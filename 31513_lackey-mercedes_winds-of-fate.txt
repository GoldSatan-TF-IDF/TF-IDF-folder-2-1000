winds of fate by mercedes lackey dedicated to the memory of donald a wollheim a gentleman and a scholar prologue the legend long ago in the days of the first king for whom the kingdom of valdemar is named it came to the king that he was growing old now valdemar had led his people out of the hands of a tyrannical monarch and had no wish to see them fall again into the hands of tyranny he knew that his son and heir was a worthy honest manbut what of his sons sons and theirs he longed for a way to determine who would be a worthy successor to the throne so that valdemar the kingdom need never become less free than it was at that moment so he went into the fields and gardens beside the palace alone and wrought what was half a prayer and half a spell begging all benign powers for their aid in this desire of his and as the last rays of the sun died from the sky there was a mighty wind and a shaking of the ground and out of the grove of trees before him came a being like unto a white horse and it spoke into his mindthen came a second and a third and before valdemar could think to question why these came his own son and his chief herald came to the place as if they had been called and these two beings spoke into their minds also saying i choose you so did the king know then that these companions would choose only worthy folk to bear them company for all their livesand that these folk would be the instrument of justice and honor for all of the kingdom from this moment so did he name those chosen by companions to be heralds for only one could be a monarch and only one could be the heir but all could aspire to be a herald and he had made for them clothing of white like the coats of their companions so that all might know them at a distance or in a crowd and he decreed then that only a herald could be the heir or the monarch and he decreed that there should be one herald always to advise and serve and befriend the monarch so that his decisions be tempered with another view and that herald was to be called the monarchs own so it was and so valdemar has prospered the heralds increased and the monarchs justice spread the chronicles in the first year of herald talias investiture as full queens own prince ancar of hardorn slew his father and all his fathers men in a bloody and successful attempt to take the throne he slew also herald kris who was there as ambassador on behalf of queen selenay and imprisoned and tortured herald talia who was with him she was rescued out of all expectations by the power of herald dirk the young heir elspeth and all the companions together such a thing had never been known before that the companions would all add their strength to the heralds to accomplish a task ancar then made a trial of the strength of valdemar using both magic and his private army but he was thrown back some two years later he made trial of the borders again this time he was beaten back by the combined forces of the mercenary company the skybolts under captain kerowyn the armies of valdemar and the army of rethwellan under lordmartial prince daren who had come in answer to a promise of aid long forgotten in the heat of the battle the prince and the captain lost their horses and were both chosenand the prince and queen were taken with a lifebonding a circumstance that both pleased and disturbed many our ancient enemy karse remains quiet for karse is beset with internal troubles ancar makes incursions on the border from time to thing but feints however so it has been to this day some s years from the last battle when the events occurred that i now relate heraldchronicler myste pchapter one elspeth but elspeth protested weakly the empty salle echoed back her words faintly she stared at herald kerowyn and tried to make some sense of what shed just been ordered to do repair armor why should i repair armor i dont even know the first thing about repairing armor and what does that have to do with anything she sat down her arms sagging beneath the weight of a set of wornout leather practice armor a set long past its useful lifespan and smelling faintly of sweat leatheroil and dust but i you know leatherwork dont you kerowyn asked her generous mouth twitching as if she were trying not to laugh elspeth squirmed uncomfortably on the wooden bench feeling very much like a tiny brown mouse facing a bored cat yes but youve seen me and alberich repair armor before havent you the mercenarycaptainturnedherald continued with patient logic arms folded across her chest elspeth looked from kerowyns weathertanned face to the dust motes dancing in the sunlight to the whitewashed walls of the salle in hope of finding an answer she was unable to come up with one shed been put directly under kerowyns command this week in lieu of the usual duties of a herald those usual dutiesriding circuit on a sector acting as lawbringer occasional judge paramilitary advisor and general troubleshooterbrought a herald into areas of significant riskrisk the council was not willing to take with the heir to the throne so her assigned duty at the moment consisted of doing whatever herald kerowyn told her to do shed assumed her tasks would be things like acting as an assistant trainer perhaps learning command tactics perhaps even acting as liaison between kerowyns mercenary company and the council especially since the council members still werent certain what to do with a mercenary captain who was also a herald these were all things she knew how to door at least make a start on after all those were the kinds of things heralds were supposed to do they were not supposed to be repairing armor yes but she repeated weakly not knowing what else to say you dont happen to think youre too good to repair armor kerowyns tone held a certain silky menace that told elspeth that someone had given herald kerowyn chapter and verse on the illtempered royal brat of course the brat was a phase she had long ago outgrown but some people couldnt seem to forget that stage of her life no she said hastily but but why do i want you to repair armorespecially when its someone elses job kerowyn unbent enough to smile and shifted her weight to her right foot lets play just suppose for a moment lets suppose you arefor some reasonout in the back of beyond not even alone we could have a situation like the one that brought me up here in the first placewhere youre with a fighting force maybe even in command but there arent any armorers around she gestured at the pile of leather in elspeths arms your gear gets damaged and theres nobody free to fix it what are you going to do wear something with a weak spot and hope nobody notices hope you can find somebody to fix it before the next engagement did you ever have to fix your own gear elspeth countered she had so been looking forward to a free afternoon i assume you mean after i made captain the herald laughed out loud displaying a fine set of strong white teeth my dear child the skybolts were so badly off that first year that i helped make armor and arrows and lances and even some horsegear no dear you arent going to wiggle out of this one leather armor isnt that hard to repair merely timeconsuming so i suggest you get to it as for how you take apart everything that doesnt look solid and replace it the formerand currentcaptain of kerowyns skybolts nodded her blonde head emphatically and turned away toward the heap of practice armor that had been tossed into the needs repair pile resigned to the situation elspeth watched kero toss her blonde braid over her shoulder thought of her own dull brown hair and sighed a little enviously if i werent the heir nobody would ever pay any attention to my looks mother is gorgeous the twins are adorable my stepfather is the handsomest man at courtand im the little brown sparrow why couldnt i have been born looking like her kerowyn was certainly an amazing person lithe strong and with a face even her critics had to call striking she would have had dozens of suitors if it hadnt been for the fact that she and herald eldan discouraged even the most persistent with their devotion to one another the captain had been blessed with a head of hair as bright as newminted gold and thick as a horses tail and despite the fact that she was literally old enough to be elspeths mother it showed no sign of graying whatever kerowyns past life had been like it had left no outward marks on her and from the stories kero had told over the past few years shed been through enough to gray the hair of four women for that matter her present was just as hectic and it hadnt left that much of a mark on her she juggled two dedications herald and mercenary captain either one of which would have been a fulltime career for anyone else and there are plenty of folk who think she should stick to one or the other elspeth smiled to herself those were the same folk who were mightily annoyed that the herald captain wouldnt wear whites unless it was ordered by the queen herself she compromisedif one could call it thatby wearing the same kind of dark gray leathers the weaponsmaster favored and the queen smiled and held her peace like alberich kerowyn was a law unto herself besides you have all the resources of the armory at your disposal kerowyn said over her shoulder as she hefted another corselet in need of repairthis one of metal scale a mending task elspeth didnt even want to think about you wouldnt have that in the field be grateful i dont demand that you fix it with what folks carry in their field kits elspeth bit back a retort and spread the shirt out over the bench she was sitting on giving the armor the kind of careful scrutiny she imagined kero must have well it isnt as bad as i thought she decided after a second examination proved that some of the worst places had already been repaired evidently the captain had taken that much pity on hershe bent to her task determined to make as good a job of it as kerowyn would her determination did not last more than a few moments someone distracted her as soon as she turned her attention to a tricky bit of stitchery that had to be picked out without ruining the leather a whisper of air was all that warned her of the attackers rushbut that was all the warning she needed what weaponsmaster alberich had not pounded into her the herald captain was making certain she learned and in quicktime too and kerowyn was a past master of the unconventional gwena she screamed mentally as she acted on what had become reflex she tumbled off her bench hit the hard wooden floor with her shoulder and rolled she came up on the balls of her feet poised and ready the tiny knife shed been using to cut the stitches still in her hand her heart pounded but from battlereadiness not fear she found herself facing someone who had recovered just as rapidly as she had he stood in a nearidentical pose on the opposite side of the bench and she sized him up quickly taller and heavier than she an anonymous male in nondescript clothing his face wrapped in a scarf and head covered with a tight hood so that all she could see were his wary eyes a thousand fleeting thoughts passed through her mind in that moment of analysis uppermost was a second mental scream for help to her companion gwena hard on the heels of that was the sudden question why doesnt kero do anything she glanced out of the corner of her eye the captain stood with arms crossed watching both of them no discernible expression on her handsome face the obvious answer was implied by the question because she was expecting this and because kerowyn was a herald and her companion sayvil would never permit her to betray another and further because elspeths own companion gwena was not beating down the doors of the salle to get in and help her stand off this attacker it followed that the assassin was nothing of the sort her heart slowed a little and she dared a mental touch nothing her assailant was shielded which meant he knew how to guard his thoughts which only another mindspeaker could do and a closer look at the bright brown eyes and the additional clue of a curl of black hair showing outside the assailants hood gave her all the information she needed to identify him skif she said flatly relaxing a little good girl came the voice in her mind i told sayvil youd figure this out before it got anywhere but she didnt believe me she shifted her gaze over to kerowyn though without taking skif out of her line of sight this was a setup wasnt it she asked the older woman you never really intended for me to fix that armor kero shrugged not at all discomfited hell yes i did and tomorrow you will but i also intended for you to figure out that you could she temporized as skif relaxed minutely thats a good thing for you to know if youre ever in the situation i described if you dont know you can do something it doesnt occur to you as an option but dont relax her voice sharpened as skif started to come out of his crouch and elspeth followed suit just because youve identified him that doesnt mean that the rest of the exercise is canceled take it up where you left off with this elspeth looked doubtfully at the tiny knife in her hand with thatand anything else you can get your hands on therere hundreds of things you can use in here including that bench kerowyn frowned slightly anything can be a weapon child its time you learned to improvise kerowyn did not have to outline the reasons for that statement even if the current interkingdom situation had been full of light and harmony there would always be the risk of someone with a grudge or grievanceor even a simple lunaticwho would be willing to risk his life to assassinate the next in line to the throne of valdemar and with at least two enemies on the borders hardorn and karse the political situation was far from harmonious stillanything can be a weapon what on earth is she talking about but she didnt have time to question the statement in detail elspeth went back on guard just in time to dodge skifs rush for her she sidestepped him and reversed the knife not wanting to really hurt him and feinted for his eyes with the wooden hilt he recognized the feint for what it was and ignored it coming in to grapple with her so far he hadnt produced any weapons of his own so his orders must be to capture rather than to kill that makes my job easier and his harderrelatively easier skif had learned his handtohand skills in the rough world of havens slums even the capital of valdemar was prone to the twin problems of crime and poverty and young skif had been the godchild of both orphaned early he had apprenticed himself to a thieving uncle and when that worthy was caught set up shop on his own probably only being chosen had saved him from hanging like his uncleor death at the hands of a competitor like his mother his style was a mixture of disciplinesa kind of catchall anything that works devious dirty and deadly the queens own herald talia had learned quite a bit from him but no one had ever thought to have him teach elspeth as well at leastnot that he had taught her knife throwing which had saved her life and talias but even queen selenay had been horrified a few short years ago at the notion of her heir learning streetfighting elspeth had begged but to no avail many things had changed in those few years among them the arrival of kerowyn who had sent one of her commandos to prove to selenay that she and her daughter needed the kind of protection only instruction in the lowest forms of fighting could provide alberich undertook the queens instruction kero and skif got elspeths the lessons were frequently painful dirks taught me a thing or two since the last lesson she told herself as she circled him warily testing her footing as she watched his eyes and i bet neither of them knows that she sensed the pile of armor behind her and tried to remember what was topmost was it something she could throw over his head to temporarily blind him pick up the pace boy kerowyn said take some chances you only have a few more moments before she either calls for help herself with mindspeech or her companion brings the cavalry skif lunged just as she made a grab for the nearest piece of junk a leather gambeson he waited until she moved then struck like a coiled snake he caught her in the act of bending over sideways and tackled her both of them flying over the pile and landing in a heap on the other side of it her knife went skidding across the floor as her cheek hit the gritty floor all the breath knocked out of her she writhed in his grip and grabbed the edge of his hood and tried to pull it down over his eyes but it was too tightly wrapped she struggled to get her knee up into his stomach clawed at the wrappings around his head with no effect and kicked ineffectually at the back of his legs he simply pinned her with his greater weight and slapped the side of her head at the same time calling out disable damn she obediently went limp he scrambled to his feet heaved her up like a sack of grain slung her over his shoulder and started for the door she watched the floor and his boots and wondered what her companion was supposed to be doing while the assassin was carrying her off not that way gwena said calmly in her mind right on cue ive got the front door blocked and sayvil has the rear the only way out is by way of the roof no good skif elspeth said to his belt the companions have you boxed in well then ill have to abort and follow my secondary orders he replied sorry little kitten youre dead he put her down on her feet and she dusted herself off crap she said sourly i could do better than that i wish id had my knives she couldnt resist a resentful glance at kero who had made her take them off when she entered the salle well kero told her you didnt do as badly as i had expected but i told you to get rid of those little toys of yours for a reason they arent a secret anymore everybody knows you carry them in armsheaths and youve begun to depend on them you passed up at least a half dozen potential weapons elspeths heart sank as skif nodded to confirm kerowyns assessment like what she demanded she didntquitegrowl it was ironic that a room devoted to weaponswork should be so barren of weaponry there was nothing in the room at least nothing that could be used against an enemy the salles sanded wooden floor stood empty of everything but the bench she sat on and the pile of discarded armor there were a few implements for mending the armor that shed brought in from the back room there were no windows that she could reach they were all set in the walls near the edge of the ceiling even the walls were bare of practice weapons just the empty racks along one wall and the expensivebut necessarymirrors on the other the bench skif said promptly you were within range to kick it into my path you should have grabbed that leather corselet when you went off the bench kero added any of the mirrorsbreak one and youve got a pile of razor shards the sunlightmaneuver him so that its in his eyes the mirrors again distract me with my own reflection the leatherneedles the pot of leatheroil your belt all right elspeth cried plopping down heavily on the bench defeated by their logic whats the point something that you can learn but i cant teach in simple lessons kerowyn told her soberly an attitude a state of awareness one where you size everyone up as a potential enemy and everything as a potential weapon and i mean everyone and everything from the stranger walking toward you to your motherfrom the halberd on the wall to your underwear i cant live like that she protested nobody can but at keros raised eyebrow she added doubtfully can they kero shrugged personally i think no royalty can afford to live without an outlook like that and ive managed for most of my life so have i skif seconded it doesnt have to poison you or your life just make you more aware of things going on around you thats why weve started the program here kerowyn finished a salle is a pretty empty room even with repair stuff scattered all over it that makes your job easier now she fixed elspeth with a stern bluegreen eye before you leave youre going to figure out one way everything in here could be used against an assailant elspeth sighed bade farewell to her free afternoon and began pummeling her brain for answers eventually kerri left for other tasks putting skif in charge of the lesson elspeth breathed a little easier when she was gone skif was nowhere near the taskmaster that kerowyn could be when the mood was on her heraldic trainees at the collegium used to complain of alberichs lessons now they moaned about kerowyns as well and it was an open question as to which of the two was considered the worst elspeth had once heard a young girl complain that it was bad enough that the weaponsmaster refused to grow old and retire but now hed cursed them with a female double and it wasnt fair but then again she had thought at the time what is skif grilled her for a little longer then took pity on her and turned the lesson from one on attitude to simply a roughandtumble knifefighting lesson elspeth found the latter much easier on the nerves if not on the body skif might be inclined to go easy on her when it came to the abstract lessons but when it came to the physical he could be as remorseless as any of the instructors when he chose finally when both were tired enough that they were missing elementary moves he called a halt in fact she thought wearily as he waved her off guard and stepped off the salle floor i doubt i could be a match for a novice right now thats enough he panted throwing himself down on the floor beside the bench as she slumped down on the seat and then sprawled along the length of it shoving the forgotten leather armor to the floor the angle of the sunlight coming in through the high clerestory windows had changed there was no longer a broad patch of sunlight on the floor it was starting to climb up the whitewashed wall not yet dinnertime but certainly late afternoon i have to get back to drilling the little ones in a bit he continued besides if i spend too much more time in your unchaperoned company the rumors are going to start again and i dont feel like dealing with them elspeth grimaced and wiped sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand the last time rumors had started about a romance between her and skif shed had to placate half the council and endure the knowing looks of half the heralds she wasnt sure which group was worse now i know how mother and stepfather felt when they were my age every time someone gets interestedor interestingmost of the time theyre frightened off by the matchmakers youd think people would have more important things to worry about but it was too bad poor skif had to pay the price of her rank there ought to be something she could do about that but right now her weary mind was not supplying the answer ill see you later then she said instead ive got a few things of my own id like to do before dinnerif youre satisfied with my progress that is youre getting there he told her getting up with an effort his sweatdamp hair curled even tighter i was making more mistakes than you were toward the end whats the closest weapon to your right hand the bench im on she replied without thinking i roll off it and kick it in your direction i was thinking of the shears on the floor there but thatll do he said with a tired chuckle see you at dinner not tonight theres some delegation from rethwellan here to see father that means all meals with the court until theyre gone she levered herself up on her elbows and smiled apologetically i guess they wont believe im not plotting against the rest of the family unless they see us all together skif was too polite to say anything but they both knew why that suspicion of treason might occur to a delegation from rethwellan elspeths bloodfather a prince of rethwellan had plotted to overthrow his own wife and consort queen selenayand in the end had attempted to assassinate her himself not the best way to handle foreign relationsas it happened though no one in rethwellan had any idea he might attempt such a thingcertainly there was no one in the royal family who had backed him in fact there been no love lost between him and his two brothers and there had been no repercussions from rethwellan at the news that he had not survived that assassination attempt the queen quietly accepted king faramenthas horrified apologies and disclaimers and there the matter had rested for many years but then war and the redemption of a promise made to selenays grandfather had brought one of those brothers prince daren to the aid of the queen of valdemar and the unexpected result of that first meeting had been not only love but a lifebonding rethwellan lost its lordmartial and valdemar gained a coruler for daren like kerowyn had been chosen literally on the battlefield whether the bedding had followed or preceded the wedding was moot the result had been twins nine months to the day after the ceremony which left the titular heir elspeth with two unexpected rivals for her position elspeth whose father had tried to murder the queen and steal her throne and there were the inevitable whispers of bad blood king faram the current king of rethwellan and brother to both her father and stepfather held no such doubts about her but occasionally some of his advisors required a reminder that treason was not a heritable trait elspeth slipped out of her musings and stretched protesting muscles i wish she began and stopped you wish what kitten skif prompted never mind she said dragging herself to her feet it doesnt matter ill catch up with you tomorrow after council assuming kerowyn doesnt have me mucking out the stables or something equally virtuous and valuable he chuckled and left the salle leaving her alone with her thoughts she cleaned up the scattered equipment from their lesson while the sweat of her exertion cooled and dried and took herself out before her erstwhile mentor could return and find her idle a warm summer wind whipped her hair out of its knot at the back of her neck and dried her sweatsoaked shirt as she left the salle door she made a hasty check for possible watchers trotted around the side of the salle and didnt slow until she reached the edge of the formal gardens and the relative shelter of the tall hedges the path she took from the formal garden and the maze to the herb and kitchen gardens of the palace was one normally used only by the palaces husbandmen it ran along the back of a row of hedges that concealed a line of storage buildings and potting sheds she wasnt surprised that there was no one on it since there was nothing to recommend it but its relative isolation a commodity in short supply at the palacecollegium complex not the sort of route that anyone would expect to find her taking nor was her destination what anyone who didnt know her well would expect it was a simple potting shed a nondescript little building distinguished from its fellows only by the stovepipe a stone kiln and the small glazed window high up on one side and even then there was no reason to assume it was special the kiln had been there for years and had been used to fire terracotta pots for seedlings and winter herbs which made it all the more valuable to elspeth she opened the door and closed it behind her with a feeling of having dropped a tremendous weight from her shoulders this unprepossessing kingdom was hers and hers alone by unspoken agreement so long as she did not neglect her duties no one would bother her here not unless the situation were direst emergency a tiny enough kingdom one bench in the middle with a stool beside it one sink and hand pump one potters wheel boxes of clay ready for working shelves and a stove to heat the place in the winter and double as a small bisquefiring kiln in the rear but not one implement here reminded her of the heir or the heirs duties this was the one place where elspeth could be just elspeth and nothing more a proper kingdom as far as she was concerned shed been having second thoughts about ruling anything larger for some time now up on the highest shelf were the finished productswhich was to say the ones to her critical eye worth keepingof her own two hands they began with her first perfectly thrown pots and bowls ranged through more complicated projects and ended with some of the results of her current effortspouredslip pieces cast from molds that had in turn been made from her own work the twins were going through a competitive stage at the momentand any time one of them got something the other had to have something just like it but different if kris got a toy horse lyra had to have a toy horsesame size shape length of tail and equipage but if kris horse was chestnut hers had to be bay dapplegray or roan if he got a toy fort she had to have a toy village same size number of buildings number of toy inhabitants as his fort and so on the only thing they agreed on was toy companions they had to be twins like the twins themselves not that they need toy companions elspeth thought with amusement they have the real thing following them around by the nose every time mother takes them with her into the field no doubts there about whether or not theyll be chosen in fact gwena had remarked more than once that the only question involved would be which companion did the choosing there were apparently a number in the running mark my words shed said with amusement there are going to be fights over this in a couple of years but that made gift giving both harder and easier trying to findor makeabsolutely identical presents in differing colors had been driving elspeth and everyone else to distraction they were able to pick out the most amazing discrepancies and turn them into points of contention over whose present was better finally though shed hit on the notion of making a mold and copying a successful piece her first effort had been a pair of dragonlamps or rather nightlights comical rolypoly fellows who gently burned lampoil at a wick in their open mouths those had been such a hit that elspeth had decided to try dolls specifically dolls that looked as much like the twins themselves as shewho was not exactly a portrait sculptorcould manage its a good thing that theyre in that vague sort of childshaped stage she thought wryly as she surveyed the row of greenware heads waiting to be cleaned of moldmarks and sorted for discards i doubt if i could produce anything more detailed than that well dressing the completed dolls in miniatures of the twins favorite outfits would take care of the rest and providing the appropriate accessories of course she would have to appeal for help on that to talia for the outfits since she could probably bribe the queens own with an offer of another doll for talias son jemmie her plainsewing was as good as many of the seamstresses attached to the palace staff though her embroidery was still enough to make a cat laugh as she put it to keren for the rest lyra was in a horsecrazy phase at the moment a bit young for that perhaps but the twinsand jemmiewere precocious in most areas kris had gone mad for the guard half the time when asked he would assert that he wanted to be a guardcaptain when he grew up which usually made any nearby companions snort tiny swords and miniature riding boots were a little out of elspeths line but perhaps keren or sherrill kerens lifemate could arrive at a solution the first three heads werent worth bothering with bubbles in the slip had flawed the castings badly enough to crack when they were fired the fourth was perfect the fifth possible and the sixththe arrangement of the window and door in the shed made it a regrettable necessity that she sit with her back to the door that being the case she had left the hinges unoiled it simply was not possible to open the door however carefully without at least some noise however slight she froze as she heard the faintest of telltale squeaks from behind her then continued examining the head as if she had heard nothing a lightningquick mental probe behind her revealed that it was skifagainat the door this time his thoughts were unguarded he assumed that she had already put this afternoons lessons out of her mind a little tired and careless here in the heart of the palace grounds not a chance friend she thought and as he slipped through the door she shifted her weight off the stool she had been using and hooked one foot around one of the legs at a moment when he was poised and unbalanced she pulled the stool over whirled and kicked it under his feet all with a single motion he was hardly expecting opposition much less that he would be on the defensive he lost his balance as his feet got tangled up with the stool and couldnt recover he fell over backward with a crash of splintering wood as her stool went with him landing ingloriously on his rear she stood over him shaking her head as he blinked up at her and grinned feebly ever heard of knocking she asked she picked up her stool without offering him a hand and made a face hed broken two of the bottom rungs and loosened all four of the legs and it had not been that sturdy to begin with you owe me a new chair she said annoyed all out of proportion to the value of the stool that wasnt just a dirty trick skif that was dangerous you could have broken some of my best pieces too almost broke some of mine he grumbled you arent going to get an apology if thats what youre looking for you knew very well wed be springing these surprise attacks on you but not in the one place i can relax she thought seething with resentment not in the only place i can get away from everything and everyone you still owe me lout she said stubbornly righting the stool and rocking it to check how wobbly it was going to be she sat on it and folded her arms making no attempt to disguise how put out she was you still could have broken something i dont ask for much skif and i give up a lot i think its only fair to be offlimits when im out here he didnt say will an attacker go along with that and he didnt give her a lecture which mollified her a little instead he grinned ingenuously and pulled himself up from the floor dusting off his white uniform once he reached his feet i really have to congratulate you he said you did a lot better than i expected i deliberately came after you when i knew you were tired and likely to be careless i know she said crisply and watched his bushy eyebrows rise as he realized what that meant first that shed detected him soon enough to make a mental test of him and second that shed gone ahead and read his thoughts when she knew who it was the second was a trifle unethical heralds were not supposed to read others thoughts without them being aware of the fact but if he was going to violate her precious bit of privacy she was going to pay him back for it let him wonder how much else i read while i was peeking and sweat about it a little oh he certainly knew better than to chide her for that breach of privacy at this point ill see you later i guess youd better have a new stool with you she said as he backed hastily out the door only now aware that she was still clutching the muchabused dolls head she looked at it as soon as he was out of sight whatever shape it had been in before this it was ruined now she disgustedly tossed it into the discard bucket beside her bench it wasnt until she had a half dozen usable heads lined up on the bench in front of her and had smashed the rejects that she felt as if her temper was any cooler cleaning them was a dull but exacting task precisely what she wanted at the moment she didnt want to see or talk to anyone until her foul mood was gone so when she felt the stirring of air behind her that meant the door had cracked open again she was not at all amused im going to kill him she readied a mental bolt designed to hit him as if she had shouted in his earwhen her preliminary mindtouch told her something completely unexpected this was not skifor kerowyn or anyone else she knew and she ducked instinctively as something shot past overhead and landed with a solid thunk pointfirst in the wall above the bench a hunting knife ordinary and untraceable it quivered as she stared up at it momentarily stunned then her training took over before the other could react to the fact that he had missed she kicked the stool at him as she rolled under the bench and came up on the other side he kicked it out of the way slammed the door shut behind him and dropped the bar a few heartbeats later the door shuddered as gwena hit it with her hooves now i wish this place wasnt quite so sturdythe stranger turned with another knife in his hands gwena shrieked and renewed her attack on the door he ignored the pounding and came straight for elspeth with her lesson so fresh in her mind she flung the first thing that came to hand at himthe halfcleaned dolls head it didnt do any damage but it made a hollow popping sound which distracted him enough so that she could get clear of the bench get to where hed kicked the stool and snatch it up using it as a combination of shield and lance she rushed him trying to pin him against the abused door with the legs but the battering the stool had taken had weakened the legs too much to hold his single blow broke the legs from the seat and left her holding a useless piece of flat board or almost useless she threw it at his head forcing him to duck and giving her a chance to grab something else as gwenas hooves hit the door again that something else proved to be one of her better pots a lovely graceful twohandled vase but she sacrificed it without a second thought snatching it off the shelf and smashing it against the wall of the shed leaving her with a razorsharp shard a knifeedge with a handle to control it she took the initiative as he started at the crash of shattering crockery and threw herself at him he wasnt expecting that either and she caught him completely off guard he tried to grapple with her and she let him sacrificing her own mobility for one chance to get in with that bit of pottery in her right hand he grabbed her but it was too late to stop her before he realized what she meant to do with that bit of crockery she slashed it across his throat cutting it from ear to ear as gwenas hooves hit the door and it shattered inward are you going to be all right kerowyn asked as she wiped elspeths forehead with a cold damp cloth elspeth finally finished retching and licked her lips tasting salt and bile before she nodded shakily i think so she replied closing her eyes and leaning back against the outer wall of the shed the others had arrived to find her on her hands and knees in the grass covered in bloodnot her ownwith gwena standing over her protectively as she emptied her stomach into the bushes her stomach still felt queasy as if she might have another bout at any moment no matter that she had seen death beforehad even killed her share of the enemy in the last war with hardornshed taken down lord orthallen with her own two hands and one of skifs throwing nives that wasnt close not this close i was dropping arrows into people from a distance i threw a knife from across the room not like this where he bled all over me and looked up at me and her stomach heaved again and she quelled the thoughts who was he she asked wiping her mouth with the back of her hand trying to get her mind on something else how did he find out where i was and how did he get past the guards i dont know the answers to your second and third questions kero replied as elspeth closed her eyes and concentrated on the coolness against her forehead but i can tell you the answer to the first theres a spiderweb brand on his palm hes one of the followers of the cold god they hire themselves out as assassins and theyre very expensive because they dont care if they get caught he was either providing a legacy for a family or doing penance for some terrible sin if you hadnt killed him hed have killed himself kero dropped the cloth and sat back on her heels and elspeth opened her eyes and gaped at the older herald her nausea forgotten ive never heard of anything like that she exclaimed kero nodded not too many people have the cold ones advocates come from farther south than anyone i know has been except geyr hes the one who told me about them after the last try at your mother and told me what to look for said that if ancar really got desperate and knew how to contact them he might try hiring one of the cold blades she frowned i didnt take the threat seriously and i should haveand believe me it wont happen again frankly you were luckythey usually arent that careless and there is nothing nothing more dangerous than a suicidal fanatic buthow did he get in here in the gardens she asked bewildered how could he we have guards everywhere kero frowned even harder if geyrs to be believed by mmmmmagic she said forcing the word out around the compulsion that seemed to overtake all heralds when discussing anything but the mental gifts and the truthspell therere mmages among the cold ones that give them a kind of invisibility my grandmother could do itmake people think that when they looked at her they were actually seeing someone they knew and trusted and expected to be there works with the mind like mindspeech but its set up with a spell dangerous stuffand now the guards are going to have to doublecheck everyone they think they know therere going to be some unhappy folks unless i miss my guess he either underestimated me or he was inexperienced she thought soberly as kero left her to talk quietly with some of the guard who were dealing with the body andi dont think were ever going to find out how ancar found him because i have the funny feeling that he used magic she shivered and stood up her knees shaking her whites were ruinednot that shed ever want to wear this set again magic again whatever had protected valdemar in the past it was not proof against ancar anymore chapter two darkwind darkwind ksheyna balanced his bondbird vree on his shoulder and peered out across the sea of grass below him with a touch ofregret envy a little of both perhaps from where he stood the earth dropped in a steep cliff more than a hundred manlengths to the floor of the dhorisha plainsa formidable barrier to those who meant the shinain and their land any ill it took knowledge and skill to find the paths down into the plains and from there intruders were visible above the waisthigh grass for furlongs his bondbird lifted narrow pointed wings a little in the warm grassscented updraft that followed the cliff prey vrees thought answered his own framed in the simple terms of the bondbirds understanding not so much a thought as a flood of images treehares mice quail rabbits all of them from the viewpoint of the forestgyre as they would appear just before the talons struck prey indeed any wouldbe hunter attempting to penetrate the plains without magic aid would find himself quickly turned hunted the land itself would fight him he would be visible to even a child he would never guess the locations of seeps and springs and without landmarks that he would understand that intruder would become disoriented in the expanse of grass and gently rolling hills the guardians of the plains and the scouts that patrolled the border had half their work done for them by the plains themselves darkwind sighed and turned away back to his own cool silent forest no such help for himother than the fact that the eastern edge of ksheyna territory bordered the plains but to the south and west lay forest league upon league of it and all of it dangerous sick complained vree darkwind agreed with him magic contaminated those lands a place outlanders called the pelagir hills with no notion of just how much territory fell under that description magic flowed wild and twisted through the earth a magic that warped and shaped everything that grew theresometimes for the better but more often for the worse darkwind took vree onto his wrist the fingerlong talons biting into the leather of his gauntlet as vree steadied himself and launched him into the trees to scout ahead the forestgyre took to the air gladly unlike his bondmate vree enjoyed the scouting forays hunting was no challenge to a bondbird and there was only so much for vree to do within the confines of ksheyna vales safe territory scouting and guarding were what vree had been bred for and he was never happier than when flying ahead of darkwind on patrol darkwind didnt mind the scouting so much even if the ksheyna scouts were spread frighteningly thinafter all he was a vayshedruvon guard scout protector he was all of those its the magic he told himselfnot for the first time if it wasnt for the magicevery time he encountered some threat to ksheyna that used magic or was born of it and had to find some way other than magic to counter that threat it scorched him to the soul and worse was his fathers attitude when he returnedscorn for the mage who would abandon his power and a stubborn refusal to understand why darkwind had done so if i could go back in time and kill those fools that set this loose in the world i would do so and murder them all with my bare hands he thought savagely his anger at those longdead ancestors remained as he chose a tree to climb looking for one he had not used before a massive goldenoak was his choice this time he slipped handspikes out of his belt without conscious thought and pulled the fingerless backless leather gloves on over his palms the tiny spikes set into the leather wouldnt penetrate the bark of the tree enough to leave places for fungus or insects to lodge but it would give him a little more traction on the trunk as would the shakrashide soles of his thin leather boots in moments he was up in the branches the gametrail along the edge of the territory lay below him when twolegged intruders penetrated ksheyna most of the time they sought trails like this one when scouts patrolled it was often up here where the trails could be seen but where the scouts themselves were invisible he shaded his eyes and chose a route through the next three forest giants by means of intersecting limbs stowing his climbingspikes and removing his doubleended climbing tool from the sheath on his back then he picked his way through the foliage walking as surefootedly on the broad swaying branch as if he were on the ground pulling another branch closer with the hook end of his tool and hopping from his goldenoak to the limb of a massive candlepine just as the branch began to bow beneath his weight he followed the new branch in to the trunk then back out again to another conifer this time stowing the tool long enough to leap for the branch above him and swing himself up onto it as he chose his next route his thoughts turned back to that wild magic as they always did what it has done to the land to us is unforgivable what it could do is worse never mind that the tayledras tamed that magic cleansed the places it had turned awry made them safe for people and animals alike to live there not that there werent both there nowbut they often found their offspring changed into something they did not recognize but that isnt our real task our real task is more dangerous and my father has forgotten it ever existed in his obsessions with power and power darkwind looked back at the treeless sky where the plains began the shinain had no such problems but then the shinain had little to do restricted parts of the palace dressed in graysand im a bit too young kujwith magic odd to think we were one once very odd for all that there was no mistaking the fact that tayledras features and shinain were mirrors of each other the kaledain they had been the most trusted allies of a mage whose name had been lost over the ages the tayledras remembered him only as the mage of silence and if the shinain had recorded his true name in their knotted tapestries they had never bothered to tell anyone in the tayledras clans fatherforgets that the real duty of the hawkbrothers is to heal the land of the scars caused by that war of magics even as the goddess has healed the plains he often felt more kinship with his shinain cousins these days than he did with his real kin the lady gave them the more dangerous task truth to tell he admitted grudgingly he looked back again but this time he shuddered the hawkbrothers cleansedbut the shinain guarded and what they guardedsomewhere out there buried beneath grass and soil are the weapons that caused all this and not all of them require an adept to use them only the shinain stood guardian between those hidden weapons and the rest of the world i dont envy them that duty men vree sounded the alert and followed it with a vocal alarmcall darkwind froze against the tree trunk for a moment and touched vrees mind long enough to see through the bondbirds eyes he clutched the trunk fingernails digging into the bark direct contact with the forestgyres mind was always disorienting his perspective was skewedfirst at seeing the strangers from above as they peered up through the branches in automatic response to vrees scream the faces curiously flat and alien then came the dizzying spiral of vrees flight that made the faces below seem to spin as always the strangeness was what kept him aware that it was the forestgyres eyes he was using and not his ownthe heightened sharpness of everything red and the colors vree saw that human eyes could not he was a passive traveler in vrees mind not an active controller it was a measure of the bond and vrees trust that the forestgyre would let him take control on occasion but darkwind took care never to abuse that trust in general it was better just to observeas he found yet again vree spotted one of the strangers raising what was probably a weapon and kited up into the thick branches before darkwind had registered more than the bare movement of an arm darkwind released his link with vree and his hold on the trunk at the same time running along the flat branch and using his tool as a balanceaid and leaping to the next tree limb a heartbeat later in his first days with vree it had taken him a long time to recover from a linkand some never did especially the first time caught up in the intoxication of the flight and the kill they never detached themselves and unless someone else discovered them they could be lost forever that waytheir bodies lying in a kind of coma while their minds slowly merged with that of the bird diminishing as they merged until there was nothing left of what they were that had never happened in darkwinds lifetime by accident although there had been one scout when he was a child who had a lightningstruck tree crush him beneath its trunk he had been far from a healer and had deliberately merged himself with his bird never to return to the crippled and dying wreck of his body he remained with ksheyna within his birds mind slowly fading until at last the bird vanished one day never to return slower death but death all the same darkwind thought pragmatically climbing a pine trunk by hooking the stub of a broken branch above him to ascend to a crossover branch he preferred to avoid such a nonchoice altogether he slowed as he neared the strangers and dropped to all fours stalking like a slim treecat along the branch and taking care not to rustle the leaves not that it would have mattered to the intruders who called to each other and laughed as if they had no idea that they were being observed or that they were in forbidden territory his jaw tightened they are about to find out differently and theyre damned lucky that its me who found them there are plenty of othersincluding fatherwho would feather them with arrows or make ashes of them without waiting to find out if theyre ignorant stupid or true hostiles not that theyll ever know enough to appreciate the difference since im going to throw them out there were seven of them however and only one of him and he had not survived this long as a scout by being incautious first he called to vree for his mindspeech was not strong enough to reach to the two nearest scouts call alert he said shortly vree knew what that meant hed contact the birds of the two scouts nearest and they in turn would summon their bondmates if darkwind didnt need their help he would let them know through vree and they would turn back but if he did need them they were already on the way he followed the intruders for several furlongs as they blundered along the game trail their clumsiness frightening all the creatures within a league of them into frozen silence leaving behind them a visible trail in the scuffed vegetation and an invisible one in the resinous tang of crushed pine needles and their own human scent two of the men bore no visible weapons the rest were armed and armored vrees scorn as sour and acidic as an unripe berry tempted him to laughter cubs the bird sent unprompted images of bumbling young bears and tanglefooted wolf pups well this was getting him nowhere nothing that the intruders had said or done gave him any idea of their intent with a sigh he decided that there was no choice in the matter he was going to have to confront them decision made he worked his way up ahead of them climbed down out of the branches restored his climbingtool to his back limbered his bow and waited for them to catch up to him they practically blundered into him the one in the lead saw him first an ordinary enough fellow his brown leather armor marking him as a fighter rather than a forester he shouted in surprise and quite literally jumped even though darkwind had not moved of course darkwinds own intricately dyed scouting gear and hair dyed a mottled brown made a nearperfect camouflage but he wasnt that invisible citymen darkwind groaned to himself i ought to just let the icedrakes do my job for meexcept that there were no icedrakes in ksheyna territory nor anything else large and deadly enough to eliminate them except the gryphons or the firebirdsbut that might well be what brought them here in the first place darkwind did not intend to have either his friends or his charges wind up as some fool hunters trophies instinctively they closed ranks against him he spoke before the strangers recovered from their startlement using the tradetongue that the shinain favored in their dealings with outlanders you are trespassing on ksheyna lands he said curtly a bluff but i doubt theyll know how thin were spread and let them wonder if theyd have been taken by tayledras or something else you must leave the way you came now they certainly couldnt miss the bow in his hands his hooked climbingstaff on his back or the steely menace in his voice one of them started to object the man next to him hushed him quickly the fellow in the lead narrowed his eyes and frowned looking him up and down as if measuring him theres only one the objector whispered obviously unaware of how keen tayledras hearing was his silencer cut him off with only one we can see you fool let me handle this the man stepped forward moving up beside leather armor your pardon my lord he said with false geniality we didnt know how could we there are no signposts no border guards tayledras have no need of signs darkwind interrupted coldly and i am a guard i am telling you to leave your lives will be at hazard else did that sound as stupid as i think it did or did i convince them they dont dare chance m i may not be as fbk as im pretending to be i shall not permit you to pass he warned as they continued to hesitate the objector plucked at speakers sleeve leather armor frowned and turned his head to listen to the others whispered conference without taking his eyes off darkwind this time they spoke too softly even for him to hear and when they turned back to face him speaker wore a broad brightand emptysmile damn theyve seen through me i look like a lad and i didnt feather one of them before i stopped them my mistake of course well leave my lord he said with hollow good humor and were very sorry to have trespassed darkwind said nothing speaker waited for a response got none and shrugged very well then gentlemen he said and gestured back down the path shall we they turned as if to goive seen this before they somehow knowor guess only one of me right now they think theyre going to catch me offguard idiots he alerted vree with a touch dropped and rolled into the brush at the side of the trail they were making so much noise they didnt even hear him move they turned back weapons in hand and were very surprised to see that he wasnt where they expected him to be before they managed to locate him he had popped up out of the brush and the one darkwind had mentally tagged as speaker was down with an arrow in his throat he dropped back into the cover of the bushes as vree dove at the unprotected head of one of the men in the rear of the party the one who had been making all the objections the man shrieked with feminine shrillness and clapped both hands to his scalp as vree rose into the branches with bloody talons thats one down and one hit i think that takes out anyone who might be a mage it didnt look as if the rest of this was going to be that easy though leather armor was barking orders in a language darkwind didnt recognize but as the rest of the men of the party took to cover and began flanking him darkwind had a fairly good idea what those orders were do they want a live hawkbrother or a dead border guard the question had very real significance if the former he could probably take them all himself they would have to be careful and he wouldnt but if the latter he was going to have his hands full his answer came a few moments later as an arrow whistled past his ear and no rebuke from leather armor followed a dead border guard then damn my luck is simply not in todaythere were at least two men with bows that he recalled and he was not about to send vree flying into an arrow he told the forestgyre to stay up in the branches and worked himself farther back into the bushes that proved to be a definite tactical error within moments he discovered that he had been flanked just my luck to get a party with an experienced commander now he had the choice of trying to get to thicker cover or taking on one of the men nearest him thicker cover wont stop an arrow that decided him he put aside his bow and slid his climbingstaff out of the sheath at his back he rose from cover with a bloodcurdling shriek not unlike vrees the staff a blur of motion in his hands the man nearest him fell back with an oath but it was too late he had misjudged the length of the staff and the wicked climbinghook at the end of it designed to catch and hold on tree bark caved in half his face and lodged in his eye socket darkwind jerked the hook free and dropped as another man belatedly aimed an arrow at him it went wild and darkwind took to cover again that leaves four brothers come vree said and hopefully added vree huntno dammit featherhead stay up there p vree replied darkwind swore at himself got too complicated for him again he thought emphatically arrows replied vree just as rustling in the dry leaves told darkwind that he was being stalked he mindtouched cautiously ready to pull back in an instant if it proved that the stalker had any mindpowers ordinary ungiftedbut this one was leather armor darkwind knew he wasnt going to take him by surprise with a yell and a hooked stick he worked his way backward wondering where the other two guards that vree had called for him were his mindspeech wasnt strong enough to hear them unless they were very near but vree and the other bond birds of the scouts patrolling nearby were in constant contact vree was trained to serve as a relay pointif there was anything to relay the rustling stopped and darkwind froze so that he did not give himself away they remained where they were he and leather armor for what seemed like hours finally just when darkwinds leg had started to cramp leather armor moved again meanwhile darkwind had an idea vree play wounded bird find a man with no arrows and take him to the brothers it was an old trick in the wild but it just might work against citybred folk after a moment darkwind heard vrees distress call faint with distance and growing fainter the rustling stopped for a moment someone cursed softly then the rustling began again thats four darkwind moved again but the cramp in his leg made him just a little clumsy and he overbalanced he caught himself before he fell but his outstretched hands brushed by a thick branch and it bent shaking enough to rustle the leaves and betraying his location damn no hope for it now he halfrose and sprinted for the shelter of a rock pile pounding feet and crackling brush not far behind him the woods were too thick here to afford a good shot it was going to be handtohand if leather armor overtook him ill luck struck again just as he reached the rocks something shot at ankleheight out of the shadows he leapt but couldnt quite avoid the tanglecord it caught one foot and he tumbled forward he tucked and rolled as he went down but when he came back up he found himself staring at the point of a sword behind the sword stood leather armor frowning furiously a few moments later panting up behind him came the man with the bloody furrowed scalp no spindly runt is going to tell us where we can go sneered leather armor one little brat to play guardman hmm so much for your big bad hawkbrothers milor two screams from out in the woods interrupted him and both their heads turned for a fraction of a heartbeat just long enough for darkwind to reach the killblade he had hidden in his bootand vree to begin his stoop what made you think i was alone he said mildly leather armors head snapped back around giving darkwind a clear shot at his eye a quick flick of the wrist and the knife left his hand and went straight to the mark just as vree struck the second man from behind his talons aimed for the neck and shoulders knocking the mage to the ground with the force of the blow as darkwinds victim toppled over vrees talons pierced the back of his targets neck and he bit through the spine the powerful beak able to separate even a deers backbone at need it was over in moments vree flapped his wings and screamed in triumph and darkwind licked the blood away from his lip he had bitten it when he fell the taste was flat and sweet gritty with forest loam he rose slowly and brushed himself off waiting for vree to calm down a little before trying to deal with him like all raptors the bondbirds were most dangerous just after a kill when their blood still coursed hot with excitement and they had forgotten everything but the chase and strike when darkwinds own heart had settled he turned and called vree back to the glove the bondbird mantled and screamed objection at him still hot with his huntingrage but when darkwind mindtouched himcarefully for at this stage it was easy to be pulled into the raptors mindhe calmed darkwind held out his arm and slapped the glove again and this time vree returned to his bondmate launching himself from the body with a powerful shove of his legs and landing heavily on darkwinds gauntlet the wicked talons that had so easily pierced a mans neck closed gently on the scouts leathercovered wrist darkwind pointedly ignored the second body vrees victim and stooped over the first corpse to retrieve his knife vree flapping his wings a little to keep his balance admittedly it was no uglier a death than the one he had just delivered but it was easy to forget that the tayledrasbred forestgyres largest of all the bondbirds other than the eagles were easily a match for many wild tiercel eagles in size and fully capable of killing men and when vree did just thatsometimes the realization of just what kind of a born killer he carried around on his wrist and shoulder every day came as a little shock at least he doesnt try to eat them darkwind thought with a grimace in fact vree was even now fastidiously cleaning his talons his thoughts full of distaste for the flavor of the blood on them the bird looked up suddenly darkwind tensed for a moment but brothers come the bird said and went back to cleaning his talons even to darkwinds experienced eyes it seemed as if a manshaped piece of the forest had detached itself and was walking toward him when firestorm first came into view the sight gave him a renewed appreciation for the effectiveness of the scouts camouflage hed heard somewhere that one of the outlanders superstitions about the tayledras was that they were really all mirrorcopies of the same person i suppose it might look that way to strangersthe scouts all dressed so identically in the field that they might well have been wearing uniforms closefitting tunic and trews of a supple weave and of a mottled layerdyed green gray and brown there were individual differences in the patterns as distinct as individual fingerprints to the knowledgeable but to an outlander the outfits probably looked identical and their hair was identical except for length hair color among the hawkbrothers was a uniform white living in the vales surrounded by magic hair bleached to white and eyes to silverblue by the time a tayledras was in his early twentiessooner if he was a mage the scouts dyed their hair a mottled brown to match their surroundingsthe rest of the clan left theirs white i suppose outlanders have reason to think us identical firestorms bondbird was nowhere in sight but as the younger scout came into the clearing kreel dove down out of the treetops to land on firestorms casually outstretched arm kreel was a different breed from vree smaller and with the broad wings of a hawk rather than the rakish pointed wings of the falcon neither bird had bleached out yet since darkwind no longer used his magic powers and firestorm never had been a mage it would be years before either bird became a tiaevaleshya a forest spirit one of the snowwhite ghost birds with markings in faint bluegray too bad in a way the white ones frighten the life out of outlanders who see them we could use that edge vree and i if this lot had seen him first they might not have chanced taking me on vrees natural coloration was partially white already his white breast sported brown barring the same pattern as the underside of his wings his back and the upper face of his wings were still brown with a faint black barring kreel was half vrees size with a solid bluegray back and a reddishbrown barred breast kreels red eyes had begun to fade to pink vrees eyes had already faded to light gray from his adolescent color of iceblue i got one of the bastards skydance got one and skydances raan got the third firestorm said ruffling the breastfeathers of his cooperihawk he shook his head in admiration at the gyre on darkwinds wrist as vree fastidiously preened the blood from his breastfeathers makes me wish id bonded to a gyre sometimes this little one is faster than anyone would believe but she cant take down a man a bird doesnt have to be able to take a man down to take one out darkwind reminded him kreel does all right youre too damned bloodthirsty firestorm just chuckled reached into his gamepouch and fed kreel a tidbit vree clucked and shifted his weight from one foot to the other in an anxious reminder that he was owed a reward as well darkwind scratched the top of vrees head then reached into his own gamepouch for a rabbit quarter vree tore into the offering happily funny isnt it firestorm observed we can shape them all we like make them as intelligent as we can and still have flightworthy birds but we cant change their essential nature theyre still predators to the core who were those fools i dont know darkwind frowned i listened to them for a while but i didnt learn anything i think there were two mages and the rest were fighters to guard them but thats only a guess i dont know what they wanted other than the usual flies were beginning to gather around the fallen bodies and he moved out of the way a little dive in steal the treasures of the mysterious hawkbrothers and try to get out intact greedy bastards they never learn do they firestorm grimaced no darkwind agreed soberly they never do something about the tone of his voice made firestorm look at him sharply are you all right he said if you got hurt but youre trying to go all noble on me forget it if youre not in shape for it we can take over your share for the rest of the day or i can send back for some help darkwind shook his head and tossed his hair out of his eyes im all right im just tired of the whole situation were in we shouldnt be out here alone we should be patrolling in threes at least on every section ksheyna is in trouble and anyone with any sense knows it most of our mages wont leave the vale and the best of our fighters are out of reach i dont know why the council wont ask the other clans for help or even the shinain firestorm shrugged indifferently we havent had anything hit the border that we couldnt handle even shorthanded he replied after all we had cleaned this area out thats why the children and minor mages and half the fighters were gone when he broke off flushing im sorryi forgot you were there when when the heartstone fractured darkwind finished for him his voice flat and utterly without expression im not surprised he doesnt remember darkwind had been songwind then a proud young mage with snowwhite hair and a peacock wardrobenot darkwind who refused to use any magic but shielding who never wore anything but scout gear and wouldnt use the formidable powers of magic he still could controlif he chosenot even to save himself he washad beenadeptrank in factand strong enough at nineteen to be one of the heartstone anchorsnot that it mattered he watched vree tear off strips of rabbit and gulp them down fur and all i dont know if you ever knew this he said conversationally not wanting firestorm to think he was upset about the reminder of his past i watched the building of the gate to send them all off firestorm tilted his head to one side why did they send everyone off i wasnt paying any attentionit was my first valemove we always do that darkwind said as vree got down to the bones and began cleaning every scrap of flesh from them he could find its part of the safety measures sending those not directly involved in moving the power or guarding those who are to the new valesite where theyd be safe in case something happened which it did firestorm sighed i guess its a good thing the gods only know where they are now somewhere west somewhere west too far to travel when over half of them were children and not an adept able to build a gate back to us in the lot of them darkwind scowled now that was a mistake and it was bad tactics half of the adepts should have been with them and i dont know why the council ordered them all to stay until the heartstone was drained and the power moved firestorm relaxed marginally and scratched kreel with his free hand nobody ever tells us about these things darkwind why havent we built a new gate and brought them back a damned good question darkwinds lips compressed father says that whats left of the heartstone is too unstable to leave too dangerous to build a gate near and much too dangerous to have children exposed to firestorm raised an eloquent eyebrow you dont believe him i dont know what to believe darkwind stared off into the distance over firestorms shoulder into the shadows beneath the trees i probably shouldnt be telling you this even that kind of information is only supposed to be discussed by the council or among mages theres another thing father was acting oddly even before the disasterhe hasnt been quite himself since he was caught in that forest fire or thats the way it seems to me but nobody else seems to have noticed anything wrong well i havent at least not any more than with the rest of the council firestorm laughed sarcastically old men too damned proud to ask for help from outside and too feeble to fix things themselves which is probably why im not on the council ive said that in public a few too many times the scout tossed his hawk up into the air and turned to go kreel darted up into the trees ahead and all the birds went silent as he took to the air everything that flew knew the shape of a cooperihawk nothing on wings was safe from a hungry one and no bird would ever take a chance on a cooperi being sated if youre all right to finish ill get back to my section do we bother to clean up or leave it for the scavengers leave it darkwind told him maybe a few bones lying around will discourage others maybe the younger man laughed or maybe we should start leaving heads on stakes at the borders with that macabre suggestion the scout followed his bird into the forest moving in silence blending into the foliage within moments vree had finished his rabbit dropping the polished bones and darkwind launched him into the air as well so that they could resume their interrupted patrol hed meant what he told firestorm every bitter word of it i hardly know father anymore he used to be creative flexible he used to have no trouble admitting when he was wrong now hes the worst of the lot every time another clan sends someone to see if we need help he sends them away how can we not need help weve got an unstable heartstone we dont have enough scouts to patrol a border that we had to pull back in the first place our children are gone and we cant get them backand we dont dare leave and hes pretending we can handle it that was part of the reason he spent so little time in the vale anymore the place was too silent too empty tayledras children were seldom as noisy as outlander children but they made their presenceand their absencefelt the oncelively vale seemed dead without them and another part of the reason he avoided the vale was his father the fewer opportunities there were for confrontations with the old man the better darkwind liked it he would have to go in at the end of his patrol though and he wrinkled his nose in distaste at what he would have to endure this invasion would have to be reported and as always the council would want to know why he hadnt handled things differently why he hadnt blasted the intruders or shot them all when he first saw them and because he was an elder the questions would be more pointed i didnt kill them because they could have been perfectly innocent dammit and starblade would want to know why he hadnt used magic and as always darkwind would be unable to give him an answer that would satisfy him because i dont want to isnt good enough he wants to know why i dont want to darkwind pulled his climbingstaff out of the sheath and hooked a limb hauling himself up into the tree and trying not to wince as he discovered new bruises he wants to know why he says but he wont accept my reasons because adept starblade couldnt possibly have a son who gave up magic for the life of a scout even when the magic killed his mother in front of his eyes even when the magic ruined his life even when hes seen over and over that magic isnt an answer its a tool and any tool can be done without he looked out over the forest floor and briefly touched vrees mind all was quiet even the birds frightened into silence by the noise of the fight and the appearance of the cooperihawk were singing again well hed better start learning to change again darkwind decided because ive had enough im taking this incident to the council as usual but this time im going to make an issue of it and i dont care if he doesnt like what hes going to hear we cant keep on like this indefinitely and if he wants a fight hes going to get one chapter three elspeth elspeth bit her lip until it bled to keep herself from losing her temper queen selenay normally serene in the face of any crisis had reacted to the attack on her eldest child with atypical hysteria well id call it hysteria anyway elspeth had barely gotten clean and changed when the summons arrived from her motheraccompanied by a bodyguard of two as a harbinger of what was to come that bodyguard put elspeths hackles up immediately the sight of selenay standing beside the old wooden desk in her private apartments white to the lips and with jaws and hands clenched did nothing to make her daughter feel any better and so far selenays impassioned tirade had not reassured her heir either it seemed that the queens answer to the problem was to restrict elspeths movements to the palace complex and to assign her a dayandnight guard of not less than two at all times and that as far as elspeth was concerned was totally unacceptable but she couldnt get a word in until her mother stopped pacing up and down the breadth of her private office and finally calmed down enough to sit and listen instead of talking it helped that talia though she was privy to this notquiteargument elspeth was having with selenay was staying discreetly in the background and so far hadnt said a word one way or the other i think if she sided with mother id have hysterics i cant believe youre taking this sosocasually selenay finally concluded tightly her hands shaking visibly even though she held them clenched together on the desktop white as a marble carving im not taking it casually mother elspeth replied hoping the anger she thought she had under control did not show im certainly not regarding this incident as some kind of a bad joke but i am not going to let fear rule my life she paused for a moment waiting for another tirade to begin when selenay didnt say anything she continued trying to sound as firm and adult as possible no bodyguards mother no one following me everywhere and i am not going to live behind the palace walls like some kind of cloistered novitiate youre almost killed and you say that i mother elspeth interrupted every other ruler lives with that same threat constantly weve been spoiled in valdemarmages have never been able to get past our borders and the heraldic giftsespecially the queens owns giftshave always made sure that we knew who the assassins were before they had a chance to strike sonow that isnt necessarily true anymore i am not going to restrict my movements with a nightandday guard just because of a single incident and frankly im not going to lose any sleep over it selenay paled and seemed at a loss for words that doesnt mean im going to be careless she added im going to take every precaution kerowyn advises im not foolhardy or stupidbut i am not going to live in fear either finally talia spoke up there really isnt that much more danger than there always was she said mildly weve just been a lot more careless than the monarchs were insayvanyels day we have been spoiled we thought we were immune to danger that magic had somehow gone away the fact is we didnt learn from the last two wars we have to do moremuch morethan we have in finding ways to counter this threat or should i say in rediscovering them now thats odd no one seems to have any trouble discussing magic when its in the pastthe stories of vanyels time for instance its only when were talking about it happening nowand here inside valdemarthat the restriction seems to hold but before she pursued that train of thought she had to come up with some convincing arguments first mother im a herald first and your heir second the fact is i cant do my job with somebody hovering over me all the time when selenay looked blank elspeth sighed im still on duty to the city courts remember and on detached duty with kerowyn what if she wants me to go work with the skybolts for a while what would your allies say if i went over there with a set of bodyguards at my back theyd say you dont even trust your own people thats what not to mention what a pair of hulking brutes at my back is going to do to my lovelife she thought unhappily there wasnt a lot there to begin with but i cant even imagine trying to have a romantic encounter with half the guard breathing down my neck you could always try confining your pursuits to your bodyguards gwena suggested teasingly oh thanks thats a wonderful idea ill take it under advisement she replied trying to keep her level of sarcasm down to something acceptable to suddenly start trailing bodyguards around isnt going to do much for my accessibility mother she continued thinking quickly people come to the heir when they are afraid for one reason or another to come to the monarchand you know thats been true for hundreds of years if theres something you want done but dont want the open authority of the crown behind it you give it to me talia is your double in authorityshe cant do that im your unfettered hand and now you want to shackle me it just wont work anyone could tell you that it not only cuts down my effectiveness it cuts down on yours good girl thats the way to win your argument i agree with you by the way bodyguards are not a solution not unless those bodyguards were also heralds and we have no heralds to spare elspeth felt a little more relaxed and confident with gwenas support thanks at least im not just being boneheaded and stubborn about this oh you are being boneheaded and stubborn her companion replied cheerfully but its for the right reasons and theres nothing wrong with a little stubbornness for the correct cause elspeth could hear the gentle good humor in gwenas mindvoice and couldnt take offensethough for a moment she was sorely tempted selenay did not look convinced by the argument however i cant see that its worth the risk she began talia interrupted her elspeths right im afraid she said in her quiet clear voice it is worth the risk when elspeth goes out off the palace grounds you could assign her a discreet guard but other than that i think that extra care on everyones part will serve the same purpose if kero is right simply having the guards question anyone they see who doesnt seem to be acting normally will prevent another incident like the last one selenays jaw tightened in a way elspeth knew only too well you think im overreacting dont you yes elspeth repliedmentally and kept a very tight shield over the thought no talia said and smiled youre just acting the way any mother would i know if it were jemmielets just say id have him hidden away with some familysay a retired guardsmanturnedfarmerso far out in the country that no one could counterfeit a native and any stranger would cause a stir maybe selenays expression turned speculative and elspeth started to interrupt the thought she knew was going through her mothers mind talia did it for her that wont work for elspeth im afraid shes too old to hide that way even if she would put up with being sent off like an exile howeverher uncles court is very well protected not too bad an idea elspeth had to admit even if it doesnt feel right thats a thought selenay acknowledged i dont know ill have to think about it so long as you arent planning on putting me under armed guard like the crown jewels elspeth said in a little better humor not at the moment her mother admitted all right then she ran a hand over her hair and smiled a little i can put up with one guard in the city we probably should have had one anyway if im not safe on the palace grounds after kero gives the guards one of her famous lectures i wont be safe anywhere i should know i got one myself today two in fact as soon as she figured i was all right she gave me a pointbypoint critique on my performance talia chuckled and selenay relaxed a little i can just see kero doing that too talia said she doesnt ever let up shes like alberich the more tired you are the more she seems to push you i know believe me uhon that subject sort ofwould there be any problem if i had a tray in my room she asked drooping just a littlenot enough to resurrect selenays hysteria but enough to look convincingly tired i dont think i can handle uncles delegation right nowafter this afternoon i doubt anyone would expect you to the queen replied sympathetically ill make your apologies and hopefully after this afternoon the current batch of rumors will be put to rest for a while and ill see that someone sends a tray up talia offered with honeycakes she added giving elspeth a quick wink elspeth managed to keep from giving herself away and stayed in character thanks she sighed throwing both of them grateful looks if anyone wants me ill be in the bathing room under hot water and frankly right now all you need to worry about is whether or not i drown in the bathtub all i want is a hot bath and a book dinner and bed she made a hasty exit before she betrayed herself after all it was partially the truth she really was tired her afternoons doubleworkout had seen to that even before the attack she really did want a hot bath and a tray in her room but she had no intention of going to bed early there was too much to think about a candlemark later wrapped in a warm robe and nibbling on a honeycake as she gazed out into the duskfilled gardens she still hadnt come to any conclusions of her own things just felt wrong she was restless and unhappy and she wasnt certain why the restrictions selenay had wanted to place on her movements had merely heightened those feelings which had been there all along its almost as if there was something i should be doing she decided as the blue dusk deepened and shrouded the paths below in shadows as if somewhere i have the key to all this if i can just find it one thing she was certain of this would not be the last time ancar attempted an assassination or something of the sort he wanted valdemar and he was not going to give up trying to annex it there was no way he could expand eastward the aurinalean empire was old and strong enough to flatten him if he attacked any of its kingdoms north was iftelstrange isolationist iftelguarded by a deity he could not move against them not unless he wanted a smoking hole where his army had been south was karse and if rumor was true he was already making moves in that direction but karse had been at war with valdemar and rethwellan for generations and they were quite prepared to take him on as well taking valdemar would give him protection on the north a western border he would not need to guard and another place from which to attack karse besides doubling his acquisitions he probably assumed that if the rightful rulers and their heirs died it would leave the country in a state of chaos and an easy target for takeover he might not be ready for another war nowbut he would be given time and the chance to rebuild his forces so no matter what theres going to be another war she thought shoving the rest of her dinner aside uneaten i know it kero knows it stepfather knows itmother knows it and wont admit it she turned away from the window and rested her back against the sill shed had a fair number of discussions with kero and princeconsort daren on this very subject her stepfather didnt treat her like a child then again her stepfather hadnt ever seen her until she was adult and in her full whites it was an old proverb that a person was always a child to his parents but it was war she should really be worrying about not how to make her mother realize that she was an adult and capable of living her own life the two problems were entwined but not related and the personal problems could wait the next try ancar makes is going to involve magic i know it combative magic warmagic the kind they use south of rethwellan the kind the skybolts are used to seeing kero says so and i think shes right she can talk about real magic and i can and that might be a clue to what i need to be doing right there for valdemar was not ready to cope with magic especially not within its borders for all the efforts to prepare the populace for all the research that was supposed to have been done in the archives very little had actually been accomplished yes the ballads of vanyels time and earlier had been revived but there was very much a feeling of but it cant happen now in the people of elspeth had talked to and she wasnt the only one to have come to that conclusion kero had said much the same thing the captain was worried elspeth licked her bitten lip and thought hard keros told me a lot of stories she hasnt even told mother some of the things the skybolts had to deal withand those were just minor magics most of the time the major magics dont get used shed said more than once that was because the major mages tended to cancel one another out adeptclass mages tended to be in teaching or in some otherwise lesshazardous aspect of their profession most mages adeptclass or not were unwilling to risk themselves in allout mageduels for the sake of a mere employer most employers were reluctant to antagonize them but when the ruler himself was a mage or backed by onea powerful mage at thatthe rules changed mages could be coerced like anyone else or blackmailed or bribed if the offer was high enough there was already evidence of coercion magical and otherwise outright control like the men of his armies and where there was a power broker there were always those who wanted power above all else and were willing to pay any price to get it so valdemar wasnt protected anymore because there was someone willing to pay the price of breaking the protections or bending themall right when the borderprotection has failed whats been the common denominator she rubbed her temple as she tried to think of what those failures had in common it didnt keep hulda outbut she didnt work any magic while she was here it didnt keep some of ancars spells out but they were cast across the border it didnt keep that assassin outbut the spell must surely have been cast on him when he was with ancar and it didnt keep need out but need hasnt done a blessed thingopenlysince kero got here so as long as there wasnt any active magiccasting within the borders the protections they had relied on werent working anymore or else there were now mages who were stronger than the protections so long as they worked from outside and without a doubt ancar had figured that out too furthermore no matter how powerful the protections were unless they were caused by some deity or otherwhich elspeth very much doubtedthey could be broken altogether instead of merely circumvented and whennot if but whenancar accomplished that they were going to be as helpless as a mouse beneath the talons of a predator as if to underscore that elspeth heard the call of an owl somewhere out in the gardens someone was going to have to find a magepreferably a very powerful mage one who wouldnt suffer from whatever had kept the skybolts mages outand bring him to valdemar that was going to take a lot of money persuasion or both the first they hador could get the second just required the right person someone who was experienced in diplomacy and negotiation or failing being able to bring someone in a herald was going to have to learn magic herself thats it she decided thats what i need to dofind a mage and bring him in im the perfect instrument for the job or learn magic kero says there are some thingsaccording to her grandmotherthat just need a trained will ive certainly got that and as for where to find a magei think i know just the place to start this time elspeth called the meeting at breakfast in her mothers suite she hoped to catch her in a malleable moodwhich she often was in the early morning not that elspeth enjoyed being up that early on the whole she preferred never to have to view the sunrise but for a good cause shed sacrifice a bit of sleep she stated her case as clearly and logically as possible before selenay had finished her muffins but after shed had her first two cups of tea shed thought about her presentation very carefully why someone had to go chasing mages and why that someone had to be her then she sat back and waited for her answer she has to agree theres no other choice for us no selenay stated flatly its not possible for a moment she was taken aback but she rallied her defenses thought quickly and plowed gamely onward mother i dont see where theres any choice elspeth replied just as firmly as her mother ive told you the facts kero backs up my guesses about whats likely to happen and shes the best tactician we have and alberich backs her up the three of us have talked this over a lot i dont selenay fell strangely silent looking troubled and very doubtful elspeth followed up her advantage i cant give her a chance to say anything look at her hands shes clutching things again its conflict between being a mother and the ruler i think i can convince the council but i have to convince her before i convince the council we cant do this on our own anymore we have to have help we have to have a mageadeptclass is what kero says someone who can work around whatever it is that keeps active mages out we have to find someone like that who is willing not only to help us but to teach heralds if he can i dont see why selenay began weve managed all right until now why cant the gifts provide an adequate defense theyve worked so far mother believe me there hasnt been a real trial of them elspeth countered ive listened to keros stories and frankly they wont hold against a real effort by several mages ill tell you what i suspect that we have people capable of becoming mages the chronicles all talk about amagegift just as if it were something likeoh firestarting rare but not unusual i dont think its been lost i think that weve just forgotten how to tell what it is and how to train it but to do that we need a mage a good one and kero says that all the good teachers are adeptclass even if all that is true selenay said after a long silence her hands clenched around her mug why should you be the one to go well for one thing ive got crown powers when i find a mage we can trust i can offer him anything reasonableand i know whats reasonable keros briefed me on hiring mages for anotherim not indispensable you have two more heirs and if you want to know the truth im not certain i should wear the crown she smiled ruefully i take shortcuts a little too often to make the council comfortable selenay returned the smile reluctantly but if faded just as quickly as it came elspeth shrugged the truth of the matter is that the twins are probably going to be better rulers than i would the council cant object to letting me go with two more candidates for the throne still here im a full herald i know what we need kero can probably give me contacts and i have crown authority im the bestabsolutely bestperson for the job selenay started to say somethingelspeth waited for the rebukebut it never came it was almost as if something had interrupted her before she could say anything odd but she followed up on her advantage let me give you another reason you wanted me safe right you can put forty layers of guards on the twins and they wont mind but you know very well that i wont put up with it on the other hand if you send me to uncle faram ancar wont know where to find me at firstand when he finds out he wont risk a try for me in rethwellan uncle has a larger army he has mages and i dont think even ancar would risk allout war with him she firmed her jaw and raised her head stubbornly besides i wont be there for long ill be looking for keros old mage quenten he has a school she says and if anybody can find us mages i should think he would when im there ill be surrounded by mages i couldnt possibly be safer than that selenay finally sighed and unclenched her hands there must be something wrong with that logic but i cant figure out what it is she said her brow furrowed with an unhappy frown elspeth turned a look of appeal on talia who bit her lip and looked very uncomfortable as if part of her wants to side with me and part of her doesnt i just dont like it selenay said finally youre far too vulnerable even traveling through valdemar i wouldnt feel comfortable unless you had a full company of troops with you traveling across the comb is nearly as dangerous in summer as winterthere are thunderstorms wild beastsand the only decent pass is too close to karse for my comfort she shook her head no i cant allow it bringing in a magethats not a bad idea i think youre right about that much but the person i send wont be you selenays chin came up and her voice took on a steely quality that elspeth knew only too well there was no arguing with her mother in this mood she could appeal to her stepfather and alberich kero was already on her side but not now and it might take weeks even months to get selenay to change her mind by then it would be fall or winter and she would have another excuse to keep elspeth at homethe weather and perhaps by then it would be too late she closed her eyes for a moment the odd pressure inside her now that she had a goal in mind and a task that really needed to be done was already uncomfortable any delay would make it intolerable she had to gohad to and she couldnt she wanted to scream argue cry anything but just one word at this point would ensure that she would never win selenays permission and without that permission there was no point in going to the council they would never override the queen on this if i just ran off and did itno that wouldnt work either she had to have crown and council authority to make this mission a success and running off on her own was not going to win her either so instead of bursting out as she really wanted to she simply clamped her mouth shut she got up leaving her breakfast untasted bowed stiffly and took herself out of the room altogether she managed to keep her temper as far as her roomswhere she slammed the door shut behind her and yanked open the closet so hard she nearly took the door off the hinges the handle did come loose in her hand and she flung it across the room without a single word grabbing a set of old clothes from the back of the closet pulling off her uniform and throwing it in a heap on the floor and pulling on the new clothing with no care whatsoever she heard several stitches pop as she pulled the shirt over her head and ignored them kitten gwena said tentatively dearest dont be too discouraged things can change sometimes in a heartbeat there are events occurring out on the borders that none of us know about yetone of those may force your mother to change her mind dont patronize me elspeth snarled im past the age when you can tell me that everything will be all right we have trouble and no one wants to admit it or let me do my part in meeting it so leave me alone all right let me cool down my own way oh gwena replied very much taken aback by the barelysuppressed rage in elspeths mindvoice then she remained silent though elspeth sensed her watchful presence in the back of her mind she ignored it leaving her rooms with another slamming of doors and heading defiantly out to the gardens and her pottery shed no one even tried to stop her several people looked curiously at her as she stormed past but no one spoke most of the evidence of the assassination attempt was gone along with the remains of those pieces that were smashed in the struggle the floor had been swept cleanmuch much cleaner than elspeth ever kept it no it was more than that there was a new stool beside the bench where the old one had stood there was a new door in place of the shattered one her old stove had been replaced with a new kiln and a new stove her shelves had been replaced with stronger ones the walls had been scoured the floor scrubbed and the place had been tidied up with meticulous precision elspeth stared around with a sense of affront bad enough that shed been attacked herebut someone had taken it upon himself to improve the place her sanctuary had been violated with good intent but violated just the same it wasnt hers anymorebut it was all she had resolutely she squared her shoulders went to one of the waiting boxes of raw clay and cut herself a generous chunkquite enough to make another twohandled vase better than the last one and she set about grimly wedging the helpless hunk of clay into submission stubborn unreasoning woman she fumed punching the defenseless clay as hard as she could flattening it to a fingerwide sheet on the smooth slate top of the bench a lot like her daughter whispered her conscience so what she answered it i can see sense when i have to whatever it costs me she wont even consider what this could mean if i succeedor what it will mean if im not allowed to try i dont even know if shell send someone elseshe might decide not to she might even forget her conscience persisted as she rolled the sheet of clay up into a cylinder and flattened the cylinder into a sphere youve never been a mother so how can you know what letting you go would cost her you heard taliaif it were her son that was in jeopardy shed be just as irrational and she is the most sensible person you know and besides you arent the only one who could take this mission on and make a success out of it oh no she snarled at her conscience picking the ball of clay up and throwing it down on the slate over and over again who else is there kerowyn for one her conscience replied too promptly after all her uncleif hes still aliveis a white winds adept and quenten used to be one of the skybolts mages she has the same contacts she would be giving you surely one of them could be persuaded to help and if not she challenged if nottherere king farams court mages they arent exactly apprentices and theyve already proved theyll work for hire by being in his employ and kero is daren and farams very good friend she could probably even persuade faram to part with one or more of his mages if they are willing to come up here but im their relative she countered that should be twice as effective her conscience had no counter to that but she had no answer for it either so she wasnt the only person who could goso what she was still the best choice if not the only one if only selenay would admit it the clay was readybut she wasnt she continued to pound her temper out on it as she sought reasons why kerowyn could not be spared to go in her place shes the captain of the skyboltswho are in valdemars employ and she has perfectly adequate standins she doesnt have crown authority in case she has to negotiate with someone besides the people she knows well theres always a writ shes too old that sounded like a stupid excuse even to elspeth too old sure she can beat me nineteen falls out of twenty not even close girl she doesnt know what we need now that might be a good reason the needs of a mercenary captain and the needs of a country like valdemar were vastly different a company might be able to use someone who didnt necessarily fit their profile valdemar was going to need someone very special for one thing hes going to need a pretty good set of ethics hell have to be able to get along with people hell have to know when not to use his power and most especially hell have to be someone who would never ever abuse either his power or position in other words he would for all intents and purposes be as much like a herald as possible and ideally really he would be chosen as soon as elspeth returned to valdemar with him that would be perfect but that would make him the first heraldmage since vanyelshe shook off the haze of speculation what mattered was that keroif she wentwas all too likely to bring back someone who was picked with a captains eye rather than a heralds and that could be a major mistake she might well take the best of a dubious lot without looking any further she could get someone who had managed to conceal his motives she could even get someone in alliance with ancar who had not only managed to conceal his motives but his intentions kero was smart but she hadnt been a herald for very long she still took some folks aback by her attitudes that was amusing inside valdemar but in a situation where valdemars wellbeing depended on her attitudesa difference of opinion could be dangerous and there was always the possibility that she would pick someone who was not strong enough to pass the borders then what would she simply conclude that this magehunting was a waste of time and return elspeth wouldntbut she wasnt sure that the same would be true of kero this may be one case where my stubborn streak is an advantage i wont give in until i have someone kero might and if she winds up having to go outside of rethwellani think her reputation as a mercenary might be held against her there might be mages with active morals who would feel that working with a mercenary former or no wasnt ethical no matter how worthy the cause kero had worked all of her life to keep her emotions out of her negotiations that lack of obvious passion might work against her in a case like this but elspeth might be convincing enoughi have all the reasons and counters i need she thought grimly kneading her clay now if only someone would be willing to listen to them chapter four darkwind so you have encountered another situation starblade ksheyna said coldly as he regarded his son without blinking the ekele was too low on the tree trunk to sway but the branches surrounding it moved in a gentle wind darkwind tried not to shift position in any way that might be interpreted as showing his discomfort it was difficult to remain cool beneath that measuring inscrutable gaze starblades bondbird a huge hawksized crow gazed at him with the same impassive expression as its bondmate it might have been a stone bird or a shadow made into flesh and feathers what ever happened to the father i knew hes gone as thoroughly as songwind let me see if i understand this correctly you were on patrol along the border your bondbird located invaders there were some seven intruders two of whom may have been mages the rest of whom may simply have been in their employ sun poured through the leaves beyond the open windows engulfing them in a dappled silence yes elder darkwind replied just as impersonally perhaps if i give him a little taste of his own aestarblade inclined his head a little in mocking acknowledgment of the imitation and the tiny multicolored crystals braided into his waistlength snowwhite hair sang softly as he moved echoing the wind chimes strung in each window but you are not sure no elder darkwind knew very well what starblade was up to and did not rise to the bait he wants me to get angry and i wont that would be an acknowledgment of weakness and lack of control why not starblade persisted narrowing his iceblue eyes to slits what was it that you did to try and determine what they were as if he didnt know what would be the proper procedure i followed them for some distance before i judged they had ventured too far into ksheyna territory nothing in their conversation gave me any clues as to their identity elder darkwind replied holding his temper in check there was no real reason for this interview they had already been over this several times once before the entire council once with the other three elders in detail and now for the second time with his father alone the council had heard his story without allowing him to confront them over the situation of being so shorthanded on the border that they had assigned to starblade as the most senior adept and presumably the one who could make a decision about the situation perhaps he is supposed to conjure up something darkwind thought bitterly which meant he had to go over this as many times as starblade wanted in order to get his point made i listened carefully to the conversation what there was of it the armed men treated the unarmed men with a certain amount of deference but there was no outward sign that they were notsayadventurous traders i thought they might be mages because they were unarmed so i moved to neutralize them first you did not spellcast to determine if any of them were using magic of any kind starblade settled back in his greencushioned chair in contrast to his sons camouflage outfit his own elaborate clothing made him look like an exotic silvercrested blueplumaged bird perched in the shrubbery no sir darkwind replied allowing a hint of effrontery to carry into his voice i did not and why not starblade asked softly you have the power after all because i do not choose to use that power father darkwind said holding in his temper with an effort you know that as you know my as i know your excuses starblade snapped they are not reasons you put ksheyna in jeopardy because you refuse to use your abilities i did no such thing i kept ksheyna from jeopardy because i destroyed the interlopers when they would not turn back darkwind interrupted i did so without the foolish use of magic which might have attracted more trouble that close to the border despite being shorthanded i did so with the limited resources at my disposal without magic without magic darkwind repeated because it was not needed and because other things might have been attracted that it would not have been possible to combat with only three guards and their birds within range to stand against the threat he glared at his father if you are so insistent on having mages on the border father perhaps you would care to join us for some of our patrols and we can lead you about by the hand they could not have been more of a contrast he and starblade the mage wore his waistlength silver hair braided with crystals feathers and rainbow beads his costume of peacockblue spidersilk cut and decorated elaborately was impressive and impractical in the extreme darkwind when he was not in his scout clothing tended to wear brown or gray cut closely to his body highcollared and mostly without ornament his hair was barely shoulderlength most of the mages dressed the way starblade did though some made concessions to camouflage by wearing white in the winter and leafcolors in the rest of the year garments that could blend in with the woods after a fashion not that long ago he had looked like the rest of them this is growing tedious father we have been over this any number of times i did my duty i rid ksheyna of the interlopers the point is not that i did or did not get rid of them using magic the point is that we are chronically shorthanded we shouldnt be here at all father more than half of ksheyna iselsewhere whats wrong with us why havent we done something about this situation that is none of your concern starblade began coldly drawing himself up and staring at his son in astonishment it is my concern darkwind interrupted im on the council too i am the representative of the scouts im one of the clan elders now which you seem to have forgotten and as the scouts representative i would like to know exactly what we are doing to drain the heartstone or stabilize it and rejoin the rest of our clan he drew himself up to match his fathers pose and looked challengingly into starblades eyes starblade met the challenging gaze impassively that is the business of the mages if you wish to have a say in the matter he smiled you may take up your powers again then you may join the mages and have your words heeded darkwind felt himself flushing with anger despite his earlier resolutions what i choose to do with my powers has nothing to do with the matter those of us who are not mages have a right to determine what is ksheynas future as well he paused a moment and added the tradition after allthat every voice in a clan has some say in the running of the clan starblade looked past his sons shoulder for a moment and took a long slow breath what you choose to do with your powersis precisely at issue here he lowered his eyes to meet darkwinds again and there was an anger to match his sons in his gaze you are risking the lives of your scouts by your refusal to use your magic your abilities are required on our boundaries and yet you will not use them and i do not accept why you refuse darkwind closed his eyes but he could not block the memories the heartstone a great crystallaced boulder taller than he pulsing with all the life and power of the vale its surface glowed with intricate warm red and golden tracings as the inner circle of adepts continued to drain the excess mageenergy from the land about them to empty the nodes and the powerlines so that there was nothing left that could be used to harm that was how the tayledras left a place concentrating all the realigned power of the area in their heartstone then draining the heartstone and channeling most of its awesome energy into a new one at the site of their new vale power crackled and seethed pouring into the stone as darkwind held to his position anchoring the westoutside the circle of adepts that contained his mother and father the shunting off of the great stones energy was a dangerous task and required many protectors and guides from outside the main circle he was an important part e in age ngw eyna was the youngest adept of his clan ever to take such a task and quite conscious of the responsibilities involved there was no warning no unsettling current of unclean energy just a brightening of the stone more intense than the last and a disorienting sensation like lightning strikinghell opened in front of him a blaze of incandescent white power that scorched him to the soul silhouetted against the hellfires his mother i dont trust my socalled abilities father he said slowly shaking off the toovivid memories no one knows why the heartstone fractured and the power broke loose was it his imagination or did his father start a little i was the youngest adept there he persisted i was the only one who had never participated in moving a heartstones power before what if it was something i did and everything i do magically is forever flawed that way i will not take that chance father not when what is left of our clan is at stake starblade would not look into his sons eyes but his voice was implacable he gazed down at his hand as if he had never seen it before examining the long fingers as he spoke i have told you many times it was nothing you did or did not do it it had nothing to do with you can you be certain of that he shook his head and started to stand up father i know exactly what my abilities are with my hands my senses i cant count on my magic starblade looked up and his expression had changed to one of scorn if you have no confidence in yourself the elder finished your magic is flawed only if you choose to believe it is so songwind was not thatfearful i remember and loved songwind he saw his power as a source of pride and our clan was proud of him for it our children and old ones are gone from us now and you have refused those powers to defend what is left of us here i have little respect for you for that darkwind the heat of darkwinds anger cooled to ice as he felt the blood draining from his face the golden sunlight drifting through the windows and making patterns upon the white wooden floor suddenly lost all its warmth the starblade who is my elder is not the father i remember either he replied perhaps a change of name is in order for you as well iceblade perhapsor brokenblade for you seem to have lost both your courage and your compassion starblade gaped at him in startled surprise you are unwilling to face the fact that circumstances have changed i think that you are terrified to face that change i dont knowi only know that you seem to think that we who work without magic are not worth aiding if you see no reason to help the scouts father then we must take what help we can geteven to calling on the hertasi the dyheli and the others of the hills whose wellbeing you scorn in your arrogance he started to turn and had taken one step toward the door when starblades voice stopped him arrogance the elder said as coolly as if darkwind had not said anything at all an interesting choice of words from you songwind was the youngest adept in the clanbut it has occurred to me of late that perhaps that distinction was not enough for you darkwind turned back to his father reluctantly what is that supposed to mean he asked the words forced from him unwillingly songwind was only an adept darkwind is on the councilis in fact an elder starblade shrugged that was an opportunity that would not have been given to songwind for some timebut with the scouts so shorthanded and poor newlybereft darkwind so eager to join themand socharismatic if you are suggesting that i have left magic solely for the sake of another kind of power darkwind could feel himself going red then white with anger he struggled to control his temper an outburst now would win him nothing i am suggesting nothing starblade replied smoothly i am only saying that the appearance is there a hundred retorts went through darkwinds mind but he made none of them instead he strove for and regained at least an appearance of calm if that were indeed the case elder he said quietly but with just a hint of the rage that he held tightly bottled within it seems to me that i would already have been acting on those ambitions i should have been moving to consolidate that power and to manipulate both the nonmages and the weaker mages as you are well aware i have been doing no such thing i have simply been doing the work assigned to melike any other scout like any responsible leader i never sought the position of leader or elder it was pressed upon me i would never have used personal attraction to get them starblade smiled tightly i merely suggest darkwind that if you returned to magic you would be forced to give up that position in fact in light of the fact that you are out of practice you might be asked to return to the position of student rather than adept and that perhaps unconsciouslyyou are reluctant to return to the position of commanded having been commander you have hinted that before elder darkwind answered him grimly and the suggestion was just as repellent the first time as it is now i think i know myself very well now and there is no such reluctance on my part for that ridiculous reason if there were anyone else within the scouts who wanted the position i would give it to himor herand gladly and if we were a less civilized people those words would be cause for a challenge i have said that i do not know this thing you have become darkwind starblade began darkwind cut him off abruptly with an angry gesture indeed elder he replied turning on his heel and tossing his last words over his shoulder as he left the outer room of starblades ekele you do not know me at all if you think that little of me it was notquitethe kind of exit he would have liked there was no door to slam only a hertasimade curtain of strung seedsand it was difficult if not impossible to effectively stamp his feet the few steps it took to reach the ladder without sounding like a child in a temper which is how he wants me to feel after all and if he rushed angrily down the ladder even so short a distance as he needed with his fathers treedwelling he risked taking some stupid injury like a sprain or a broken limb starblades ekele was hardly more than a few manheights from the floor of the vale and had several rooms like a bracelet of beads around the trunk of the huge tree it was built onto the access leading to it was more like a steep staircase than a ladder so it was quite impossible to descend in any way that would underscore his mood without playing to his fathers gloating he settled for vaulting off of the last few feet of it as if he could not bear to endure starblades hospitality a moment more he landed as lightly and silently as only a woodsscout could and walked away from the ekele without looking back his purposeful steps taking him on a path that would lead him out of the vale altogether he knew that he was by no means as calm as he looked but he was succeeding in this much at least he was working off some of his anger as he pushed his way through the exotic semitropical undergrowth that shadowed and sometimes hid the path the plants themselves were typical of any tayledras vale but the state of rank overgrowth was not the hawkbrothers always chose some kind of valley for their clansites something that could be roofed over magically and shielded from above and on all sides so that the climate within could be controlled and undesirable creatures warded off then if there were no hot springs there already the mages would create themand forcegrow broad trees to make them large enough to hold several ekele the result was always junglelike and the careful placement of paths to allow for the maximum amount of cover and privacy for all the inhabitants gave a vale the feeling of being uninhabited even when crowded with a full clan and all the hertasi that served them it appeared uninhabited to the outsider to a tayledras there was always the undercurrent of little sounds and lifefeelings that told him where everyone was a comforting lifesong that bound the clan together but there was no such song here in ksheyna vale instead of a rich harmony with undermelodies and counterpoint the music halted limped within a broken consort hertasi made up most of the lifesparks about darkwind as the little lizardfolk went about their business and that of the clan cleaning and mending and preparing food and that was not right further there were no childfeelings anywhere about only adults and a mere handful of those compared to the number a full clan should muster any tayledras would know there is something wrong something out of balance just by entering the vale silence tayledras that were not mages undertook all the skilled jobs that hertasi could not managebesides the scouts there should have been artisans musicians crafters all those activities made their own little undercurrent of noises and that too was absent the rustle of leaves the dripping of water the whisper of the passing of the shy hertasi sounds that he would never have noticed seemed too loud in the empty vale then there were the little signs of neglect ekele empty and untenanted going to pieces so that hertasi were constantly removing debris and trying to get rid of things before they fell springs were littered with fallen leaves vegetation grew unchecked untrimmed or dying out as rare plants that had required careful nurturing went untended it all contributed to the general feeling of desolationbut there was an underlying sense of pain as well and that was because not all of the ekele stood empty by choice half the clan had moved to the new vale it was true and were now out of reach until a new gate could be built to them there were no mages strong enough in the faraway exiled half of the clan to build that gate and not even the most desperate would choose to take children and frail elders on a trek across the dangerous territory that lay between them but ksheynathatremained was at a quarter of its strength not a half and most of those were not adepts the circle of adepts that had been charged with draining and moving the heartstone had been the strongest the clan could muster they had taken the full force of the disaster fully half of those that had remained behindmost of the adeptshad died in the catastrophe that claimed darkwinds mother many of those that were left were still in something of a state of shock and like darkwind himself trying to cope with the unprecedented loss of so many mates friends and children the silence left by their absence gnawed at the subconscious of mage and scout alike only a few went to darkwinds extreme and changed their usename but he was not completely alone in his reaction to change a usename meant that for all intents and purposes the person described by that name was dead that was why songwind became darkwind when he had recovered from his burns and lacerations he repudiated magic altogether then when that move brought him into conflict with his father he moved out of the family ekele and took up life on his own with the scouts and craftsmen who were left another mage starfire became nightfire and became obsessed with the remains of the heartstone studying it every waking moment trying to determine the cause of the disaster and the most traumatized mage of all moonwing became silence i could have been like silence he thought beating a branch aside with unnecessary force i could have retreated into myself and become a hermit i could have stopped speaking except mindtomind i could be broadcasting my pain to anyone who dared touch my thoughts i didnt do that im doing something useful but that evidently was not enough for starblade hell have me as a mage or not at all darkwind scowled at the trail before him frightening a passing hertasi into taking another route he should look to the clan there are more important problems than the fact that i will not use magic the physical wounds had mended but the emotional and mental injuries were still with ksheyna and they were not healing well but then those that could have taken care of such deepseated problems had all perished themselves there was no one skilled enough for instance to enter silences mind and heal herheal silence theres no one even skilled enough to heal me there should have been help coming from other clansthere can only be only one reason why there isnt he thought and not for the first time the elders pride they will not admit that we failed so badly or that we need help at all fools fools and blind in the first few weeks after the disaster there had been messengers from other clans that much he knew for a fact the rest was a guess for he had been delirious from brainfever and the pain of his burns he had been in no position to make any pleas but the visitors did not stay long in any case he had no doubt that they had been rebuffed now no visitorsor offers of helpcame at all darkwind reached the edge of the vale where the shield met the outside world the boundary line was quite clear within the vale grew a riot of flowers and plants with enormous tropical leaves all of it surrounding individual trees that reached higher than the cliffs beside them trees with trunks as large as houses flowers bloomed and plants flourished no matter the season outside the valeone scant fingerlength from the shieldit was pine forest with the usual sparse undergrowth and if darkwind looked closely enough he could see a kind of shimmer where the one ended and the other began of course if he cared to use magesight on that barrierwhich he did notthat shimmer was a curtain of pure energy tuned only to allow wildlife the hawkbrothers their allies and select individuals across he paused before crossing that invisible border and looked reluctantly at a stand of enormous bandarplants behind those plants lay a hot spring one of many that supplied the heat and moisture the plants required and provided places of refreshment as well gods above i could use a soak its been a long day and there is still more ahead of me well perhaps a short pause would not hurt anything he slipped between two of the plants and shed his clothing quickly leaving it in a pile on the smooth stones bordering the spring this was not one of the larger springs nor one of the more popular it was too close to the edge of the vale and the shield and the reminder of the real world outside their little sheltered vale made many of the remaining mages too uneasy to use it while the scouts who were more than a little uneasy within the heart of the vale in close proximity to the shattered but still empowered and dangerous heartstone did not much care to use the larger carefully sculptured springs there with their pools for washing as well as pools for soaking away achesor disporting hertasi did their best to keep all the little pockets of hot bubbling water free of fallen leaves and other debris but they had too many other duties to attend to this particular spring had not been attended to in some time and ran sluggishly the surface covered with fallen vegetation darkwind tossed a half dozen huge leaves out to the side and scooped out quite a bit of debris at the bottom before the spring bubbled up freely again then he relaxed back into the smooth stone of the seats built into the sides created by magically sculpting the rock before the water had been called here as the warm water soaked away his aches and bruises and relaxed tootaut muscles he closed his eyes and for once tried to remember back to those dark and chaotic days immediately following the catastrophe did we know then how bad the area was outside our own borders he didnt think so it seemed to him that no one had paid any attention to the lands outside the purview of the clan and to be fair they had their hands full with the territory they had undertaken to cleanse we definitely had enough to doand whatever was out there tended to leave us alone while we were strong there was no reason to think that it was any worse than our own lands it was only after they had cleaned up their own areas and were preparing to move that they realized that the blight they faced on their southern border was at least as pervasive as the one they had just dealt with and was perhaps more dangerous than the area to the west that they had chosen as the new valesite why hadnt they seen the blight well it might have been because there had been a clear zone between the two a zone that disguised the true nature of what lay beyond it was only after the disaster when creatures from across that clear zone swarmed over the wreckage of the vale that anyone realized just how tainted that area was now of course they could not deal with it could not clean it out and could not eliminate it theres at least one adept in there darkwind thought clenching his jaw involuntarily it was his constant attentions after the accident that forced us to pull back our borders in the first place and now that there were no more offers of help from the other clans they could not ask for one of the others to lend aid they could not even push the unseen enemies back not without help id try to contact the other clans myself but i would have to do so by magic means i dont know where the other territories are and father isnt about to give me a map and using magic would only have attracted more unwelcome attentions he had seen all too often how blatant use of magics brought a wave of attackers from the outside the one mage who had been willing to work with the scouts had fallen victim he suspected to just that he was certainly overwhelmed before we could reach him and i know there were not that many misborn there before he suspected that the adept watched for magicuse and turned his creatures loose when he saw it so long as ksheyna confined themselves and their magic to their vale he seemed content to pursue his own plans only pressing them occasionally rather than sending an army against them there may be more than one adept out there but somehow i dont think so dark adepts dont share power willingly so far they had been able to beat all attempts to penetrate the new boundaries so far they had not lost more than a handful of scouts and a mage or two and right now we seem to be operating under an uneasy truce as if he had decided we were too weak to threaten him but too strong to be worth moving against at least nothing major has come out of there for about a year and there havent been any attacks from outlanders that i can prove originated from there nothing had made any attempt at the creatures ksheyna protected either so far the hertasi enclaves remained untouched the dyheli herds had not been preyed upon the firebirds had fled the area thoughand that bothered him and there were no human villages within ksheyna territory anymore crops had failed wells dried up traders ceased to come only a handful of hunters and a religious hermit or two stayed behind no overt attacks for a year but who knows what that means he thought pesimistically we have a weak and unstable clan facing a nebulous enemy and our options grow fewer with every passing day starblades answer to their troubles was simple more magic more mages everyone who had a spark of magegift should train it and use it in their defense while the handful of real mages worked to find an answer to their unstable heartstone magic was the answer to every problem but how many times have i seen that using magic attracts problems hundreds and what happens when we attract something we cant handle no more magic was not the answer not to darkwinds way of thinking what we should do is appeal for help to one of the other clans we need adepts who can drain the old heartstone or stabilize it and take over this vale for us then we can build a gate and rejoin the rest so what if they cant gate in to us that doesnt matter and while we wait for the heartstone to be made safe we can defend ourselves with stealth with cleverness he had to force his shoulder muscles to relax again and sank a little deeper into the hot water in fact thats what we should be doing about this adept we should find some way of luring him out into the open maybe by playing dead then we should neutralize himbut the one thing he wouldnt be expecting is a physical assault he nodded to himself the pieces finally falling together for him that adept wants somethingthe power in the heartstone probably he has to be watching constantly for magic power in use and sending things against us only when he sees it he really hasnt made an allout assault against us because hes clever he knows it would cost him less to take us by attrition than by full force and right now hes hoping to lull us into forgetting that hes out there he tightened his jaw thinking about how starblade kept dismissing the importance of the scouts and the threats on the borders right he just might too that brought up another thought i wonder if he sent those intruders to test us it could be and not using magic told himwhat that we dont have mages to spare probably he should have a pretty good idea of how weak we really are at this point but what if i can use that against him what if i can lure him out into the open and find out who and what he is what if i could destroy himor at least convince him that were too strong still to be worth the trial he shook his head at his own ambitions certainly and what if i could grow wings and fly out of here for help the one is as likely as the other best to stick to what he knew he could accomplish he looked up through the leafy canopy above him not long until sunset and that meant he had better get back to his own ekele the dayscouts would be waiting to report the nightscouts to be briefed and vree would be waiting for his dinner for that bit of rabbit earlier was hardly enough to satisfy him reluctantly he pulled himself out of the spring dried himself with his shirt and pulled on the rest of his clothing if i can see what needs taking care of then its my job to take care of it my duties wont waitwhether or not father approves chapter five elspeth elspeth stood on guard trembling with exhaustion with the last of the dulled practice swords in her hands the captain went offguard and nodded right kerowyn said just a hint of satisfaction in her voice lets go through it again did i hear satisfaction approval gods maybe all the bruises are worth it after all elspeth shook sweat out of her eyes picked up the scattered practice blades with hands that still tingled from keros disarms and distributed them randomly around the perimeter of the circle it was kind of funny really this was the one and only time she had ever been ordered to just drop weapons carelessly leaving them exactly where they fell this had been another one of keros little exercises in attitude today had been entirely defensive she had not been permitted to strike a single blow and shed had one of the most strenuous workouts shed ever had in her life the exercise was simple kero disarmed her and she would try to get to another weaponby whatever means possiblebefore kero could corner her hence the rough circle of weaponry scattered around the salle her setupsuch as it wascompleted she stood in the middle of the circle sword in hand and waited for kero to disarm her kero went into ready stance and elspeth matched her here it comes her heart beat a little faster and her mouth dried no matter that it was just a practice with kerowyn or alberich nothing was ever just a practice when they delivered killing blows they left bruises as a reminder of what could have happened the captain came in slowly this time kero feinted and fenced with her for a few moments forcing her to move away from her original position then when elspeth was not expecting it the captain bound her blade and sent it flying out of her hand she didnt waste a moment the instant she lost the blade she dove to one side rolled and came up with another in her hand a shortsword this time without thinking she shifted her grip until the balance was right this time kero rushed her before she had a chance to settle herself catching her offguard while she was still finding the balance for the blade crap she backpedaled but not fast enough kero got to her and literally swatted the blade out of her hand she did the unexpectedas kero had been trying to get her to do she rushed the captain barehanded shouldering past her and springing for the next sword on the floor this time she didnt even get a chance to get her hands on it kero beat her to the spot and kicked it away before she reached it she dove after another sliding bellydown across the wooden floor she got it and started to roll overbut kero was on top of her and swatted that one out of her hands too this one fell short and elspeth made a short dive and grabbed it again her hand tingled and she had trouble feeling her fingers but she got it all the same just as kero reached her and cut down this time she didnt lose it this time she managed to hold onto the hilt long enough to counter keros first three attempts at disarming hereven though her grip was an entirely unorthodox twohanded one and she never managed to return a blow thats enough kero said stepping back and wiping the sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand elspeth simply collapsed where she lay for a moment spreadeagled on the floor she blinked several times to clear her eyes and rolled over onto her side and when kero offered her a hand to help her up she took it without shame not bad the captain said as she started to pick up the scattered swords not bad at all elspeth cast her a startled glance oh i mean it the captain grinned you were exhausted your hands were numband you still always managed to get a weapon in your hands before i could close with you good job kitten and this is the person alberich says is better than he is for a moment elspeth truly did not know what to say in reply finally she managed to think of something that wouldnt get her into trouble do you think i could have kept myself alive for a little while longer she asked at least until help cameand if gwena couldnt get to you in time to help youd be in deeper compost than anyone could be expected to get out of kero told her as she got the remainder of the practice blades and took them over to the wall to rack them and that is all anyone can ask for someone cleared his throat conspicuously and skif emerged from the shadowed entry of the door leading to the outside of the salle excuse me captain he said meekly but if youre through with elspeth the circle and council want to talk to her now kero asked her eyebrows arching dear gods now what elspeth wondered skif looked very odd and unusually subdued well yes sort of he replied uncomfortably i mean theyre meeting now with the queen and they really wanted to talk with her now well they can just give her a moment to sluice herself off kero replied firmly theres no sense in making her show up looking like a shambles kitten she mindspoke in privatemode theres a set of my whites and a kind of wash area in my office youll fit my uniform closely enough i know from experience that its easier facing an official situation ifyou feel as if you look presentable thanks elspeth replied gratefully surprised a little at the mindspeech kero seldom used it except with eldan and her companion having had to conceal the fact that she had the gift for most of her life she was almost as flattered by keros use of it with her as by the captains earlier compliments elspeth darted into the weaponsmasters office before skif had a chance to stop her there was indeed a pump and a deep basin in a little room in the back behind a screen and a stack of thick towels beside it the basin was deep enough for her to duck her head under water and she did so the water fresh from the pump was cold enough to make her yip but it revived her considerably she was toweling off her hair when the promised set of whites appeared over the screen she scrambled into them and discovered as kero had promised they were a close fit i didnt think kero had a set of whitesi thought shed convinced everybody she was never going to wear them well there are times when she plays the uniform game with everyone else not often but ive seen her do it i suppose if she absolutely has to show up as a formal herald this is as good a place to keep her whites as any they were a little loose across the shoulders and tight in the chest but no one was likely to notice and she realized as she wound her wet hair into a knot at the back of her neck that she did feel a little more confident skif was still waiting for her when she trotted out of the office and he didnt look too impatient lets go she said he just nodded and fell into step beside her the two left the building sidebyside setting a brisk pace toward the palace she glanced at him in open inquiry but he avoided her eyes dear gods what is it im supposed to have done she wondered is this over that argument i had with mother about recruiting mages she tightened her jaw stubbornly if it isim not backing down im right i know im right why would they take her to task about that though what was the problem it wasnt as if she was espousing open revolt against the crown on the other hand shed been pressuring selenay to allow her to do the magehunting that might well be the problem some of the councilors considered her to be impetuous and sometimes hotheaded maybe they figure i intend to go riding out of here anyway with or without permission now that was a stupid idea if thats what they were thinking not that i hadnt considered it if i could get gwena to go along with it but i didnt think about it for more than a couple of heartbeats really it was a stupid idea the only way i could get a decent mage to go along with this would be if i had official blessingand how would i have gotten that by running off on my own but while she had been thinking about that would anyone have eavesdropped on her she didnt think so but if they hadshe stifled a slow wave of hot anger no use in getting angry over something that might not have happened but if it hassomeone is going to pay they kept her cooling her heels for some time before finally letting her into the council chamber skif left her at the door and disappeared leaving her no one to question and being kept there did not help her smoldering temper any but after she had waited impatiently for what seemed like hours she heard footsteps coming down the hall leading to the council chamber she turned to see the rest of the council approachingand at that point the door to the council chamber opened and they all filed in to take their places elspeth no longer felt quite so annoyed at being dragged off to see the circle then left in the hall though it would have been nice if someone had bothered to tell her they were waiting for the other council members to arrive she took her seat with the rest casting covert glances at the faces of those councilors who were also in the heraldic circle teren who had taken elcarths place as dean of the collegium the seneschals herald kyril the lord marshals herald griffon the queens own herald talia selenay and prince daren their expressions didnt tell her much their faces were tightly controlled that in itself was something it meant they were worried and since there was a whiteclad herald with the silverarrow insignia of the special messenger sitting on the extra chair reserved for guests and petitioners chances were slim that the circle and council were going to take elspeth to task for her notions she relaxed and sat back a little into the familiar bulk of her council seat so this is just council business after all if the others hadnt looked so serious shed have chuckled at herself see elspeth the world doesnt revolve around you selenay rose when the others had settled themselves this messenger arrived from the eastern border earlier this afternoon from shallan one of heraldcaptain kerowyns lieutenants she had ordered this messenger to come to me first before reporting to his captain elspeth stifled a smile theres one in the eye for anyone who still wonders where keros loyalties lie or the skybolts for that matter since the circle was in session and since i understood that his message was fairly urgent i had him brought here after hearing what his message was i decided to call an emergency council meeting she nodded at the messenger as she sat down herald selwin the floor is yours the messenger cleared his throatthough not selfconsciously elspeth notedand stood i think most of you know that the eastern border is considered a sensitive enough area for messengers to be posted at garrisons full time my current post is the town garrisoned by kerowyns skybolts now what you probably dont know is that the skybolts havewith the queens knowledge and permissionbeen engaging in someahcovert activities he flushed a little and elspeth raised a surprised eyebrow some of the other councilors muttered a little and one of them stood up lady kester speaker for the west just what do you mean by covert activities she asked sharply looking a great deal like a horse who is about to refuse a jump well herald selwin glanced at the queen who shook her head imperceptibly some of themi cant talk about im sure youll understandthe queen and the consort both know every move but its very much a situation where the fewer who know the better i trust the situation that brought you here is something you can talk about the woman said dryly uhyes of course selwin quickly regained his aplomb weve been smuggling people and information out of hardorn anduhsupplies in one of the people we just smuggled out was not just one of ancars farmers who has been pressed too far this was an escaping prisoner we huh that means selwins involved too hes not just a messenger elspeth glanced around the table from the looks of speculation she suspected that this had not come entirely as a surprise this wasnt an ordinary prisoner either selwin continued he had been one of the undersecretaries in ancars officer corps this time murmurs of surprise met the statement he held the same position under ancars father and the reason he was never replaced like so many were is that he is so ordinary as to be invisible he saysand weve truthspelled him so we believe himthat he didnt know what was going on until recently elspeth was very skeptical of that statement until selwin finished describing the former prisoner then she could believe it lieutenant rojer klinseinem was exactly the kind of focused obsessive individual their own seneschal and lord marshal prayed to see come into their secretarial corps his life was in his accounting books he never left his office except to eat and sleep and he truly never thought about what those figures he toted up daily meant until ancars excesses among his people began to affect even him he found officers and court officials he had known all his life vanishing without a trace he discovered friends neighbors even children in the street avoiding him when he wore his uniform then he noted some odd discrepancies in his accounts one of his duties was to take care of the prison accounts the number of prisoners in the cells had gone up substantially but the amount of money allotted for their maintenance had not increased in the corresponding amounts furthermore the names of those imprisoned changed sometimes weekly for all his shortsightedness he was an ethical man and all these things worried him so he decided to investigate them himself an investigation that led him eventually to the prisons and the barracks rooms then the kings own dungeons what he discovered horrified him then one of the kings sorcerers caught him hed had the sense to keep his mouth shut about most of what hed learned and because he was so completely ordinary with no record of ever thinking for himself he was actually put under house arrest until he could be questioned by someone they called the truthfinder general he didnt wait to discover who or what that was he got out a back window stole a horse and fled toward valdemar he remembered the old days the days of friendship with valdemar and its queen and he was no longer inclined to believe the official stories about the cause of the hostilities between valdemar and hardorn he fled toward a hopedfor sanctuary with the hounds on his heels i wont go into all the details selwin said you can question him yourself when we bring him here right now hes not up to much traveling elspeth nodded grimly nothing rojer said would surprise her not after some of keros storiesand not after what had happened to talia whats important at the moment is that he learned where the prisoners were vanishing to theyre being used as sacrifices in bloodritesand there are more of them dying every week ancar is bringing in mages lots of mages and those he is not buying outright or coercing hes making alliances with rojer says that ancars longrange plans include another major war with valdemar and this one is going to include those mages as a major part rather than in a support capacity the one that caught him boasts that not even a god would be able to hold defenses against all the mages ancar is gathering now the muttering around the council table grew louder and there were distinct undertones of alarm thats not all selwin said over the voices the councilors quieted and some looked at him with real fear in their eyes right after we got rojer out there was an attack on the skybolts garrison town a magical attack and it got across the border past the protections why asked the lord patriarchfather ricard who had replaced elderly father aldon at the same time the lord marshal asked how why should be fairly obvious prince daren said the first time hed spoken since the meeting began they knew we had rojer and they felt what he had to tell us was important enough to try to silence him selwin nodded precisely your highness he replied as for how i presume the mage managed to overcome the borderprotections somehow i saw the attack at first i thought it was some kind of mist and i didnt think it looked all that dangerous but lieutenant shallan said the skybolts had seen this sort of thing before and got us all evacuated she said they had something to take care of it but it would only work at a distance the mist turned out to be a swarm of tiny insects no bigger than gnats but poisonous enough to drop a man and they were guided theres no doubt of that they came out of a kind of hole in the sky he shook his head i really cant properly describe it but the hole appeared near the outskirts of town inside the valdemar border these insects the seneschal asked are they gone now not gone my lord selwin replied dead the skybolts as i said have seen this kind of weapon before they evacuated the town then used small catapults to lob pots of burning herbs into the streets the insects were killed so completely that there were none to follow us and few to return when the hole in the sky reopened he sat down again when no one else had any more questions prince daren stood up in his place this is not going to be the last attempt my lords and ladies he said grimly i think we can count ourselves fortunate that it was the skybolts who encountered this first if it had not beenif it had been a regular garrisonthey would have died to a man and we would never have known what it was that killed them prince daren sat down and took his wifes hand selenay looked very pale i must admit she said that i doubted when kerowyn and my daughter swore that ancar would find a way to penetrate our border with magic i was wrong selenay looked over at elspeth and bit her lip my daughter also proposed a solution that i rejected out of hand she suggested that valdemar seek out magical allies as well and find some mage who was strong enough to pass our borders to help us from within and perhaps even teach new mages she suggested that since the chronicles all speak of amagegift that there may still be heralds carrying that gift she thinks that gift has simply gone unrecognized and untaught because there was no one to teach it she also suggested that she be the one to leave valdemar find such a mage and bring himor herback to us silence met her words as the councilors turned looks of doubt toward elspeths end of the table she did her best to look as mature and competentand confidentas any of them could have wished she was very glad now that kero had insisted she wash and change before the meeting she doubted she would have been able to convince any of them looking like a disheveled hoyden may i speak she asked at selenays nod she stood up always speak to the council from a standing position kitten kero had tutored her a few weeks ago after watching one of the sessions from the visitors seat the council had wanted a report on what the skybolts had been assigned toand now elspeth knew why kero had been fairly reticent but what the council didnt realize was that kero had learned more about them than they had from her the captain had made careful assessments of the council and their reactions to elspeth and had some fairly shrewd observations to make afterward always speak to them from a standing position that will put your head higher than theirs and give you an emotional advantage put your hands on the table and lean forward a little showing your hands tells their guts that you have nothing to hide leaning says that you are comfortable with your power and leaning forward tells them that you are earnest never raise your voice in fact if you can speak a little lower than usual that tells their guts that youre not just an emotional female but if you feel passionately about something choose your words carefully and put some punch behind them talia and selenay did all these things but they did them without thinking without knowing the reasons why they worked talia analyzed the audience through her gift of empathy and adjusted herself accordingly all without ever thinking about it selenay had been trained by her fatherwho may have known why his advice worked but didnt bother to explain it to his daughter kerowyn on the other hand had to fight her way up to the top in a predominantly male professionand she was a superb tactician in any arena she knew how to deal with authority figures and why the tactics she used worked elspeth tried to keep all her advice in mind as she began heraldcaptain kerowyn and i have had several conversations about this eventuality she said quietly that in itself is unusual because until now it seems as if it has been very difficult even to speak about magic within the bounds of our realm especially for heralds please think back think about what has happened every time in the past that youve spoken about magic in this council roomyouve gone outside these walls and gradually forgotten all about it havent you she looked around and got slow nods from most of the councilors somehow as urgent as the threat seemed to be it became less urgent once the immediate danger was over didnt it it did for me too until i met kerowyn i suspect that forgetting may be a symptom of whatever it is that has protected us until now but nowif youll notice were speaking about magic all of us and i dont think were going to forget about it outside the room and i am terribly afraid that this is a symptom of something elsea symptom of the fact that this protection is weakening a swift intake of breath was the only sound that broke the silence following her words but she couldnt tell who it was that had gasped she glanced around the horseshoeshaped table several of the councilors were nodding though not happily she continued i dont think we have a choice i believe we must find a mage or mages to help us i have several reasons why i think that the person who goes to look for one should be me she paused again waiting for opposition but she didnt see anyone leaping to hisor herfeet to object a herald must be the person we send to find us a mageor mages that is because only a herald is likely to be able to weigh the motives of those we consider and find a person of sufficient ethics to do us any good as to my qualifications first of all my rank is such that im not likely to encounter anyone who doubts my ability to negotiate now talia is the queens own but she also has a small child i think it would be unreasonable to ask her to leave him for an indefinite length of time and there is a very sinister reason for her to avoid taking him with her if someone captured her child jemmie could be held to be used against her emphatic nods around the table gave her confidence to continue as you know ancar has made an assassination attempt on me i think he will find it harderas kero would sayto hit a moving target there may be other heralds who have sufficient rank to be able to negotiate but of all of them only kero and i seem to be able to even speak of magic clearly much less assess the capabilities of a mage and kero was a mercenaryfrankly the kind of mage we are looking for may hold that against her she spread her hands and shrugged the answer seems obvious to me and if i may be so blunt as to say so i am expendable mother has the twins either of whom can easily succeed me as heir she sat down carefully and then the uproar began elspeth had a pounding headache before it was over and the arguments went on long past dinnertime and well into the night servants were sent out for cold meat cheese and other provisions then called in again to light the lamps because of the nature of the arguments young heraldic trainees in their final year were brought in to serve at the table and keep a steady supply of tea and other nonintoxicating drinks on hand this was not the longest council session on record but it was certainly right up with the record holders and elspeth was right in the middle of it all half the time the councilors went at her like a horde of interrogators shouting questions each one trying to make himself heard over the rest the rest of the time they acted as if she werent even there arguing about her and her competence at the tops of their lungs talia spared her a sympathetic glance or two but she had her own hands full and besides this was elspeths fight it was up to her to win it no one else was as convinced of her mission as she was and her mother was still dead set against it so she fought by herself grimly determined that she would win no matter how long it took she did notice something odd however every time it looked as though one of the heralds would say something against her decisionhe or she would freeze for a moment sometimes in midsentence and then fall silent heralds often did that when their companions were speaking to them but elspeth had never seen it happen so many timesor so abruptly it was almost as if the companions were arguing on her behalf against their chosens better judgment elspeth even caught her mother in that momentary listening pose shortly before midnight the council was finally in reluctant agreement elspeth could go in fact must go she had succeeded she and selwin in persuading everyone of the urgency of the situation she had persuaded even her mother that she was the only person with the right combination of talents and credentials to successfully carry it off however her route and ultimate destination would be watched over at least inside valdemar and she would not go alone you cant possibly go without an escort the lord marshal said firmly i would saytwenty armed at the least thirty said the seneschal over her squawk of outrage no less than that absolutely lady cathan of the guilds seconded anything less would be inappropriate im trying to track down mages she thought in exasperation im trying to find people who are notoriously shy and they want me to bring an entire army with me but she didnt say that instead she waited while the councilors argued about the size of her escort building it up until it did resemble a small army then entered into the affray again when she thought she had a chance of being heard over the din impossible she said clearly all heads turned in her direction absolutely impossible she repeated just as firmly youre asking me to haul an entire armed force along with me im trying to make speedand i doubt if you could find fifty fighters with beasts able to keep up with a companion even among the skybolts i may have to leave rethwellan and the presence of a troop like that could greatly offend the rulers of other countries that i might find myself in but most importantly of all insofar as my movements remaining a secret from ancar you might just as well post him a message every day telling him where im going because thats how visible id be with that many armed fighters around me that brought all the arguments to a dead silence the lord marshal actually looked sheepish now she continued reasonably if you really want to make a big fat target out of me i wish youd tell me there are easier ways to get rid of me oh come now replied lord palinor the seneschal wearing a superior expression that made her want to bite something surely thats an exaggeration is it she asked raising one eyebrow but otherwise keeping her expression sweetly innocent you just heard a description of something that could have destroyed an entire garrisona weapon ancar deployed inside our borders and without having to come within sight of valdemar protected valdemar whats likely to happen if he knows my every movement outside our borders she chuckled dryly kind of negates the benefit of being a moving target id say silence for a moment while they thought that one over well said prince daren what do you want to do my preference is to go alone she admitted basically im safest if no one else knows where i am but the prince shook his handsome head no he said with a touch of regret if it were anyone else that wouldnt be a problembut not you you may think youre expendable but youre still the heir right now you cant go running off the face of the earth all alone and there is one argument that applies to talia that also applies to you if you were taken you could be used as a hostage as well elspeth sighed but nodded in agreement thats true stepfather i admit that i hadnt thought too much of thatbut frankly between gwena and myself i dont think we could be taken by anything but a small army theres always treachery daren said firmly youll have to take at least one other person with you and personally i would suggest a herald someone responsible capable said father ricard crafty and clever said talia fine she agreedand then before they could engage in a tilldawn debate on exactly who she could take with her said but its going to be skif or no one there is no one in the entire heraldic circle who is better suited to watching my back she expected an explosion of argument after all given the fuss there had been over the rumors started simply by being in skifs company the councilors should one and all roundly denounce such a notion and after they argued themselves into exhaustion she just might be able to talk the council into letting her have her own way and going out alone fine selenay said instantly skif is perfect hes everything we could ask responsible capable clever crafty lord palinor laughed aye and tricky the young devil ancar wouldnt catch him napping id wager and while elspeth gawked caught entirely flatfooted with surprise every single one of the councilors agreed to the choice she would have bet money they thought unsuitable before she quite realized what was happening they approved her authority as negotiator for the crown approved her escort and closed the session and began filing out heading straight for their beds while she stared at them dumbfounded talia even patted her on the shoulder as she left whispering good choice kitten i think it was the only thing that could have convinced them finally she was alone in the council chamber sitting back in her seat still wondering what on earth had happenedstaring at the guttering candle and wondering just who exactly had been outmaneuvered chapter six darkwind council meetings endless dithering about nothing while we guardians dance with death out there on the border and no help for us either if i could get anyone else to do this id give up the council seat in a heartbeat darkwind pushed aside a tangle of vines covered with blue trumpetshaped flowers and restrained himself from pulling the whole curtain of vegetation down in a fit of anger it had been daysweekssince his confrontations with his father and the council demanding that they do something about the situation of the clan of the scouts and what had they done nothing or rather they had taken it under advisement they would weigh all the possible options they were studying the problem theyre sitting on their backsides afraid to do anything thats whats really going on father wont let them act because hes afraid of what it will do to the heartstone and they still wont go outside ksheyna for help not that he had really expected anything else after the way starblade had treated him really when it came to anything important especially where magic was concerned the entire council spoke with starblades ill have to start considering those other plans of dawnfires using the hertasi and some of the others theyve left us no choice if were going to guard them effectively well have to use whatever allies we have and he didnt particularly care if pulling the hertasi away from their other duties left some of those jobs undone so what if the vale got a little more overgrown it didnt look to him as if it would make much difference and maybe if some of the elders had to suffer a little if their ekele went unrepaired and their gardens untended because the hertasi were out helping keep their vale saferwell maybe then theyd notice that there was something wrong with their little world and maybe theyd decide that it might be a good idea to try and fix what was wrong i hope but im not going to count on anything like sense out of them he took the shortest possible route to the pass out of the vale cutting down longneglected paths until he reached the boundary and the shieldwall as he burst through a stand of wildly overgrown flowering bushes he saw vree waiting for him in a tree growing just outside the magebarrier the gyre preferred not to enter the vale itself if he could help it many of the other bondbirds demonstrated vrees distaste for the vale proper and tried to stay outside of the shield darkwind wasnt sure if it was because they shared their bondmates dislike of magic or sensed the problems with the heartstone one thing was certain he knew that aversion dated back to the disaster and not before he just wished he could avoid the vale as well the place made him uneasy for all its luxury here near the edge it wasnt so bad the flora were tropical and wildly luxuriant but it was nothing that couldnt be found in a glassedover hothouse but the closer he came to the damaged heartstone the stranger the plants becameand the odder he felt slightly disoriented offbalance lethargic as if something was sapping his energy clouding his thoughts and its not my imagination either he thought stubbornly if vree and the other birds dont like the vale that should tell us all something no matter what father claims what would he know anyway his bondbird is that damned crowhardly bred out of the wild line and it might as well be a metal simulacrum for all the intelligence it shows it does what he tells it to it doesnt talk to the other birds at all and most of the time it sits on its perch in the corner of the ekele like some kind of art object he passed through the barriera brief tingling on the surface of his skinand emerged into the real world again already he felt lighter freer and it seemed to him as he walked out on the path taking deep breaths of the pinescented air that even his footfalls were more confident no cloying flowerscents no heavy humidityjust an honest summer breeze no one to answer to out here no one questioning his judgment unless it really needed to be called into question vree he mindcalled the gyre suddenly anxious to feel the birds familiar weight on his shoulder vree obliged him by sweeping down out of the top of the nearest pine landing on his leathercovered wrist with a thunder of pinions and stepping happily from there to his favorite perch on the padded shoulder of darkwinds jacket dont like vale the falcon complained too hot too empty feels bad dont like crow stupid crow dont go back he sent agreement tinged with regret i have to featherhead but you dont have to go in if you dont want to and i dont have to go back for a while the bird crooned a little and preened a beakful of darkwinds hair as the scout laughed softly feeling considerably more cheerful now that he was outside the vale and wouldnt have to face another council meeting for days darkwind returned the birds affectionate caress scratching the breast and working his fingers up to the headfeathers vree made a happy chuckling sound and bent to have his head scratched a little more sybarite darkwind said laughing feels good the bird agreed scratch report featherhead he told the gyre or no more scratches vree actually heaved a sigh and reluctantly complied the bondbirds had some limited abilities at relaying and reporting messages while darkwind was in the vale he depended on vree to keep in contact with the rest of the scouts under his command vree had messages from most of the scouts all those who had not reported in person before darkwind went to the council meeting this afternoon most of the messages were simple enough even by vrees standards nothing to report all quiet all is well a normal enough day hed been half expecting that something disastrous would happen while he was out of touch but it seemed that all the scouts had things well in hand all except for the handful of scouts who shared the southern boundary with him those sent back messages that there were problems three of them said that they had turned their watch over to the nightscouts and would meet him at his ekele to make their reports in person vree could not imitate the emotional overtones of those mindsent messages relayed through their birds to vree but the terse quality did not auger well he swore silently to himself the last time hed had to take reports in person he and the rest of the scouts had faced a weeklong incursion of magicallytwisted creatures that ultimately cost them two scouts and the only mage who had deigned to work with them that had been shortly after hed joined the scouts and before they made him their spokesperson he could only hope that if this was the situation they faced again they were sufficiently aware of the problems now to deal with it without more losses home vree asked hopefully when hed finished listening to the last of those messages yes he confirmed to the birds delight meet me there he let vree hop back down to his wrist and tossed the heavy gyre into the air vree pushed off and flapped upward driving himself up through the branches with thunderous wingclaps darkwind waited until he had disappeared then started off through the forest at a trotnot on one of the usual paths but on a gametrailheading for his ekele he never took the same route twice he never approached his ekele the same way while he ran as silently as only a tayledras scout could he kept his mind as well as his other senses open constantly on the alert for traces of thought that were out of the ordinary for the scent of something odd for a color or texture where it didnt belong or movement or the sound of a footfall in the forest beyond him other scouts had not been that cautious rainwind hadnt hed been ambushed halfway between the vale and his ekele after a long soak in one of the springs hed been lucky his bondbird had spotted one of the ambushers first so he had only had to deal with one enemy the creatures had not sported the kind of poisoned fangs and claws so many others had and hed escaped with only a permanent limp from a lacerated thigh others had not been so fortunate they had been just as careless and had paid for it with limbs or lives that was the cost of living outside the vale no single tayledras could hope to shield more than his ekele even if he were an adeptclass mage since most of the scouts werent they paid the price of freedom in personal safety but anyone who lived out here felt it was worth that cost there were too many other things that were bad about living in the vale these days it was good to have a little distance from the heartstone and space between themselves and the mages the run stirred up his blood and made him feel a little readier to face whatever trouble was coming he felt the presence of the other scouts long before they knew he was there out of courtesy they had not climbed to his ekele while he was not in it instead they waited below patiently while vree perched above impatiently hungry vree complained as soon as his keen eyes spotted darkwind approaching the three scouts waiting caught the edge of the mindsent plaint and he felt their attention turning toward him little brushes of thought as they each tested for him and found him with their individual gifts they waited until he came into view though before tendering some very subdued greetings and not the usual zhaihelleva either winterlight and stormcloud only raised their hands in a kind of sketchy salute and dawnfire tendered him a featherlight mental caress a promise of things to come but also carrying overtones of deep concern this did not indicate good news at all he signaled to vree who swooped down and landed on one of the lower branches although he could not see the bird hidden as he was by growth he knew what vree was up to the gyre sidled along the branch to the trunk and pulled a strap on the hook holding his rope ladder out of reach the ladder dropped down to the ground with a clattering of wooden rungs darkwind motioned the others to precede him and followed after with the strap that was attached to the end of the ladder tucked into his belt the others were far above him on the ladder he had to go slowly as he was bringing the end of it up with him they were already hidden in the branches when he was only halfway up his ekele like those of the other scouts was actually more elaborate than any of those inside the vale it had to be it had to withstand winter winds and summer downpours snow and hail and the occasional visit from some of the distinctly hostile creatures from the outlands at last after penetrating the growth of the first boughs he reached the place where the ladderrelease was fastened to the bark of the trunk he hooked the end of the ladder back in place and followed his guests up through the trapdoor in the floor of the first chamber of the ekele the tree holding his home was an amazing forest giant but it was nothing like the trees that supported a halfdozen ekele apiece back in the vale like them though it was a huge conifer with a girth more than ten men could span with outstretched arms and an arrowstraight trunk that towered without a single branching up for several manheights above the forest floor the first branches concealed his ladder his ekele began well sheltered another manheight above that he pulled himself up onto the floor closed and locked the trapdoor then went to the glazed window of the first chamber unlocked the latch at the side and held it open for vree the forestgyre dove through it in a rush landing on his outstretched arm then hopped to his shoulder darkwind shut the window and relatched it then turned to climb the stairs to join his guests the entire ekele was built of light strong wood stained on the outside to resemble the bark of the tree but polished to a warm gold within the first chamber was nothing more than a single barren room meant to buffer the effects of the wind coming up from below there were allweather coats hung on pegs on the wall some climbingtools and weapons but that was all the other scouts had already gone ahead of him following a staircase built into the side of the trunk a stair that spiraled up to the next chamber each chamber was built upon the one below it in a snailshellspiral pattern using the huge branches as supports for the floor the next chamber was one commonly used for the gathering of friends it was considerably larger than the entrance chamber and covered an arc fully onethird of the circumference of the trunk heated in winter by a clever ceramic stove that he also used for cooking it supplied warm air to the two chambers above it one of those was a sleeping room the other a storeroom and study to bathe he had to descend to the ground as soon as his head and shoulders had cleared the doorsillif one could rightly call an entrance that was placed in the floor a doorvree hopped off his shoulder and bounced sideways toward his perch in the ungainly sidling motion of any raptor on the ground the floor and wallmounted perch was a permanent fixture of the room placed in the corner where it could be braced against two of the walls and near one of the windows vree leapt up onto it roused his feathers and yawned waiting for his dinner aside from the perch and the stove the only other permanent features of the room were the low platforms affixed to the floor those platforms upholstered in flat cushions now hosted the three scouts winterlight stormcloud and dawnfire three of the best if they have problem its not from incompetence winterlight was the oldest of all of them he had held the position of councilspeaker and elder but had given it to darkwind with grateful relief when the others suggested him now i know why he gave it up id gladly give it back he seldom dyed his hair longer than his waist he generally kept the snowwhite fall in a single braid as thick as his own wrist winterlight was actually starblades elder by several years but was of such a solitary nature that he had lived outside the vale for most of his life he was also unusual in that he flew two bondbirds a snoweagle lyer by day a tufteared owl huur by night both birds had mated and although the mates had not bonded to the scout they provided extra security for winterlights ekele nesting near each other in a rare show of interspecies tolerance for given the chance owls and eagles would readily hunt and even kill one another huur and lyers offspring had been in high demand as bondbirds had beenbut the reduced population and the absolute dearth of children meant that this years crop of nestlings would probably go unbonded and fly off to some other clan to seek mates unless one of the scouts chose to bond to a second bird or lost his bird before the eyases fledged and became passagers darkwind had briefly toyed with the notion of bonding to an owlet but vree had displayed a great deal of jealousy at the idea and he had discarded it albeit regretfully stormcloud might have been a mage but as a child his gift was not deemed enough by starblade and the other adepts and now he refused to enter training at all his argument using their own words against them in a direct quote was its better to have a firstquality scout than a secondclass mage and i dont blame you old friend no matter what father says about ingratitude and insolence id have said and done the same as you he was darkwinds oldest and best friend their friendship dating back to when they were both barely able to walk his features differed from the aquiline tayledras norm considerably with a round chin and a snubbed nose he alone among ksheyna cut his hair short with a stiff jaylike crest he flew a white raven krawn that was as loquacious as starblades crow was silent krawn was easily the brightest of all the corbies flown in ksheyna and very fond of practical jokes as was stormcloud it was a measure of how serious the situation among the scouts was that neither krawn nor his bondmate had played any of their famous jokes for months dawnfire flew a redshouldered hawk kyrr a bird as gracefuland as soughtafter for matingas her bondmate dawnfire cast darkwind a look full of promise as he entered the room and he marveled that he of all the scouts had captured her fancy she typified the opposite end of the extreme from stormcloud in her the aquiline tayledras features had been refined to the point that she resembled the elfin tervardi the lovely flightless birdpeople she often worked with that was her strongest gift she mindspoke the nonhuman races with an ease the others could only envy and communicated equally well with animals of all sorts her hair now bound tightly into three braids was as long as winterlights when she let it down an errant beam of light reflected from the snowgoose lanterns touched her head giving her an air of the unearthly as darkwind watched her that light was provided during the day by four windows all of which could be opened that were glazed with a flexible substance as clear as the finest glass but nearly impossible to break tayledras artisans created it how darkwind had no idea but it was as impervious to wind and weather as it was to breakage by night the light came from darkwinds single concession to magic magelights captured in the lanterns that began glowing as dusk fell and increased their pure light as the external sunlight faded darkwind dug into his gamepouch as soon as his feet touched the floor of the room vree had waited long enough he came up with a half rabbit a light meal by vrees standards but enough to hold him until the discussion was over vree looked up at him with an expression of inquiry when presented with the rabbit the bird said reminding darkwind of his hunger more later he promised the bird i have a duck waiting for you vree chirped a happy acknowledgment and began tearing the meat from the bones gulping it down as fast as he could one thing the bondbirds were not and that was dainty eaters so he said leaving vree to his snack and sitting crosslegged on one of the couches whats the problem the barrierzone said winterlight succinctly his hands resting palmdown on his knees a deceptively tranquil pose weve got some real problems on the south things moving in things and people and we dont like the look of either theyre coming in from that bad patch of outland and it looks like theyre settling theyre making dens lairs and fortified homes i dont like it darkwind its got a bad feel to it these creatures arent overtly evil but they make the back of my neck crawl theyre inside the old ksheyna boundaries now and not just in the old barren zone you know how one bird will crowd another getting closer and closer until the other one either has to peck back or be forced off a perch thats what it feels like theyre doing to us ive got the same stormcloud told him wearing a slight frown and ive got enough magegift to read some other things as well theres a new node thats being established just off my area and a lot of leylines have been diverted to feed it theres a new line going off that node tooand its feeding straight into outland territory into one of the places we know that adept has made his own its bad darkwind its feeding him a lot of power and anyone that can divert lines is damned good hes pulled some of the lines away from us completely and ive caught him trying to read the vale for power too i think he might be planning to use one of the lines to tap into the vale itself darkwind frowned this is a new tactic for him isnt it hes never stolen power before that i can recall exactly stormcloud said and bit his lip i dont like it darkwind and i like it even less that our own mages havent sensed him doing anything unless that was what this meeting you had to attend was all about darkwind shook his head no at least that wasnt on the agenda so unless theyre keeping it from meand they could be ill admitthey havent noticed either the new node or the diversion of the leylines winterlight snorted his contempt you could probably start a magewar out here and theyd never notice inside the vale theyre lost in their own little dream of whatwasonce even if they were alert the heartstone just blanks out everything thats not in there with them darkwinds frown deepened a trifle that was not the way it was supposed to be the heartstone was supposed to sensitize the mages to what was going on with energies outside the vale not destroy or bury their sensitivity but he realized that winterlight was right that was another of the side effects he disliked about being inside the vale when he was within the shieldarea it was as if he had been cut off from the energyflows outside no one had said anything about that not even right after the heartstone shatteredwhich meant either that the effect was new another developing side effect of living next to the broken stone or its been that way since the disaster and nobody noticed which is worse dawnfire had been silent up until now he turned toward her and raised an eyebrow well she said with a frown that matched his own stormcloud is the one who knows energies and winterlights huur is absolutely the best at spying so ill just say that i think the same things have been happening in my area but id like someone to check to be sure what i have that they dont is a network of allied species acting as my informantshertasi dyheli tervardi and a few humans who arent fond of civilization most of the humans are a little crazy but theyre sharp enough when it comes to noticing whats going on around them darkwind nodded dawnfire was the one who had suggested taking volunteers among the nonhumans in the first place and she had proved the idea was viable by establishing a network outside the ksheyna boundaries well some of my informants are missing she said some of her distress coming through despite her best efforts to control it and when i sent someone to try and find them there was nothing they havent just disappeared theyve gone without a trace that wouldnt be too hard to do with dyheli but hertasi have real homesthey actually build furnishings for their caves and hollow treesand tervardi build ekele and even those are gone its as if they never existed at all gone darkwind repeated how could anyone make a tree vanish dawnfire shook her head i dont knowthough the trees themselves dont vanish just the hollows and ekele but the caves do vanish theres solid earth and rock where the cave used to be at least thats what my bird tells me winterlight frowned could that be illusion it could she acknowledged with a nod kyrr cant tell illusion from the real thing and shes not particularly sensitive to magic i wasnt about to ask her to test it but my tervardi and hertasi arent mages either so they wouldnt have used illusion to conceal their homes something took them then covered its tracks by making it look as if there had never been anything living there who why and how stormcloud asked succinctly there is an adept out there but again this isnt like anything hes ever done before said winterlight that we know of darkwind added he might have decided to change his tactics and it might not be himor herat all it might be another adept entirelywhy is another good question why take them at all and why try to make it look as if they never existed to confuse us stormcloud asked facetiously and make us think were crazy why not was dawnfires unexpected reply as she sat straight up with a look of keen speculation on her face he has to know how badly the heartstone has been affecting us if we were only in sporadic contact with those particular creatures erasing their very existence might make us uneasy about our own sanity winterlight nodded slowly as if what she had said had struck a note with him too a good point but the question is what are we going to do about it about losing neutral territorytheres not much we can do darkwind sighed we could make it uncomfortable for the things moving in i suppose uncomfortable enough that they might move back without our having to force a confrontation we havent the manpower to meet like some really nasty practical jokes for the first time in the meeting stormclouds eyes lit up krawn and i could take care of that now that its summer there are a lot of things we can do to make them miserable as long as we have your permission he grinned evilly i know where there are some lovely firewasp nests and krawn can bring in absolute swarms of other corbies they arent going to be able to leave anything outside without having it stolen or fouled do it darkwind told him and dont stretch yourself too thin but if you can extend your reach into dawnfires and winterlights areas do so i can stormcloud replied with barely concealed glee the thing about tricks is that theyre more effective if theyre sporadic and unpredictable krawn is going to love this what about the powertheft asked winterlight anxiously we cant do anything about thatas well try to bail water with a basketbut surely someone should ill tell the mages darkwind said but i cant promise anything they might seal off the leaks they might not theres no predicting them these days and my missing creatures dawnfire was giving him that look of pleading he found so hard to resist but there wasnt anything he could do that would satisfy her theyll have to stay missing he said and held up his hand to forestall a protest i know i know its not right but we havent enough guardians to spare to send even one into the neutral territory to find out what happened to them and protect the rest if your gryphon friends were the ones missing she said her eyes sparking with momentary anger would you still be saying that yes i would he replied if they had nested outside our boundaries and even then well anything treyvan and hydona couldnt take care of themselves i rather doubt we could handle but i promise this much if you and kyrr can catch our predator in the act well see what can be done to save whoever hes after and if we can catch him in the act we may have a chance at figuring out a defense for the rest of your friends dawnfire obviously didnt like the answer but she knew as well as he did that it was the only one he could give her anything else he asked stifling a yawn and casting a look at the windows the sky beyond the branches was a glorious scarlet they had spoken until sunset and if the others were to get back to their ekele before dark theyd have to leave soon im going to have to get out on patrol before dawn to make up for stealing a couple of hours of amberwings time so i could go to the blamed meeting so ive got a short night ahead of me i think weve covered everything winterlight said after a moment of silence ill catch up with the others and let them know what weve decided he got up from the couch and started down the stairs stormcloud followed him then paused at the top of the stairs just long enough for a slow wink dawnfire glanced at the windows at the heavy branches standing out blackly against the fire of the sunset are you really that tired she asked she didnt get up from the couch not if youre going to stay a while he replied with a slow smile you havent taken back your feather she said somehow gliding into his arms before he was aware she had moved and i certainly dont want mine back of course ill stay a while the scent of her overlaid with the musky trace of her bird was as intoxicating as trandust and the soft lips she offered to him made his blood heat to nearboiling he lost himself in her their two minds meeting and melding adding to the sensuality of the embrace her hands caressed the small of his back and slid down over his hips his right was buried in her hair at the nape of her neck his left crushed her to him he had just enough wit to remember he still had to pull up his ladder so did she fortunately go secure the door the sunset if i recall correctly is incredible from upstairs she pushed him away he moved down the stairs in a dream the trapdoor was still unlatched he brought the ladder up rung by rung and rehung it latched down the trapdoor and keyed the magelight to a dim blue then he ran up the two flights of stairs to the sleeping room she was waiting clothed only in her loosened hair curled like a white vixen on the dark furs of his bedspread her hair flowing free and trailing behind her like a frozen waterfall she turned a little at his footfall and smiled at him holding out her handand they didnt see a great deal of the sunset brother comes fast said vree then with an overtone of surprise very fast vrees alert interrupted what had been an otherwise completely dull and uneventful patrol along the dry streambed that formed part of the ksheyna border it hadnt always been dryin fact a week ago there had been a stream here evidently not only leylines were being diverted darkwind had not been overly worried when he discovered the condition of the stream the diversion could easily have had perfectly natural causes it could have gone dry for a dozen reasons including the helpful work of beavers but it was one more thing to investigate that was when vrees call alerted him before darkwind had a chance to wonder just what that fast meant he heard the pounding of hooves from uptrail a moment later a dyheli stag plunged over the embankment above him coming to a halt in a clatter of cleft hooves and a shower of sand and gravel the graceful antelopelike creature was panting his flanks covered with sweat his mane sodden with it as dawnfire slid from his back he tossed his golden head with its three spiraling horns and mindspoke darkwind directly cannot run morehelp my brothers then he plunged back into the brush staggering a little from exhaustion as darkwind turned toward his rider what theres a dyheli bachelor herd just outside the boundaries she said her words tumbling over each other with her urgency theyre trapped in a pocket valley one they cant climb out of i dont know what chased them in there or even if they just went in there last night figuring it was a good place to defend in the darkbut theyve been trapped and theyre going mad with fear whoa he stopped the torrent of speech by placing his hand over her lips for a moment take it slowly whats holding them there itsits like a fog bank and it fills the outer end of the valley she replied her voice strained only its bluish and all that goes into it doesnt come out alive darkwind we have to get them out of there you say theyre outside the borders he persisted she nodded her enormous palesilver eyes fixed on his i he hesitated presented with the pleading in her expression i shouldnt its outside it could be a diversion to get several of us out thereit could be an attempt to ambush usbut her eyes persuaded him against his better judgment iall right ashke ill come look at the situation but i cant promise anything it took them a while to reach the spot even with the assistance of two more dyheli from a breeding herd inside ksheyna borders by the time they reached the valley the situation had worsened the fog had crowded all the young dyheli bucks into the back of the valley and they milled around the tiny space in a state of complete unthinking panic trampling everything beneath their churning hooves with horns tossing their squeals of desperation reached to darkwinds perch on the hill above them he studied the situation his heart sinking the sides of the valleyit was really a steep cup among the hills with a spring at the bottomwere rocky and far too steep to bring the dyheli up even if theyd been calm in their current state of panic it was impossible the fog was mageborn that much he could tell easily but the mage himself was not here there was no one to attack and no way to counter such a nebulous menace even calling up a windif he could have done sowould not have dispersed the evil cloud it roiled beneath him a leprous bluewhite thick and oily too murky to see into twice now hed seen young bucks overcome with fear and madness try to break through into the clear air beyond they had never come out on the other side we have to do something dawnfire pleaded he hesitated a moment then gave her the bad news there isnt anything we can do he said closing his mental shields against the tide of fear and despair from below the dyheli were so panicked now that they werent even capable of thinking maybe the rain tonight will disperse it in time to save them no she shouted careless of what might overhear her no we cant leave them im a guardian theyre my responsibility i wont leave them dawnfire he took her shoulders and shook them there isnt anything we can do dont you understand that theyre too panicked to get harnesses on and haul them upeven if we had enough people here to try and i wont call in all the scouts from their patrols its bad enough that i left mine dont you see this could still be a diversion to clear the way for something else to come in over the border while its unguarded she stared at him aghast for a long moment then you coward she spat you wont even try you dont care if they die you dont care what happens to anyone or anything all you care about is yourself you wont even use your magic to save them as the envenomed words flew darkwind kept a tenuous grip on his temper by reminding himself of how young dawnfire was shes only seventeen he told himself she lives and breathes being a guardian and she doesnt understand how to lose she was barely assigned her duties when the heartstone blew she doesnt mean what shes sayingbut as her words grew more and more hurtful and heated in response to his cool silence he finally had enough his temper snapped like a dry twig and he stopped the torrent of abuse with a mental slap and as she stood silent and stunned he folded his arms across his chest and stared at her until she dropped her eyes you say you are a guardian well you pledged an oath to obey me your commander and abide by my decisions have you suddenly turned into a little child regressed to the age of ten when sworn oaths mean only until im tired of playing no he studied her a moment more as she went from red to white and back again in that case i suggest you calm yourself and return to your assigned patrol if you comport yourself well and if you can keep yourself under control i will consider leaving you there rather than nm you elsewhere is that understood yes elder she replied in a voice that sounded stifled very well he said go then chapter seven elspeth elspeth despite the anxious tone of skifs voice elspeth didnt look up from her book what she said absently more to respond and let skif know shed heard him than a real reply she was deep in what was apparently a firsthand description of the moments before vanyels final battle it was then that we saw how the valley walls had been cut away to widen the passage and the floor of the vale had been smoothed into a roadway broad enough for a column of four and all this said vanyel was done by magic i knew not what to think at that moment elspeth dont you think we should be getting out of here skif persisted on the road i mean she looked up from her page and into skifs anxious brown eyes there was no one else to overhear them they were the only ones in the library archives where the oldest chronicles were stored sunlight damaged books so the archive chamber was a windowless room in the center of the library smoke and soot damaged them as well so all lighting was provided by smokeless lanterns burning the finest of lamp oil constructed to extinguish immediately if they tipped over no other form of lighting was permittedcertainly not candles elspeth realized as she looked into skifs anxietyshadowed face that she didnt know what time it was if any of the collegium bells had rung she hadnt noticed them her stomach growled in answer to the halfformed question telling her that it was past lunchtime if nothing else she rubbed her eyes shed been so absorbed in her reading that she hadnt noticed the passage of time why she asked simply whats your hurry he grimaced then shrugged i dont like the idea of riding off south with just the two of us but since you seem so set on iti keep thinking your getting the council to agree was too easy they didnt argue enough not argue enough she replied making a sour face i beg to differ you werent there they argued plenty believe me i thought theyd never stop till they all fell over from old age but not enough he persisted it should have taken weeks to get them to agree to your plan insteadit took less than a day that doesnt make any sense at least not to me i keep thinking theyre going to change their minds at any minute so i want to know why we arent getting out of here before they get a chance to they wont change their minds she said briefly wishing hed let her get back to her researches gwena says so what does a companion have to do with the council changing its mind he demanded thats what i would like to know she thought gwenas playing coy every time i ask i dont know but ask yours i bet she says the same thing huh his eyes unfocused for a moment as he mindspoke his little mare then ill be damned he replied youre right but i still dont see why we arent getting on the road everything we need is packed except for your personal gear i should think youd be so impatient to get out of here that i would be the one holding us back she shrugged lets just say that im getting ready what im doing in here is as important as the packing youve been doing oh he shaded the word in a way that kept it from sounding insulting which it could easily have done its no secret she said gesturing at the piles of books around her im researching magic in the old chronicles magic and heraldmages what they could do and so forth so i know what to look for and what we need if he noticed that some of those chronicles were of a later day than vanyels time he didnt mention it i suppose that makes sense he acknowledged just remember the council could change their decision any time no matter what gwena says ill keep that in mind she replied turning her attention back to her page after a moment skif took the hint she heard him slip out of his chair and leave the room but her mind wasnt on the words in front of her instead she gave thought to how much skifs observations mirrored her own this was too easy there was no reason why the queen should have agreed to this much less the circle and council the excuse of the magical attack on bolton the skybolts deeded border town was just that an excuse she had checked back through the chronicles of the past several years and she had uncovered at least five other instances of magical attacks on border villages all of which looked to her as if they showed a weakening of the borderprotections the records indicated no such panic reaction as shed seen in the council chamber rather that there was a fairly standard way of responding a team of heralds and healers would be sent to the site the people would be aided and removed to somewhere safer if that was their choice then the incident was filed and forgotten farther back than that had been talias encounter with ancar that had signaled the beginning of the conflicts with hardorn there had been long discussions about what to do how to handle the attacks of mages elspeth remembered that perfectly well and there had been some progress the collegium made a concerted effort checking the chronicles following vanyels time to determine how heralds without the magegift could counter magical attacks some solutions had been found the appropriate people were briefed and trainedand that was all the knowledge was part of the schooling in gifts now but there was no particular emphasis placed on it not the way there should have been especially following ancars second attempt at conquest file and forget for that matter there was even some evidence that karse had been using magic under the guise of priestly powers no one had ever followed up on that not even when kero had made a point of reminding the council of it there had to be another reason for letting her go on this quest especially since there were overtones in the council meetings she attended of the brat is getting her way it would have been obvious to anyone with half a mind and one ear that now that the initial excitement was over they regretted giving her their permission to leave even to as safe a destination as bolthaven deep in the heart of her uncles peaceful kingdom even the heralds on the council gave her the unmistakable feeling that they were not happy about this little excursion and theyd gladly use any excuse to take their permission back but they didnt gwena had said repeatedly that they wouldnt there was something going on that they werent talking about and it didnt take a genius to figure out that whatever it was the companions en masse were hockdeep in it and did it have something to do with her growing resistance to this compulsion to forget magic to avoid even thinking about it once her suspicions were aroused elspeth had decided that before she ran off into unknown territory she was going to do a little research on the heraldmages not just to find out their strengths and weaknesses nor to discover just what the limits and gradations of the magegift were but to see just how extensive the apparent prohibition against magic was how deeply rooted and how long it had been going on and what she had learned was quite quite fascinating it dated from vanyels time all rightbut not exactly to be precise it dated from the time that bard stefen then an old and solitary man vanished without a trace in the forest of sorrows at least that was elspeths guess he was supposed to be in the company of some other young unspecified herald on a kind of pilgrimage to the place where vanyel died he never arrived at his destination yet no one reported his death granted he had not yet achieved the kind of legendary status he had in elspeths time but still he was a prominent bard the author of hundreds of songs epic rhymed tales and ballads and the hero of a few of them himself he was vanyels lifebonded lover the last one to see him alive and vanyel did have the status of legend someone would have said something if he had diedat the very least there should have been an impressive bardic funeral no mention no funeral he simply dropped out of sight nor was that all even if he had vanished someone should have noticed that he disappeared surely searches should have been made for him but no one did notice nor did anyone look for him he simply vanished without a trace and no one paid any notice and thatpossibly even that precise momentwas when it became impossible to talk about magic except in the historical sense that was when the chronicles stopped mentioning it when songs stopped being written about it when encounters with it outside the borders of valdemaror occasionally just inside those borderswere forgotten within weeks fortunately those encounters were usually benign as when ambassadors from valdemar would see the mages in the court of rethwellan performing feats to amuse or ambassadors from outside of valdemar would mention magic and some of the things their kingdoms mages could do the chronicler of the time would dutifully note it downthen promptly forget about it so would the members of the counciland the heralds did they attribute all of that to boasting and travelers tales now i wonder if when other people read the chronicles over do their eyes just skip across the relevant words as if they werent even there it wouldnt surprise her elspeth herself had noticed whole pages seeming to blur in front of her eyes so that she had to make a concerted effort to read every word she had initially ascribed the effect to fatigue and the labor of reading the archaic script and faded inks but now she wasnt so sure it had gotten easier the more she had read but she wondered what would happen if she stopped reading for a while then came back to it she had even found a report from selenays grandfather back when he was plain old herald roald and the heir about his encounter with keros grandmother kethry and her partner tarma shena talesedrin a shinain kalenedral sworn to the service of her goddess was plainly some kind of a priest in fact much to roalds surprise she had achieved a physical manifestation of her goddess right before his eyes never having seen a goddess he was rather impressed so would i be hed described the manifestation the impossibly lovely young shinain woman clothed as one of her own swordswornbut with strange eyes with neither pupil nor white just the impression of an endless field of stars brrr i would probably have passed out he and tarma had become quite firm friends after that roalds companion approved of both the priest and her goddess which roald had found vastly amusing but if tarma was a powerful priest kethry was just as clearly a talented and powerful mage roald had quite a bit to say about her it was evident that he was quite smitten with her and if it hadnt been for the fact that she was obviously just as smitten with the rethwellan archivist they had rescued he hinted that he might well have considered a try in that direction a superb tactician however he knew a hopeless situation when he saw one and wisely did not pursue his interest any further it was roalds account of kethrys magical abilities that interested elspeth it was in this account that she got a clearer idea of the differences between journeyman class and master of master and adept that alone was useful since it proved to her that what valdemar needed was indeed an adept more than one if at all possible certainly a teacher there was no reason why the magegift should have vanished from the population of valdemar when it was clearly present elsewhere roald did not have a great deal to say about kethrys magical sword need other than the fact that it was magical with unspecified powers and would only help women so at that point in time the song threes had not migrated up to valdemar or roald would have made certain to mention it interesting about songsas evidence of just how strong that magicprohibition had been elspeth had come across another fascinating bit of information in the bardic chronicles which were also stored here the song kerowyns ride had preceded the arrival of the real kerowyn by several yearsascribed to anonymous which it wasnt several times visiting bards had attempted to set the valdemaran record straight each time the attribution was duly noted then the very next time the song was listed in a court performance it was ascribed to anonymous it was the habit of master bards particularly the teachers to write short dissertations on the meaning and derivation of popular songs to be used as teaching materials out of curiosity elspeth had made a point of looking up the file on kerowyns ride at that point it would have strained the credulity of even a dunce to believe that there was nothing working to suppress the knowledge of magicfor even after the arrival of the real kerowyn master bards were writing essays that claimed it was an allegorical piece wherein the goddessascrone passed her power to the goddessasmaiden at spring solstice she found several other papers stating that it described an actual event that had taken place hundreds of years ago as evidenced by this or that style that was quite enough to get elspeth into more of the bardic chronicles and that was when she discovered corroborating evidence for her theory that something was suppressing the very idea of magic despite the fact that there had been a concerted effort to get the songs about herald mages and magical conflicts back into the common repertory despite the fact that this was bardic collegiums top priorityand despite the fact that perfectly awful maudlin songs like the unkffiable my ladys eyes stayed popularthe magic songs could not be kept in repertory audiences grew bored or wandered away bards forgot the lyrics or found themselves singing lyrics to another song entirely when given a list of the songs for various occasions a seneschal or master of the revels would inexplicably choose any song but the ones describing magic only those songs that did not specifically mention magic or those where the powers described could as easily be ascribed to a traditional gift stayed in popular repertory songs like the sun and shadow ballads or the windrider cycle songs that were hundreds of years older than the vanyel songs and written in archaic language were well knownwas it because not once was there a reference to a specific spell only vague terms like power and curses furthermore elspeth herself had heard the problem songs being sung not once but fairly often and with a great deal of acclaim and success so it wasnt that there was anything wrong with the songs themselves it had to be because of their content and was it possible that the reason the songs had been successful was that they were sung in the presence of many heralds for at seemed to be the common factor it was when they had been sung with no heralds present at all that the worst failures occurred she had learned several other things from the chronicles of vanyels timethings which had no direct bearing on her present mission but which explained a great deal for instance there had been something called the web which demanded the energy and attention of four heraldmages those four apparently had been somehow tied to onequarter of valdemar each and were alerted to anything threatening the kingdom by the reaction of the spell the problem was by the end of queen elspeth the seconds reign there were not enough heraldmages to cover the four quarters not and deal with enemies too that was when vanyel altered the spell tying all heralds into this web so that when danger threatened everyone would know before that it was only chance that a foreseer would bend his will to a particular time and place to see that something would be a problem after it was guaranteed foreseers would see the danger and would know exactly what gifts or actions were required to counter it heralds with those gifts would find themselves in the saddle and heading for the spot whether or not they had been summoned the chronicles were not clear about how he had done this only that it definitely worked and there was a great deal of relief knowing that the kingdom no longer depended on having four powerful heraldmages to act as guardians vanyel had done something else at that time though whether or not it was part of the alterations to this web or not the chronicles were unclear he had summonedsomething or rather he had summoned things having called them he did something to them or with them somehow gave them the job of watching for mages and alerting heraldmages to their presence in valdemar what happened when there werent any more heraldmages she wondered did they just keep watching or what have they been trying to alert heralds or not at least this accounted for something kero had said about why quenten and the rest of the skybolts mages couldnt stay inside valdemar he said it felt like there was someone watching him all the time shed told elspeth like there was someone just behind his shoulder staring at him waking or sleeping said it just about drove him crazy that certainly made a good enough reason for elspeth she didnt think she would want to stick around anywhere that she felt eyes on her all the time unless of course she was a truly powerful mage one able to shield herself against just about anything one that knew she was so much the superior of other mages that she felt totally confident in her ability to hide from the enemy like hulda maybe we still dont know everything she can do weve been assuming she was just ancars teacher and attributing all his success to ancar himself but what if its really hulda letting him think hes in control while she is really the power and the mind behind his actions again that would explain a great deal particularly ancars obsession with eliminating talia selenay and elspeth it could be he simply hated suffering defeat at the hands of women but it also could be hulda egging him on if he felt somehow shamed at being defeated by females she could be playing on that shame making him obsessive about it after all she had very little to lose if ancar was goaded into defeating valdemar she won and if he lost or was killed during the conflictshe would be there to inherit his kingdom and pick up the pieces and hulda would never repeat his mistakesit all made hideous sense a good explanation of otherwise inexplicable behavior and elspeth didnt like the explanation one bit ancar as an enemy was bad enough but the idea of an enemy like hulda who had been plotting for decadesit was enough to send a chill down the toughest of spines it was more than enough to give elspeth nightmares for three nights running elspeth closed the book shed been reading fighting down a queasy sensation in her stomach she had just finished reading the passages in the chronicles about tylendel vanyels first lover his repudiation and his suicide it didnt make for easy reading it had been written not by the chronicler of the time but by a nonherald a healer who had been a friend of tylendel s mentor evidently the heralds had all been affected so strongly by this incident that they were unable to write about it but that was not why she was fighting uneasy feelings tylendelat seventeenhad evidently been able to construct something called a gate or a gate spell which enabled him to literally span distances it would take a companion days or even weeks to cross her blood ran cold at the idea and even though the author had hinted that the mage who used this spell had to know precisely where he was going that fact was no comfort hulda had been to valdemarand it would not be very difficult to insert other agents into valdemar simply to learn appropriate destinations what if ancar were to control this spell what if he were able to get it past the protections there would be no stopping him he would be able to place agents anywhere he chose in facthulda had been in the palace for years there was probably very little she didnt know about the palace she could place an agent in the queens very bedroom if she chose and all the guards in the world would make no difference that might even be how that assassin got onto the palace grounds she shuddered i think im going to have nightmares againthis had not been an easy day for reading elspeth was just as disturbed by the chronicle she had completed before this one the one describing vanyels last battle the heraldmage had commanded tremendous power so tremendous that the author had made an offhand comment to the effect that he could have leveled haven if he so chose granted haven was a smaller city then than it was now butthe power to level a city it simply didnt seem possible destruction on that kind of scale seemed absurd on the face of it yet for the writer such power seemed to be taken for granted at first reading she had been skeptical of such claims chroniclers had been known to indulge in hyperbole before this she had assumed that the descriptions were the embroideries of a frustrated bard a chroniclers version of poetic license but on the second reading she had discovered the signature at the end modestly tucked away in small neat handwriting that matched the rest of the chronicle but not anything else in the book bard stefen for heraldchronicler kyndri now there was no reason for stefen to have invented outrageous powers for his lifebonded there was every reason for him to have been absolutely factual in his account he was not a wouldbe bard like many of the chroniclers he was a bard with all the opportunity to play with words that he wanted outside of the chronicles and everything else in those chronicles had been simple direct without exaggeration so it followed that herald vanyel had that power that ability the ability to level a city and if vanyel had commanded that kind of power there was no reason to suppose that ancar could not ally himself to a mage with that same power sooner or later there probably werent many with that kind of ability but if there was one with the same kind of lust for conquest that drove ancar the king of hardorn would eventually find him elspeth sat for a moment with her head in her hands overwhelmed by a feeling of helplessness how could valdemar possibly stand against the power of a mage like that by finding another like him she finally decided if there is one there have to be more and surely not all of them will find ancars offers attractive and thats exactly what im going to have to do she shook back her hair and pushed her chair away from the bookladen table she was a little surprised by the bulk of her scattered notes shed been so engrossed she hadnt noticed just how much shed been writing down all right she decided ive learned all i can from books now its time to get out there and see how much of it applies to current reality she collected her notes into a neat stack and shoved them into a notebook then she rose stretched and picked up the books restoring them to their proper places on the shelves finally though she had to admit to herself that she wasnt being considerate of the librarians she was putting off the moment of departure she squared her shoulders lifted her head and walked out of the archives with a firm stepshowing a confidence she did not feel not that it really mattered this was her plan and she was by the gods going to see it through and the first step on that road was to go find skif and tell him it was time to leave that she had everything she needed if nothing else she told herself wryly skif will be ready even if im not sure i am skif was ready he had wisely refrained from repeating just how ready he was but he was so visibly impatient that she decided to get on the road immediately instead of waiting for morning she headed back to her room at a trot to throw her personal things into packs while he had the companions saddled and loaded with saddlebags it was after all only a little after noon they could conceivably make quite a bit of progress before they had to stop for the night from the look on his face that was exactly what skif intended she intercepted a young page and sent him around with farewell messages for everyone except her mother and talia those farewells she would make in person mother would never forgive me if i just sent a note she thought ruefully as she stuffed clothing into a pack not that i wouldnt mind just slipping out of here shes bound to raise a fussselenay still was not resigned to the situation elspeth was as sure of that as she was of her own name she had been so involved in her researches that she hadnt spent much time in her mothers company but the few times she had shed been treated to long reproachful looks selenay hadnt said anything but elspeth would have been perfectly happy to avoid any chance of another motherly confrontation she fully intended to plead the need for a hasty departure putting the blame on skif and his impatience if she had to if i can just get this over quicklyjust as she thought that someone tapped on her door she started her heart pounding for a moment then winced as she forced herself to relax she hadnt realized just how keyed up she was a second tap sounded a little impatient dont tell me mothers already found out that im leaving come in she called with a certain resignation but to her surprise it wasnt selenay who answered the invitation it was kero a second surprise the heraldcaptain was carrying a sword need to be precise not wearing it but carrying it the blade was sheathed in a brand new scabbard with an equally new swordbelt both of bluegray leather and before she had a chance to say anything kero thrust the swordsheath belt and allinto her hands here she said gruffly her voice just a little hoarse as if she was keeping back emotions of some kind youre going to need this no pun intended her hands left the sheath reluctantly and it seemed to elspeth as if she was wistfulunwillingly soat parting with the blade for her part elspeth was so dumbfounded she felt like the village idiot unable to think at all coherently im going to whatshes giving methats need its magic she cant mean me to have it whywhat but was all she could say anything else came out as a sputter butwhy why kero shrugged with an indifference that was obviously feigned right after you and i met need spoke for you i couldnt do without her not right then and she hasnt said anything since but theres never been any doubt in my mind that youre the one she was supposed to go to go to elspeth repeated dazedly now that the blade was in her hands she feltsomething an odd feeling a slight disorientation as if there was someone trying such a delicate mental probe on her that it was at the very edge of her ability to sense it it was a little like when shed been chosen only not nearly as strong its something like being chosen i suppose kero said echoing her thought she picks the one she wants to be passed to better that than just getting picked up at random or so id guess though women are the only ones that can use her grandmother got her from an old female merc when she left her mageschool she gave need to me and now im giving her to you youd have gotten her from me in any case eventually but since youre going out past the borders i think it would be a good idea if you take her with you suddenly the blade seemed doubly heavy you mean the sword talks to you elspeth replied vaguely trying to sort out surprise the odd touches at the back of her mind and just a touch of apprehension not exactly talks no kero chuckled though let me warn you now she is going to try and exert a lot of pressure on you to do what she wantswhich is to rescue women in trouble dont give in to her more than you have to shell try two thingsshell either try to take over your body or shell give you a headache like youve never had in your life you can block it and her out i learned to eventually and i should think with all the training youve had in the gifts you should be able to manage just fine after all when i faced her down i was only halftrained at best whatever you do dont give in to her or youll set a bad precedent as bad as giving a troublesome falcon its own way she manipulated my grandmother but i never let her manipulate me if i could help it elspeth regarded the gift dubiously if shes that much trouble oh shes worth it kero said with a rueful chuckle especially for somebody like you or me somebody who doesnt know beans about magic for one thing shell heal you of practically any injury even on the battlefield in the middle of a fight that alone is worth every bit of bother she ever gave me but for the rest of her abilities if youre a swordswinger shell protect you against magicand i mean real protection as good as any adept ive ever seen i had some encounters with some mages of ancars that i havent talked aboutthere wasnt anything any of them threw at me that she couldnt deflect kero chuckled gave them quite a surprise too but your grandmother was a mage elspeth said right if youre a mage she protects you toobut she doesnt do anything for you magically she takes over your body and makes you a good fighter elspeth supplied right but she doesnt do anything for a fighter in the way of fighting ability i think i remember something about your grandmother being a fighter in some of the songs only i knew you said she was a mage elspeth said looking down at the blade in her hands with a touch of awe i never could figure out how the confusion happened from everything ive read becoming a mage takes up so much of your time you couldnt possibly learn to fight well kero shrugged yes and no it really depends on how much you want to curtail your social life if you want to be a celibate you could learn to be both huh like vanyel anyway need makes you a swordmaster if youre a mage protects you from magic if youre a fighter and if you arent either like inkerowyns ride elspeth asked with a sly smile kero groaned yes gods help me like in that damned song if you arent either she takes over and makes you both her way though which tends to make you almost as big a target as one of yourhere i am shoot me uniforms elspeth chuckled kero was as usual not wearing whites then she sobered but you said i can fight the compulsion right kero nodded i did it it takes a little determination if you dont know what youre doing but it can be done i had to threaten to drop the damned thing down the nearest well and ive already told it that youll do the same if it gives you too much trouble seeing elspeths hesitation she added if you dont want it dont draw itit cant force you to take it you know if you dont draw it it wont have any kind of hold on you elspeth wasnt entirely sure of thatnot after the tentative touches in the back of her mind but she was certain that the hold the blade had on her could be fought if she chose to if kero could so could she carefully she weighed all the factors in her mind this was not going to be a decision to make lightly shell have a hold on mebut shell protect me from things i not only dont understand but might not detect until its too late and the healingthats damned important if im hurt i may not be able to get to a healer but i wont have to if i have her not such a bad trade really and since elspeth had already been chosen perhaps the hold would be that much less gwena would surely help fight it she could be very possessive when she wanted to be another good reason to take the blade suddenly occurred to her one that kero might not have thought of if i dont find a mageim a woman and mothers a woman how well would this magic sword work against ancar i wonder given that scenario how could she not in good conscience accept the blade without hesitation she pulled need from her sheath for a moment nothing at all happened thentime stopped a humming somehow joyful gleeful filled the back of her head it is just like being chosen she thought absently as the blade glowed for a moment the fire coalescing into script runes that writhed then settled into something she could actually read womans need calls me as womans need made me she read as her eyes watered from the fiery light her need will i answer as my maker bade me the runes writhed againthen faded the moment she had the sense of them the hum in the back of her mind stilled and time hiccupped then resumed its stately progress what the hell was that supposed to mean she demanded as soon as she could speak again kero shrugged damned if i know she admitted only the gods know her history now grandmother said thats what happens when she gets into the hands she wants but that my dear is the first time shes roused since i brought her inside the borders of valdemar elspeth slid the blade gingerly into her sheath her i doubt ill ever call her it againwhat happens when i take her outside valdemar she asked with trepidation there had been such a feeling of power when need had responded to hera feeling of controlled strength held back the way a mastiff would handle a newborn chick and im not sure i like feeling like a newborn chick i dont know kero admitted she hasnt been outside valdemar for a long time whatever happens youre going to require her of that much im certain but what about you elspeth was forced by her own conscience to ask where does that leave you kero laughed the same as before i havent ever depended on her to bail me out of a tough spot and to tell you the truth i dont think im going to be seeing anything worth being protected against and i am elspeth made that a statement id bet on it kero nodded soberly ill tell you this much while shes given me trouble in the past shes always been worth the having i may not have depended on her but shes bailed me out of things i could never have gotten myself out of alone i feel a lot better knowing you have her i elspeth stopped at a loss for words kero thanks just doesnt seem adequate oh dont thank me thank her kero grinned she picked you after all im thanking you anyway elspeth hugged her sword and all then bade her a reluctant farewell it was hard saying goodbye a lot harder than she thought it would be she stood with the sheathed sword in her hands for a long time after kero was gone finally elspeth buckled the swordbelt over her tunic and wriggled a little to settle needs weight once in place the sword felt right most swords took some getting used to they all weighed differently their balance on the hip or in the hand was different but most swords arent magic the thought was unsettling this was the stuff of which ballads and stories were made and although elspeth had daydreamed herself into a heroine when she was a child shed given up those daydreams once she achieved her whites i thought i had anyway that made for another unsettling thought though stories all had endingsand she was beginning to feel as if the ending to this one was already written as if she had no choice in where she was going or how she was going to get there as if everyone knew what her goal was except her destiny was one word she had always hatedand now it looked as if it was the one word that applied to her and she didnt like the feeling one bit chapter eight darkwind stupid said vree with profound disapproval darkwinds stomach lurched as vree made another swooping divenot quite a stoopskimming through the pocket valley that held the trapped dyheli bucks there were times when the gyres viewpoint was a littleunsettling the gyre wheeled above the dyheli herd just above the highest level of the mist giving darkwind the loan of his keener eyes and the advantage of wings and height stupid stupid we should go not that darkwind needed a bird even a bondbird to tell him that the gentle dyheli huddled together in an exhausted witless knot too spent by panic to do anything sensible through the gyres eyes he looked for anything that might pass as a track out of the valleyand found nothing the spring dropped from a height five times that of the dyheli to the valley floor down a sheer rock face the other two sides of the valley were just as sheer and sandstone to boot nothing short of a miracle was going to get them out of there vrees right we should go i cant risk all of ksheyna for the sake of a dozen dyheli i made pledges i have greater responsibilities so why was he here lying under the cover of a bush just above the mistchoked passage out of the deadend valley searching through his bondbirds eyes for a way out for the tiny herd why was he wasting his time leaving his section of the border unpatrolled tearing up his insides with his own helplessness because im stupid one of the bucks raised a sweatstreaked head to utter a heartbreaking cry of despair his gut twisted a little more and because i cant stand to see them suffering like that theyre fellow creatures as intelligent as we are they looked to dawnfire for protection and help even if they did range outside our boundaries they acted as her eyes and ears out here i cant just abandon them now which was no doubt exactly the way dawnfire felt there was no difference in what he was doing now and what she wanted to do except that im a little older a little more experienced but just as headstrong and stupid the mistwhatever it wasrose and fell with an uneasy wavelike motion and wherever it lapped up on the rock wall it left brown and withered vegetation when it receded and it took quite a bit to kill those tough little rockplants so the mist was deadly to the touch as well as deadly to breathe there was no point in trying to calm the dyheli enough to get them to hold their breath and make a dash for freedom theyd never survive being in the mist for as long as it would take them to blunder through as if to underscore that observation the mist lapped a little higher just below his hiding place a wisp of it eddied up and he got a faint whiff of something that burned his mouth and throat and made his eyes water he coughed it out as the mist ebbed again poisonous and caustic first burns to madden them further then the poison theyre horribly susceptible to poisons theyd probably get fatal doses just through skin contact through the area of the burn no no hope there he rubbed his eyes to clear them and sent vree to perch in the tree over his head another of the dyheli called mournfully and the cry cut into his heart he knuckled his eyes again blinking through burning eyes but still could see no way out of the trap even the springfed waterfall was not big enough to do more than provide a little water spray and a musical trickle down the rocks there was no shelter for even one of the dyheli behind it i cant bear this he decided finally all i could do is shoot them and give them a painless death or leave them and hope that whatever this poison is it disperses on its ownor maybe wont be able to get past the mist that the waterfall is throwing two choices both bad the second promising a worse death than the first his heart smoldered with frustration and anger and he swore and pounded his fist white on the rockhard dirt then wiped the blood off his skinned knuckles no dammit its not fair they depended on tayledras to protect them their has to be somethhe looked back into the valley at the tugging of an invisible current a stirring in the fabrics of power the rest of his thought forgotten a sudden shrwing along his nerves an etching of ice down his backbone that was what warned him of magicmagic that he knew intimately though he no longer danced to its pipingthe movements of energies nearby and working swiftly his fingers moved silently in unconscious response he swung his head a little trying to pinpoint the source therethe mist below him stirred the hair on the back of his neck and arms stood on end and he found himself on his feet on the floor of the valley before the wall of mist with no memory of standing much less climbing down it didnt matter magic coiled and sprang from a point somewhere before him purposeful and guided striking against the mageborn wall of poison the mist writhed as it was attacked stubbornly resisting magic a single spell fought the mist trying to force it to disperse the mist fought back with magic and protections of its own it curdled thickened compacted against the sides and floor of the valley flowing a little farther toward the dyheli the spell changed power speared through the mist cutting it lancelike a clear spot appeared a kind of tunnel in the cloud the mist fought again but not as successfully this time darkwind felt it all felt the conflicting energies in his nerves and bones he didnt have to watch the silent battle he followed it accurately within himselfthe spellwielder forcing the mist away the mist curling back into the emptying corridor being forced away and oozing back in again he reached out a hand involuntarily to wield power that he had forsaken then pulled his hand back the conflict within him as silent and devastating as the conflict below him but before he could resolve his own battle the balance of power below him shifted the magicwielder won the mist parted held firmly away from a clear tunnel down the middle of the valley with only the thinnest of wisps seeping in but he could feel the strain the pressure of the mist on the walls of that tunnel threatening to collapse it at any moment it cant hold for long but again before he could move the balance shifted the ground trembled under his feet and for a moment he thought it was another effect of the battle of mist and magic being fought in front of his very eyes but nosomething dark loomed through the enshrouding mist something that tossed and made the ground shake the dyheli now he dared a thought a mindspoken call it didnt matter that someone or something might overhear they had been started or spooked but without direction they might hesitate fatally brothershooved brothers come quickly before the escapeway closes there was no answer except the shaking of the ground but the darkness within the mist began to resolve into tossing heads and churning legsand a moment later the dyheli bucks pounded into sight a foam of sweat dripping from their flanks coughing as the fumes hit their lungs and behind themsomething else something that ran on two legs not four it collapsed just barely within the reach of the mist and as it collapsed so did the tunnel of clear air he did not even stop to think he simply acted he took a lungful of clean air and plunged into the edge of the roiling angry mist his eyes burned and watered his skin was afire he could hardly see through the tears only enough to reach that prone figure seize one arm and help it to its feet he halfdragged halfcarried it out aware of it only as lighter than he and shorter and still alive for it tried feebly to help him there was no telling if it was human or not here in the borderland between ksheyna and the pelagirs that was not something to take for granted but it had saved the dyheli and that was enough to earn it in turn aid the mist reached greedily for them he reached clear air at the edge of it sucked in a lungful felt his burden do the same both of them shuddered with racking coughs as a wisp of mist reached their throats he stumbled into safety at the same moment that the other collapsed completely nearly carrying darkwind to the ground with him him at that moment darkwind realized that this was no male and as he halfsuspected not human either run vree screamed from overhead with mind and voice and darkwind glanced behind to see the mist licking forward again reaching for them turning darker as if with anger from somewhere he found the strength to pick her up heave her over his shoulder and stumble away at a clumsy run he ran until exhaustion forced him to stop before he dropped the girl fell on his face or both vree scouted for him as he slowed to a weary walk muscles burning side aching he figured he must have run all out for furlongs at least he was well out of sensing range of the evil mist if that still existed and had not been dissipated that was all that mattered by the time he came to a halt in the lee of a fallen tree he was sweating as heavily as the dyheli bucks he knelt and eased his burden down into the grass beside the barkstripped trunk of the tree and didnt bother to get up he sat right down beside her his legs without any strength at all propping himself against the tree with his back against the trunk for a long time he just sat there his forehead against his bent knees wrists crossed over his ankles every muscle weak from the long run relying on vree to alert him if anything dangerous came along sweat cooled and dried his back and scalp itched but he was too tired to scratch them he was only aware of his burning muscles his aching lungs the pain in his side after a while other things began to penetrate to his consciousness as his legs stopped trembling and the pain in his side and lungs ebbed birds called and chattered all around a good sign since they would have been silent if there had been anything about to disturb them he began to think again slowly his mind dull with fatigue was nevertheless alert enough to encompass this much as a nonhuman and an outlander she was not going to be welcome in ksheyna she was not as he recalled from the brief glimpse hed had before he had to pick up and run with her a member of any of the nonhuman races ksheyna had contact with and unknown meant suspect in the dangerridden lands beyond the borders of the vale now what am i going to do with her he wondered exhaustion warring with the need to make a quick decision id better take a closer look at her we arent inside the vale yet if she isnt badly hurt maybe i can just leave her here keep an eye on her until she comes around then make sure she takes herself off away from the vale he raised his head and turned his attention to his silent companionstill unconscious he saw as he turned her over to examine her everything about her set off ripples of aversion not only was she nonhuman she was onlytooobviously one of the socalled changechildren from the pelagirs creatures modified from either human or animal basesat their own whims frequently if the base was human or that of their creators if they were modified from animals it was what the tayledras had done with the bondbirds and what they had done to horses on behalf of the shinain taken to an extreme an extreme that many tayledras found bordering on the obsceneperhaps because of the kinds of modifications that had been done at the time of the mage wars it was one thing to modify it was quite another to force extreme changes for no good reason be the base human or animal his experienced eye told him which it was there was only so much that could be done with an animal base you couldnt grant equal intelligence with humans to an animal except over the course of many generations it had taken the hertasi many generations to attain enough intelligence for a rare mage to appear among their ranks and that event itself had been centuries ago human base modified to cateven unconscious she oozed sexual attraction which made him both doubly uneasy and pitying that attractionit was a common modification based on smell and the stimulation of deep instinctual drives in the onlooker whether he decided ultimately on pity or revulsion would depend on whether shed had it done to her or done it herself if herselfalready he felt a deep smoldering anger at the idea i may pitch her back into the damned mist those who modified themselves for sexual attractiveness were generally doing so with intent to use themselves and their bodies as a weapon and not an honest one either on the other hand if shed had it done to herit was likely with the intent of her master to use her as a kind of sexual pet that was as revolting to darkwind as the first but it was not a revulsion centered on the girl for the rest the overall impression was of a cat or something catlike her hair was a dark deep sable and rather short with a subtle dappled effect in the direct sunlight like his own dyed haircamouflage her face was triangular with very little chin her ears pointed with furlike tufts on the ends her eyebrows swept upward her eyes were slanted upward and when he pulled an eyelid open to see if she really was conscious he was unsurprised to see that her goldenyellow eyes had slit pupils which were dilated in shock her stunned condition was real she wore the absolute minimum for modesty a scanty tunic of creamcolored leather and skintight breeches that laced up the side showing a long line of dark goldenbrown flesh beneath not practical garb for woods running even unconscious she lay with a boneless grace that echoed the cat theme and her retractile fingernails were filed to sharp points like a cats claws whatever she had been she was not even as human now as the tayledras the changes had been made to her from birth possibly even before in fact in view of the extensiveness of the changes it was increasingly unlikely that shed done them to herself unless she was born in one of the contaminated areas the poison twisted her in this direction and she decided to continue the shift she was barefoot but the tough soles of her feet convinced him that she had spent most of her life without wearing foot coverings again not practical for woods running which argued that she had run away from something or someone then he saw the patterns of old and new bruises over much of her body as if someone had been beating her on a regular basis nothing to mar the pert perfection of her facebut everywhere else she was marked with the signs of frequent blows the darkness of her skin had hidden it from him at first but she was covered with the greenishyellow of old healing bruises and the purpleblack of fresh ones some of them on her arms were as big as the palm of his hand he could only wonder sickened about the parts of her hidden under her clothing the evidence was mounting in her favor she was thintoo thin with bones showing starkly as if she never had quite enough to eat darkwind sat back on his heels no longer certain what to think the changechild was a bundle of contradictions if she was as she seemed the escaped chattel of an adeptlevel mage how was it she had commanded the power to free the dyheli herd no mage would have permitted a pet to carry the magegift much less learn how to use it but if she was an enemy why did she bear the marks of beatings and semistarvation and why had she freed the herd in the first place she represented a puzzle he did not have enough information to solve i have to give her the benefit of the doubt he decided after pondering the question for a moment she did save the dyheli whatever else she is or is not will have to wait but i cant make a decision until i know what she is he thought a moment more i have to see that she stays safe until she wakes i do owe her that much at the very leastand i owe her the protection of a place to recover afterward at a guess she hadnt breathed enough of the poison to have put a healthy creature into the unconscious stupor she lingered in but she had not been healthy and she had depleted her resources considerably in fighting that evil mist she was not adeptlevel that much was obvious she was not even a master no master would have exhausted herself in fighting the mist directly a master would have transmuted the mist into something else an adept would have broken the spell creating it and holding it there both would have involved very powerful and difficult spells and would have alerted every mage within two days ride that there was another mage plying his powers that was what darkwind would have donebefore he swore that nothing would ever induce him to wield magic energies again before it became too dangerous for him to draw the attentions of other adepts to the depleted and disrupted clan of ksheyna she had notprobably could noteither break or change the spell she could only fight it that meant she was journeyman at best and that the energy to create the tunnel of safety had come directly from her it was what made journeymen so hard to track since the only disturbances in the energyflows of mageenergies were those within themselves they couldnt be detected unless one was very nearby and thank the fourfold goddess that was what had kept her magics from attracting anything else probably he had been the only creature close enough to detect her meddling but that was also what limited a journeymans abilities to affect other magic and limited his magical arsenal as well when the energy was gone the mage was exhausted sometimes to the point of catatonia depending on how far he wanted to push himself and there was no more until he was rested that was what brought the changechild to this pass depleting herself on top of her poor physical condition then taking one whiff too many of the poison mist she might be a long time in recovering but darkwind could not in all conscience leave her where she was it wasnt safe and he could not spare anyone to protect her and even if it was safe she might not recover without help he didnt know enough of healing to tell he rested his chin on his knee and thought i need someplace and someone willing to watch her and keep her out of mischief but i cant take her into the vale father would slit her throat just for looking the way she does i need a neutral safehaven temporarilyand then i need a lot of good advice he knew where to find the second it was coming up with the first that was difficult finally with a tentative plan in mind he hefted her over his shoulder againwith a stern admonition to his body to behave in her proximity as her sexual attraction redoubled once he was close to her his body was not interested in listening finally in desperation he shieldedeverything and thought of the least arousing things he could managescrubbing the mews boiling hides and finally cleaning his privy that monthly ordeal of privyscrubbing was the only thing that ever made him regret his decision to move out of the valethe last worked and with a sigh of relief he headed off to the nearest source of aid he could think of vree he called the bondbird dove out of the branches of a nearby tree he felt the gyres interest at his burden but it was purely curiosity the changechildthank the starswas of the wrong species to affect vree if shed been tervardi thoughshed have gotten to both of us and i dont think vrees as good at selfcontrol as i am i would truly have had a situation at that point where the bondbird replied with the inflection that meant where are we going the hertasi vree he mindspoke back the ones on the edge of ksheyna thisone hurtsleeps good vrees mindvoice was full of satisfaction the hertasi liked bondbirds and always had tidbits to share with them he could care less about darkwinds burden only that she was a burden and darkwind was hindered in his movements i guard which meant that he would stay within warning distance just ahead of darkwind alert at all times instead of giving in to momentary distractions unae his bondmatelatrines he thought firmly cleaning out latrines most part would start out chasing a helplesslooking old nera looked up at darkwindit was hard for the diminutive hertasi to do anything other than look up at a humanhis expressive eyes full of questions and what if she wakes the guard mindspoke he turned his head slightly and the scales of the subtle diamond pattern on his forehead shifted from metallic brown to a dark gold like old bronze nera was the elder of the hertasi enclave and an old friend darkwind had brought his burdenand problemstraight to neras doorstep let the mages discount the hertasi if they chose or ignore them thinking them no more than children in their understanding and suited only to servants work darkwind knew better i dont think she will darkwind told him honestly at least not until im back i risked a probe and she is very deeply exhausted i expect her to sleep for a day or more nera considered that his eyes straying to the paddies below where his people worked their fields of rice the hertasi settlement itself was in the hillside above a marsh carefully hollowed out holes shored with timbers with walls floors and ceilings finished with watersmoothed stone set into cement and furnished well if simply the swamp was their own domain one in which their size was not a handicap they grew rice and bred frogs hunted and fished there they knew the swamp better than any of the tayledras that had made it easy for darkwind to persuade the others to include them within the bounds of the ksheyna territory the marsh itself was a formidable defense and the hertasi seldom required any aid a border section guarded by a treacherous swamp full of clever hertasi was something even the most stubborn mage would find a practical resource though they knew how to use their halfsize bows and arrows perfectly well and even the youngest were trained with their wicked little sickleshaped daggers and fishspears the hertasi preferred when given the choice to let their home do their fighting for them enemies for the lizardrnn only to find themselves suddenly chestdeep and sinking in quicksand or mire the hertasi were fond of referring to these unwelcome intruders as fertilizer nera was still giving him that inquisitive look darkwind groaned inwardly there were some definite drawbacks to a friendship dating back to childhood old nera could read him better than his own father thank the gods for that the changechilds attraction didnt work on nera any more than it did on vreebut darkwind had the feeling that the hertasi knew very well the effect it was having on the scout and he was undoubtedly giving darkwind that look becausehe assumed the attraction was affecting his thinking as well asother things darkwind sighed all right he said finally if she wakes and gives you trouble shes fair game for fertilizer does that suit you nera nodded and his flexible mouth turned up at the corners in an approximation of a human smile good i just wanted to be certain that your mind was still working as well as the rest of you darkwind winced nera was so small it was easy to forget that the hertasi was actually older than his father and was just as inclined to remind him of his relative youth and hertasi who only came into season once a year enjoyed teasing their human friends about their susceptibility to their own passions it didnt help that this time neras arrow hit awfully near the mark im still chief scout he reminded the lizardanything that comes out of the pelagirs is suspectand if its helpless and attractive its that much more suspect excellent nera bobbed his muzzle in a quick nod then give my best to the winged ones follow the blueflag flowers we changed the safe path since last you were here with that tacit approval darkwind again shifted his burden to the ground this time laying her on a stuffed grassmat just inside neras doorway when he turned the hertasi elder had already rejoined his fellows and was kneedeep in muddy water weeding the rice he might be old but he had not lost any of his speed that was how the hertasi normally shy managed to stay out of sight so much of the time in the vale they still retained the darting speed of that longago reptilian ancestor darkwind pushed aside the bead curtain that served as a door during the day shaded his eyes and looked beyond the paddies for the first of the blueflag flowers the hertasi periodically changed the safe ways through the swamp marking them with whatever flowering plants were blooming at the time or with evergreen plants in the winter after a moment he spotted what he was looking for and made his way dryshod along the raised paths separating the rice paddies dryshod only for the moment when he reached the end of the cultivated fields he pulled off his boots meant mostly for protection against the stones and brambles of the dryland fastened them to his belt and substituted a pair of woven rush sandals he kept with nera rolling up the cuffs of his breeches well above his knees he waded into the muddy water trying not to think of what might be lurking under it the hertasi assured him that the plants they rooted along the paths kept away leeches special fish they released along the safe paths would eat any that werent repelled by the plants and that he himself would frighten away any poisonous water snakes if he splashed loudly enough but he could never quite bring himself to believe that it was very hard to read hertasi even when someone knew them well and it was all too like their sense of humor to have told him these things to try and lull him into complacency he could have gone around of course but this was the shortest way to get to the other side of the swamp where the marsh drained off down the side of the craterwall into the dhorisha plains the swamp barely within ksheyna lands ended at the ruins he soughtand when he had apportioned out the borders he had made sure that both were within his patrolling area one advantage of being in charge i could assign myself whatever piece i wanted dawnfire gets the part facing on the hills that hold her friends and i get the area that holds mine seems fair enough to me normally he didnt have to get there by wading through the swamp this was not the route he chose if he had a choice the water was warm unpleasantly so for so was the heavy humid air a thousand scents came to his nostrils most of them foul rotting plants stale water the odor of fish he looked back after a while but the hertasi settlement had completely vanished in waving swampplants that stood higher than his head he thought he felt something slither past his leg and shuddered pausing a moment for whatever it was to go by or bite me whichever comes first but it didnt bite him and if there had been something there it didnt touch him again he waded on watching for the telltale pale blue of the tiny odorless flowers on their long stems poking up among the reeds as long as he kept them in sight he would be on the path the hertasi had built of stone and sand amid the mud of the swamp there were always two plants one marking each side of the path the idea was to stop between each pair and look for the next while the path itself twisted among the reeds and muck it was a straight line from one pair of plants to the next and there were false trails laid it wasnt a good idea to break away from the set path and take what looked like a more direct route or a drier one the direct route generally ended in a bog and the dry one always ended in a patch of quicksand or a sinkhole once again he was sweating like a panicked dyheli and that attracted other denizens of the swamp below the water all might be peaceful but the hertasi could do nothing about the insects above darkwind had rubbed himself with pungent weeds to enhance his races natural resistance to insects but blackflies still buzzed about his eyes and several nameless nearly invisible fliers had already feasted on his arms by the time he reached dry land again there was no warning the ruins simply began and the marsh ended darkwind suspected that the marsh had once been a large lake possibly artificial and the ruins marked a small settlement or trading village or even a guard post built on its shore if whatever cataclysm had created the plains had not altered the flow of watercourses hereabouts he would have been very surprisedand after that it would have been logical for the lake to silt up and become a swamp he climbed up on the stones at the edge of the swamp slapping at persistent insects vowing silently to take the long way around on his return he looked up to make sure of vree and found the bondbird soaring overhead effortlessly in the clouddotted sky not for the first time he wished for wings of his own and what would you do with them little one asked a humorfilled mindvoice how would you hide and creep and come unseen upon your enemies hmm the same way you do you old myth he replied from above good answer replied treyvan and the gryphon dove down out of the sun to land gracefully on a toppled menhir in a thunderous flurry of backwinging driving up the dust around him and forcing darkwind to protect his eyes with his hand until the gryphon had alighted sssso what brings you to our humble abode treyvan asked genially somehow managing to do what the tervardi could not and force human speech from his massive beak i need advice and maybe help darkwind told him feeling as small as the hertasi as he looked up at the perching gryphon those handclaws for instance were half again as wide and long as his own strong hands and their tips were sheathed in talons as sharp and black as obsidian treyvan jumped down from the stone and his claws clenched and released reflexively as the gryphon changed its position before him absentmindedly digging inchdeep furrows into the packed earth advissse we will alwayss have forrr you featherlessss sson advissse you will take that iss up to you treyvan smiled goldtinged crest raising a little in mirth help we will alwaysss give if we can wanted orrr not darkwind smiled and stepped forward to grasp the leading edge of the great gryphons folded wing and leaned in to run a hand through the spicyscented neck feathers seemingly unending in their depth thank you where is hydona sssearrrching for nessstlining i would guess treyvan let a trace of his pride show through fluffing his chest feathers and raising his tailtip so soon when when will you make the flight sssoon sssoon you will be able to tellll treyvan chuckled at darkwinds blush then halfclosed his eyes and darkwind felt the wingmuscles under his hand relax it was easyvery easyto fall under the hypnotic aura of the gryphon a state of dreamy relaxation brought on by the feel of the soft silky feathers the faintly sweet scent the deeprumble of treyvans faint purr it was the gryphon himself who broke the spell you have need of usss darrrkwind he reminded the scout the muscles in the wing retensed and he stood wings tucked to his side under panels of feathers let usss go to hydonaaa he turned and paced regally on a path winding deeper into the ruins darkwind had to hurry to keep up with his companions groundeating strides the gryphons had arrived here in these ruins literally out of the sky one day when darkwind was seven or eight hed claimed these ruinsthen well within the safe boundaries of ksheyna territoryas his own solitary playground there was magic here a halfdozen leylines and a node but the mages had decreed it safe tame and unlikely to cause any problems it was a good place to play and imagine mysteries to be solved monsters to conquer magics to learn watching treyvans switching tail he recalled that day vividly he had rounded a corner the great mage investigating possibly dangerous territory and about to encounter a fearsome monster when he encountered a real one he had literally walked into treyvan who had been watching his antics with some amusement he later learned all he knew at the time was that he had turned a corner to find himself facetoface withlegs very large legs ending in very very large claws his stunned gaze had traveled upward up the furry legs to the transition between fur and feathers to the feathercovered neck to the beak the very very very large sharp and wickedly hooked beak the beak had opened it seemed as large as a cave grrr treyvan had said darkwind had turned into a small whirlwind of rapidly pumping arms and legs heading for the safehaven of the vale and certain with the surety of a terrified eightyearold that he was not going to make it somehow he had somehow he escaped being pounced on and eaten whole he had burst into the ekele babbling of monsters hundreds thousands of them in the ruins since he had never been known to lie his mother and father had set up the alarm and a small army of fighters and mages had descended on a very surprisedand slightly contritepair of gryphons fortunately for all concerned gryphons were on the list of friendly though we have never seen one creatures all tayledras learned of some time in their teens treyvan apologized and explained that he and hydona were an advance party intending to discover if these lands were safe to live and breed in they offered their help in guarding ksheyna in return for the use of the ruins as a nesting ground the elders had readily agreed help as large and formidable as the gryphons was never to be disdained a bargain was struck and the party returned home but all darkwind knew was that he was huddling in his parents ekele his knife clutched in his hand waiting to find out if the monsters were descending on his home until his parents returned unbattered unbloody perfectly calm and when hed demanded to know what had happened his father had ruffled his hair chuckled and said i think you have a new friendand he wants to apologize for frightening you treyvan had apologized and that had begun the happiest period of his life when everything was magical and wondrous and he had a pair of gryphons to play with he hadnt realized it at the time but it hadnt entirely been play treyvan and hydona had taught him a great deal of what he knew about scouting and fighting playing monster for him as they later would for their fledglings teaching him all about dangers he had not yet seen and how to meet them now he knew though he had not then that they had chosen the ruins deliberately for the magicsources that lay below them magic energies were beneficial for gryphon nestlings giving them an early source of power for gryphons were mages too a different kind of mage than the tayledras or other humans they were instinctive mages earthmages hydona said using the powers about them deftly and subtly for defense and in their mating flights for without a specific spell a mating would not be fertile that was what treyvan had meant by you will know when he and hydona flew to mate for their second clutch any mage nearby would know very well that a spell with sexual potency was being woven the last time theyd risen hed been fourteen and just discovering the wonders of girls fortunately he had been alone and there had been no girls within reachthe offspring of that mating were six or seven years old now fledged but not flying yet and still subadult pretty little things he thought to himself with a chuckle though the term little was relative they were bigger and stronger than he was at fourteen hed already acquired vree and the appearance of the gryphlets hadnt appalled him the way it might have vree had looked much scrawnier andwellawful right out of the egg lytha and jerven were born alive and with a reasonable set of flufffeathers and furand treyvan hadnt let him see them until their second or third day when their eyes were open and they didnt look quite so unfinished the gryphons nest was very like an ekele but on the ground presumably to keep the flightless gryphlets from breaking their necks the pair had created quite an impressive shelter from stone blocks cleverly woven vegetation and carefully fitted logs as darkwind neared it he realized that it was bigger than it had been it wasnt until he got close enough to measure it by eye that the difference was apparent from without it looked almost like a tent made of stone and thatch with a roof quite thick enough to keep out any kind of weather it looked very much as if the gryphons had dismantled and rebuilt it keeping the same shape with an increase in size he glanced in the door as treyvan turned a look of proprietary pride on his expressive face obviously he was waiting for a compliment inside there were three chambers now instead of the two darkwind remembered the fledglings the adults and a barren one which would probably be the new nursery the other two were basically large nests piled deep with fragrant grasses that the pair had gathered down on the plain and changed periodically treyvans neck curved gracefully and he faced his human friend eye to golden eye well he demanded whaaat do you think i think its magnificent darkwind replied warmlywhich was all he had time for as the gryphlets heard and recognized his voice and came tumbling out of their chamber in a ball of squealing furand feathers darkwind was their favorite playmateor plaything sometimes he wasnt entirely certain which but hed used treyvan and his mate the same way as a child so turnabout only seemed fair mostly they tried to be careful but they didnt always know their own strengthand they were very young sometimes they forgot just how long and sharp their claws and beaks were they hit him together lytha high jerven low and brought him down both shrieking in the highpitched whistles that served the gryphons for howls of laughter darkwind tried not to wince but those whistles were enough to pierce his eardrums ill be glad when their voices deepen human children are shrill enough as it is lytha grabbed the front of his tunic in her beak and worried it jerven gnawed his ankle he struggled at least they were big enough now that he didnt have to watch what he did he could fight against them in earnest and not hurt them provided he didnt indulge in any real g blows they seemed to have improved in their playing since the last time hed needed a new tunic when jerven got through with him treyvan watched them maul him indulgently for a moment then waded in gently separating his offspring from his friend batting at them so that they rolled into the far corners of the chamber shrieking happily darkwind did wince treyvan whistled something at them they bounced to their feet and bounded out the door darkwind still wasnt fluent in gryphon it was a very tonal language and hard to master but he thought it was probably the equivalent of go play darkwind needs to talk to mother and father about things that will bore you to sleep treyvan shook his head then turned and settled himself into a graceful reclining curve with his serrated meatrending bill even with darkwinds chin bare inches away gazing into the humans face your indulgenssss old friend they aaare veeeery young i know he replied picking himself up off the floor and dusting himself off i distinctly remember doing the same thing to you treyvans beak opened in a silent laugh aaaah but i wassss ssstill thissss ssssize and you were much ssssmaller yesss the damagesss were much lessss i think ill survive them darkwind responded and i owe you both for more than just being gracious about playing monster for me treyvan shook his head weee do not think of sssssuch he said immediately thissss issss what friendssss do darkwind remained stubbornly silent for a moment whether or not you think of it i do he said you two helped me cope with mothers death youve been mother and father to me since its not something i can forget the memory was still painful but he thought it was healing it certainly wouldnt have without their help sssstill treyvan objected you are uncle to the little onesss at consssiderable perssonal damage he shrugged to quote your own words he replied wryly thats what friends do i think theyre well worth indulging so youve obviously enlarged the nestand its wonderful the new chamber doesnt look tackedon it looks like it was built with the original what else are you planning to do we thought perhapsssss a chamber for the younglingssss to play in foul weather they discussed further improvements for a moment until a shadow passed over darkwind and he looked up at the sound of his name whistled in gryphonthen once again he had to protect his eyes as hydona treyvans mate landed in the clearing before the nest driving up a stronger wind with her wings than treyvan had darkwind rose to his feet to greet her she was larger than treyvan and her dustybrown coloration was a muted copy of his goldenbrown feathers there was more gray in her markings and less black her eyes were the same warm lovely gold as treyvans though and she was just as pleased to see him as her mate had been she nuzzled him and gripped a shoulder gently purring loud enough to vibrate his very bones he buried his hands in her neckfeathers and scratched the place at the back of her neck she could never reach herself the most intimate caress possible to a gryphon short of mating behavior she and treyvan had been extraordinarily open with him especially after the death of his mother allowing him glimpses of their personal life that most humans were never allowed to see they were all in all quite private creatures of all the tayledras only darkwind was considered an intimate friend they had not even allowed dawnfire who was possibly the best of all the ksheyna at dealing with nonhumans to come that close to them ssssso hydona sighed after a long and luxurious scratch thisss is your patrol timeit musst be busssinesss that bringsss you and bussinesss isss ssseriousss how can we help darkwind looked into her brilliant deep eyes i want to ask advice and maybe some favors he said i seem to have acquired a problem hydonas eartufts perked up acquired a problem interesssting word choicssse ssssay on he chose a comfortable rock as she curled up beside her mate well he began it happened this way chapter nine elspeth master quenten reread the message from his old employer captain kerowyn herald captain kerowyn he was going to have to remember that not that the new title seemed to have changed her much quenten i have a job for you and a sizable retainer enclosed to make you go along with it important personage coming your way keep said personage from notice if possible official and sensitive business will have one escort along but is capable of taking care of self in a fight personage needs either a mageforhire a damn good one or training or both use your own judgment pass personage on to uncle if you have to thank you for your help write if you find a real job kerowyn he smiled at the joke no kerowyn hadnt changed even since becoming one of the whiteclad targets for the queen of valdemaralthough quenten also had no doubts that she refused to wear the white uniform without a royal decree quenten thanked the courier for the message and offered him the hospitality of the post for his recoverystay it was graciously accepted and the young manone of king farams squiresoffered to share gossip of the rethwellan court with him in return come dinner and people wonder how we get our information the squire was an affable youngster fresh from the hill district with the backcountry burr still strong in his speech he made quenten quite nostalgic for the old days with the skybolts a good half of them came out of the hill district facing karse with their tough little ponies and all their worldly goods in a saddlepack up behind them what they lacked in ons they tended to make up for in marksmanship tracking and a toughminded approach to life something kero had called attitude he had all of that with a veneer of gentility that told quenten he was from one of the noble families that hung on there after fighting their way to the local high seat and holding it by craft guile and sheer stubborn resilience his eyes went round at quentens pair of magelights over the table though he never said a word about them he knew how to use the eating utensils though which was more than keros hill lasses and lads generally did hed gotten that much out of civilization but because he was so new to court he couldnt tell quenten what the mage really wanted to knowjust who and what this personage was theres two of em about a day behind me id reckon the young man said around a mouthful of quentens favorite eggandcheese pie one man one girl done up all in white with white horses fast they are the horses i mean i say about a day cause i started out a week ahead but i reckon theyve made it up by now thats how fast them horses are well done up all in white in connection with the note from kero meant they were heralds out of valdemar but what heralds could possibly want with a mage was beyond him he recalled quite vividly his encounter with valdemars borderprotections he didnt think theyd be able to pay any mage enough to put up with that still that wasnt for him to say maybe there was a way around it hed have to wait and see but who were these heralds theyd have to be important for kero to exert herself on their behalfand equally important for king faram to have sent one of his own squires on ahead with keros message to warn him that they were coming he put that question to the youngster over dessert when the squire had sipped just enough of quentens potent sweet wine to be a little indiscreet ehrriswine does it every time the young man rolled his wide blue eyes well as to that he replied no ones said for sure but the young lady i think she must be related i overheard her call his majestyuncle when the king gave me the packet and instructions just before i left i reckon shes darens get though id never heard of her before darens child quenten snorted to himself with amusement and a herald of valdemar not unless the twins are aging a year for every month since theyve been born but selenays oldest child now thats a possibility though i wouldnt have thought theyd let her out of the city much less the kingdom interesting something must be going on in that war with hardorn that i dont know about id thought it was back to staring at each other across the border he sat back in his chair while the young man rattled on and sipped his own wine suddenly the stakes were not just kero asking a favor not with a princess riding through rethwellan incognito looking for mages to hire this had all the flavor of an intrigue with the backing of the valdemaran crown and it promised both danger and the possibility of rapid and high advancement quenten had a good many pupils that would find those prospects attractive enough to chance the protections keeping mages out maybe they even found a way to cancel them that might be why theyre finally coming down here now in factnow that quenten was masterclass and could be a lowlevel adept if he ever bothered to take the testit was possible that it was attractive enough to interest him it might be worth trying to find a way around those watchers whatever they were if they hadnt been countered already court mage of valdemar for a moment visions of fame and fortune danced in his head then he recalled why he wasnt a court mage nowthe competition the rivalry and above all the restrictions on what he could and could not do or say hed been offered the position and more than once so had jendar as far as that went both of them had preferred to help friends to the postfriends who would tell them what was going onand keep up casual ties with the rulers of the time sometimes a king preferred to go outside his court for advice to a mage say with no other obvious axes to grind he laughed at himself then and bent his attention to the amusing stories the young squire brought from court and remembered what he had once told kero if i have to choose between freedom to do whats right and a comfortable high court position ill take the freedom she had shrugged but her smile told him that she tacitly agreed with him which was probably why she was making a target of herself in valdemar right now were both fools he thought and chuckled the squire who thought the mage was chuckling at one of his jokes glowed appreciatively quenten used the same office and suite of rooms that the captain had back when bolthaven was the skybolts winter quarters and not a mageschool placed high up in a multistory tower that overlooked most of the town as well as the former fortress he had a clear view of the main gate and the road leading to it the exercise yard and most of the buildings kero might not recognize the place at first sight anymore the exercise yard had been planted and sodded and turned into a garden hed had trees and bushes brought in and scattered about to provide shade and most of the buildings had been refaced with brick the barracks were a dormitory now and looked it with clothing drying on the sws food or drink placed there to cool kites flying from the rooftop and youngsters sitting or hanging out of most of the windows the main stable was a workshop where anything that was likely to blow the place up could be practiced in relative safety only the smaller visitors stable remained to house the few horses bolthaven needed while he kept the stockade as a means of defining boundaries beyond which the students were not permitted without permission the place didnt look like a fortress anymore it looked like what it was a school and not just any school the largest white winds school in rethwellan the only one that was larger was the school kethry had attended in jkatha her son jendar quentens teacher had founded a school near petras the capital of rethwellan in a little town called great harsey but it had never been this large then again mageschools can be dangerous for the innocent townsfolk sometimes things get a little out of hand townsfolk can get downright touchy over the occasional earthelemental in the scullery cant imagine whythat hadnt been a problem for quenten the town of bolthaven had been built around the garrison the folk here depended on it for their custom theyd been relieved to learn that there would still be custom here and most of them had been able to turn their trades to suit young mages instead of young mercs and all told an earthelemental in the scullery did less damageand was less of a hazard to the problematical virtue of the helpthan any drunken merc bent on celebration the worst that ever came up from bolthaven now was an urgent call for one of the teachers followed by a polite bill for damages quentens desk was right beside the window a necessity since he spent very little time in doing paperworkthats what he had clerks forand a great deal of time in overseeing the pupils and classes some of that overseeing was conducted from his deskan advantage mages had over mercenary captains he could look in on virtually anything he chose at any time simply by exercising a little of the power that came with the rank of master mage just now he was keeping an eye on the road in between considering the proposed theses of four wouldbe journeymen the messenger had departed early this morning since then hed been waiting for the personage not with impatiencea mage soon learned the futility of impatiencebut with growing curiosity he wasnt certain what to expect really on rereading the note he saw that kero had said that he should give this girl training something he hadnt taken a great deal of notice of the first time around now that was interesting kero herself was not a mage but she had somehow managed to spot potential mages in the past and send them to either him or her uncle had she seen something in this girl or was it simply something the girl herself wanted had she absorbed tales of what keros mages had done until she had convinced herself that she too could become a mage well that was possible but not without the talent for it unless you could see and manipulate the energies mages used she could fret herself blue without getting anywhere even those who followed the bloodpaths had at least a little of the talent there were varying degrees in what mages could do too not only did the strength of the talent varythus dictating how much energy a mage could handlebut the kind of talent variedthus dictating the kind of energy he could handle some never became more than earthmages and hedgewizards using their own lifeenergies to sense what was going on in the world around them augmenting the natural attributes of plants and animals to serve them and healing not that there was anything wrong with that quenten himself had seen some very impressive merc work done by hedgewizards with a firm grasp of their abilities and a determination to make the most of them the tiniest change at the right moment can down a king or an army but he rather doubted that being told she would never be anything other than a hedgewizard would satisfy a headstrong princess nor would being told she could not be any kind of a mage at all he was prepared for just about anything or so he told himself from a spoiled brat who thought a white uniform and a coronet entitled her to anything she wanted to a naive child with no magetalent whatsoever but many dreams to someone very like some of his older pupilsthat would be the best scenario in many ways to have her turn out to be teachable with magetalent present but unused so that he could give her what she wanted but would not have to force her to unlearn bad habits theoretically the discipline required by the heralds mindmagic would carry over and give her a head start over talented youngsters who had yet to learn the value of discipline a flash of white on the road just below the gate alerted him and he paused for a moment to key in his magesight that in particular had improved out of all recognition since the joining the skybolts and his elevation to masterclass if this child had any ability at all he would be able to see it even from the tower then he would know what to tell her if she asked for training and hed have some time to think about just how he was going to phrase it be it good news or bad two dazzlingly whiteclad riders on pure white horses entered the main gate and paused for a moment in the yard beyond before dismounting and that was when quenten got one of the greatest shocks of his life whatever he had been expectingit wasnt what he saw the ordinary young woman with the graceful white horse wasnot ordinary at all she was the bearer of an untrained but major magegift one so powerful it sheathed her in a closelywrapped sparkling aura in his magesight that briefly touched everyone around her with exploratory fingers she was apparently unaware of quenten was astonished and surprised she hadnt caused problems with it before this surely she must have seen powerflows energylevels even the nodes that he could see but could not use surely she had wondered what they were and how could she not have been tempted to try and manipulate them then he recalled something these heralds one and all had mindmagic and were trained in it if they didnt know what magetalent wasit could possibly be mistaken for something like sight and if she was told that this was just another way of viewing things that she could not actually affect them she might not have caused any trouble they have no idea how close they came if she had ever been tempted to touch something that was not the end of the surprises she was carrying at her side something that radiated such power that it almost eclipsed herand only long familiarity with keros sword enabled him to recognize it as need the sword had changed had awakened somehow and it was totally transformed from the relatively simple blade he had dealt with now there was no doubt whatsoever that it was a major magical artifactand it radiated controlled power that rivaled the adepts he knew its a good thing i never tried mucking around with it when it was like this it probably would have swatted me like a fly he wondered how he could have missed it when they were riding in it must have been like a beacon and how the mages at farams court could have missed ithe had his answer as it simplystopped what it was doing it went back to being the simple sword he had known magical yes if you looked at it closely enough but you had to look very closely and know what you were looking for did it put on that show for my benefit he wondered somehow that idea was a little chilling no one he knew could detect magesight in action it was a passive spell not an active one no one he knew that didnt mean it couldnt be done that notion was even more aweinspiring than the display of power had been need was old perhaps the ancient ways of magic it was made with harbored spells he couldnt even dream of the creature she was ridingnot a horse at all even if it chose to appear as onerivaled both the young woman and the sword but in a way few would have recognized the aura enveloping it was congruent with the creatures skin as if controlled power was actually shining through the skin which was very much the case although few mages would have known it for what it was quenten recognized it as a guardian spirit of the highest order and from the colors of its aura it was superior even to the ethereal spirits he had once very briefly had conversation with when some of the shinain relatives came to bolthaven for the annual horsefairthe ones keros other uncle called spiritkalenedral that served the shinain goddess the veiled ones shaman kraheera had called them the unspoken implication being that only the spirit kalenedral went veiled they were to this horse what an eating knife is to a perfectly balanced rapier one blow after another all within a heartbeat he practically swallowed his tongue with shock and dropped his arms numbly to his sides for a moment he felt like an apprentice again faced with his master and the vision of what that master had become after years and years of work in developing his talent to its highest pinnacle placed before him all that powerall that potentialand he hadnt the slightest idea what to do with it his mind completely froze for a moment as he stared at her i cant take her on his thoughts babbled in panic one slipand she wouldnt just blow up the workshop she couldshe couldand that guardianand the swordandandonly years of selfdiscipline combined with more years of learning to think on his feet with the skybolts enabled him to get his mind working again so that he could stop reacting and start acting like a mage and a competent master instead of a dumbfounded apprentice and the first thing he did was to turn away from the window with her out of his sight and sight he was able to take a deep breath run his hand through his sweatdamp hair and think quickly he had to come up with an answer and a solution one thing was certain it wasnt a question of whether she could be trained or not she had to be trained one day she might be tempted to try to manipulate some of the energies she could sense all around her and thenno telling what would happen depends on what she touched and how hard she pulled it could be even worse if she were in a desperate situation and she simply reacted instinctively trying to save herself or others with the thrust of fear driving hergods and the very first thing we are taught is never ever act in fear or anger she would be easy prey for anyone who saw her and wanted to use her there were bloodpath masters and even adepts out there who wouldnt hesitate to lure her into their territory with promises of training and then exploit her ruthlessly willing or not anyone could be broken and no mage had gotten to the master level without learning the patience it took to break someone and subvert them even if it took a year or more no she had to be trained now the question was by whom kero said if i couldnt handle her to send her on to old jendar her uncle hes an adept hellfires he taught me he ought to be able to handle anyone he can deal with her i dont have to that burden off his hands he sighed and relaxed gradually the sweat of panic dried his heart went back to its sedate pace his muscles unknotted the problem was solved but he wasnt going to have to be the one to solve it he was glad now that hed delegated one of the teachersa very discreet young lady who was bless the gods an herbalisthealer earthwitch with no magesight worth speaking ofto greet them when they arrived just in case he suddenly found himself with his hands full god only knows what id have been like if id met them at the gate babbling probably hardly one to inspire confidence by the time word reached him that they had arrived he was back to being the calm unruffled image of a schoolmaster completely in control of everything around him yes he said the child poked his head inside cautiously all the apprentices were cautious when the master was in his office quenten had been known to have odd things loose in the room on occasion just to keep people from interrupting him the legend of the constables scorched backside was told in the dormitory even yet and that had happened the first year the school had been founded sir the people you expected are here the ladys names elspeth the genman is skif eirodie says if youre able sir you should come down elrodie says the child looked the way he must have a few moments ago it wasnt often an apprentice got to see the inside of the masters office usually he met the youngsters on their own ground and when he wasnt actually in the office he kept it magelocked for his office also served as his secondary workroom there were things in here no apprentice should ever get his hands on ill be right there he said the child vanished he waited a few moments more to be certain his stomach had settled then turned and started down the stairs by the time he reached the ground he felt close to normal and was able to absorb the shock of his visitors appearance without turning a hair outwardly anyway the sword was quietbut the girl and her socalled horse werent so long as they dont do anything he turned first to greet the young lady as her companion held back a little diffidently confirming his guess that she was much higherranked than he was and given her strong family resemblance to king faram she was undoubtedly the elspeth that was heir to the valdemar throne she took after the dark side of the family rather than the blond but the resemblance was there beyond a doubt to all outward appearances she was no different than any other young wellborn woman of his acquaintance wavy brown hair was confined in a braid that trailed down her back though bits of it escaped to form little tendrils at her ears her square face was not beautiful or even conventionally pretty and dolllikeit was a face that was so full of character and personality that beauty would have been superfluous and mere prettiness eclipsed like kero she was handsome and vividly alive her brown eyes sparkled when she talked her generous mouth smiled often if he hadnt had magesight he would have guessed that she had magetalent in abundance she had that kind of energy about her shed studied her rethwellan that was evident from her lack of accent i am very glad to meet you at last she said when shed been introduced im keros problem child master quenten shes told me a lot about you and since shes a pretty rotten correspondent i guess youre rather in the dark about me her smile widened i know what her letters are like the last time she was with the skybolts there was a flood that got half the town and all she wrote wasits a little wet here be back when i can he chuckled well she neglected to supply me with your name and she kept calling you a personage i expect that was for reasons of security you are the elspeth i think you arethe one with a mother named selenay elspeth nodded and made a face im afraid so that was part of what i meant by being a problem child sorry cant help who my parents are born into it oh this is skif hes also assigned to this job by which shes tactfully saying that my chief duty is to play bodyguard skif said holding out his hand quenten released his magesight just a little and breathed a silent sigh of relief this young man was perfectly ordinary no magical artifacts no adeptpotential except that he was also riding a guardian spirit not as exalted a spirit as the girls butthe mare turned looked him straight in the eye and gave him a broad and unmistakable wink he stifled a gasp felt the blood drain from his face then plastered a pleasant smile on his lips and managed not to stammer since there is only one elspeth with a mother by that name that i know ofthat kero would have been so secretive abouti can understand why you are in that role he said its necessary i know it is they both said and laughed quenten noted that they both had hearty unforced laughs the laughter of people who did not fear a joke elspeth made a face and skif shrugged we know its necessary skif replied for both of them but that doesnt mean elspeth much likes it quenten had not missed the sword calluses on her hands and the easy way she wore her blade she had the muscles of a practiced fighter too though she didnt have the toughened hardeyed look the female mercs had after their first year in the ranks he coughed politely kero did at least tell me what brings you here and i have to be honest with you i wish i could help you but i cant none of my teachers are interested in anything but teaching and none of the youngsters ready to go out as journeymen are up to trying to cross your borders and dealing with the magical guards of that border i assume you know about that i couldnt pass it when kero first took the skybolts north and i dont know that i could now that im a more practiced master with years in the rank elspeths face fell skif simply looked resigned what about you teaching us she askedalmost wistfully i mean i dont suppose either of us are teachable are we do i tell her right now he thought about that quickly well it couldnt do any harm to tell her a little about her abilities right off it might make her a little more cautious im afraid skif isntbut young ladyyou are potentially a very good mage your potential is so high in fact that i simply dont feel up to teaching you myself and you have to be taught there is absolutely no doubt about that her face was a study in contradictory emotions surprise warred with disappointment elation withwas it fear he hoped so she would do well to fear that kind of power i dont have the time he said truthfully youre coming to the teaching late in your life and as strong as you could bewell it will require very personal teaching one to one in fact with someone who will be able to deal with your mistakes and i cant do it it would take time away from the students ive already promised to teach that wouldnt be fair to them and i gather that youre under some time considerations both of them nodded and elspeths horse snorted as if in agreement dearest gods its looking at me the way old jendar used to when i wasnt up to doing a particular task and said so like its telling me at least you know when not to be stupid it it wouldnt be fair to you to give you less attention than you need especially given that her shoulders sagged and her expression turned bleak so ive come on a fools errand then not at all he hastened to assure her what i can and will do is send you on to my old master keros uncle adept jendar hes no longer teaching in his schoolhe will on occasion take on a very talented pupil like yourself but without my directions introduction and safeconduct youd never find him hes very reclusive i dont suppose we could get him to come back with us could we skif asked hopefully that would solve all our problems quenten shrugged i dont know hes very old but on the other hand magic tends to preserve mages i havent seen him in years and he may still be just as active as he always was hes certainly my superior in ability and knowledge hes just as canny and hard to predict as kero and i wont even attempt to secondguess him the best i can offer is ask him yourself skif looked a great deal more cheerful thanks master quenten we will quenten felt as if a tremendous burden had just been lifted from his shoulders theres nothing quite like being able to legitimately pass the responsibility he thought wryly and feeling a good deal more cheerful himself he told both of them even if i cant offer you the dubious benefits of my teaching i can still offer the hospitality of the school you will stay for at least the night wont you id love to hear what keros been up to lately youre right by the way he concluded turning with a smile for elspeth shes a terrible correspondent her letter about you was less than half a page the letter im going to give you for jendar is going to be at least five pages long and i dont even know you that well the young woman chuckled and gave him a wink that was the mirror image of the one skifs spirithorse had given him he racked his brain for the right name for themcomrades no companions that was it i can even offer something in the way of suitable housing for yourahfriends he said bowing a little in their direction yourcompanions i believe you call them i dont know what kind of treatment theyre accustomed to at home but i can at least arrange something civilized elspeth looked surprised at that but the companions themselves looked gratified like queens in exile who had discovered that someone at last was going to give them their proper due we have two looseboxes with their own little paddock and you can fix the latchstring on the inside so that they can open and shut it themselves he said hastily trying to look as if he had visits from guardian spirits all the time kero always had shinain warsteeds you know and they needed that kind of treatment they arent companions of course but theyre a great deal more intelligent than horses thats lovely elspeth said as he fell silent her gratitude quite genuine that really is i cant tell you how hard it is even in valdemar to find someone who doesnt think theyre just horses oh no my lady he replied fervently convinced by the lurking humor in both sets of blue eyes that the companions found him and his reactions to them very amusing oh noi promise youi know only too well that they arent horses and you dont know the half of it friend whispered a voice in his mind for a moment he wasnt certain hed actually heard thatthen the light of amusement in the nearest ones eyes convinced him that he had i think i should ignore that if they wanted me to treat them like heavenly visitors they wouldnt look like horses would they or would they do the heralds know what they are if they dontno i dont think id better tell them if the companions want them to know theyll know if notno it would not be a good idea to go against the wishes of a guardian spirit in fact it would be a very stupid ideahe realized that he was babbling to himself now and decided to delegate the tour of the stables and school to someone else he was going to need a chance to relax before he dealt with these two again dinner held without being under those disturbing blue eyes was far easier they exclaimed over his magelights and over the tame little fireelemental that kept the ham and bread warm and melted their cheese for them if they chose they marveled at a few of his other little luxuries like the stoves instead of fireplaces which kept his quarters much warmer in winter even without the aid of more fireelementals he exchanged stories with them of what he knew of kero and faram and daren from the old days with the skybolts and what kero was up to now at least as a herald he actually got quite a bit of useful court gossip from her she knew what to look and listen for but he got even more from skif who evidently didnt miss anything that young man bore watching he reminded quenten of another one of the shinain one he knew was trained as an assassin whod been one of the skybolts specialist instructors for a whilean instructor in techniques he knew without being told that he didnt want to know anything about there was a great deal more to skif than met the eye quenten had the feeling that he was not only very resourceful he could probably be quite dangerous he also had the feeling that skifs presence had a great deal to do with the reason why elspeth hadnt been bothered by mages eager to use her before this elspeth was he discovered an extremely wellspoken young lady but in many ways she was still a girl she knew how she was treated inside valdemar and how her rank worked within that kingdom but had very little notion of how knowledge of her rank would affect people for good or ill outside itor how they could and would exploit her given the chance you see skif said after hed explained some of the ways in which she would have to be careful around local nobility i told you it was complicated down here she made a face and the magelight picked up golden glints in her eyes as she turned toward her partner you told me a lot of things and some of them i was right about quenten intervened its not her fault skif shes always dealt with very highlyranked nobles its the local lordlings you have to be really careful with around here id say that half of them were never born to their titlesor at least werent the first sons they didnt get where they are now by being nice and most of them want to climb a lot higher before they die you cant even count on blood relations to be honest with you well take keros brother for instance hes all right but the lady dierna is pretty much an informationsiphon for her relatives and there are a couple of them that none of us trust not even the king go to lordan and within half a day every one of diernas relatives will know that something brought heralds down out of valdemar let lordan know who and what you are and i personally wouldnt vouch for your safety once you got off his lands ransom is too tempting a prospect huh was skifs only comment he reached for another piece of smoked ham thoughtfully there were odd markings on his hands old scars that looked like they might have been left by knife fights interesting quenten thought a strange sort of partner for a princess for skif was a partner and not just a bodyguard the bodylanguage of both of them said that more than a partner a maybe that seemed likely at firstthen again maybe not they were both heralds and the little hed managed to pry out of kero on the subject indicated that heralds had an even closer brotherhood than the tightest merc company emotionally sexually whether the two were lovers didnt bear any thought after that they were heralds and that was a good enough answer for quenten even if you were left alone theyd find a way to use your presence he continued believe me the more you act like common folk the better off you are he waited for understanding to dawn then said patiently but forcefully get out of the white outfits skif snickered elspeth simply looked bewildered look common people dont ride around in immaculate white outfits the horses are bad enough add the uniforms and you might as well hire barkers to announce you in every little village ill get you some clothes before you leave save the white stuff for when you need to impress someone your simple presence as someones guest could lend weight to some quarrel they have that you know nothing about and i wish there was a way to dye the companions too but im afraid the amount of magic energy they have simply by being on this plane is going to bleach them again before they get half a day down the road thats assuming dye would take which i wouldnt bet on elspeth sighed and finally nodded a reluctant agreement damn being able to pull rank on someone who was being stupid would have been awfully useful all right you know more about the way things are around here than we do thats why hes got bolthaven as a freehold of the king skif put in unexpectedly as long as its a freehold none of the locals can try and bully each other by claiming hes with them he turned to quenten gesturing with a piece of cheese am i right exactly he replied pleased with skifs understanding not that anyone who knew anything about magic would ever suspect a white winds school of being on anyones side we dont do things that way skif grinned crookedly i kind of got the impression from kero that you folks were the closest thing there was to heralds down here oh he replied lightly trying to keep away from that subject the brotherhood of the white winds mages wasnt something he wanted to confide to an outsider there were things about white winds people that werent shared by any other mageschool and they wanted to keep it that way we arent that close ill second that whispered that voice in his mind he started involuntarily so what exactly are these mageschools anyway skif persisted showing no notice of his momentary startlement i mean some of you are real schools and some of you seem to be philosophies if you catch my meaning wereboth he replied wondering who or what had spoken surely not the companions surely he would have detected them listening in on the conversation wouldnt he each method of teaching is a philosophy he continued mind alert for other intrusions we differ in how we use our magic and how we are willing to obtain power how much should he tell them and how much should he leave in jendars hands better stick to the basics white winds takes nothing without permission and we try to do the least amount of harm we can we also think that since magetalent is an accident of birth we have the obligation to use it for the sake of those who were never born with it then he grinned but theres no reason why a mage cant make a living at the same time so long as he doesnt knowingly use his powers to abet repression or aid others who abuse their powers but thats why you dont find many white winds mages working with mercenary companies when youre a merc you cant guarantee that youre going to be working for the right side at least we dont have to worry about that elspeth said skif simply raised an eyebrowand quenten had the distinct feeling that skif was debating how much to tell him i assume youve heard of bloodpath mages he asked and was surprised when skif shook his head oh hellfire i guess i had better tell you then theyre mages who take their power from others he waited expectantly for them to make the connection then added a little impatiently by killing them usually painfully and by breaking and using them if they have the time to spare elspeths eyes widened thats what ancar is doingor at least thats what some of the people whove escaped from hardorn say he and his mages are doing i didnt know there was a name for them skif scowled so which school teaches people to do that he asked growling a little quenten shrugged there are schools but the moment anyone finds out about them theyre destroyed if the mages havent scattered first which is what usually happens no sane ruler wants that on his soil but to tell you the truth that kind of magic usually isnt taught in a school its usually onetoone a bloodpath mage who decides to take an apprentice just goes looking for one they try to find people who have potential but are untrained and cant tell one mage from another skif asked with a hard look at him quenten nodded skif had already seen what he was driving at sometimes sometimes they look for someone who is impatient who is powerhungry and ruthless thats the kind that usually rebelseventually has a confrontation with his master and either dies wins or has a draw that both walk away from and that is how they reproduce themselves basically quenten did not mention what happened in the first example he decided all things considered it was better to wait until elspeth was gone now theres one thing i have to warn you about and its back to the same old story of you arent in valdemar anymore for every rule theres an exceptionand this is the one to bloodmagic there are perfectly good people that practice a couple of forms of magic that require a bloodsacrifice the shinain shamans for one sometimes they spill their own blood just a little because any spillage of blood releases a lot of power and in times of a very dire problem a shaman or swordsworn may actually volunteer as a sacrifice as a kind of messenger to their goddess that things are very bad they need help and they are willing to give up a lot to get it elspeths eyes got very wide at that youre joking quenten shook his head i am not joking its very serious for them it hasnt happened in the last three or four generationsand the last time it did the plains were in the middle of a drought that had dried even the springs people and herds were dying one of the shamans threw himself off the top of the cliffs that ring the plains right down onto an altar hed set up down there and skif asked and the drought ended they say that he roams the skies of the plains as a spiritbird now some even say he transformed as he fell that he never actually hit the ground it was quentens turn to shrug im not their goddess its not my place to make decisions whats better answer every little yelp for help or make people prove they need it i dont know skif admitted elspeth just bit her lip and looked distressed but i can see what you mean we really arent home are we theres a lot of gray out here and precious little black and white quenten replied with a hint of a smile the shinain arent the only odd ones either therere the hawkbrothers what the shinain call taleedras nobody except the shinain shamans knows anything about them mostly because they tend to kill anybody that ventures into their territories skif scrutinized him closely for a moment if youre waiting for a gasp of horror master quenten you arent going to get one theres a reason you told us this and it has to do with the situation not being black and white so why do they kill people who walk across their little boundary lines quenten chuckled caught me didnt you all right theres a reason that i think is a perfectly good oneand to be honest they will try and turn you back its only if you persist that theyll kill you the shinain say that they are the guardians of very destructive magics that they purify a place of these magics then move on and that they kill persistent intruders so that those intruders cant get their hands on that magic seems like a good reason to me skif nodded any evidence to support this quenten raised an eyebrow well their territories are all in the pelagirs and there are more weird twisted and just plain evil things in there than you could ever imagine and they do periodically vanish from a place and never come back and once theyre gone anybody that moves in never has trouble from the oddling things again so your guess is just as valid as mine id believe the shinain personally skifs eyes were thoughtful but he didnt say anything elspeth stifled a yawn at that moment and looked apologetic it isnt the stories or the company master quenten she said ruefully its the long ride and the wonderful meal we started before dawn and we got here just before sunset thats a long day in the saddle skifs used to it but im a lot softer im afraid well i cant blame you for that quenten chuckled the truth is im not up to a day in the saddle myself anymore why dont you find that bed i showed you i was thinking of calling it a night myself thanks she said and finished the last of the wine in her glass then pushed herself away from the table she gave skif an opaque look but didnt say anything good night then quenten supplied ill see you off in the morning unless you want to stay longer no were going to have to cover a lot of ground and were short on time she replied absently then smiled but thank you for the offer good night skif looked after her for a moment after the door had closed then turned to quenten theres something else you didnt want her to hear he said about those bloodpath mages what is it a little startled by skifs directness quenten came straight to the point its about the ones who are looking for an apprenticeor at least they call it thatwho is untrained but powerful the ones looking for someone who is totally naive about magic like your young friend there skif nodded his eyes hardening go on what theyre looking for is the exact opposite of someone like themselves they have two ways of operating and both involve subversion he paused to gather his thoughts the first is to corrupt the innocent not possible skif interjected trust me on that one if youve ever heard that heralds are incorruptible believe it well anyone who rides around on a guardian spirit probably is no matter what people say about everyone having a price i suppose heralds do too but its not the kind of price a bloodpath mage could meet well the other is destruction luring the innocent into a place of power then breaking him or her quenten gave skif a sharp look and dont tell me that you cant be broken anyone can be broken and a bloodpath mage has all the knowledge patience and means to do so their places of power are usually so well guarded that it would take a small army to get in usually at a terrible cost and by the time they do its usually too late thats if you can find the place because besides being protected it will also be wellhidden skif had the grace to blanch a little nice little kingdom you have here oh there arent ever a lot of that kind but they do exist quenten replied and thats why im warning you you dont have the ability to see the kind of potential she carriesbut i do and so will anyone else of my rank who happens to see her thats master and above and there are not only bloodpath masters there are adepts trust me on that one of those would be able to persuade you that he was your longlost best friend if you werent completely on the alert for someone like that in fact the truth is that unless youve got introductions like im going to give you i would be very wary of anyone who seems friendly the friendlier they are the warier id be there isnt a mage out here who has to go looking for pupilsthey come to him its a matter of the way things work power calls to power so if someone is out looking it usually isnt for anyones purposes but his own the only people as a group that you can trust without hesitation are the shinain and whoever they vouch for anyone else is suspect skifs eyes narrowed and you say she looksattractive quenten nodded soberly i hate to send you to bed with a thought guaranteed to create nightmares butyes more than attractive to put it bluntly my friend you are riding out into wolf territory with a young and tender lamb at your side and the wolves can look convincingly like sheep skif licked his lips and the look in his eyes convinced quenten that he hadnt been wrong this man was very dangerous if he chose to be and he had just chosen to be quenten could only hope the man was dangerous enough chapter ten darkwind vree dove down out of the sky with no warning whatsoever coming straight out of the sun so that darkwind didnt spot him until the last possible second seeing only the flash of shadow crossing the ground treyvan look out he shouted interrupting whatever it was hydona was about to say treyvan ducked and flattened his crest and vree skimmed right over his head his outstretched claws just missing the quill hed been aiming for then without faltering in the slightest he altered his course with a single wingbeat and shot back up toward the clouds vanishing to the apparent size of a sparrow in a heartbeat that was the single bad habit darkwind had never been able to break him of the gyre was endlessly fascinated by treyvans crest feathers and kept trying to snatch them whenever the gryphon wasnt careful about watching for him sorry darkwind said apologetically i dont know what gets into him i really dont hydona smothered a smirk treyvan looked up at the birdwho was now just a dot in the sky innocently riding a thermal as if he had never even thought about snatching treyvans feathersand growled darrrrkwind i do love you but ssssome day i aaam going to sssswat that birrd of yourrrsss hydona made an odd whistling sound halfchoked treyvan transferred his glare to his mate sorry darkwind repeated feebly ah hydona you were saying oh that therrre ssseems no rrreassson for the changechild to haave sssaved the dyheli hydonas eyes still held a spark of mirth as treyvan flattened his crest as closely to his skull as he could unlessss she trrruly meant to be altrrruissstic and i sssuppose you could not judge how powerrrful a mage sssshee iss he shook his head not on the basis of a single spell if i were an adept trying to worm my way into a clan id probably try and make myself look as harmless as possible actually shhheee isss otherrr treyvan said unexpectedly both darkwind and his mate looked at him in surprise it iss the clawsss thossse cannot be changed from human bassse only brrred in which meansss that she isss otherrr for the clawsss come frrrom the unhuman and only the othersss brrreed with them ssso ssshe is otherrr at least in parrt hydona nodded slowly that iss trrue i had forrgotten that darkwind bit back a curse that would make her even harder to slip past his father if he had to a changechild he might accept with difficultybut one who was even in part of the others the bloodpath mages of the outlands not a chance but if shes other what was she doing that close to ksheyna he asked treyvan ruffled his feathers in the gryphon equivalent of a shrug it ssseemsss obviousss that sshe could haave many motivessss true darkwind could think of several she could be a spy she could still have been trying to escape a cruel master she could even be an adept herself and have inflicted all those hurts on herself with the intent of lulling their suspicions we could hydona offered unexpectedly her for you we arrre asss effective asss the vrondi at sssensssing falsssehood it isss insstinct they are that was news to himthough welcome news somehow the gryphons kept pulling these little surprises out of nowhere keeping him in a perpetual state of astonishment that would bedamned useful he replied honestly the truthspell is still a spell and i dont want to use it not this close to the border i cant chance attracting things to the hertasi settlement or to ksheyna either it isss insstinct with usss treyvan repeated to reassure him not a ssspell perhapsss though you ought to be therrre alsso ssshe will probably be verrry afrraid of usss he smiled considering that youre large enough to really bite her head off if you wanted to youre probably right he said and that might not be a bad thing either if we keep her frightened we have a better chance of catching her in a lie dont we yessss treyvan agreed it doesss not affect the trrruth asss we sssensse it fearr good ill be with you so that she doesnt try to run but you two loom a little bit be the big bad monsters and ill be her protector but another thought occurred to him then hed been planning on what to do to find out more about her he still had no idea what to do with her what do i do with her if she seems all right he asked i cant possibly take her into the vale worrry about that whenand ifthe time comesss treyvan said quietly it isss eassy to make a decission about a frrriend i would worrrry more about how to dissspossse of herrr if ssshe issss falssse leave herrr to usss if you like we can dissspatch her no he said quickly no thats my job it made him sick to think of killing in cold blood but it was his job and he would not put the burden on someone else not them especially theres such an innocenceabout them i wont see it stained with a coldblooded murder no matter how casually they think of doing it it would matter to me even if it doesnt seem to matter to them treyvan shrugged very well then he said ssshall we meet you therrre fine he replied and couldnt help but grin even if it does mean another trek through the marsh the things i do for duty treyvan just laughed and spread his wings jussst keep that birrrd frrom my crrrest he beginsss to look tasssty and as darkwind turned to head back he was mortally certain that the gryphon was thinking of all those quillsnatching attempts by vree and chuckling at the notion of dining on the poor gyre the gryphons were very catholic in what they considered edible just as vree would happily dine on a kestrel a fellow raptor the gryphons would probably be just as willing to make a morsel of vree except that vree was darkwinds that alone was saving him from becoming treyvans lunchin reality if not in thought featherhead he mindspoke up to the dot in the blue you have no notion how close to the cliff youve been flying cliff responded vree puzzled what cliff where cliff i cant tell if hes playing coy or he really doesnt understand me darkwind sighed and waded into the murky water never mind just stop teasing the gryphons leave treyvans feathers alone you hear me yes said vree slyly yes that hed heard darkwind not that hed obey darkwind groaned no wonder father doesnt listen to me i cant even get respect from a bird nera met him at the edge of the swamp popping up out of nowhere right into his path and scaring a year out of him he yelped one foot slipped off the path and into whoknewhowdeep smelly water and he teetered precariously for a moment before regaining his balance he glared at the hertasi snarling silently nera blithely ignored the glare the winged ones are here he mindspoke the creature you brought is also awake and with that he vanished again melting back into the reeds darkwind closed his eyes for a moment and tried to think charitable thoughts he let me leave the girl here and hes worried because of her the threat she represents he was startled to see the gryphons hes preoccupied with other things he forgets that im a lot clumsier in the swamp than he is he grimaced sure he does and im the shinain goddess not that it mattered nothing was going to change nera the hertasi was far too fond of playing his little games of eccentric old creature and insisting that if darkwind really tried he could move as well as the hertasi could in the swamp he enjoyed watching darkwind come out of the reeds covered in muck vree nera dawnfire the gryphons with friends like these why do i need to look on the border for trouble all i need to do is sit and wait theyll bring trouble to me but he did hurry his steps a little as much as he dared without losing his footing nera would not have come looking for him if the hertasi werent at least a little worriedtruly worriedabout the changechild and rightly it was possible the girl was an adept she seemed a little young for the rank but darkwind had just attained adeptclass when the heartstone fractured and he had been younger and it didnt follow that she was as youthful as she looked one of the commonest changes for a bloodpath adept to make in himself was to remove years most of them kept their bodies looking as if they were in their midtwenties but some even chose to look like children those were the really nasty ones for tayledras to cope with given the hawkbrothers strong reaction to children it was easy to play on their emotions until the enemy adept had them in exactly the position he wanted them kvala had been decimated by an adept using that ploy several hundred years ago back when their territory was on the eastern shore of the great crater sea the one the outlanders called lake evendim now their lesson was one no tayledras could afford to ignore he found himself thinking of his options if she was an adept and how he might be able to trick her into revealing her abilities shell have to pull power from the nearest node just to heal herself he thought as he felt his way along the submerged path treyvan should be able to sense that if she does from what he told me hes tied his magic into that node if shes a master shell draw from the leylines thats going to be subtler and harder to catch hmm if he had someone trap the lines so that any interference would be noted she might note it as well what he needed was a sensitive someone who was so attuned to the local energyflows that he would notice any deviation from the norm wait a moment didnt treyvan tell me that the gryphlets are sensitive to the powerflows in their birth area that might workassuming he can convince them to keep their minds on it he tried to think of something that would have convinced him to keep a constant watch for something when he was that young and failed to come up with anything children were children and generally as featherheaded as vree well ill mention it to the adults and see what they say he emerged from the reeds to the walkways rimming the rice paddies and stopped long enough to dry his feet and put his boots back on a quick look around showed him nothing amiss which meant there had been no real need to hurry only neras impatience old coot just likes to see me lose my balance and hes not happy unless hes the one in charge of everything he knew nera was watching him and he deliberately took his time on the hill above neras tunnel two pairs of huge waving wings told him that treyvan and hydona were waiting too but with more patience than the little hertasi he picked his way across the paddies taking time to be courteous to the farmers who bent so earnestly over their plants one of them even stopped him to ask a few questions about one of his kin who lived in the valeand he could sense neras impatient glare even from the distant tunnel mouth he looked up and sure enough there was a shadow just within the round entrance to the tunnel he smiled sweetly at it and bent to answer the hertasis questions in detail and with extreme politeness after all he was the only tayledras any of them saw regularly and he did make a point to keep track of those vale hertasi with relatives out here they were so shy that they seldom asked him about their vale kin and it was only fair to give them a firm answer when they did inquire and if nera says anything thats exactly what ill tell him when he reached the hill and set foot on the carefully graveled trail leading up the side he debated on going first to neras tunnel but treyvans mindspoken hail decided him in favor of the gryphons instead it seemed that his charge was not only awake but moving featherless son your prize waits up here she can walk slowly and there is more room for us up here she did not ask what we were and does not seem particularly frightened well that was a little disappointing she must have known about youor else shes seen gryphons before so much for you playing monster im on my way up when he reached the top of the sungilded bluff he found his charge reclining on another of the stuffed grass mats neatly bracketed between the two gryphons they were also reclining in the cool short grass wings halfopen to catch the breeze coming over the top of the hill his eyes went back to the changechild as if pulled there she seemed even more attractive awake with sense in those slitpupiled eyes and life in the supple muscles he was only too aware of how fascinating she was her very differences from humankind were somehow more alluring than if shed been wholly human she nodded a greeting to him then shifted her position a little so that she could watch him and the gryphons at the same time he noticed that she moved stiffly as if more than her muscles were hurt sssso your charrge iss awake treyvan said genially we have been having interessssting conversssation nyarrra thisss iss darrkwind she fixed him with an odd unblinking gaze i remember you you saved me she said finally in a low husky voice that had many of the qualities of a purr from the mist you helped me get out when i fell after you saved the dyheli herd he pointed outit seemed appropriatethough i could not imagine why you aided them he lifted an eyebrow i assume you had a reason i was fleeing my own troubles when i saw them she shrugged gracefully i am what i am she replied a changechild and not welcome among the birdkin when i saw the dyheli trapped it came to me that it would be good to free them and also that your folk value them if i freed them perhaps the door might be open for one such as i and also she added looking thoughtful i have no love for he who trapped them and who might that be darkwind asked without inflection he could see what treyvan had set up even without a mindspoken prompting since the girl was not afraid of the gryphons their planned positions would be reversed they would be friendly and he would be menacing a little harder to pull off with her lounging on the ground like an adolescent male dream come to languid life but certainly a good plan it seemed that she was perfectly willing to believe that he would be hostile to her even with her sexual allure turned up to full force my master she said pouting a little at his coldness mornelithe falconsbane not a frrrriendly name hydona said with a little growl not a friendly man replied nyara with a toss of her head and a wince not a man at all anymore for all that he is maleor at least very little human he has worked more changes upon his own flesh than he has upon mine an adept then treyvan said with cheerful interest and one you did not carrre for i take it from yourrr hurtss i would sssay he wasss even lesss kind than he wasss frriendly nyara nodded her supple lips tightened into a bitter line oh yes was the creature upon which he attempted his changes and if they proved to his liking he used them also and he made his mistakes upon me and often did not bother to correct them other things he did toobeatings and her eyes filled with tears and she averted her head ihe hurt me once too often that is all i would say so you ran away from him is that it darkwind interrupted the attempt to play for sympathy rudely how did you get away from someone as powerful as that i dont imagine he let you simply walk away and when you saw the dyheli then what did you do she blinked away the tears and rubbed her cheeks with the back of her hand without raising her head i have stolen little bits of magiclearning from time to time i have a small power you see when mornelithe was careless i watched i learned i learned enough to bend the spells of lock and ward and slip free of his hold then i went north where i have heard from mornelithes servants that there were birdkin that he hated she watched him out of the corner of her eyes do you think less of me that i thought to use you you are many i am one you have been the cause of some of my hurts when he was angered with you and could not reach you i thoughtwith birdkin between me and him he would ignore my flight and harry the birdkin he might even think i was with the birdkin and turn his anger on them then i saw the horned ones and felt his magic upon them and thought to buy myself sanctuary or at least safe passage with their freedom her head came up and she looked defiantly into his eyes you owe me safe passage at least birdkin even though i thought to trick mornelithe and set him on you you have defeated him many times i am but a small thing and could not even defy him and escaped him only with guile he looked sideways at treyvan who nodded ever so slightly everything shed said was the truth then it was probably safe enough to give her what she asked for we do owe you that and a place to rest until you can journey again he admitted softening his icy expression a little he caught the glint of scales out of the corner of his eye and mindspoke nera watching her closely to see if she detected the thoughts nera this changechild seems friendly and shes going to need your help shelter for a week or two at least maybe more have you got any tunnels no one is using the hertasi forgot whatever it was that had brought him now that darkwind had invoked his authority again hmm yes the old one at the waterline that belonged to rellan and lom that flooded this spring again they finally listened to me and moved out unless we have three or four weeks of rain it should stay dry and it was right on the edge of the bluff with the swamp on one side a hillside too steep for someone in her condition to climb above and all the hertasi between herself and freedom that should do perfect he said and nyara showed no signs of having heard the conversation we will make it ready nera told him full of selfimportance and content now that he was a major part of whatever was going on the creature can walk but slowlymy healer says that there are halfhealed bones and torn muscles send her in a few moments and there will be a bed and food waiting we can give you a place to stay for as long as you need it he told her and i will see about getting you safe passage once youre fit to journey again idont think you can hope for sanctuary the elders of this clan hate changechildren too much but you do not she replied her voice a caress idont hate anyone he said flushing and averting his eyes much to treyvans open amusement but i dont determine what the elders will say or do at any rate nera and the others are moving some basic things in now and as soon as you are ready one of them will come show you where it is i am grateful darkwind she said bowing her head a little and looking up at him from under long thick lashes i am very grateful he felt his blood heating from that halfveiled glance and wondered if she knew what she was promising him with it then he decided that she must know sex was as much a part of her weaponry as her claws dont worry about being grateful he said gruffly while treyvan hid his amusement just get yourself healed up so we can get you out of this mornelithes reach the sooner youre gone the safer well all be they removed themselves to a place farther along the bluff well out of earshot of the hertasi village before any of them said anything it was a golden afternoon near enough to nightfall for things to have cooled down sunlight as thick and sweet as honey pouring over the golddusted grass of the bluff with just enough breeze to keep it from being too warm the gryphons fanned their wings out to either side of themselves basking their eyes halflidded and beaks parted slightly treyvans crest was raised as high as it could go puffed out they looked extraordinarily stupid darkwind had to fight off gales of laughter every time he looked at them and his chest feathers were vree on his good behavior now that both darkwind and treyvan were ready for his tricks joined them on the grass he had just taken a bath and looked even sillier than the gryphons even though he was behaving he kept eyeing the quills of treyvans crest with undisguised longing will the little ones be all right with you gone so long darkwind asked with concern hydona nodded slowly and lazily the ruinsss are sssafe temporrrarrrily we caught the wynnssa they were wild masssterless what about that serpent you thought moved into the ruins this spring he asked the one i found the sign of its certainly large enough to make a meal of one of you let alone lytha or jerven it made the missstake of bassssking on the sssame ssstone alwaysss treyvan replied his voice full of satisfaction it wasss delicioussss the little onesss will be fine hydona assured him their mindssspeech isss quite sssstrong now and if they are threatened they will call we can be there verrrry quickly having seen the gryphons flying at full speed once he could believe that they were even faster than vree and that was saying something for vree was faster than any wild bird he had ever seen so was she lying about anything darkwind asked as he pulled the hair away from the back of his neck to let the sun bake into his neck and shoulder muscles nyara i mean no hydona said orrrmossstly no mostly darkwind said sharply just how much was she lying about the one ssshe claimed wasss her massster treyvan said slowly mornelithe falconsbane darkwind supplied sounds to me as if he really does hate tayledras if hes taken a usename like that most adepts assumed usenames the tayledras did it simply to have a name that was more descriptive of what they were but the bloodpath adepts did so out of fear names were power though not in the sense that the foolish thought that knowing someones true name would permit you to command him no by knowing the real name the birthname of someone you could discover everything there was to know about him if you were thorough and patient enoughyou could even see every moment of his past life if you knew the spell to see into the past and by knowing that about him you knew his strengths and weaknesses and most importantly you could learn the fears that were the strongest because they were rooted in childhood it was characteristic of bloodpath adepts that they had many many weaknesses for they generally had never faced what they were and conquered those old fears there had been cases of mere journeymen besting adepts sometimes even by illusions simply by knowing what those fears were and playing to them but bloodpath mage or any other kind the usename told the world something about what the mage was now a name like mornelithe falconsbane did not call up easy feelings within a tayledras i do not like that name darrrkwind hydona said uneasily it does not sssit well in my mind nor mine either darkwind admitted i dont imagine he cares much for anything with wings and feathers mornelithe now thats old tayledras its actually kaledain the language we and the shinain had when we were the same people yesss treyvan said interrupting him we ssspeak kaledain fluently you do he replied surprised again thats something to go into with them later in detail where on earth did they ever learn kaledain i thought it was a dead language well i knew what it was but whats it mean hatrrredthatreturnsss treyvan said solemnly a name that sspeaksss of return over the agesss not once but many timesss it isss not rebirrth it isss actual returrn and returrn looking for rrrevenge it isss an evil word darrrkwind asss evil as you findfalconssssbane to be the words hung heavy and illomened between them silencing all three of them for a moment and bringing a chill to the air typical bloodpath intimidation darkwind said in disgust attempting to make light of it and dispel the gloom trying to frighten people with a portentous name and a fancy costume frankly id like to know where theyre finding people willing to make clothing like that those ridiculous cloaks and headdresses they look as if they were designed by an apprentice to traveling players with delusions of grandeur half the time they cant even walk or see properly in those outfits treyvan laughed oh and who isss it hasss an entire collection of ravenwingsss feather masssksss on hisss wallsss thats different he replied defending himself thats art back to the subject what was it nyara lied about in connection with her master wasnt he her master after all oh he wasss her massster yesss but he wasss more sssomething moreintimate treyvan shook his head and looked over at his mate who nodded yesss said hydona but not intimate asss in loversss there isss no love there it wasss something elsssse darkwind tried to puzzle that one out then gave it up ill think about that for a while maybe the connection will come to me she did escape though right oh yesss hydona replied emphatically yesss sshe did essscape and wass purssued i would ssay that her sstory isss trrrueall of it that ssshe told usss that isss i wish id been able to ask her more questions he said chewing at his lower lip as he thought i wish id been able to think of more questions it ssseemss clear enough treyvan said lazily stretching his forelegs out into the sun a little more ssshe isss exactly what sshe ssseemsss a changechild used to try out the changes her master wanted to perform on his own bodyused as a sex toy when he wished yesss hydona nodded and usssed alssso to rrraissse and hold powerrr for him you did not ssssee that upon herrr he looked up at the sky in exasperation of course i missed that aspect completely i could not imagine why falconsbane would allow her to keep her magegift intact when an adept should be able to block it or render it useless by burning the channels but if she didnt have enough to challenge himbut did have enough to carry powerssshe would make the perrrfect vesssel treyvan concluded exactly hydona replied he could ussse herrr to carrrry powerrr from hisss sacrificesss he could generrrate powerrr frrrom herrr by hurrrting herrr and best of all darkwind concluded grimly he could exhaust her power without touching his own that made it possible for him to work spells that dont disturb the energyflows around here at all because its all internal power that is how hes been doing things without my sensing them sssensing them treyvan opened one eye i thought you had given up yourrr magessskillsss i have he replied firmly but i can still sense the power flows and the disturbances when someone tampers with them as long as im not inside the vale that is that heartssstone isss a problem darrrkwind treyvan said unexpectedly it isss distorting everrrything in the area of the vale asss if it were a thick warped pane of glasss and when thingsss come into thiss area like the ssserpent it isss attracting them i am ssssurprisssed that no one in therre hasss noticed the problemsss darkwind shook his head compressing his lips tightly if i say what id like towell thats vale business and the elders business and you are outssssidersss treyvan replied rolling his eye in exasperation and if your father dissscovered you had been ssspeaking of vale busssinesss to outsssiderssss what then would he cast you out it might be worth it darrkwind thisss isss involving more than jussst ksssheyna the broken heartssstone beginsss to affect the area outssside the vale no he shook his head emphatically i have a duty to my clan and to what the tayledras are supposed to be i guess he thought for a moment i suppose im just waiting for the moment that they all bury themselves and i can find out where kvala or ktreyva are now and i can go get some help may that be ssssoon hydona sighed too true he eyed the sun and stood up then hesitated a moment you know my personal reasons for giving up magicandwell i wouldnt admit it to anyone but you butim beginning to think that may have been well a little shortsighted treyvan tilted his head i will not ssay that i told you the ssame i know you did but now he frowned if the heartstone is attracting uncanny things it is probably a good idea not to rescind that vow look what happened to the one mage who tried casting spells outside the vale a good point treyvan acknowledged but you ssstill show adeptpotential do you not would that not attract creaturesss asss well ass sspellcasssting he tilted his head the other way a dissstinct liability to a ssscout i would sssay he flushed treyvan im not stupid i thought of that i swore i wouldnt spellcast i never swore i wouldnt keep my shields treyvan laughed aloud good you are asss canny as i could wish flightlesss ssson he had to laugh himself well nera has things well in hand for now you have youngsters to get back to and ii guess id better finish out my patrol tell dawnfire the good news if she doesnt know already and figure out how best to phrase nyaras request to the elders treyvan chuckled ssshe wont be moving far or fasst for a few dayss if im any judge of human ssshapesss youll have ssome time to think darkwind sighed i hope so he replied it isnt going to be easy starblade is not going to like this chapter eleven elspeth skif peered through the foggy gloom of neardawn wishing he had eyes like a cat he watched for possible trouble as elspeth stoodliterally on her saddle trying to read the signpost in the middle of the crossroads gwena stood like a stone statue a distinct improvement over a horse in a similar situation before they had left bolthaven elspeth had taken quentens advice quite literallyand very much to heart for one thing shed consulted with him about disguises in lieu of being able to ask kerowyn now they wore something more in the line of what a pair of prosperous mercenaries would wear mercs would be best quenten had decided after a long discussion and taking into consideration the fact that no amount of dye would stain the companions coats tell people who ask youve been bodyguards for a rich merchants daughter and thats where you got the matched horses if you say youre mercs no one will bother you and you can wear your armor and weapons openly just put a coat of paint on those shields or get a cover for them theyd given him carte blanche and a heavy pouch of coin hed grinned when skif lifted an eyebrow over the selection of silks and fine leathers quentens agent brought back from the bolthaven market clothing that was loose and comfortable and so did not need to be tailored to them to look elegant we want you two to look prosperous hed said first of all only a prosperous merc would be able to afford horses like yours even if you did get them in the line of duty and secondly a prosperous merc is a good fighter no bandit is ever going to want to bother a mercenary who looks as welloff as you will the last place a merc puts his money is in his wardrobe if you can afford this youre not worrying about needing cash for other things but the jewelry skif had protested youve turned most of our ready cash into jewelry a freelance merc wears his fortune quenten told him if you need to buy something and you dont want to spend any of those outland gold coins because it might draw attention to you break off a couple of links of those necklaces take a plate from the belt hand over a ring or a bracelet thats the way a merc operates and no one is going to turn a hair very few mercs bother with keeping money with a moneychanging house because it wont be readily accessible in fact only about half of even bonded mercs have a running account with the mercenarys guild for the same reason where youre going every merchant and most good inns have scales to weigh the gold and silver and theyll give you a fair exchange for it skif thought about what he said then sent quentens agent back to the bazaar to exchange the rest of their valdemaran and rethwellan gold and silver for jewelry he had to admit that the ornaments he got in exchange a mixture of brand new and worn with use were a great deal less traceable than the valdemaren coin he felt like a walking targethis old thief instincts acting up againbut he knew very well that when he was a thief hed never ever have tackled two wealthy fighters especially when they walked with their hands on their hilts and never drank more than one flagon of wine at a sitting quenten had been right a wealthy cautious fighter was someone that tended not to attract trouble still hed complained to elspeth their first night on the road that he felt like a cheap tavern dancer with his necklaces making more noise than his chainmail elspeth had giggled saying she felt like a northprovince bride with all her dowry around her neck but she had no objections to following quentens advice he still resented that a little hed made a similar suggestionthough he had suggested they dress as a pair of landed hillfolk rather than mercsand she had dismissed the notion out of hand but when quenten told them to disguise themselves she had agreed immediately maybe it was simply that hed suggested plain unglamorous hillfolk and quenten had suggested the opposite skif had the feeling she was beginning to enjoy this she was picking up the kind of swaggering walk the other welloff mercs they met had adopted and she had taken to binding up her hair with bright bands of silk and some of the strands of garnet and amethyst beads quenten had bought there were eyecatching silk scarves trailing from the hilt of need and binding the helm at her saddlebow she looked like a barbarian and he got the distinct impression she liked looking that way her eyes sparkled the moment they crossed into a town and found a tavern and she began grinning when other mercs sought them out to exchange stories and news one night shed even taken up with another prosperous female freelance selina ironthroat and had made the rounds of every tavern in town the gods only know what they did i dont even want to think about it at least she came back sober even if she was giggling like a maniac if half the stories those other mercs told me about selina are true her mother would never forgive me not only that she took the inevitable attempts at assignations with a cheerful good humor that amazed him hed expected her to explode with anger the first time it happened she had been the center of a gossiping clutch of guild mercs but as the evening wore on one by one theyd drifted off leaving her alone for a moment that was when a merc with almost as much gold around his neck as she wore had tried to get her to go off with himand presumably into his bed he readied himself for a brawl then shed shocked the blazes out of him shed laughed but not in a way that would make the man feel she was laughing at him and said in a good approximation of rethwellan hillcountry dialect oh now that is a truly tempting offer tis in very deed but i misdoubt ye want to make me partner there feel ive left im alone shed nodded at skif who simply gave the merc the look dont mess with my partner and turned back to his beer with one cautious eye on the proceedings he gets right testy when he thinks hes gonna be alone truly he does she continued a friendly grin on her face her eyes shining as she got into her part ye see his last partner left im all by imself one night and some sorry son of a sow snuck up on im when he wasnt payin attention an hit im with a bottle her face went thoughtful for a moment twas sad thate not only took it out on is partner gods grant th puir man heals up quick e took it out on th lads as took the puir fellow off he hates havin no one to watch is back he truly do the other merc looked at skif who glowered back gulped and allowed as how he too hated having no one to guard his back then lets buy you a drink lad shed exclaimed slapping him so hard on the back that hed staggered when times be prosperous tis only right t share em no hard feelins among mercs eh now where are ye bound for oh yes indeed she looked and acted the part a far cry from the competent but quiet princess of valdemar who never had seen the inside of a common tavern in her life as he waited for her to decipher the sign he wondered as he had wondered several times before this if she wasnt enjoying it a bit too much she dropped down into her saddle by the simple expedient of doing just that her feet slipping down along the sides as she fell straight down and he winced that was one of keros favorite tricks and it always made men wince were on the right road if we go straight ahead she said thats dark wing road and we dont want it its going into the pelagiris forest in a couple of leagues and it doesnt come out until it hits the edge of the dhorisha plains no towns no inns no nothing we want this one its still the pelagiris road and in a while itll meet the high spur road and that takes us to lythecare on the map this dark wing road had looked to be a very minor track but it was just as wellmaintained in reality as the high spur road they expected to take of course now that shed pointed out what it was it was obvious that it went in the wrong direction but with all this dark mist confusing his sensesim all turned around in this fog he complained thats what you get for being a city boy she replied ridiculously cheerful for such an unholy hour get you off of the streets and you cant find your way around she sent gwena to join him then took the lead his companion followed after with no prompting on his part the fog muffling the sounds of hooves and the jingle of harness his nose was cold and the fog had an odd metallic taste and smell to it he hated getting up this early at the best of times the fog made it that much worse youre just as much citybred as me he countered resentfully a harder edge to his voice than he had intended since when did you get to be such an expert on wilderness travel she swiveled quickly and peered back at him hardly more than a dark shape in the enshrouding fog whats wrong with you she asked astonishment and a certain amount of edge in her voice as well nothing he said quicklythen with more truthwell not much i hate mornings i hate fog and theres something thats been bothering meyoure different its as if youre turning into kero or even selina ironthroat so what if i am she countered who would you rather have next to you in troublekero or mousy little princess elspeth who would have let you try and figure out where we were going and what we were doing whats wrong with turning into kero thats assuming that i am i happen to think youre wrong about that now it was his turn to be surprised hed never heard her refer to herself as a mousy little princess before and while she had sometimes railed about things to him shed never turned on him before uh he replied cleverly or is it just that i wont let you take care of me is that the problem he heard the annoyance in her voice that meant she was scowling youve been sulking since we left bolthaven and im getting damned tired of it as long as i let you make all the decisions everything was finebut this is my trip and im the one with the authority and you know it i pull my own weight skif i was perfectly capable of doing this trip by myself in fact i was ready to i admit i didnt think about disguisesand you were right about that idea but the fact is if id been able to go on my own i was intending to travel by night and hide by day and if anyone saw me i was going to pretend i was a ghostrider and scare the blazes out of him its not that youre making the decisions its just the changes in you youre sohearty he said feebly youre kind of loud actually everybody notices us wherever we go i thought the point was to keep from drawing attention to ourselves she snorted and it wasnt ladylike you think these costumes arent going to draw attention to us come on skif were walking advertisements for the life of the merc sure im loud thats what a woman like berta would be like selina ironthroat i spent that night studying her ill have you know im competing for mens money in a mans world and im doing damn well at it and the more i advertise that fact the more jobs ill be offered in fact ive been offered jobs quite a few of them i turned them down saying we were going off to take another job with a caravan we were picking up at katashinain oh he replied feeling overwhelmed admittedly he hadnt thought much about the part he was supposedly playing certainly not the way she had she had everything motives background charactereven an imaginary job that would give them an excuse to turn down any other offers dont cosset me skif she said her voice roughened with anger im sick to death of being cosseted kero wouldnt and you know it this is exactly the kind of job shed love shed be right beside me slapping those drunks on the backand if she had to i bet shed be hauling them off to bed with her too elspeth he yelled before he thought there she said triumphantly you see whats the matter dont you think i know about the simple facts of a man and a woman an ordinary man and woman not heralds the kind of people who are driven by the needs of the moment just what exactly are you trying to protect me from the idea that drunk strangers grab each other and hop into strange beds and proceed to forn he tried but he couldnt help himself he emitted an inarticulate moan each others tails off she finished right over the top of him and i deliberately didnt use any of the ten or so rude words i know for the act just to avoid bruising your delicate sensibilities i can swear with the worst of the mercs if i have to and i know hundreds of filthy jokes and furthermore i know exactly what they mean ive spent lots of time with keros skybolts and they treated me just like one of them skif i grew up im not the little sister that you used to leave candy for and i dont need you to shelter me from what i already know a pause during which he tried to think of something to say stop treating me like a child skif im not a little girl anymore i havent been for a long time and thats the problem he thought unhappily she wasnt a little girl anymore and he wasnt sure how to act around her it wasnt that competence in women bothered himhe loved talia dearly and he looked up to kero as to his very own captain for she was one of the few at court to whom his background meant nothing in particular it was seeing that confidence in elspeth that bothered him he couldnt help but think that it wasnt confidence it was a foolish overconfidence the headiness of freedom the warnings quenten had given him had made him wary to the point of paranoia every time someone approached her he kept examining them for some sign that they werent what they seemed that they were really bloodpath mages stalking her like a cat stalking a baby rabbit she just doesnt understand he confided to his companion thinking that she at least would sympathize therere all those mages out there quenten warned us about she doesnt even think about them she doesnt watch for them and shes not trying to hide from them but you warned her about everything quenten said cymry said answering his thought you told her everything you knew she may be right about hiding in plain sight you know why would a mage look for someone like her to have magegift everyone knows mages cant be fighters besides dont you think shes as capable as you are of telling if someone is stalking her yes but in fact she continued thoughtfully its entirely possible that she would know sooner than you she does have mage abilities even if they arent trained quenten said that power calls to power and shes keeping a watch on the thoughts of everyone around her dont you think shed know another mage if one came that close to her yes but he lapsed into silence because that wasnt all or even most of what was bothering him shed grown up all right she was no longer anything he could think of as a girl and whether it was the new attitude or the new clothing or bothhe couldnt help noticing just how much she had grown up certainly the new clothing far more flamboyant than anything she wore at home enhanced that perception it seemed almost as if she had taken on a new life with the new persona maybe it was also at least in part the fact that no one was watching them together there was no one to start rumors no one to warn him that she was not exactly an appropriate partner for an exthief no one to wink and nod whenever he walked by with her no one to ask with arch significance how she was doing lately the friends had been as annoying as the opponents but now both were gone far out of distance of any gossip and he was free to look at her as elspeth instead of the heir to the throne and he was discovering how much he liked what he saw she was handsome in the same vibrant way kero wasand admit it he thought to himself youre more than half in love with kero clever witty with a ready laugh that more than made up for her whiplash temper oh she was a handful but a handful he wouldnt mind having by his sidedear gods a sudden realization made him blush so hotly he was very glad that the fog was still thick enough to hide it it wasnt outraged sensibilities that made him yelp at the idea of her entertaining one of those mercs in bedit was jealousy the very last emotion hed ever have anticipated entertaining especially over elspeth he didnt want her running off with someone else he wanted her to run off with him he must have been giving an ample demonstration of his jealousy over the past few days surely she had guessed long before he had but now that he thought about it she didnt seem to notice anything except his increasing protectiveness motherhenning she called it this wasnt the first time shed complained about it but it was the first time she had done so at the top of her lungs she might not have noticed his attraction but she had certainly noticed the side effects i guess shes really mad he thought guiltily and cleared his throat hoping to restart the conversation and get it turned back onto friendlier ground she didnt say anything but she didnt turn around and snap at him either the growing light of dawn filtered through the fog enveloping them both in a glowing pearly hazeand it was a good thing they were both wearing their barbaric merc outfits the companions just faded into the general glow and if theyd been wearing whites theyd have lost each other in a heartbeat this kind of mist fuddled directions and the apparent location of sound too he peered at her fogenshrouded shape up ahead of him it looked uncannily as if she was bestriding a wisp of fog itself try something noncommittal ask something harmless did quenten say why adept jendar is living in lythecare when the school he founded is all the way back up near petras in rethwellan he asked trying to sound humble dont try to sound humble skif she replied waspishly it doesnt suit you then she relented and unbent a little he thought perhaps she turned again to make certain he was still following and hadnt halted his companion in a fit of pique sorry that wasnt called for ahhe did tell me some jendar wants to be down here in jkatha so hes somewhere nearer his shinain relatives but he doesnt want to be in katashinain because its really just a tradecity and it practically dries up and blows away in the fall and winter what did he mean by that skif asked puzzled i should think a tradecity would have anything hed want she paused let me see if i can do a good imitation of quenten imitating jendar her voice shifted to that of a powerful old mans with none of the querulousness skif expected i want fabulous food carpets hot bathhouses and decent shops beautiful women to make a fool of me in my old age servants to pamper me outrageously and merchants to suck up to me when im in the mood to buy something skif chuckled elspeth did an excellent imitation when she was in a good moodand from the sound of it she had shaken her foul humor i have the feeling im going to like keros uncle as much as i do her i think im going to like the old man she said echoing his thought quenten also said that there were two reasons jendar didnt retire in great harsey even though the school and the village begged him to the first was that great harsey is a real backwater too far for a man his age to travel to get to petras even if it is less than a days ride away the other is that he said that if he stayed the new head would never be a head hed always be consulting with jendar and never making any decisions for himself he thought that would be a pretty stupid arrangement her voice shifted again let the youngster make his own mistakes the way i did you certainly havent been hanging on my coattails quenten and youre doing just fine she paused again and said significantly jendar obviously believes in letting people grow up i get the point skif muttered i get the point it wasnt far now to the turnoff but elspeth was beginning to wonder if shed make it that far and she wondered also what happened to a herald who murdered his companion once in a while she wished there was such a thing as repudiation by the herald and this was one of those times the summer heat was bad down here it was worse without trees to give some shade the pelagiris forest lay somewhere to their right but there wasnt a sign of it along this road way except for the occasional faint fugitive hint of pine well youre certainly smug today elspeth finally said to gwena when for the fourth time a sensation as of someone humming invaded the back of her mind she pushed her hat up on her forehead and wiped away the sweat that kept trickling into her eyes what gwena replied her ears flicking backwards what on earth do you mean you were humming to yourself elspeth told her crossly if you were human youd have been whistling tunelessly might i add its damned annoying when someone is humming in your head its not something a person can just ignore you know im just feeling very good gwena replied defensively picking up her pace a little to the surprise of cymry who hurried to match her hooves kicking up little clouds of dust is there anything wrong with that its a lovely summer day oh really a candlemark ago you were complaining about the heat well maybe im getting used to it gwena tossed her head her mane lashing elspeths wrist and added maybe its you maybe youre just being testy her mindvoice took on a conciliating tone is it the wrong moontime dear no its not as you very well know besides that has nothing to do with it elspeth snapped without thinking skif is being a pain in the tail skif is falling in love with you gwena replied dropping the conciliating tone you could do worse i know he is and i couldnt do worse she said conscious only of her annoyance im not talking about differences in rank or background either and dont you start playing matchmaker hes a very nice young man and im not the least interested in him all right all right all right gwena said sounding surprised at her vehemence forget i said anything gwena closed her mind to her chosen and elspeth sighed it wasnt just skif and his problem that was bothering heror even primarily skif it was something else entirely it was a feeling one that had been increasing every step she rode toward lythecare the feeling that she was being herded toward something some destiny like a complacent cow to the altar of sacrifice as if she were doing what she should be doing and she didnt like it not one tiny bit everything had fallen into place so very neatly she could almost tally up the events on her fingers first kero showed up with a magic sword then elspeth having seen real magic at work firsthand just happened to get the idea that valdemar needed mages then kero just happened to back that up having had to deal with mages herself in her career all that could have been mere coincidence but not the rest why was it that within a month she was attacked by an assassin who may have been infiltrated into haven magically there was a magic attack on a major border postmanned by keros people so an accurate report got back and the council for some totally unknown reason seemed to be forced into letting her go look for mages and lo as if in a book kero just happened to have kept up contact with her old mage who happened to have kept up contact with his old teacher who happened to be keros uncle and doubly likely to cooperate no one had stopped them on this trek no one had even recognized them as far as elspeth knew everyone was so helpful and friendly it was sickening even the mercs seemed to take her stories at face value there was no sign of ancar or his meddling everything was ticking along quietly just like it was supposed to occur they were barely a candlemark away from the turnoff for lythecare and the companions were so smug about something she could taste it gwena was humming again and suddenly she decided that she had had enough that is it she yanked so hard on her reins that gwena tripped went to her knees and scrambled back up again with a mental yelpand cymry very nearly ran into her from behind she turned to look at him he stared stupidly back at her as if wondering if she had gone mad thats it she said that is it i am not playing this game anymore what now skif looked at her as if certain she had gone mad i am being herded to something and i dont like it she snapped as much for gwenas ears as his i did want to do this and valdemar certainly needs mages but i am not going to be guided by an invisible hand as if i were a character in a badlywritten book this is not a foreordained quest i am not in a prophecy and i am not playing this game anymore with that she dismounted and stalked off the side of the road to a clearing like seemingly all wayside clearings in this part of jkaroughtha it was a bit of grass surrounded by fenced fields of grain with a couple of dusty tall bushes and a very small well she sat down beside the well defiantly and crossed her arms skif dismounted his expression not the puzzled one she had expected but something she couldnt read he walked slowly over to her the companions following with her reins trailing on the ground well she said staring up at him he shrugged but the conflicting emotions on his face convinced her that he knew something she didnt i am not moving she said firmly suppressing the urge to cough as road dust went down her throat i am not moving until you tell me what you know about whats going on he looked helplessly from side to side then his companion whickered and looked him in the eyes nodding as if to say you might as well tell her i thought so she glared at gwena who flattened her ears you should have told me in the first place itwas the companions skif said faintly they well they sort ofganged up on their heralds when you first wanted to go looking for mages the heralds that didnt want to let you go like your motherwell they kind of got bullied they what she exclaimed and turned to gwena surprise warring with other emotions she couldnt even name it had to be done gwena replied firmly you had to go it was important thats not all skif said looking particularly hangdog for one thing they absolutely forbid you to be told what they were doing for another theyre the ones that suggested quenten in the first place they said he was the only way to an important mage that they could trust i knew it she said fiercely i knew it i knew it i knew they were hockdeep in whatever was going on i knew i was being herded like some stupid sheep she turned to skif ignoring the companions did they say anything about the shinain she demanded if im going to do this i am by damn going to do it my way well he said slowly no not that i know of we dont know anything about the shinain goddess gwena said alarm evident in her mindvoice shes not something valdemar has ever dealt with were not sure we trust her you cant manipulate her you mean she replied angrily no she could be like iftels god she could care only for the welfare of her own people thats all we know some of what she is and doesbut its not something we want to stake the future of valdemar on gwenas mindvoice rose with anxiety elspeth cut her off what do you have to say about this she asked skif you i mean not the companions iuh he flushed and looked horribly uncomfortable idont know really what the companions think of it hes lying his companion is giving him an earful but iuh from everything keros said the shinain probably could give you the teaching and if they couldnt they would know someone who could he gulped and wiped sweat from his forehead with his sleeve kero trusts themnot just her relatives i meanand so does her companion i know that much gwena snorted of course sayvil says she trusts them contrary old beast shed say that just to be contrary elspeth ignored the waspish comment fine she turned to stare into gwenas blue eyes i am going to katashinain and i am going to see if the shinain know someone to train me she turned the stare into a glare that is where i am going and you are not going to stop me ill walk if i have to ill buy a plowhorse in the next village but i am not going to lythecare and that is my final word on the subject she raised her chin and stared defiantly at all of them now are you with me or do i go on alone less than a candlemark later they passed the turnoff to lythecare heading straight south to katashinain and gwena was giving her the most uncomfortable ride of her life in revenge but every bruise was a badge of victoryand i hope ill still believe that in the morning when i cant move chapter twelve darkwind this patrollike all the others latelyhad been completely uneventful this is almost too easy darkwind thought making frequent checks of the underbrush beside the path for signs of disturbance a week now that nyaras been hiding with us and theres nothing from the other side nothing hunting her except that couple of wyrsa i caught on her trail no magic probes nothing the very quietude set all his nerves on edge of course her shielding is really outstanding falconsbane might not know shes here or even that she headed this way when she ran he could be hunting for her in another direction altogether that was what treyvan said hydona was of the opinion that falconsbane knew very well shed come this way but assumed she was in the vale she pointed out that in all the time falconsbane had been on their borderand everything nyara said indicated that he had been there for a very long timehed never directly challenged ksheyna he was only one adept after all and there were at least five adepts and ten times that many masters in ksheyna and even though none of them were operating at full strength the mages of ksheyna could still be more than he cared to meet in conflict especially when the conflict was over the relatively minor matter of the loss of a single changechild he can alwaysss make anotherrr hydona had said callously it isss unussual for one like himssself to keep a pet forrr longerrr than a few yearsss and oddly enough nyara agreed with hydonas analysis if he was angered at all his anger would have been for a loss not for the loss of me shed said more than a little piqued at having to admit that she was worth so little to her former master as an individual i mean very little to him he has threatened many times to create another to then see how i fared among his lesser servants as their playffin all that would goad him into action was that he had lost a possession if something distracted him from that anger he would have made only a token attempt to find me more to appease his pride than to get me back so it seemed for other than the pair of wyrsa there had been nothing in the way of activitynot along darkwinds section nor dawnfiresnot for that matter anyone elses except for moonmist she ran into a basilisk whod decided her little patrol area was a good one to nest in prying that thing out had taken five scouts and three days they didnt want to kill it if they didnt have to basilisks were stupid incredibly dangerous and ravenous carnivores who would eat anything that couldnt run away from thembut they werent evil they had their place in the scheme of things they dined with equal indifference on their own kills or carrion and there were few things other than a basilisk that would scavenge the carcasses of colddrakes or wyrsa but no one wanted a basilisk for a near neighbor not even the most ardent animal lover not even earthsong who had once unsuccessfully tried to breed a vulture for a bondbird but that was the only excitement there had been for days and there was no way that incident could have been related no one could herd a basilisk the best you could do was to make so unpleasant for it that it chose to move elsewhere no one in all the history of the tayledras had ever been able to even touch what passed for ones mind much less control it the histories said they were a failed and abandoned experiment like so many other creatures of the twisted lands a construction of one of the bloodpath mages at the time of the mage wars but perversely once abandoned the basilisk continued to persist on its own its just a good thing they only lay two or three fertile eggs in a lifetime he thought wryly or wed be up to our necks in them a broken swath of vegetation caught his attention and he looked closer only to discover the spoor of a running deer and the tracks of its pursuer an ordinary enough wolf pair from the small hooves it was probably a weanling separated from its mother it wouldnt have broken down the bushes if it had been an adult this is ridiculous he thought i might as well be a forester in the cleansed lands there hasnt been attbw worth talking about out here for the past week that was the way the area around a vale was supposed to look just before a clan move to a new spot no magicwarped creatures like the giant serpent no magemade things like the basilisk just normal animals relatively normal plant life maybe fathers been right about sitting and waiting for the heartstone to settleup ahead the forest thinned a little the sunlight actually reaching the ground in thick shafts these golden lances penetrated the emerald leaf canopy bringing life to the forest floor for the undergrowth was thicker here and there was even thin grass among the wild plum bushes he looked up at the hot blue eye of the sky as he reached a patch of clearing framed by treebranches vree soared overhead calmly he hadnt seen anything either in fact hed been so bored hed taken a rockdove and eaten it while waiting for darkwind to catch up it had been a long time since hed been able to hunt and eat while out on scout starblades answer to the fracture of the heartstone had been to wait and see what would happen hed insisted that the great well of power would drain itself slowlyheal itself in factuntil it was safe to tap into it drain the last of its energies construct a gate and leave darkwind had disagreed with his father on that as he had seemingly on everything else and up until the past week it certainly hadnt looked as if the heartstone was following his fathers predictions in fact if anything the opposite was true there had been more uncanny creatures more misborn attracted more actually trying to penetrate the borders and recently there had been the other developments the fact that the mages within the vale had been unable to sense the changes in energy flows outside it the fact that now most of the scouts bondbirds refused to enter the vale itself the perturbations that treyvan sensed but maybe that was all kind of the last gaspmaybe things have settled down maybe fathers right but when he considered that possibility all his instincts revolted yes but what if i just feel that way because if father is right it means that i am wrong at if i am wrong what does it matter other than if im wrong father will never let me forget ithe stopped for a moment hearing a thudding soundthen realized it was only a hare drumming alarm hind foot beating against the ground to alert the rest of his warrenprobably at the sight of vree is it just that i cant admit that sometimes he might be right on the other hand there was a feeling deep inside connected he now realized with the magesenses he seldom used that starblade was wrong dead wrong a heartstone that badly damaged could not heal itself it could only get worse and this calm they were experiencing was just a pause before things degenerated to another level i guess ill enjoy it while it lasts and stay out of the vale as much as possible he sent another inquiring thought at vree but the gyre had no more to report than the last time it was very tempting to cut everything short and go to see how nyara was doing so tempting that he fought against the impulse stubbornly determined to see his patrol properly done it might make up for the other days he had neglected it not really neglected itthere were the dyheli and then nyara his efforts at appeasing his conscience came to nothing it still wasnt done and if i hadnt been very lucky things could easily have slipped in he no longer worried that these temptations were caused by anything other than his own selfish desire to spend more time with the changechild nyara was good company in a peculiar way she was interested in what he had to say and just as interesting to listen to at least i can appease my conscience with the fact that im learning something about our enemy she was also as incredibly attractive as she had been the first time hed seen her if he had been a less honorable man her problematic virtue wouldnt have stood a chance which led him to revise his earlier assumptions to think that she wasnt in control of that part of herself she might even be completely unaware of it that would fit the profile of her master mornelithe falconsbane would not have wanted her in control of anything having to do with sexual attraction he would have wanted to pull the strings there which was one reason why darkwind had continued to resist letting her lure him to her bed he had no prejudice against her but he was not sure what would happen what little traps had been set up in her makeup that a sexual encounter would trigger that would fit falconsbanes profile too make her a kind of walking breathing trap that only he could disarm so anyone meddling with the masters would find himself punished by the thing he thought to enjoy with a set of clawsand sharp pointed teethlike she had he didnt think he was in any hurry to find out if his speculations were true either darkwind was not about to risk laceration or worse in a passionate embrace with her he was so lost in his own thoughts that he almost missed the boundary marker the blaze that marked the end of his patrol range and the beginning of dawnfires he glanced at the sun piercing through the trees but near the horizon it was time for thundersnow to take over for him and if he hurried he would have a chance to chat with nyara before he went to the council meeting he was already on the path to the hertasi village before the thought was half finished i think this is the best chance im going to have things have been so quiet they cant blame disturbances on your presence so im going to tell the council about you and put your request to them he told her as they both soaked up the last of the afternoons heat on the top of the bluff she didnt answer at first just turned on her back and stretched lithe and sensuousand seemed just as innocent of the effect it had on him as a kitten she wasnt even watching him she was watching a butterfly a few feet away from them that didnt stop his loins from tightening or keep a surge of pure unmixed lust from washing over him making it difficult to think clearly for a moment he sought relief in analyzing the effect that sexual impact she has cant be under conscious control she couldnt fake the kind of nonchalance shes got right now when she asked yawning delicately is it tonight this meeting he nodded hed explained to her the need to wait until a regular meeting so that her appearance would seem a little more routine shed agreedboth to his reasons and to the need to wait but in fact his real reasons were just a little different hed put off explaining what had happened in its entirety until he wouldnt have to face his father alone starblade in the presence of the rest of the elders was a little easier to deal with than starblade in the privacy of his own ekele where he could rant and shout and ignore anything darkwind saidand he tended not to take quite so much of his sons hide in public where there were witnesses both to his behavior and to what darkwind told him it is well nyara purred satisfaction brimming in her tone she blinked sleepily at darkwind her eyes heavylidded the pupils the merest slits though i still cannot travel should they grant me leave you will say that yes dont worry he replied im going to make that very clear in fact that was one of the points he figured he had in his favor nyara obviously could not move far or fast and he wanted to have a reason for why he had left her with the hertasi instead of putting her under a different guardian more competent starblade would undoubtedly say less sympathetic was what he would mean and if worse came to worst he wanted to have a reason for continuing to leave her here instead of putting her with a watcher of starblades choice you still seem fairly weak to me he continued and neras healer seems to think its a very good idea for you to stay with us until those cracked bones of yours have a chance to heal a bit more and that reminds me have you had any problems with the hertasi have they complained of me she snapped sharply twisting her head around to cast him a look full of suspicion he was taken a little aback why noits just that i wanted to make certain you were getting along all right if there was any friction i could move youmaybe to the ruins where the gryphons are its pretty quiet there no no she interrupted her voice rising as if she were alarmed then before he could react she smiled your pardon i did not mean that the way it may have sounded treyvan and hydona are wonderful and i like them a great dealas i expected to like anything mornelithe hated i learned early that whatever thwarted him he hatedand that what he hated i should be prepared to find good he knows about treyvan and hydona no no no she interrupted again hastily i am saying things badly today no it is only gryphons in general that he hates as he hates birdkin so i was prepared to like you he never told me why she shrugged indifferently and by now darkwind knew hed get nothing more out of her on the subject she had all the ability of a ferret to squirm her way out of anything she didnt want to talk about but if she likes them why wouldnt she want to stay near them it is the little ones she sighed pensively as if answering his unspoken suspicion i am very sorry for i am going to say something that will revolt you birdkin but i cannot bear little ones no matter the species she shuddered giggling in voices to pierce the ears running about like mad things shrieking enough to startle the deadi cannot bear little ones she looked him squarely in the eyes i have she announced no motherly instinct i do not want motherly instinct i do not want to see little ones for more than a short time at long intervals he laughed at her long face i can see your point he replied they are a handful and soon there will be two more this time the very little ones who cry and cry all night and will not be comforted who become ill for mysterious reasons and make messes at both ends no she finished firmly i care much for treyvan and hydona but i will not abide living with the little ones youve been getting along all right with the hertasi though he asked anxiously if he had to leave her here for any length of time it would be a good idea to make sure both parties were willing nera had indicated that he had seen no trouble with her but darkwind wanted to be sure of that sometimes the hertasi were a little too polite as well as one gets along with ones shadow she shrugged they are quiet they bring me food and drink they are polite when i speak to them but mostly they are not thereto speak to that is a wry smile touched the corners of her mouth and the tips of her sharp little canine teeth showed briefly i am well aware that they watch me but in their place i would watch me so all is well i pretend to ignore the watchers the watchers pretend they are most busy counting grass stems we both know it is pretense and politeness is preserved darkwind laughed she smiled broadly now i know why nera called her a very polite young creature as long as youre doing all right here he glanced at the setting sun i have to get back for that meeting i expect to have some trouble with it nyaras smile faded to a wistful ghost i wish i could tell you it would be otherwise but i doubt it will be so i only hope you do not come to regret being my champion he sighed and got to his feet i hope so too the windows of the ekele shook as his father pounded the table with his fist by all the gods of our fathers starblade stormed i never thought my own son would be so much of a fool darkwind stared at a patch of the exposed bark of the parenttree just past his fathers shoulder and kept his face completely expressionless at least it sounded like most of the tirade was over this was mild compared to the insults starblade had hurled at him at the beginning of the session then again it might simply be that starblade had run out of insults starblade shook his fist in the air not actually threatening darkwind but the implication was there if i didnt know better id swear i couldnt be your father ive never thats enough starblade interrupted old rainlance tiredly that is quite enough the quiet words were so unexpected especially coming from rainlance that both starblade and his son turned to stare in surprise at the oldest of the four elders rainlance never interrupted anyone or raised his voice except that he had just done both by now we all know that you think your shmm darkwindis the greatest fool ever born we also know precisely why you think that rainlance leveled a penetrating stare at starblade that froze him where he sat the fact is ive known you a great deal longer than darkwind and i think there are times when you allow some of your opinions to unbalance your judgment this is one of them it just so happens ive never shared your peculiar prejudice against the changechildren i wont go into why right now but i have several good reasons strong ones to disagree with you on that and i also do not share your view of darkwinds incompetence he coughed and shook his head in point of fact i think elder darkwind has done a fine job up until now a very fine job his peers trust him he has never let his private opinions interfere with his judgment and i dont see any reason to make a snap decision about this other of his i dont see any reason in fact why we shouldnt continue to help her rainlance looked pointedly at the other elder iceshadow who shrugged the crystals braided into his hair tinkling like tiny wind chimes shes not a danger where she is iceshadow said she hasnt caused any trouble that we know of snapped starblade iceshadow gave starblade a look of disapproval and darkwind knew hed scored at least one point iceshadow hated to be interrupted very well if you insist on that phrasing that we know of frankly i see no harm in letting her stay where she is until shes healthy and considering her request for safe passage then rainlance nodded starblade frowned angrily then pounced under strict watch darkwind may be a gullible boy being led by a pair of comehither eyes and a sweet voice but im not so sure this other may not be playing a deeper game i say she stays under strict watch with careful observers you cant get more careful than hertasi iceshadow remarked to the ceiling of his ekele and if shes leading darkwind around by his urges that ploy wont work on hertasi even stubborn pigheaded oldahmages will admit to that it was iceshadows turn to receive a glare but the elder ignored it winking broadly at darkwind when starblade turned away in disgust i think the hertasi will do as watchers rainlance said smoothly soothingly as he sought to heal the split in the council they are certainly quite competent but i do agree she should be kept as far from the vale itself as possible and if she causes any trouble if she even looks like shes causing any trouble starblade growled rainlance raised his voice a little and annoyance crept into it shell have to be dealt with shell find herself bound and staked and you can tell her so starblade shouted are you quite finished rainlance shouted back his temper frayed to the snapping point id like to get on with this if i may starblade sank back into his seat with an inarticulate mumble confining himself to angry glares at anyone who happened to glance at him rainlance closed his eyes for a moment and visibly forced himself to calm down darkwind had no sympathy to spare for him hed been on the receiving end of his fathers tempers too often to feel sorry for anyone else really darkwind rainlance continued opening his eyes his voice oozing reason and conciliation you must see this in the perspective of the vale and clan as a whole we really cant take her into the vale we cant take the chance however slim that she might be some kind of infiltrator im not asking for her to be brought into the vale darkwind replied echoing rainlances tone as much as he was able im just asking that she be allowed nearer right now shes in jeopardy shes hurt and she cant run the way the hertasi can i doubt shed be able to get away if something comes the border especially if its something thats come hunting especially for her she cant run she cant hide and magegifted or not she probably cant protect herself from any kind of trained mage iceshadow shook his head regretfully darkwind got the feeling that if this hadnt been so serious an issue he was so annoyed with starblade right now that he would have been glad to agree with darkwind just for a chance to spite his father no its just not possible and im sure she realizes that even if you dont after all look at what she is and what we arewere enemies or at least shes been on the enemy side and yet she came to us supposedly for help she admitted she was going to use us as a kind of stalking horse no she stays where she is and thats the end of it well said starblade his voice penetrating the silence that followed iceshadows speech like a set of sharp talons his eyes narrowed and a tight little smile on his lips since you seem so worried about her since you brought her into our boundaries in the first placeand since she is in your territoryi think its only fair that you be the one to undertake her protection even if it means you have to fall back on magery he looked around at the other elders isnt that fair i dont know rainlance began id say it is iceshadow said firmly ive never been happy that when songwind left us his magic did as well darkwind i understand your feelings but ive never been happy about it you could be quite a mage if youd give it another try rainlance shrugged starblade cast his son a look of triumph it seems theres a consensus he said smugly darkwind managed not to jump up and hit him scream at the top of his lungs or do anything else equally stupid and adolescent in fact his reaction so completely under control seemed to disappoint his father he thought quickly and realized that unwittingly his father had not only left him an out hed given the scout a chance to do something hed been campaigning for all along hed have to phrase this very carefully very well elders he replied nodding to each of them in turn i overruled nyara may stay under the eyes of the hertasi i will undertake to keep the changechild protectedusing all the resources at my disposal is that your will rainlance nodded thats fine iceshadow said starblade looked suspicious but finally gave his consent done said rainlance you have the councils permission as stated good darkwind said then if that is the consensus i will have the other scouts keep an eye out for her and stand by for trouble i will recruit whatever dyheli i can find to stand guard and i have no doubt there will be plenty of volunteers since she helped save one of their herdsi will ask dawnfire to look for help among the tervardi and i will see if the gryphons are willing to work some of their protective magics he managed not to grin at starblades expression for once hed managed to outmaneuver his father but there was no feeling of triumph as he left the meeting the fight had been too hard for that instead he was weary and emotionally bruised like someones been beating me with wild plum branches he climbed down out of the ekele before anyone else it would have been a courtesy to wait for the eldest to descend first but he wasnt feeling particularly courteous right nowand he really didnt want to chance his father ambushing him for a little more emotional abuse it was dark enough around here that he should be able to escape provided he did the unexpected and he was getting rather good at doing that so he hurried off into the cover of the thick undergrowth taking exactly the wrong pathone leading to the waterfall at the head of the vale instead of the exit it passed the heartstone though not near enough to see the damaged pillar of stone its cracked and crazed exterior only hinting at the damage echoed across the five planes and visible to anyone with even a hint of magesight he felt it though as he passed an ache like a bruised bone a sense of impending illness a disharmony if hed had any doubts about it healing itself earlier they were dispelled now it hadnt healed itself it had only gotten worse now it left a kind of bitter lingering aftertaste in the back of his mind if it had been a berry hed tasted he would have labeled it poisonous without hesitation so he did something he had never thought he would do in his lifetime he shielded himself against it the air immediately seemed cleaner and the sour sense of sickness left him there was only the hint of incenselike smoke from the memorial brazier at its foot the flame that commemorated the lives lost when the heartstone fractured now all he had to contend with was the bad taste the meeting had left in his mouth he started to look for a way to double back to the path he wanted to take when he remembered that there was another hot spring at the foot of the waterfall it wasnt a big waterfall but it was a very aumtive one it had been sculpted by iceshadow himself back when the vale had first been constructed and the cool water of a tiny stream fell into a series of shallow rock basins to end in the hot pool of the spring below each of the basins had been tuned although darkwind had no idea how something like that was done the music of the falls was incredibly soothing just what i need right now that decided him instead of retracing his steps he took the path all the way to the end and as if to confirm that he had made the right decision as he entered the clearing containing the pool the moon rose above the tree level touching the waterfall and turning it into a shower of flowing silver and diamond droplets if you didnt know better youd swear there was nothing wrong here in the vale its that peaceful and no one absolutely no one was there of course that might have been because this particular pool had once been a popular trysting spot and there was not a great deal of romance going on in the vale anymore most of the young tayledras were scouts and they seldom came this far in now as for the restdarkwind suspected the mages were suffering perhaps without realizing it from the same sickened feeling the heartstone induced in him that was not the sort of sensation likely to make anyone think of lovemakinghe wondered how many of them had thought to cut themselves off from the stone not many he decided shedding his clothes and leaving them in a heap beside the pool its their power their lifeblood theyd rather feel ill than lose their connection to it they wouldnt be able to draw on it if they shielded themselves against it idiots then he left all thought of them behind as he plunged in a long flat dive into the hot water of the pool he came to the surface and floated on his back letting it soothe the aches in his muscles as it forced him into a state of relaxation only then did he realize how tightly he had been holding himself and how many of those aches were due to tension he drifted for a while losing himself deliberately in the sound of the falling water the changing patterns of the sparkling droplets the silence turning merman said a shadow at the entrance he swam lazily to the edge rested his arms on the sculpted rim and looked up into dawnfires amused eyes she looked down on him a faint smile playing on her lips her hair loose her boots in her hand not that im aware of he said lightly unless you saw something i didnt know about probably not she knelt down beside him put her boots down beside her then unexpectedly seized his head in both her hands leaned down to waterlevel and presented him with the most enthusiasticand expertkiss hed ever had from her his mouth opened under her questing tongue and he clutched the rim with both hands convulsively whatshe never gets aggressive he became aware that not all the heat coursing through his veins was due to the temperature of the water he closed his eyes went passive and let her lips and tongue play with his until he was breathless her hair fell around him enveloping him in her own silken waterfall she released him and he nearly slid under that was for going back and saving my dyheli she said sitting back on her heels balancing there as if she had no weight at all i didntexactly he regretted having to confess that he had very little to do with it if that was what she had in mind for a reward she dismissed everything he was going to say with a wave of her hand i know theres that changechild involved in it and it did the magicbut you stayed with them and you mindcalled them theyd never have found their way out without that it did the magic she doesnt know nyara is female his attention was captured and held as she began removing her clothing in the most provocative way slowly teasingly he found himself watching her with parted lips first the tuniclacings loosened then pulling the garment slowly over her head then the breeches inching them down over her hips sliding them a little at a time down her long lithe legsall the while maneuvering so that the shirt covered all the strategically important parts of her then the shirt followed the tunic at the same tantalizingly slow speed at that moment she seemed just as exotic as nyara and just as desirable nyara if she doesnt know nyaras a female theres no harm in not telling hershe was down to a short chemise now and she winked once then vanished into the shadows reappearing before he had time to think why she had left i put the in use marker at the entrance she said not that theres anyone likely to be here tonight i knew you were at the meeting and i waited to catch you to thank you properly but you didnt go the way i thought you would i had to chase you loverhawk she stood in an unconscious pose at the rim moonlight softening the hard muscles and turning her into something as soft and quicksilver as a changechild i wanted to avoid father he said filling his eyes with her i thought so she said and laughed i figured knowing you that as long as you were here youd probably decide to soak him out of your thoughts ive been checking every pool between here and rainlances ekele im glad you found me he said softly she sat on the rim slid out of the chemise and into his arms so t i hisred and buried her hands in his damp hair her lips and tongue devouring him teasing him doing things no woman had ever done to him before his hands slid down her back to cup her buttocks and hold her against him she strained into the embrace as if she wanted to reach past his skin to merge with him her kiss took on a fiercer quality and she worked her mouth around to his neck biting him softly just beneath his ear while he ran his hands over every inch of her reexploring what had become new again and making her shiver despite the heat of the pool he gasped as she nuzzled the soft skin behind his ear then worked her way back to the hollow of his throat and gasped again when she untangled her fingers from his hair and slid them down his chest slowlyteasingly not in here he managed to whisper as he grew a little lightheaded from the combined heat of the water and his blood she laughed low and throatily all right she began to back up one tiny step at a time rewarding him for following her with her clever fingers which were now hard at work well below the waterline and threatening to make his knees go to jelly at any moment they reached the edge of the pool right beside the waterfall where some kind soul had left a pile of waterproof cushions and mats she turned away from him to hoist herself up on the rim he caught her by the waist lifted her up and held her there nibbling his way up the inside of her thighs until it was her turn to gasp she buried her hands in his wet hair and her fingers flexed in time with her breathing then she clutched two fistfuls of hair pulled him away and swore at him half laughing get up here you oaf she hissed or ill get back in the water and do the same to you you just might drown we cant have that he chuckled and joined her tumbling her into the cushions nibbling and touching making her squeal with laughter and surprise he only had the upper hand for a moment then she somehow squirmed out from beneath him and pulled a wrestlers trick on him then she had him on his back bestriding him a wicked smile on her face as she lowered herself down a teasing hairs breadth at a time he arched to meet her his hands full of her breasts catching her unawares she cried out and arched her back driving herself down onto him their minds met as their bodies met and the shared pleasures enhanced their own as she felt his passion and he experienced every touch of his fingers on her flesh she roused him almost to the climax again and again building the passion higher and higher until he thought he would not be able to bear another heartbeatthen she loosed the jesses and they soared together deargods he whispered as they lay together in a trembling symmetry of arms and legs she giggled the reward of virtue i think i shall strive to be virtuous he mumbled then exhaustion took him down into sleep before he could hear her reply if she even made one verbally when he woke she had moved away from him to lie in a careless sprawl an arms length away hed expected as much hed learned over the past few months that she was a restless sleeperafter more than once finding himself crowded onto a tiny sliver of sleeping pad the moon was just retreating behind the rock of the waterfall he slipped into the pool for a moment to rinse himself off after his exertions warm up his muscles and to cross to the other side without rustling the undergrowth that would surely wake her as the sound of someone swimming would not on the other side of the pool he used his shirt to dry himself and pulled on the rest of his clothing he hated to leave her like that but she is as curious as two cats and i am not certain i want to answer all the questions she is likely to have when she wakes she ask about the rescue and she would also want to know about the changechild and when she found out that nyara was female am not ready to fend offfits of jealousy he thought wearily fathers accusation are bad enough hers would be worse and their is no reason for yet not that he hadnt entertained a fantasy or two but they are only fantasies and will ytn so he told his conscience firmly still they are things i would rather she did not know about she is not old enough to accept them calmly for the simple daydreams that they are hmmer saffiffing or accept that sometimes the fantasy can be as fulfilling as the reality he moved quickly and quietly along the pahs of the vale pausing now and then to take his bearings once outside he went on alert although this was where the scouts had their ekeles they did not equip them with removable ladders for nothing but the night lay over the forest as quietly as a blanket on a sleeping babe only twice did he pause at an unusual sight or sound the first time it was a pair of bondbirds huge snowwinged owls chasing each other playfully he recognized them as ktathi and corwith and relaxed a little if they were up it meant the uu was under watch the second time he stopped was to hail his older half brother wintermoon the bondmate of those owls who knelt beside the trail dressing out a young buck deer wintermoon one of two children of starblades contracted liaison with a mage of ktreva had none of either parents magetalents and only enough of mindmagic to enable him to speak with his bondbird the other child a girl had apparently inherited it all but she was with ktreva and out of starblades reach the adept had never forgiven his eldest son for his lack of magery and wintermoon had responded by putting as much distance between himself and his father as clan and vale would permit he had no wish to leave ksheyna he had an amazing number of friends and lovers for so taciturn and elusive an individualit was simply that he also had no wish to deal with a father who had nothing but scorn for him good hunting darkwind said with admiration eyeing the size of the bucks rack wish i could do that well in the daylight he had no fear that wintermoon had taken anything other than a bachelor his brother was too wise in the stewardship of the forest to make a stupid mistake in his choice of prey wintermoon laughed part of his attempt to put distance between himself and starblade had been to bond exclusively to owls he had become completely nocturnal and was one of the nighthunters and nightscouts and encountered his father perhaps twice in a moon if that often it becomes easier as time goes on and ktathi there lends me his eyes thats most of it how does darkwind began puzzled wintermoon followed the thought with quicksilver logic he perches above my head i simply have to adjust my aim to match practice enough against trees and its not so bad so little brother do you want any of this darkwind shook his head no im fine for the next few days dawnfire could use some though she was telling me her larder was a little bare lhw should make up for my k her like that ill see she gets it alls clear the way back to your place fair skies that was a clear dismissaland really about as social as wintermoon ever got outside of the walls of his ekele wind to thy wings darkwind responded and continued up the trail he didnt entirely release his hold on caution but he did relax it a little wintermoon was completely reliable if he said it was clear he didnt mean just the trail he meant for furlongs on either side once at his ekele he woke vree up to let down the ladderstrap for him there was still enough moon for the gyre to see though he complained every heartbeat and went back to sleep immediately without waiting for darkwind to climb up even though he was relaxed and utterly weary he couldnt help thinking about nyara as he drifted off to sleep he found himself thinking of her suspiciously the way his father would or wintermoon for that matter hes more like father than he knows or will admit he wished hed been able to persuade the elders to allow her closer and not just for her protection no it would have been much easier to keep a watchful eye on her if shed been say in one of the dead scouts abandoned ekeles of course starblade would have opposed that out of its sheer symbolism still she was within reach the hertasi were clever and conscientious there were the gryphons three or four tervardi several dyheli herds and dawnfire between here and the vale and her only other escape routes lay across the border into the outlands i cant see her going back that way he yawned finally giving in to sleep she was running away why in the name of the gods would she ever run back chapter thirteen interlude nyara huddled before her father abject terror warring with another emotion entirely pure wanton desire she hated it that need that fire that drove her to want himand even as she hated him she hated herself for feeling it even though she could not control that need even though she knew it was built into her as he had sculpted her flesh to suit him he had also sculpted her mind and her deepest instincts it didnt matter none of it mattered half the time she suspected he had inserted that same selfhatred into her purely for amusement and when he had called her this night she had obeyed the call that was built into her too for all that she had run away from him for all that she had deluded herself telling herself that she could would resist him she could not and had not and now she groveled here at his feet longing for his touch hating and fearing it despising herself for thinking that she could escape him so easily it had been no trouble to deceive the little hertasi who guarded her they were not creatures of the night and a simple illusion of her slumbering form in the darkness of the little cave they had given her was enough to satisfy them she had not lied until tonight she had thought she could escape his reach she had not purposefully misled the hertasi healer eitherher weakness and pain were not feigned nor were her injuries but what the healer did not know was the extent to which she could ignore pain and fight past weakness when she had to that was how she had found the strength to counter her fathers magic and free the dyheli herd that was how he had forced her to come to him when he called overriding the pain with his own commands and as usual he said nothing at first merely smiled and waited until she had abased herself sufficiently to drive home how helpless she was how much of her life lay within his power if she resembled a cat mornelithe falconsbane was a feline one that stood upon two legs and walked and talked but there his connection with humanity ended long silky hair poured uncut down his back the color a tawny gold that he maintained magically else he would have been as bleachedsilver as any tayledras adept long silky hair grew on most of his face carefully groomed and tended by a madeservant whose only role was to brush her master whenever he called his slitpupiled eyes were a goldengreen like watery beryls his canines sharper and more pronounced than hers his pointed ears were tufted at the tips and the silky hair continued down his spine in a luxurious crest ending at the clefts of the buttocks for the rest he was as perfectly formed and conditioned as a human could be with a body any sculptor would have wept to see as nyara knew intimately since he had emerged from his stronghold to call her to the border of ksheyna and the beginnings of his domain he had chosen to dress for the occasion in soft buckskin leather that perfectly matched his hair darkwinds disparaging comments to the contrary mornelithe seldom wore elaborate costumes in fact within his own quarters he went nude as often as not which nyara also knew intimately she knelt before him until her legs ached from the stones and bits of branch beneath themwhich he would not permit her to clear away he lounged on a blanket of fur spread over a fallen tree trunk by a servant making him an impromptu throne the golden magelight above his head glistened on his hair the tips of the fur and on the batwings of his two giant guardianbeasts half wolf half something she could not even name creatures whose heads loomed even with his when he stood some of her scars had come from the teeth of those beasts lessonings in her proper place in the scheme of things and the proper demeanor to display thus she had learned not to move until told or speak until spoken to well he said at last his voice deep calm smooth and soothing there was a wealth of warm amusement in his voice which meant he was pleased she soon discovered why you took my invitation to flee to the birdfools as if you had thought of it yourself dear daughter he chuckled i am proud of you she burned with humiliation so it had all been his idea from the inattentive guards to the captive dyheli herd without a doubt he had planned everything knowing how she would react to anything he presented in her path she should have knownyou followed my plan to the letter my child he said with approval i am very pleased with you i assume that they invoked a truthspell upon you of a kind she whispered shivering with shamed pleasure as his approval warmed and excited her the birdkin do not trust me yet they keep me in a dwelling of sorts at the border with hertasi and one birdkin scout to watch one scout only mornelithe threw back his head and laughed and the guardianbeasts hung out their tongues in frightening parodies of a canine grin they trust you more than you think little daughter if they set only one to watch you are there no other watchers on you she could not help herself she was compelled to answer truthfully but she could make him force it out of her a word at a time and perhaps he would grow tired before he learned all the truth let him think it was fear that tied her tongue two she whispered hertasi she shook her head he frowned and she trembled tervardi then she shook her head again hope growing thin that he would lose interest surely not dyheli no his frown deepened and she lost any hope of hiding her friends identities what are they speak he reached out a tendril of power to curl about her a hand of pain tightened around her mind though not so much that she could not speak her body convulsed gryphons she whimpered through tears of agony and anger gryphons the pain ceased and she slumped over her knees head hanging hands clasped together tightly she fought to control her tears so that he would not know how she had come to like the pair and so have yet another weapon to hold over her gryphons his voice deepened and the guardianbeasts growled gryphons here this requiresthought i will have more of these gryphons out of you my child but later she looked up cheeks still wet with tears he was looking past her into the dark forest his mind elsewhere than on her then he took visible hold of himself and gazed down on her sniffing when he saw her tears he leaned down and lifted a single drop on a long talontipped finger and licked it off slowly eyes narrowed as he watched her closely she shook with a desire she could not control and that only he could command he smiled with satisfaction this birdfool he said leaning back into his fur his name darkwind she told him his eyes lit up from within and again he laughed long and heartily and this time the beasts laughed with him in gravelly growls darkwind the son of my dear friend starblade what delicious irony has starblade seen you my dearest she shook her head baffled by his words what a pity hed have been certain to recognize you as you would recognize him if you saw him he laughed again and she dared a question starblade i have seen him this starblade of course you have my precious pet he was my guest here for many days mornelithes smile deepened and he licked his lips many many days you dined upon his pet bird do you not recall and i gave him the crow to replace it once he learned his place beneath me nyaras eyes widened as she remembered the tayledras mornelithe had captured and broken how she had been so jealous of the new captive who had taken her place however briefly in mornelithes attentions how she had so amused mornelithe with her jealousy that he had chained her in the corner of his bedroom like a pet dog so that she was forced to watch him break the new captive to his will and he the former captive without a doubt would remember her my little love if you can contrive a way for starblade to see you i should very much be pleased mornelithe said caressingly it would enlarge my vengeance so well to know that he knew that i had an agent in place on his ground subverting his beloved son it would be delicious to know how his mind must burn and yet he could do and say nothing about it i do not think i can manage that she told him timidly he never leaves the vale and i may not go within it ah well mornelithe said waving the idea aside if you can it would be well but if not i am not going to contrive it at the moment his expression grew abstracted for a moment she ventured another question is there something that i should know my lord he looked down at her and smiled shaking his head it is no matter there are other matters requiring my attention just now a bit weightier than this my vengeance has waited long and it can wait a little longer she sighed with relief thinking that he was finished with her that he had forgotten about treyvan and hydonaonly to have her hopes crushed the gryphons he said suddenly looking down at her again and piercing her with his eyes tell me about the gryphons everything compelled by his will she found herself reciting all that she knew about them in a lifeless expressionless voice their names the names of their two fledglings what they looked like where they nested why they had chosen to nest there and that there was going to be another mating flight shortly he sat straight up at thatand she huddled in on herself shivering her teeth chattering free from his compulsion and sick inside with her own treachery she looked up at him from under her lashes his eyes were blank his thoughts turned entirely within even his guardianbeasts were quiet holding their breath not wanting to chance disturbing him thenhe stared down at her and pointed his finger at her demandingly the talon fully extended more he barked his words and will lashing her like barbed whips tell me more but she had nothing more to tell him and so he punished her lashing her with his mind inflicting pain that would leave no outward signs nor anything that a healer could read but whose effects would linger for days and the more he hurt her the more she yearned for him burned for him until the pain and desire mingled and became one obscene whole she groveled and wept and did not know whether she wept because of her shame or because of her need finally he released her and she lay where he left her panting and spent but still afire with longing for him enough he said mildly softly you will learn more i will call you again when my other business has been attended to and you will tell me what you have learned you will try to ensnare darkwind if you can but you will learn more of the gryphons yes she whispered you will return here to me when i call you yes she sobbed you will remember that my reach is long i can punish you even in the heart of the ksheyna vale if i choose starblade has put my stamp on their heartstone and i can reach within at my will his eyes glittered and he licked his lips slowly deliberately yes do not think to truly escape me i created you flesh of my flesh my dearest daughter and i can destroy you as easily as i created you he reached down and ran a talon along her chin lifting her eyes to meet his and in spite of herself she thrilled to his touch she said nothing she only looked helplessly into his eyes his glittering cold cruel eyes should you try to hide should you reach ksheyna vale i will call you even from there and when you come to me you will find that what you have enjoyed at my hands will be paradise compared to what i deal you then he held her in the ice of his gaze you do understand dont you my dear daughter she wept silent tears running down her cheeks and making the magelight above his head waver and dancebut she answered him oh yes she answered him yes father and what else he asked as he always asked what does my daughter have to tell her doting father and she answered as she always answered iiilove you father i love you father i love and serve only you and her tears poured down her cheeks as she repeated it until he was satisfied chapter fourteen elspeth katashinain was a city of tents at least that was the way it looked to elspeth as she and skif approached it they had watched it grow in the distance and she had wondered at first what it was that was so very odd about it it looked wrong somehow as if something about it was so wildly different from any other city she had ever seen that her mind would not accept it then she realized what it was that bothered her the colors the city was nothing but a mass of tiny brightlycolored dots she could not imagine what could be causing that effectwas every roof in the city painted a different color and why would anyone do something as odd as that why paint roofs at all what was the point as they neared the dots resolved themselves into flat conical shapes which again seemed very strange brightly colored conical roofs what kind of odd building would have a conical roof then she realized they werent buildings at all those were tents she was looking at hundreds perhaps thousands of tents now she understood why quenten had said that katashinain dried up and blew away in the winter somewhere amidst all that colored canvas there must be a core city with solid buildings and presumably inns and caravansaries but most of the city was made up of the tents of merchants and when trading season was over the merchants departed leaving behind nothing at all she glanced over at skif who was eyeing the city with a frown whats the matter she asked just how are we ever going to find the talesedrin in there he grumbled look at that theres no kind of organization at all that we can see she interrupted believe me theres organization in there and once we find an inn well find someone to explain it to us if there wasnt any way of organizing things no one would ever get any business done theyd be spending all their time running around trying to find each other and when in your entire life have you ever known a successful disorganized trader his frown faded you have a point he admitted i dont like this complained gwena i am perfectly well aware that you dont like this elspeth replied crisply i think this is a mistake a major mistake its still not too late to turn back elspeth did not reply prompting gwena to continue if you turned around now we could be in lythecare in elspeths patience finally snapped and so did the temper she had been holding carefully in check dammit i told you i wont be into doing something like i was the gods own sheep i dont believe in fate or destiny and im not going to let you lot move me around your own private chessboard i will do this my way or i wont do it at all and you and everyone else can just find yourself another questing hero do you understand me her only answer was a deep throaty chuckle and that was absolutely the final insult she was perfectly ready to jump out of the saddle and walk to katashinain at that point and dont laugh at me she snarled biting off each mental word and framing them as single words instead of an entire thought so that her anger and her meaning couldnt possibly be misunderstood absolute mental silence then gwena repliedtimidly as elspeth had never heard her speak in her life with her companion but i wasnt laughing her temper cooled immediately she blinked it hadnt really sounded like gwena and shed never known a companion to lie so if it wasnt gwena who was it she asked if it wasnt you who was it i gwena replied hesitatingly lagging back a little as skif rode on ahead blithely oblivious to what was going on behind him idont know a chill crept down elspeths spine she and gwena immediately snapped up their defensive shields and from behind their protection she searched all around her for someone who could have been eavesdropping on them it wasnt skif that much she knew for certain the mindvoice had a feminine quality to it that could not have been counterfeited and it wasnt cymry skifs companion other companions had only spoken to her once the night of talias rescue she could not believe that if any of them did so again that it would be for something so petty as to laugh at her that was as unlikely as a companion lying and besides if it had been cymry gwena would have recognized her mindvoice and said something katashinain stood on relatively treeless ground in the midst of rolling plains while there were others within mindhearing distancethere were caravans both in front of and behind themthere was no one near certainly not near enough to have provoked the feeling of intimacy that chuckle had in fact it was incredibly quiet except for the little buzz of ordinary folks thoughts like the drone of insects in a field the chill spread from her spine to the pit of her stomach and she involuntarily clutched her hand on the hilt of her sword you said a slow sleepy mindvoice gravelly and dusty with disuse as she and gwena froze in their places child you are very like my little student wlyana long ago so very very long ago and as the last word died in her mind elspeth gulped her mind churned with a chaotic mix of disbelief astonishment awe and a little fear it had been the sword that had spoken skif looked back over his shoulder hey he shouted arent you coming youre the one who wanted to go here in the first place but something about their pose or their expressions caught his attention and cymry trotted back toward them as he neared them his eyebrows rose in alarm whats wrong he asked urgently then when elspeth didnt immediately reply he brought cymry in kneetoknee with her and reaching out took her shoulders to shake her come on snap out of it whats wrong elspeth she shook her head and pushed him away gods she gulped her thoughts coming slowly as if she was thinking through mud dear gods skifthe sword keros sword he said looking into her eyes as if he expected to find signs that she had been mindblasted what about it it talked to me us i mean gwena heard it too he stopped peering at her and simply looked at her mouth agape no he managed yes gwena heard it too her companion snorted and nodded so hard her hackamore jangled a sword he laughed but it was nervous very nervous swords dont talkexcept in tales but i am a sword from a tale boy the mindvoice still had the quality of humor a rich but dry and mordant sense of humorand horses dont talk except in tales either skif sat in his saddle like a bag of potatoes his mouth still gaping his eyes big and round if elspeth hadnt felt the same way shed have laughed at his expression he looked as if someone had hit him in the back of the head with a board his mouth worked furiously without anything coming out of it finally it talks he yelped of course i talk it was getting better at mindspeech by the moment presumably improving with practice im as human as you are or i was once you were elspeth whispered when how did you end up like that and why a long story the sword replied and one that can wait a little longer get your priorities child get in there get shelter get a place to sit for a while then well talk and not before and not one more word could any of them get from it although the companions coaxed and cajoled along with the two heralds and so with all of them wondering if theyd gone quite quite mad they entered the tradecity of katashinain the inn was an old one deep paths had been worn into the stone floors and the courtyard paving and the walls had been coated so many times with whitewash that it was no longer possible to tell whether they had been plaster brick or stone the innkeeper was a weary incurious little old man who looked old enough to have been the same age as his inn the stone floors and the bathhouse indicated that the place had once catered to prosperous merchants but that was no longer the case now it played host to a variety of mercenaries and the more modest traders who would form caravans together or take their chances with themselves their own steel and a couple of pack animals their room was of a piece with the inn worn floor faded hangings at the window simple pallet on a wooden frame for a bed a tableand no other amenities the room itself gave ample evidence by its narrowness of having been partitioned off of a much larger chamber at least it was clean elspeth took need from her sheath laid the sword reverently on the bed and sat down beside itcarefullyat the foot skif took a similar seat at the head the companions though currently ensconced in the inns stable were present in the back of their minds so now is the time to find out if im having a crazyweed nightmare all right she said feeling a little foolish to be addressing an apparently inanimate object weve gotten a room at the inn the doors locked are you still in there of course im in here replied the sword acerbically both she and skif jumped where else would i be elspeth recovered first and produced a wary smile a good question i guess well are you going to talk to us im talking arent i what do you want to know her mind was a blank and she cast an imploring look at skif what your name is for one skif said i mean we cant keep calling you sword andhey you seems kind of disrespectful my holiest stars a respectful young man the sword chuckled though there was a sense of slight annoyance that it had been the male of the two who addressed her what a wonder perhaps i have lived to see the end of all things i dont think so skif replied hesitantly but you still havent told us your name trust a man to want that its there was a long pause during which they looked at each other and wondered if something was wrong do you know ive forgotten it how odd how very odd i didnt think that would happen another pause this time a patently embarrassed one well if that doesnt sound like senility forgetting your own name i suppose youd just better keep calling meneed its been my name longer than the one i was born with anyway skif looked at elspeth who shrugged all rightuhneed if that doesnt bother you when you get to be my age very little bothers you chuckle when youre practically indestructible even less bothers you there are advantages to being incarnated in a sword elspeth saw the opportunity and pounced on it how did you get in there anyway you said you used to be human its easier to show you than tell you the blade replied thats why i wanted you locked away from trouble and sitting down abruptly they were no longer in a shabby old that was long past being first quality they were somewhere else entirely another dry mental room in an inn a forge elspeth knew enough to recognize one for what it was brickwalled dirtfloored she seemed to be inside someone elses head a passive passenger unable to do more than observe she rubbed the sword with an oiled piece of goatskin and slid it into the woodandleather sheath with a feeling of pleasure then she laid it with the other eleven blades in the leather pack three swords for each season each with the appropriate spells beaten and forged into them a good years work and one that would bring profit to the sisterhood tomorrow she would take them to the autumn harvest fair and return with beasts and provisions her swords always brought high prices at the fair though not as high as they would be sold for elsewhere merchants would buy them and carry them to select purchasers in duchys and baronies and provinces that had nothing like the sisterhood of spell and sword but before they were sold again they would be ornamented by jewelers with fine scabbards fitted to them and belts and baldrics tooled of the rarest leathers she found this amusing what brought the high price was what she had created swords that would not rust would not break would not lose their edges swords with the setspell for each season for spring the spell of calm for summer the spell of warding for fall the spell of healing and for winter the spell that attracted luck valuable spells all of them daughter to a fighter and once a fighter herself though she was now a magesmith she knew the value of being able to keep a cool head under the worst of circumstances spring swords generally went to young fighters given to them by their parents the value of the spell of warding went without saying to be able to withstand even some magic was invaluable tosaya bodyguard with one of her summer swords no guard would ever be caught by a spell of deception or of sleep wealthy mercenaries generally bought her fall swordsor the nobleborn who did not always trust their healers and the younger sons of the nobleborn invariably chose winter blades trusting to luck to extract them from anything the ornamentation meant nothing anyone could buy a worthless courtsword with a mildsteel blade that bore more ornament than one of hers but her contact had assured her over and over again that no one would believe her blades held power unless they held a trollops dower in jewels on their hilts it seemed fairly silly to her but then so did the fact that most mages wore outfits that would make a cat laugh her forgeleathers were good enough for her and a nice divided wool skirt and linen shirt when she wasnt in the forge once every four years she made eleven swords instead of twelve and forged all four of the spells into a single blade those she never sold keeping them until one of the sisterhood attracted her eye proved herself as not only a superb fighter but an intelligent and moral fighter those received the yearswords given in secret before they departed into the world to earn a living never did she tell them what they had received she simply permitted them to think that it was one of her remarkable nearly unbreakable nonrusting blades with a simple healing charm built in after all why allow them to depend on the sword if any of them ever guessed she had yet to hear about it there was one of those blades waiting beneath the floor of the forge now she had yet to find someone worthy of it she would not make another until this one found a home thats what i was whispered the sword in the back of elspeths mind the scene changed abruptly a huge building complex built entirely of wood looking much like quentens mageschool there were only two differences that elspeth noticed no town and no stockade around the complex only a forest on all four sides with trees towering all about the cleared area containing the buildings those buildings looked very oldand there was another difference that she suddenly noticed flat roofs they all had flat roofs and square doorways with a squareknot pattern of some kind carved above them she was tired she tired often now in her old age a lifetime at the forge had not prevented joints from swelling or bones from beginning to achenor could the healers do much to reverse her condition not while she continued to work so she tottered out for a rest now and then compromising a little she didnt work as much anymore and the healers did their best while she rested she watched the youngsters at their practice with a critical eye there wasnt a single one she would have been willing to give a sword to not one in fact the only girl she felt worthy of the blade wasnt a fighter at all but was an apprentice magenow working out with the rest of the young mages in the same warmup exercises the wouldbe fighters used all mages in the sisterhood worked out on a regular basis it kept them from getting flabby and softas mages were all too prone to door becoming thin as a reed from using their own internal energies too often she watched that particular girl with a measuring eye wondering if she was simply seeing what she wanted to see after all she had started out a fighter not a mage why shouldnt there be someone else able to master both disciplines someone like her own apprentice vena to be precise vena certainly was the only one who seemed worthy to carry the yearblade this was something that had never occurred in all the years shed been forging the swords she wasnt quite certain what to do about it she watched the girls stretching and bending in their brown linen trews and tunics hair all neatly bound in knots and braids and pondered the problem the sisterhood was a peculiar group part temple part militia part mageschool any female was welcome here provided she was prepared to work and learn some useful lifetask at the same time worship was given to the twins two sets of gods and goddesses kerenal and dina karanel and dara healer crafter fighter and hunter shirkers were summarily shown the doorand women who had achieved selfsufficiency were encouraged to make their way in the outside world although they could of course remain with the sisterhood and contribute some or all of their income or skills to the upkeep of the enclave all this information flashed into elspeths mind in an eyeblink as if she had always known it those girls with magetalent were taught the use of it those who wished to follow the way of the blade learned all the skills to make them crack mercenaries those who learned neither supported the group by learning and practicing a craft or in healingeither herb and knife healing or healing with their giftsor very rarely taking their place among the few true priests of the twins at the temple within the sisterhood complex the creations of the crafters in that third groupand those mages who chose to remain with the enclavesupported it through sales and hireouts the sisters were a diverse group and that diversity had been allowed for only one requirement was absolute while she was with the sisterhood a woman must remain celibate that had never been a problem for the woman whose soul now resided in the blade called need interesting thoughin all her studies elspeth had never come across anything about the twins or the sisterhood of sword and spell not that she had covered the lore of every land in the world but the library in haven was a good onethere had been information there on any obscure cults on the other hand there had been nothing in any of those books about the cold ones and elspeth had pretty direct experience of their existence shed never found any man whose attractions outweighed the fascination of combining magecraft with smithery of course she thought humorously the kind of man attracted to a woman with a face like a horse and biceps rivaling his own was generally not the sort she wanted to waste any time on she sighed and returned to her forge the scene changed again this time to a roadway running through thick forest from a horseback vantage point the trees were enormous much larger than any elspeth had ever seen before so large that five or six men could scarcely have circled the trunks with their arms of course she had never seen the pelagiris forest stories picked up from mercs along the way assuming those werent exaggerated had hinted of something like this the fair was no longer exciting merely tiring she was glad to be going home but suddenly amid the everpresent pine scent a whiff of acrid smoke drifted to her nosecausing instant alarm there shouldnt have been any fires burning with enough smoke to be scented out here campfires were not permitted and none of the fires of the sisterhood produced much smoke a cold fear filled her she spurred her old horse which shuffled into a startled canter rolling its eyes when it scented the smoke the closer she went the thicker the smoke became she rode into the clearing holding the sisterhood to face a scene of carnage elspeth was all too familiar with scenes of carnage but this was the equal of anything shed seen during the conflicts with hardorn bodies systematically looted bodies lay everywhere not all of them female none of them alive the buildings were smoking ruins burned to blackened skeletons shock made her numb disbelief froze her in her saddle under it all the single questionwhy the sisterhood wasnt wealthy everyone knew thatand while no one lives without making a few rivals or enemies there were none that she knew of that would have wanted to destroy them so completely they held no secrets not even the making of the mageblades was a secret anyone could do it who was both smith and mage and willing to spend one month per spell on a single sword why had this happened and as importantly who had done it that was when vena came running weeping out of the forest face smudged with ash and smoke tearstreaked clothing and hair full of pine needles and bark again the scene changed to the forge she had seen before but this time there was little in the way of walls or ceiling left and again knowledge flooded her vena had been out in the forest when the attack occurred she had managed to scale one of the smaller trees and hide among the branches to observe now they both knew the answer to her questions who was the wizard heshain a magelord who had never before shown any notice of the sisterhood vena had described the badges on shields and livery of the large wellarmed force that had invaded the peaceful enclave and she had recognized heshains device why his men had systematically sought out and killed every fighter every craftswoman every fighter apprentice there had been mages with them who had eliminated every adult mage then they had surrounded and captured every apprentice mage except vena they fired the buildings to drive anyone hiding into the open and had eliminated any that were not young and magetalented the entire proceedings had taken place in an atmosphere of cold efficiency there were no excesses other than slaughter not even rapeand that had struck vena as eerily like the dispassionate extermination of vermin afterward though the bodies of both sides had been stripped of everything useful and anything that might identify them there had still been no rapine no physical abuse of the apprentices they had been tied at the wrists and hobbled at the ankles herded into carts and taken away vena had stayed in the tree for a full night waiting for the attackers to return then she had climbed down to wander dazedly through the ruins vena had no idea why the wizard had done thisbut the kidnapping of the apprentices told her all she needed to know he had taken them to use to augment his own powers to seduce subvert or otherwise bend the girls to his will they had to be rescued not only for their own sakes and that of the sisterhood but because if he succeeded his power would be magnified considerably quite enough to make him a major factor in the world a man who sought to increase his power in such a fashion must not be permitted to succeed in his attempt he had to be stopped right he had to be stopped by an old crippled woman and a halftrained girl this was a task that would require a fighter of the highest skills and a mage the equal of heshain a healthy mage one who could ride and climb and run away if she had to but there was a way if vena a young and healthy girl could be endowed with all her skills she might well be able to pull off that rescue one person could frequently achieve things that an army could not one person with all the abilities of both a mage of some strengthperhaps even the superior of heshainand a fighter trained by the very best would have advantages no group could boast that was their only hope so she had sent vena out ostensibly to hunt for herbs she needed in actuality it was to get her out of the way she was about to attempt something she had only seen done once and that had not been with one of her bespelled swords she took the hidden sword the one with the spells of all four seasons sealed to it out of its hiding place under the floor of the forge she heated the forge placed it in the fire while she wrought one last spellhalf magic and half a desperate prayer to the twain then when the blade was whitehot with fire and magic she wedged it into a clamp on the side of the forge point outwardand ran her body onto it pain seared her with a whitehot agony so great it quickly stopped being pain and became something else then it stopped being even that and what elspeth felt in memory was worse than pain though totally unfamiliar it was not a sensation like anything elspeth had ever experienced it was a sense of wrenching dislocation disorientationthen nothing at all literally no sight sound sense of any kind if she hadnt had some feeling that this was all just a memory she was reexperiencing shed have panicked and still if she had any choice at all she never ever wanted to encounter anything like this again it was the most truly profoundly horrifying experience she had ever had a touch connection feelings sensations flooded back all of them so sharpedged and clear they seemed halfraw grief someone was weeping vena it was venas senses she was sharing the spell had worked she was now one with the sword with all of her abilities as mage and as fighter and everything she had ever learned intact experimentally she exerted a bit of control moving venas hand as if it had been her own the girl plucked at her tunic and it felt to her as if it was her own hand she was controlling good not only was her knowledge intact but her ability to use it she need only have the girl release control of her body and an untrained girl would be a master swordswoman vena sobbed helplessly uncontrollably after the first rush of elation it occurred to her that she had probably better tell the child she wasnt dead or not exactly anyway the sword released its hold on them and elspeth sat and shook for a long time it was a small comfort that she recovered from the experience before skif did she had never been so intimately one with someones thoughts before especially not someone who had shared an experience like needs death and rebirth she had never encountered anyone whose thoughts and memories were quite sounhuman as intense as those memories were they had felt old sounded odd as if she was listening to someone with a voice roughened by years of breathing forge smoke and they contained a feeling of difference and distance as if the emotions need had felt were so distantor so foreignthat elspeth couldnt quite grasp them perhaps that made a certain amount of sense there was no way of knowing quite how old need was she had gotten the distinct impression that need herself did not know she had spent many many lifetimes in the heart of the sword imprisoned though it was by her own will that was bound to leave its mark on someone to make her in time something other than human it was possible nevertheless it was a long time before she was willing to open her mind to the blade again and to do so required more courage than she had ever mustered up before i wish you wouldnt do that the sword said peevishly the moment she reestablished contact what she replied startled close me out like that i thought i made it clear i can only see through your eyes hear through your ears when you close me out im deaf and blind oh she shivered with the recollection of that shared moment of pain disorientationand then nothing what would it be like for need in those times when she was not in contact with her wielder best not to think about it can you always do that she asked instead as long as you arent closed out i mean skif showed some signs of coming out of his stunned state he shook his head and looked at her with a bit more sense in his expression as if he had begun to follow the conversation once i soulbond the way i did with vena and most of my other wielders yes unless you deliberately close me out the way you just did i had forgotten that there were disadvantages to bonding to someone with mindspeech need seemed a little disgruntled you know how to shield yourselves and unless you choose to keep me within those shields with you that closes me out given some of what kero had told her about her own struggles with the sword elspeth was a little less inclined to be sympathetic than she might ordinarily have been need had tried not once but repeatedly to get the upper hand and command the captains movements when she was young and she had taken over keros grandmothers life from time to time forcing her into situations that had often threatened not only her life but the lives of those around her granted it had always been in a good cause butbut keroand kethryhad occasionally found themselves fighting against women women or things in a womans shape creatures who were frequently the equal in evil of any man and when that happened need had not only not aided her wieldershe had often fought her wielder more than once both women had found themselves in acute danger with need actually helping the enemy given that wellit was harder to be in complete sympathy with the sword poor kero elspeth thought im beginning to understand what it was she found herself up against here and that made something occur to her wait a minutekero had mindspeech why didnt you talk to her before this i was asleep the sword admitted sheepishly there was a time when all i could bond to were fighters with no special abilities whatsoever during that rather dry spell there was a long period between partners i am not certain what happened i didnt get a chance to bond properly because she didnt use me for long perhaps my wielder put me away perhaps she sold meor she might even have lost me i dont know but my bond faded and weakened and i slept and my wielders came to me only as dreams what woke you skif asked he sounded back to his old curious self i think perhaps it was the one before you kerowyn you said she began to speak to me if crudely but because i had been asleep for so very long i was long in waking then as i gradually began to realize what was going on and came to full wakefulness she brought me to your home need fell silent and all of themelspeth felt gwena back with her againwaited for her to speak gwena finally got tired of waiting well she snapped what then elspeth clearly felt the sword react with surprise what then i stayed quiet of course the protections about your land are formidable horse someone has changed the nature of the vrondi there they the what elspeth asked puzzled by the strange reference the vrondi child need responded impatiently you know what they are even though you have no mages within your border you use the vrondi constantly to detect the truth unbidden the memories of first learning the truthspell sprang into her mind think of a cloud with eyes said herald teren think of the spell and concentrate on a cloud with eyes she must have spoken it aloud for the sword responded exactly need replied with impatience clouds with eyes those are vrondi did you think they were only creatures of imagination since that was precisely what she had thought she prudently kept that answer to herself someone somehow has changed the nature of the vrondi and they are not the same in your land the blade said peevishly they look now they look for mageenergies when they see them they gather about the mage and watch and watch and they do not stop watching unless they see that the mage is also a herald and has one of your talking horses with him if a sword could have produced a snort this one would have so i kept silent what else was i to do i did not wish to call attention to myself that was when i drifted back to sleep again not as deeply i trust gwena responded dryly well no and i waited not only to be able to leave your land but to be passed to the one i had sensedyou not only a fighter but one with magetalent as well and mindspeech then i took you out and i woke just as well i think if you will forgive me childyou need me elspeth groaned inwardly though not at the pun the last thing she had any use for was yet another creature with an idea of what she should be doing oh gods she thought just what i wanted another guardian someone else with a quest that was not the end of her troubles as she soon learned both she and skif were exhausted but skif seemed a little more dazed than she possibly it was simply a matter of sex need had shown herself to be a little less than friendly to males and elspeth had no doubt that the sword had not made mental contact easy on him skif lay down on the bed his face a little dazed elspeth though she was tired also felt as if she needed to get on with her plans quickly before need could complicate matters it was possible of course that need could prove to be the magicteacher she so eagerly sought possiblebut a last resort to be considered only when she had exhausted all others including seeking the adept in lythecare she wasnt certain of needs powers and she wasnt certain if the blade was entirely to be trusted if she would run roughshod over skif what would she do to handicap other valdemaran males would she actually sabotage their training elspeth couldnt be sure so she wasnt going to take the chance when the sword had been put in her sheath with a promise that elspeth would not again block need out of her mind without ample warning and cause she went out for a breath of air and to begin to explore the tent city as she had been expecting there was a logical pattern to the streets of katashinain the farthest tents those all the way downwind belonged to the beast sellers near to them were those who sold the things one would need for a beast everything from simple leads and halters for sheep and collars for dogs to the elaborate tack for parade horses then came leather workers in general then the makers of glass metal and stonework then textile merchants and finally nearest the core city sellers of food and other consumables the core city itself contained a very few shops it consisted mostly of the dwellings of those few who remained here all year and the inns there were dozens of those inns ranging in quality from a mudwalled dirtfloored oneroom ale house to a marble palace of three stories whose supposed amenities ranged from silk streets through magecrafted delicacies to the very personal and intimate attendance of the servant of ones choice the innkeeper had not gotten any more explicit than that but elspeth reckoned wryly that a whore by any other name still plied his or her tradepresumably with expertise it might be nice to experience service like that one daythough without she thought with a little embarrassment anything more personal than a good massage but for now she had a great deal more on her mind than that for one thing she had to find shinain this was katashinain city of the shinain after all once she found shinain she had to get them to talk to her then she had to find someone willing and able to put her in touch with talesedrin keros clan and she reckoned that the best place to find the shinain would be in the beast market they not only bred horses after all they also had herds of sheep and goats presumably they bought and sold both failing that she would try the textile merchants the shinain were great weavers and among those who treasured such pieces of art their carpets blankets and other textiles and embroideries were famed all the way up into valdemar so she went out to scout the beast market first she had hoped to slip away without disturbing skif who had fallen asleep on the bed exhausted by the strain of the strange day but no matter what need claimed about her own powers evidently attracting luck was no longer one of them she had no sooner gotten outside the door of the inn when skiff came panting up behind her she sighed and kept from snapping at him it was fairly obvious that he was not going to let her go out alone and it wasnt simply more of his motherhenning the peculiar look in his eyes told her all she needed to know he was infatuated with her and i ought to recognize infatuation when i see it since ive suffered under it myself he undoubtedly had convinced himself that he was in love with her wonderful she thought to herself as she headed determinedly toward her goal despite having him trailing along behind her just wonderful my partner thinks hes in love with me my companion wants me to become some kind of foretold hero my sword has a mind of its own and im going to have to find someone from an elusive tribe of an elusive people all on my own in a city where i dont even speak the language no somehow i dont think that attracting luck is on the list of active spellschapterr fifteen darkwind treyvan roused his feathers fluffing his crest and shaking his head his claws digging long furrows into the thick weedy turf he held his head high his muscles stiff with impatience darkwind glanced sideways at him and smiled a little a shadow passed over the scout and he looked up automatically but it was only a cloud passing across the sun vree was waiting for him back in the forest away from the temptation of treyvans crest feathers how long have you and hydona been mated he asked with pretended innocence twelve yearsss the gryphon replied rousing his feathers again and casting his own glance upward whatsss that got to do with anything and youve made quite a few mating flights havent you the scout continued his smile broadening treyvan was so preoccupied he didnt even realize that darkwind was teasing him well treyvan said with a sidelong glance at hydona hydona only roused her own feathers watching him coyly yesss if youve got so much experience at it he laughed reaching up to scratch behind treyvans eartufts dont you think you ought to be able to take your time about this one treyvan closed his eyes wearing an expression of longsuffering patience you a human alwayss in ssseason with matesss ambusshing you even when you are bathingyou tell me that you crrreaturess neverrr ssstop hydona made a choking sound her mate pointedly looked away from her darkwind knew that faint gargling from past exchanges with the pair she was trying not to chuckle he raised his eyebrows at her then gave her a broad wink she hid her head by turning it to the side but her shaking shoulders told him she was stifling outright laughter anyway treyvan continued in an aggrieved tone you know very well that i casst the initial ssspell thiss morrrning and you know verrry well that until we complete it with the sssecond ssspell itsss going to make me itchierrr than a plague of sssandfleasss i explained it to you often enough he shook his head and made a grinding sound with his beak i feel asss if my ssskin isss too tight he complained darkwind bit his tongue to keep from making a retort to that particular complaint in that case he said soothingly i had probably better leave you two alone oh hell live hydona countered controlling herself and her humor admirably trrruly he will youre rrready for what well do thisss time i hope not like the lassst time he flushed at the memory of the last time when he had been much younger he had been close enough to them and unshielded so that he had gotten caught up in the extremely potent magic of their mating spell the first spell that treyvan had mentioned was what actually made the mating fertile otherwise their sexual activity was purely for enjoyment the second would ensure conception and despite treyvans acerbic comment about humans always being in season the fact was that the gryphons were at least as active in that area as any humans darkwind knew ill be fine he told her im not fourteen anymore hydona laughed id notisssed she teased essspecially around dawnfirrre when will you be picking a mate uh the question took him by surprise so he settled for a gallant answer when i find a mate as magical as you are flattererrr she replied dryly well when you do perhapsss well all be rrready to ssssettle a new place together ssso that we can keep eyesss on each othersss sssmall onesss she looked over his head a moment off into the distance that isss the ultimate goal of ourrr being herrre you know she said thoughtfully werrre pioneersss of a sssort our kind came from sssomewhere about herrre you know very very long ago and trrreyvan and i are here now to sssee if it isss the time to rrreturn so you told me he said a long time ago she nodded as treyvan sighed and lay down in the long grass with a longsuffering look oh yesss she said ignoring her mate with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes we arrre herrre to sssee if we can raissse little ones brrring them into the magic of the land and prosssper if we do well more will come you know ourrr people and yoursss arrre ancient parrrtnersss from the daysss of the kaledain the hertasi too and othersss you may not have everrr ssseen beforrre it would be good if we could be partnersss again another surprise this time a much greater surprise hed been astonished to learn that the gryphons were fluent in the ancient tongue of kaledain a language so old that very few of either the tayledras or the shinain could be considered fluent despite the fact that both their current languages were derived from that parent but this revelation was a total surprise for there was nothing in the tayledras histories to indicate that the two species had been so close while he pondered the implications of that hydona reached over and gently bit treyvans neck the male gryphons eyes glazed and closed and the cere above his beak flushed a brilliant orangegold obviously her mind was no longer on the far past but on the immediate future and from the look on treyvans face his mind had been there for some time darkwind coughed uhhydona hmm the gryphon replied dreamily her own eyes bright but unfocused her thoughts obviously joined to treyvans whos watching the little ones he asked i cant ive got to be out on patrol i dont trust this quiet theyll be fine hydona replied releasing her mate long enough to reply theyve been told not to leave the nessst and if they called nothing could get to them beforrre wed be on top of it are you sure he persisted but hydona was nuzzling treyvans neck again and he knew there was no way he was going to get any sense out of her at the moment theyll be fine she mumbled all her attention centered once more on her mate despite being under shielding the sexual euphoria began penetrating even his careful defenses this was obviously the time to leave as he picked his way through the ruins a feeling of lightheadedness overcame him for a moment he looked back over his shoulder to see the two of them surging up into the cloudy sky hydona a little ahead of treyvan even as he watched they began an elaborate aerial display tumbling and spiraling around each other in a dance that was halfplanned and halfimprovisation this dance itself was part of the spell the resttreyvans extravagant maneuverswere designed to inflame himself and his mate and judging by the faint excitement he was feeling even through his shields it was having the desired effect as he turned his eyes back toward the ground another moving speck caught his eye though it was very high long experience enabled him to identify it as a redshouldered hawk one of the many breeds often used as bondbirds by the tayledras that made him think reflexively of dawnfire whose bird was a redshouldered and thatgiven all that hed been exposed to in the past few momentsmade his thoughts turn in an entirely different direction than they had been tending dawnfire rode the thoughts of her bondbird with the same ease that the bird commanded the currents of the sky theirs was a long partnership of seven years standing for she had bonded to kyrr at the tender age of ten darkwinds vree had been with him only four or five years the bird he had bonded to before that had been a shorterlived shriekowl gift of his older brother a shriekowl was not a practical bird for a scout but the tiny creatures were perfect for a mage which was what darkwind had been in that longago peaceful time shriekowls in the wild seldom lived beyond three yearsthe bondbird breed in general tripled that lifespan that was nothing near like the expected lifespan of the scouts birdstwentyfive to fifty years for the falcons larger owls and hawks and up to seventyfive years for the rarer eagles and shriekowls were tiny scarcely bigger than a clenched fist they ate mostly insects flew slowly and generally flitted from tree to tree inside a very small territory they could hardly be counted on to be an effective aid either on a scouting foray or to aid in an attack but the owls were charming little birds by nature friendly and socialin the wild they nested several to a treeand the perfect bird for a mage who only needed a bird to be occasional eyes and ears and to pass messages a mage did not necessarily need to bond to his bird with the kind of emotional closeness that a scout did nor did he need a bird with that kind of long expected lifespan all of the mages that dawnfire knew that she aed personally did bond closely with intelligent birds but it was not as necessary for them as it was for scouts scouts had to develop a good working partnerlike relationship with their birds and that required something with a long anticipated lifespan scouts spent as much as a year simply training their birds then it took as much as four or five more years to get the partnership to a smooth working relationship like the scouts the lives of the bondbirds were fraught with danger there had already been casualties among the birds and darkwind had warned his corps to expect more their enemies knew the importance of the birds as well as the impact a birds violent death had on his bondmate and often made the birds their primary targets dawnfire tried not to think about losing kyrr but the fact was that it could happen darkwinds father starblade had lost his bird in circumstances so traumatic that the mage had returned to the vale in a state of shock and actually could not recall what had occurred since he had been investigating a forest fire ignited by firebirds and since the birds themselves seldom reacted so violently that they set their homes aflame the other tayledras assumed that whatever had frightened the firebirds had probably caught and killed starblades perlin falcon that had been a set of very strange circumstances actually dawnfire remembered it quite vividly because her mother had been one of the scouts who had found the mage and had talked it over one long night with friends in her daughters presence there had been a sortie that had drawn most of the fighters off when word of the fire had reached the vale starblade had gone out to take care of it he had then vanished for many days he was found wandering dazed within the burned area near nightfall on the third day his bondbird was gone and he himself could not remember anything after leaving the vale injured burned dehydrated no one was surprised at thatbut when days and weeks went by and he still could not remember and when he chose to bond again with a crow from a nest outside of the valesome people like dawnfires mother wondereddarkwind had once said something after another of his angry confrontations with his fathersomething about his feeling that starblade had changed and was no longer the father he had known he blamed the change on the disaster dawnfire wasnt so sure starblade had not been that close emotionally to darkwinds mother though darkwind had never accepted that dawnfire was not at all certain that starblade would have been so badly affected by her death that his personality had changed she blamed the change on the death of starblades bird it seemed to her and her own mother that starblade had become silent and very odd afterward and that crow hed bonded to was just as oddshe pulled her thoughts away from the past and returned them to the present she was offduty today and had decided to indulge her curiosity in something darkwinds gryphons she had been terribly curious about them for a very long time and had even gone to visit them a time or two but the gryphons while still being cordial and polite had made one thing very clear to her the only visitor they truly welcomed was darkwind thathad hurt it had hurt a very great deal and not even darkwind knew how much it hurt she brooded on that as kyrr neared the the ruins coming in high over the forest ive never had anyone rebuff me like that she thought resentfully every other nonhuman ive ever met seems to think im a good person to deal with and to have as a friend tervardi kyree dyheli hertasieven firebirds teylldeer wolves the nonsentients why dont the gryphons want me around shed asked that question any number of times darkwind wouldnt tell her a great deal citing the gryphons desire for privacy that had only inflamed her curiosityat the same time she felt she had to respect that need but why wouldnt they be willing to meet with her once in a while away from their nest why was it that only darkwind was worthy of their attention over the months and years the unfulfilled questions ate at her and she had slipped over to the ruins more than once to watch the gryphons and their offspring from a distance darkwind had never forbid her that in fact he said once that she had eased one of his worries helping to keep an eye on the young ones while the adults were off hunting they had to spend a great deal of time in hunting they were very large flighted carnivores like the birdsofprey they resembled and they needed a lot of meat they ranged very far in order to keep from overhunting any area and they often spent an entire morning or afternoon away from the nest dawnfire had taken this tacit approval as permission to watch them whenever she wasnt otherwise occupied so long as she did it from afar feeling that she might be able to earn the acceptance of the adults with her unofficial guardianship of their offspring but then a week or so ago darkwind had specifically forbidden her to go anywhere near the ruins today without giving any explanation and that had driven her curious nature wild as well as rousing resentment in her that he had simply ordered her as if it was his right he probably shouldnt have told me she admitted to herself as her bird soared just at the border of the gryphons territory if he hadnt told me i probably wouldnt be doing thisbut then anger at him and his authoritative attitude burned away that thoughtan anger nearly a week old born of resentment and nurtured on his continued silence how dare he forbid her to go where she wanted to go on her own time he had no authority over her over her freedom he hadnt asked her simply and politely hed demanded that she promise then and there refusing to answer any questions either before she reluctantly promised or after he refused to explain himself or even talk about it her anger smoldered hot and grew hotter with every day that passed following anger had come suspicion slowly growing over the course of several days a feeling that he was hiding something and nothing had alleviated it since her suspicions centered around the changechild he was always with the gryphonshe was with them and with that changechild he wouldnt talk about either it was not unreasonable to suppose that the two were connectedand that there was something about the changechild that darkwind didnt want her to know hed never hidden anything from her before there was no reason why he should want to start now or so she had thought until this morning when an overheard comment told her something very important that darkwind had somehow left out of his few stories about the changechild has darkwind said anything more about the changechild iceshadow asked someone is she ready to leave yet she this changechild neuter in her mind suddenly took on a different face it was a she suddenly the senseless questions had sensible answers and there were plenty of reasons why darkwind would want her kept in the dark about this female especially if she was attractive and dawnfires imagination painted her as very attractive most changechildren were and there were the attractions of the exotic of coursenot that i care if hes enamored with the girl she told herself as kyrr soared a little closer to the gryphons nest its not as if were lifebonded or something we havent even traded bondbird primary feathers i would if he offered but we havent just coverts i dont exactly have a hold on himexcuses excuses and none of them meant anything not really damn him anyway she had given a promise and she never broke oneno matter what even if the person she had given the promise to turned out to be a worthless sneak so she had spent most of the morning trying to think of a way around that promise so that she could see what darkwind was really up to when he slipped off to his gryphon friends she wasnt entirely certain why she was tormenting herself it was as if she kept biting at a sore tooth it hurt but she just couldnt seem to stop doing it then the answer to her dilemma had occurred to her she had promised that she wouldnt go near the gryphons but she hadnt promised that kyrr would stay away and what kyrr saw she could see kyrr could be her way to see just what darkwind was really up to the only problem was that to do that she would have to hole up in her ekele and go into a full trance that was something she was secretly ashamed of that she could not make full contact with kyrrs mind unless she performed a full bonding she didnt know why scouts generally had no trouble using their birds senses there were one or two others who had the same trouble but no more than that darkwind had speculated that she found the experience of having her consciousness split to be too traumatic to deal with unless she was in a full trancesince in a full trance her consciousness wasnt really split normally this wasnt a handicap her communication with kyrr was otherwise excellent the big hawk was one of the most intelligent of all the scouts bondbirds and had no trouble with simply telling her what she needed to know kyrr could speak in full sentences she had a sense of humor and had no trouble in cooperating with her bondmate there had never been any rebellion or any real disagreements with kyrr but kyrr could not read facial expressions she could not pick up the nuances of behavior that dawnfire needed to know she wanted to know how he really felt about this changechild kyrr only understood things as they related to raptor feelings and instincts and she didnt want kyrr to misinterpret things that she saw in light of those instincts after all it was entirely possible that darkwind had other reasons for keeping her away legitimate reasons its entirely possible that pigs will fly too she thought sourly darkwind wasnt at the gryphons nest and neither were the gryphons surprised she sent kyrr ranging out to find them after a bit of searching she spotted them near the edge of the ruins where the forest began she must have passed them at a distance when kyrr flew in darkwinds figure blended into the landscape of tumbled stones and overgrown hillocks rendering him very difficult to see but the gryphons stood out against the ruins very clearly more clearly than she remembered in fact their feathers shone with color gold and redbrown and they seemed to capture and hold the sunlight shining in all the colors that kyrr could see and she couldnt for a moment their striking beauty drove all other thoughts from her mind then she wrenched her attention away to look for anything that might be the changechild but there were only the gryphons and darkwind with no sign of anyone else nor any of the signs that several days of occupancy would put around a hiding place in the ruins unless they were trying to conceal itand they had no reason tothere would be distinctive signs of habitation her anger faded and died giving way to embarrassment was i wrong she wondered as the gryphons fanned their wings in the sun and she and kyrr circled nearer she had never felt so stupid in her life she was just glad that she hadnt made this blunder in public was i just a suspicious jealous bitch was i overreacting to something that hadnt even happened it certainly looked like it as darkwind bade farewell to his two friends and slipped into the shadows of the forest she very nearly sent kyrr home but sheer curiosity kept her aloft circling above the two gryphons and something about their colors nagged at the back of her mind reminding her of a memory she couldnt quite put her finger on then it came to her as the larger of the two gryphons bit the neck of the smaller one in an unmistakable act of sexual aggression gods and ancestorstheyre going to mate thats why he didnt want me around them for a moment that was even more embarrassing she felt as if shed been caught watching the dyheli stallions and their mares for the sheer erotic amusement of it but theyd had matingflights before lots of them and darkwind had never forbidden her to go near what was it that was so different this time curiosity overcame embarrassment whatever it was she was going to find out as first one then the other of the gryphons launched themselves into the air she circled the sky around them keeping them in sight at all times the maletreyvanwheeled and stooped and circled his mate who hovered as he circled followed him in his dives and climbed beside him as he dove upward again this was not simply flightthis was an aerobatic dance breathtaking and beautiful and as impressive as anything she had ever witnessed the gryphons moved higher with every turn of the dance gaining altitude as the dives grew shallower the climbs steeper and the circles more fluid and sensuous they came even with kyrr then climbed above her continuing to climb higher as she tried to follow finally they climbed into regions where she couldnt follow leaving her gazing in wonder from belowthen there was just one single dot in the blue and it was growing larger dear godsthey mate on the wing like eaglesfor two minutes they fell together claws locked in ecstasyplummeting toward the earth so fast that the wind whistled in their feathers eyes closedthey arent going toat the last possible moment they broke apart spreading their wings with a crack as they caught the air and shot upward again side by side beauty so incredible that she couldnt breathewhen the beauty of the moment was shattered by the thunk of a heavy crossbow firing and a bolt streaking toward hydona dawnfire was watching the female at the moment that the broadbladed bolt ripped through the air changing its arc to meet the wing and shred it the female screamed as the wing collapsed the uninjured wing flailed wildly as she fell in a barelycontrolled spiral towards the ground the males scream of rage echoed his mates scream of pain he did a wingover and turned his climb into a killing dive claws extended as he followed his mate down the female crashed into the trees at the edge of the forest and was lost to sight the male followed an eyeblink behind her then a sudden flare of light from beneath the trees enveloped him in a tongue of white flame he screamed again but this time in pain not in rage the light held him suspended for a moment as he went limp then he simply dropped unconscious through the leafy roof of the forest all that saved him from a broken neck was the fact that it was a relatively short drop anger filled her whitehot anger and the urge to kill without stopping to think dawnfire sent kyrr in a nearvertical stoop down after them kyrrs instinct was to shriek with rage but dawnfire clenched the hawks beak shut no point in warning whoever it was that had perpetrated thisoutrage as she dove through the branches snaking through the obstacle course with desperate adjustments of her wings kyrrs blood boiled with rage it was all that dawnfire could do to keep her under control and quiet the bondbird wanted blood she wanted it now and she wasnt going to accept less kill she shrilled in dawnfires mind kill them all dawnfire gritted mental teeth and held to her tenuous control as they penetrated the last of the branches and broke out into the clear air beneath the forest canopy if i lose her now i lose her for all time ill never be able to control her in a rage againthere were two men with the unconscious gryphons she saw that in a moment one the one with the crossbow was standing guard over the unconscious male who lay in a pathetic and boneless heap at his feet the other was beside the female who was at least semiconscious he was unarmed dressed in closefitting leatherand he was without a doubt a mage one of the others who had manipulated himself into a form that was scarcely more than half human and he was doing something to the female gryphon dawnfire barely had time to take that all in at that moment the female gryphon sent up a shriek of heartrending agony the scream goaded kyrr into a rage that tore her loose from dawnfires control not that it mattered because dawnfire herself was so angered that she released control to kyrr to give her all the edge she needed screaming outrage they dove together in a fullscale attack claws extended and aimed for the mages eyes he looked upand his eyes were all dawnfire could seejust before something slammed into her and darkness swallowed her his eyeshis slitted eyesand his hatefilled sharptoothed smilechapterr sixteen elspeth elspeth swore silently as she caught a familiar profile out of the corner of her eye skif was following her again the turbaned merchant implored her to examine the clever workmanship of the leather pouch she was holding conveying grief that his profit margin had already been slashed to nothing elspeth lingered over her purchase haggling a few more coppers off the price of the beltpouch as she watched skif ghosting around the edge of the crowd keeping an eye on her he was very good it was unlikely that anyone around her realized that he was shadowing her in a bazaar full of foreigners of all shapes sizes and costumes neither of them stood out from the crowd trade season was at its height and the crowds of small traders mercs and the occasional pleasure traveler filled the aisles between the tentbooths it was not the easiest thing to spot skif as he skillfully used the crowds to cover his movements but he had trained her and she knew his moves better than anyone else could it was just a good thing that she was conscientious enough to keep her own watch out for other followers he could easily be distracting her enough to put her at hazard the scent of fine leather rose from the pouch in her hands as she pretended to examine it further the merchant swore she was impoverishing him this was getting annoying no it had gotten annoying already she had begun to lose her patience with him twice now she had gotten close to someone who had hinted he might know a shinain or twoand twice it had come to nothing the clansmen were proving incredibly elusive alas you should have been here in the spring said the folk in the fabric bazaar they are only here in the spring but i have some fine shinain rugs and you couldnt get a better bargain on them from a clansman herselfoh you should wait until the fall said the horse traders they never come here except in the fall now i have some outstanding shinain saddle mares well they were just here said the shepherds in a dialect so thick she could scarcely make out what they were saying talesedrin you say thats the blonds no ah you just missed them here last week they were buying up them new longhaired goats here last week here last season not here yetthe herders were the closest she had gotten at least they knew that keros clan had a number of blond members legacy of keros grandmother kethry but the shinain were proving horribly hard to find it seemed that no matter where she went they had either been and gone or they had not yet appeared cakes yesterday cakes tomorrow but never cakes today she muttered to herself keeping one eye on skif as she paid for the leather pouch and attached it to her belt clever pouch well worth having with a catch designed to foil pickpockets and a belt loop with woven wire glued between two layers of leather to outwit cutpurses well she wasnt going to get anywhere today the leather market was as empty of contacts as any other it was time to try something else but before she did that she was going to have to deal with skif before he drove her to give him a bloody nose the crowds hadnt thinned any sometimes she wondered what they were all doing here they couldnt all be selling to each other or there wouldnt be anyone in the booths but there were smaller merchants who had no booths picking up bargains for the luxury trade there were plenty of people who seemed to be here just to shop and enjoy themselves katashinain seemed to provide a kind of ongoing fair that lasted for months the security provided by the discreet bazaar guards encouraged folk to wear their finery and indulge themselves she headed back to the inn with her other purchases fruit and cheese and fresh bread in a string bag at her side she moved through the crowd briskly at a fast walk taking skif by surprise so that she managed to lose him around a corner well while he had been busy following her she had been paying attention to the layout of the bazaar she took a shortcut through the saddlers coming out in the midst of the rug sellers from there it was a another skip across to the food vendors she stopped just long enough to buy a parchment bag full of sugared fried cakes her nose caught the scent and she discovered she couldnt resist the rich sweet odor then she cut down the aisle of the scent sellers and from there she strolled directly into the inn she unlocked the door of their room and as she had expected she had beaten him back since he was supposed to have been taking a nap i wish youd take me with you need said querulously from beneath the bed it may be just a bazaar but you know very well there are people who are out there looking for you wonderful another mother hen i cant take you with me she said trying to keep her patience intact its bazaar rules no long weapons in the bazaar nothing longer than a knife unless its a purchase and then it has to be wrapped up you could carry me wrapped the blade suggested hopefully there wouldnt be any problem then then youd do me about as much good as a stick she snorted less youre not much good as a stick youre too awkward and not long enough before the sword could retort there was a sound of a key in the door and it opened as soon as the lock disengaged welcome back she said dryly uh hello skif said first startled then sheepish i suppose you couldnt sleep hmm she put her purchases on the rickety little table that was supplied with the room you know theres a little story ive been meaning to tell youi wonder if youve ever heard it its about herald rana and her old suitor from home he shook his head baffled youre a cruel child said gwena im getting tired of this she replied herald rana went back home for a visit last year and a young man who wouldnt give her a second glance back when she was the cheesemakers daughter decided that she was the most wonderful woman hed ever seen she shrugged it might have been the whites it might have been that shed matured quite a bit since the last time he saw her it really doesnt matter he followed her back to haven and then out on her circuit he got to be such a nuisance that she decided to do something about him so the next time he came up behind her in a market and put his arms around her she put him to the ground she raised one eyebrow at him that wasnt enough for him apparently because he kept following her but at a distance so she waited until he followed her out into the forest when she went to hunt a little fresh meat she paused significantly well skif finally responded she ambushed him and planted an arrow right between his legs im given to understand that she came close enough to his assets to shave them skif gulped i trust you take my point she turned away from him drew her knife and lopped off the tip of the cheese roll with an obvious enthusiasm that made him wince she stabbed the piece and offered it to him he declined you are a very cruel child gwena sounded more amused than accusatory very practical need retorted with a chuckle very weary she replied to both of them and took the cheese herself lets hope he gets the pointbefore i have to give it to him the sword and gwena joined in laughter oh i think he did gwena chuckled ill have a talk with cymry and see if she cant have a word with him shed better do something elspeth replied grimly or i will and this time herald or not ill be more direct priests and other religious travelers had their own special camping ground reserved for them away from the bazaar on top of a rise shaman kraheera shena talesedrin looked out over the crowded tents of the bazaar from his vantage point above it and smiled a little somewhere down there was a young woman accompanied by a tall young man who was looking for them not them specifically just the talesedrin since he and trevalen had arrived late this afternoon no less than four traders had come strolling up to their tent with the casually proffered information that someone was looking for talesedrin to each of those four kraheera had said nothing he had simply gone about his business of raising their tent his apprentice trevalen had thanked them politely but when he had shown no further interest in the subject the four had strolled onward ostensibly to visit some other tent dweller farther on but kraheera read the set of their shoulders and knew that they went away disappointed because he had not been interested in buying the rest of their information there was as much traffic in information in the bazaars of katashinain as there was in material goods he had not bought their intelligence because he did not need to and he let them know by his manner since they were no fools that he had his own ways of information reinforcing the shamans reputation for uncanny timely knowledge never hurt as sunset touched the tops of the tents with a sanguine glow another visitor reached the encampment of the shinain but this visitor had no interest in selling her information not to folk of the people of the plains not when her own son rode with them adopted into the clan of talesedrin by marriage this scarletclad visitor was welcomed within the newlypitched tent with jokes and news the brazier was fired for her and cakes and sweet tea were offered and accepted and when all the civilized amenities were completed and only then did rug seller dira crimson say what she came to say she kraheera and trevalen sat comfortably on overstuffed cushions placed on a carpet any of the rug traders would have offered their firstborn offspring for there is a girl the woman said her plump weathered face crinkling with a smile as she arranged the folds of her scarlet skirt about her feet she is a stranger and speaks with an accent that i would not know had i not journeyed once into valdemar with the clanwhere we had much profit the gods be praised kraheeras lips curled up in his own smile and he filled her cup with more tea i think that the gods had less to do with that than your own wit and fine goods tradesister she waved the suggestion aside na na one does ones best and the gods decree the rest so there is a girl there is a young man with her she looks for talesedrin he watches her with the eyes of a young dog with his first bitch kraheera laughed at the old womans simile there was no repressing dira she told things as she saw them and if anyone objected why she felt they need not listen young men are ever thus what of this girl of valdemar who seeks the children of the hawk he asked well it is said that she comes from kerowyn on whom be peace and profit if such a thing is possible for one whose livelihood is by the sword it is said that she bears the magesword given her from the hand of kerowyn as a token of this the old womans black eyes peered at him sharply from within a nest of wrinkles this is the sword of clanmother kethryveris the blade calledneed it is said kraheera pondered the information you have seen this dira shook her head no not with my own eyes nor have i heard her claim this with my own ears i have spoken with her but briefly a few words at most she seems honest that is all i can say kraheera nodded and dira smiled her satisfaction no shinain ever moved on purely hearsay evidence no shinain dared move on hearsay but dira had reported what she knew and kraheera would not be caught by surprise the last of the light faded and trevalen lit the scarlet lamps that marked the tent as priestly and not to be disturbed they exchanged a few more pleasantries and dira took herself back to her own tent somewhere in the labyrinthine recesses of the rug sellers bazaar kraheera nodded to his apprentice to take her place beside the brazier the elder shaman sat in thought while his apprentice seated himself will you do nothing about this outlander trevalen wondered aloud will you seek her out perhaps kraheera studied the bottom of his paperthin porcelain teacup perhaps she may be of some use to us whether she speaks the truth or no but we have a more urgent appointment you and i we do trevalen asked surprised his black brows arching upwards in surprise trevalen was one of the pureblood shinainby no means the majority among the mixedblood clan of talesedrin his iceblue eyes were startling to an outsider set beneath his ravenblack hair in an angular goldenskinned face surely you did not think that we came riding over the plains in the heat of summer for the pleasure of it kraheera responded wryly cif that is so you have an odd notion of pleasure trevalen flushed a little but held his tongue kraheeras wit sometimes tended to the acidic but his apprentices had to grow used to it that was part of becoming a shaman to be able to face any temperament with calm we go out now kraheera announced standing up from his crosslegged position with an ease many younger men would envy that took trevalen by surprise the apprentice scrambled to his feet awkwardly just in time to follow his superior out into the night to kraheeras veiled amusement trevalen first turned toward the bazaar and only altered his steps when he realized that the shaman was heading into the old city and not just the old city but the oldest part of the city the city swallowed them wrapping them in a blanket of sound and lights katashinain did not sleep in trade season business went on as usual after nightfall although the emphasis shifted from the general to the personal from the mundane to the exotic in the bazaar the perfume sellers the jewelers the traders in magegoods would be doing brisk business in the old city within the inn walls food drink and personal services were being sold kraheera wondered if his apprentice felt as odd as he did moving silently between walls with the sight of the land and much of the sky blocked out by masonry the wind could not move freely here and the earth beneath their feet had been pounded dead and lifeless by the countless hooves of passing beasts yet the shinain had once known citiesor rather a city one that had once stood in the precise middle of the dhorisha plains once and very long ago that had been the home of the kaledain kraheera led the way confidently between the walls of alien stone through the scents and sounds that were just as alien the evidences of outlanders conducting further businessor pleasure he moved without worry for all the fact that he wore a sword at his back for the rule of the bazaar did not apply to shinain not here in their own city where they only visited but never lived the deeper they went into the core city the darker and quieter it becameand the stranger grew the scents and the sounds voices babbling in chaos became voices chanting quietly in unison raucous song became the sweet harmony of a pair of boy sopranos the mingled scents of perfume wine and cookery gave way to the smoke of incense and the fragrance of flowers this was the quarter of the temples and the doors spilling forth yellow light yielded to those with lanterns on either side held invitingly open for the wouldbe worshiper yet these were all outlander places of worship not places that belonged to the shinain kraheera continued past them as trevalen gazed about in interest the lanterns at the temple doors became fewer the doors closed and darkened until there was no light at all except what came from the torches kept burning at intervals along the street sound faded now they heard the dull scuff of their own boot soles along the hardpacked dirt of the street finally they reached their goal near where the street ended in a blank wall a single closed door with a lantern burning low beside it ir mheera knocked in a pattern long familiar to his apprentice as the beginning of one of the drum chants the door opened and kraheera again hid his amusement to see trevalens shock she who opened the door for them was kalenedral swordswornand at first glance she looked to be garbed in black the color of bloodfeud a closer look as she closed the door behind them however showed trevalen what kraheera already knew the color of her costume was not black nor brown but deep midnight blue which was not a color that swordsworn ever wore what said trevalen she is special kraheera said anticipating his question she is sworn not only to the warrior but the crone as well she bears her bladebut she uses it to guard wisdom there are a dozen more like her here and this is the only place where you will find them the kalenedral led them down the corridor into a single square room with a roof made of tiny square panes of glass set in a latticework of lead the full moon had just begun to peer through the farther edge of the windowroof trevalen stared at it in fascination glass windows were a wonder to a shinain and a glass roof a marvel past expectation he almost stumbled onto the weaving carpeting the floor of the room kraheera caught him before his foot touched the fragile threads and steadied him as he looked down in confusion it is too old to hang he explained and besides as you know there are things that need the moon to unlock the kalenedral slipped out of the room unnoticed kraheera took a seat on one of the many cushions placed around the woven tapestry at the periphery of the room after a moments hesitation trevalen joined him you know the story of our people kraheera said softly as he waited for the moon to sail above the walls shine down through the window and touch the threads of the weaving let me remind you again to set your mind upon the proper paths out of the corner of his eye he saw trevalen nod and waited for a moment absorbing the silenceand the dust of centuries rising from the weaving in the longago time we and the hawkbrothers were one people the kaledain we served and loved an overlord one of the great mages and when he became drawn into a war so too did we the end of that war brought great destruction so great that it destroyed our homeland the mage himself had great care for his people and he gave the warning and the means for us to escape before the destruction itself was wrought it took us many years to return from whence we had escaped when we came here to this very spot the moon crept through the roofwindow it had been edging down toward the weaving he had paced his words to coincide with it reaching the first threads of the border as he reached with the power she gave her shamans and invoked the magic of the weaving this is what we saw shaman ravenwing passed her hand over her eyes wishing she could change the reality as she blotted out the sight ir way here the flattened trees iwe debris that they had encountered on the complete absence of animal and bird life the closer they came to the site had given them some warning the ridge of earth they had approached had told them more but nothing prepared them for the reality there was no homeland only a vast crater as far as the eye could see dug many many manheights into the ravaged earth so intense had been the heat of the blast that had caused it that the earth at the bottom had been fused into a lumpy sheet of glassy rock ravenwing took her hand from her eyes and looked again it was no better at second viewing and ravenwing reached out blindly for the two clansfolk standing beside her she stood with her arms about their shoulders theirs about hers and her eyes streamed tears as she forced herself to face the death of all she had ever known she sat inside the hastilypitched clan council tent erected to provide shadeand to block the sight of the destruction with her sat the shamans the clan elders every leader of every clan of the kaledain they were here to make decisionsand possibly to settle a rift that was threatening to split the people in twain the dispute centered about magic five of the clans used it four did not traditionally the four who tended and bred the horse herds were the clans which avoided the use of magery hawk wolf grasscat and deer the five clans whichamong other thingsactually manipulated the breeding of the horses as well as other creatures did so by means of magic these five had fielded many mages and healers to their overlord mage urtho falcon owl and raven clans were protesting that they were not going to give up their powers as the previous four were insisting two more clans eagle and fox were ambivalent but were disturbed by the idea of sacrificing something so integral to their lives ravenwings own clan taylesederin was foremost in demanding that magic be eliminated from their lives our warsteeds are everything anyone could wish there have been no changes made to them for generations the bondbirds are not entirely all one could wish but is it worth holding such a dangerous doubleedged power simply to improve them a little more that was ravenwings clan chief silverhorse the foremost opponent of magic in all its shapes and colors firemare valavyska elder for the owls widened her eyes with contempt what you think that is all magic does precisely what do you intend to do about those who do not share your scruples our enemies who would use any weapon they have against us who will protect you from the attacks of mages if you banish magic from our lives who protected us this time silverhorse shouted gesturing wildly at the desolation beyond the tent flap is it worth a repetition of that simply to have a little more power magic protected you this time by giving you the means to escape little brother rumbled suncat trevavyska of falcons magic has saved you before and it will again besides how do you propose to cleanse this land if not by magic only magic can undo what magic has done it was but the opening blow of a dispute that was to continue for days the last member of the five clans vanished into the north and ravenwing dried her eyes on her sleeve swallowing the last of her tears in the end the dispute could not be healed not by the softest words of the most reasonable and coolest heads in the clans nor by any appeals to brotherhood and solidarity the five clansnow calling themselves taylesederas or brothers of the hawks for their association with the corvine and raptor bondbirds they had been developinghad determined to split from the four clans who wished to banish magic from their lives for all time the four clans had no name for themselves at the momentand no home no purpose their only plan had been to do away with magery now that was done and they had no idea of what to do next but ravenwing and her fellow shamansfrom all of the nine clans had been in separate consultations after they had determined that there would be no compromise and ravenwing had been chosen to present their thoughts to the elder of hawks silverhorse stared after the departing ones long past when the last of the dust had settled his face was blank as if he had not truly expected that the people could be sundered it seemed as good a time as any to approach him well she asked jarring him from his entrancement you have succeeded in this much there is no longer magic among the people other than that she and he give the shamans now what is your plan where do we go what do we do will we find a homeland do we seek a new overlord he turned eyes upon her that were bleak and sad i do not know he confessed this land is torn and poisoned by magic turned awry there is nowhere for us to go that we may claim without displacing someone else yet we cannot remain here we could she offered he answered with a short bark of a laugh what and eat rock drink our own tears watch our little ones warped and changed by the magic gone wild and twisted in this place he laughed again but the pain in his laughter tore at her heart is that all you can offer me shaman of the hawk he continued to laugh but it was becoming wild and hysterical she silenced him with a single openhanded slap he stared at herfor in all her life she had never once raised her hand to anyone clansman or not she had been known as one of the softest and gentlest women in all the clanscertainly among the shamans but the past days had hardened and toughened her and the days to come would only mean more of the same this she knew though she was no seer you told me when you urged that we forsake magic that we must trust in the powers for our protection are you telling me now that you no longer believe that she let the acid of her words drip into the raw wound of his soul without mercy if that is true then perhaps i should take my beasts and ride out after my sundered brothers i his mouth worked for a moment before he could produce any words i believe that but but what ravenwing looked down her long nose at him from beneath halfclosed lids but you do not believe they would answer if we called on them or is it that you are not willing to pay the price they might put on our aiding would they answer he asked hope springing into his eyes have you done a seeking shaman of the hawk she nodded slowly i have done a seeking and a calling and i have been answered but the price of their aid will be in blood he took a deep breath whose the elders of each clan that is left she replied with authority yours and the other three she watched his face change as her words struck him it was not an easy decision that he was being asked to make he was a relatively young man as yet unmated with all of his life before him and that was partand no small partof the sacrifice yet when he had taken the oath of the elder he had pledged just this thing to lay down his life for his people at need but he had no doubt thought if it came to that it would be in the heat of battlenot the cold loneliness of selfsacrifice his eyes widened in a glazed shock turned inward then focused on hers again she nodded as she saw his attention return to her it is not an easy question she said quietly your three brother and sister elders are being posed the same question even now we do not expect you to answer at oncebut it must be soon the people as you pointed out cannot remain here long and if i decline thishonor he asked with a touch of painful irony then i spill my blood in place of yours she replied steadily having faced this possibility herself and made her own decision it must be one or the other of us leaving hawk without a shaman she shrugged it must be one or the other of us that is the price the calling named we four chief shaman have spoken and agreed all of the apprentices have promise but none is fit or trained to function on his own if any of the chiefs must go that clan must live without a shaman until an apprentice is ready she stepped away from him and turned to go i will leave you to think on this come to me by moonrise with your decision he touched her shoulder as she turned away stopping her i do not need until moonrise he said in a tone that made her heart usore it is not all that difficult a choice to make after all he smiled a smile sweet and without fear and she held back her tears when will you require me he asked it had taken a full moon for the clans to position themselves about the glassy crater that had been their homeland one to each prime direction it had been hardest for cat clan they had to make the halfcircle around the rim to position themselves in the west at sunsetin whatever manner they chosethe four elders gave themselves for their people silverhorse had simply stepped off the top of the ridge vanishing into the darkness of the crater without even a sigh now ravenwing stood above the place he had fallen her arms spread to the sky calling on the powers with every fiber behind her in a rough halfcircle stood the rest of the clan from the infants in arms to the oldest grandsire adding their prayers to hers and with the moon she came her face changed moment to moment from maid to crone from stern warrior to nurturing mother and back again she filled the sky and yet she stood before ravenwing and stared deeply and directly into the shamans eyes she spoke and her voice filled ravenwings ears and mind so completely that there was room for nothing but the experience i have heard your prayers she said gravely as i have heard the prayers of your sundered brothers there was a price to be paid for what they asked and there is a price to be paid for what you ask in blood asked a quiet voice which ravenwing recognized as that of azurestar shaman of cat clan a tiny bit of her was left to wonder that she could hear the voice as clearly as if azurestar stood beside her she shook her head not in bloodin your lives all of you i shall give you back your homeland but the price is vigilance she held out her hand and cupped within it was the crater in the center of the crater and scattered about it beneath the slag and fused stone were shapeless things that glowed an evil green three things destroyed the homeland she said gravely the destructive spell of an enemy the selfdestruction of the gate that you fled through and the final strike of your master urthos death by his champion meant to remove his enemy as he himself died yet despite all this there are many weapons of urthos making that still remain and could be used buried beneath the slag and rubble there are weapons there that are too dangerous even for those with good intentions to hold but you have forsworn magic for all timethey will be no temptation to you ravenwing nodded and felt the agreement of the rest here then is the price you must guard your new land which you shall call the dhorisha shinathe plains of sacrifice and yourselves the shinainthe people of the plains you must keep strangers out at all cost unless they pledge themselves into the clans or are allies that you the shamans must call on me to judge those will be marked in ways that you will recognize you will never swear to any overlord again but will remain always sworn only to each other and to the powers you have forsworn magic and you must keep that vow any of your children that are born with magegift you must either send to your sundered brothers bring into the craft of the shaman or permit the shaman to block the gift for all time it was a sacrifice indeed of freedom and to a small extent of free willand not just for them but for all generations they would swear to an endless service an endless guardianship but the gain was their home she felt the assent of her people and added her own to it the goddess smiled it is well she said and spread out her hands stepped down into the crater and began to walk where her feet touched a carpet of flowers grass and trees sprang up and spread flowing over the ruined earth like a green flood as she walked westwardkraheera blinked and smiled faintly he had forgotten how powerful the memories knotted into this weaving were ravenwing had been a formidable strongminded woman and had managed to weave in not only the memories but the emotions she had felt at the time that of course was the secret of the shamanic weavings they held the memory of every shaman who worked upon them this weaving held not only ravenwing but the half dozen who had followed her in those eventful days other weavings held the memories of more shamans than that often in the plains these days there was little to record for years or even decades the most significant weavings were kept here where all the clans could have free access to them there were more than four clans now and it was part of the training of a shaman that he come here to experience the beginning of the shinain the people of the plains for himself ravenwing was responsible for making a great deal of the early training of shaman a part of the education of every shinain so that every shinain could invoke the powers at need in the event of a clan losing their shaman it would be less of a problem to wait on the training of another than it had been in the old days she had also been responsible for insisting that whenever possible more than one shaman and apprentice be resident with each clan and she had been the shaman who created the first of the kalenedral those warriors who served not any one clan but all of the clans together altogether a remarkable woman indeed kraheera turned slowly toward his own apprentice and waited for the memories the shaman had invoked to release the younger man finally trevalen blinked and shook his head slightly all that is left is for you to learn the unlocking of these memories and the weaving of them yourself kraheera told the apprentice but that was not why i brought you here now have you guessed why trevalen who had already recovered from the affect of the alien memories on his own mind nodded it is because of the rumors i think he said there are rumors that the plains have been disturbed you wanted me to see for myself why it is the people guard them kraheera considered movingbut the memorytrance relaxed one rather than leaving one tense and there was nowhere more secure from listeners than this place the rumors are true he said there have been intruders on the plains intruders that only the shaman have been able to detect the border guards cannot stop them indeed they have only recently caught sight of them at a distance they are some kind of magicmade creatures from past the taleedras lands and they have entered from the northern side of the plains where the plains meet the territory of the taleedras clan ksheyna the falcons trevalen said curiously i do not know them i know a little but not a great deal kraheera admitted i know this much of the enemy the things that have been looking about have an incredible ability to vanish and have never been seen clearly they have been sniffing out magic i think and when they find it i think they will call that which created them they could find many things trevalen said grimly and worst case they could find the remains of the stronghold of mage urtho kraheera nodded agreement i do not know if it would be possible for an attack to be mounted against the center of the plainsbut i do not know that it would not be possible what of ksheyna trevalen asked anxiously are the hawkbrothers not pledged to help us when dangers come from out of their lands yes but ksheyna from the little i know is a clan with troubles of its own kraheera responded after a moment to gather his thoughts i do not think they are capable of repulsing a single adept just now and if these creatures are the servants of not one but an alliance of adeptswell i do not think there is much hope of aid from them trevalen grimaced so what is it we need do kraheera mentally congratulated his apprentice the youngster had cut to the heart of the matter without wasting time on things that might or might not be we need to bring together the shaman of two clans at least then we must invoke the kalenedralthe leshyaekalenedral as well as what physical swordsworn we can muster the spirits trevalen said in surprise we can invoke the spirit swordsworn if needs must yes we can kraheera told him it must be done through the living swordsworn but it is not done lightly i think however we have little choice at this moment the spirits bring with them some of her power her magic and with these i think we can withstand these intruders but to accomplish all this there is one thing more we must have time trevalen responded promptly time kraheera agreed and to gain time we need a distraction for these things hmm trevalens face grew thoughtful and kraheera felt a lifting of his heart he had not been mistaken in this young man trevalen did not simply wait to do what he was toldhe looked for answers the young woman that dira spoke of trevalen said slowly just what is she why would she seek us kraheera wondered for a moment why trevalens mind had turned to the strangers but the younger man was gifted with the ability to sift through bits of information and extract unusual solutions so here in this safest of all places the elder let his own mind range for a moment asking for a vision that would sum up what these strangers were in a moment he had that vision the young woman and her friendwith white uniforms and leshyae horses they were heralds of valdemar he had no trouble recognizing the uniform his cousin kerowyn had onethough she seldom wore it willingly only one herald had ever entered the plainsthe great and good friend of tarma shena talesedrin long before kraheera had ever been born herald roald was something of a minor legend among talesedrin with his spirithorse and his undeniable charm other clans children envied talesedrin who had hosted the verkalenedral the white swordsworn who brought them presents and took them for rides on his beautiful spirithorse kraheeras father had been one of those so honored and for years thereafter he had told the children and grandchildren his tales of the windswift horse that had the understanding of a man they are heralds from the queen in valdemar he told his apprentice i do not know what brings them but since our cousin kerowyn is also one of them i think that everything dira told us could be true hmm trevalen nodded thoughtfully that must be tested of course as they must be tested but not by us kraheera reminded him she must test and mark them butwhat were you thinking that they might prove worthy allies perhaps enough to help us with these intruders trevalen blinked owlishly in the moonlight did you have any other thoughts iyes kraheera responded smiling slowly i have in mind that they might become our distraction they have to be tested in any case why not make their testing a matter of seeing how they respond to these intruders trevalen frowned which surprised his teacher is this fair he demanded they do not know what it is they will encounter nor do they know the plains we know the girl carries a magic thing the spiritsword if these hunters are seeking out magic will they not sniff it out and what then then they must defend themselves if the hunters come for them kraheera said with a shrug they are outsiders are they not they must prove their worth must they not if she finds them worthy perhaps she will aid them but what of us trevalen asked should we not aid them why kraheera responded i see no reason to aid them if they survive very well if they survive and grant us the time we need we will aid them if they do not he shrugged the plains are ours to guard she never told us that we were to take in random strangers who come looking for help from us in fact by allowing them to cross the plains we are granting them more than any other in all of our history it is only because they are heralds and because they come from our cousin that i allow this at all reluctantly trevalen nodded it is in the interest of the clans he admitted but i cannot like it that which does not overcome us strengthens us kraheera replied callously this will be good for them and here is what we shall do elspeth knew by a sudden change in the air that she was no longer alone in her little room tonight she had demanded another room separate from skifs she was not going to share a room much less a bed with him anymore she had hoped that would make it clear to him that she was not going to put up with his nonsense any more skif had protested but she had overruled him now she was sorry she had there was an intruder in her room and if she was very lucky it would only prove to be a thie she risked a quick mental probe and met a block as solid as a wall of seamless marble crap its not a thiefshe started to reach for the knife under her pillows and started to call for gwenaonly started no more she was frozen in place by a sudden flare of light it was the candle at her bedside lighting itself and at the foot of her bed was a sinister shadow arms folded clad in black from head to toe veiledthere was no mistaking that costume kero had described and sketched it in detail and no one here in katashinain would dare counterfeit it not here not on the edge of the plains chapter seventeen darkwind as he passed beneath the trees and away from open sky darkwind redoubled his shielding when he had been fourteen and had been caught up in his friends matingspell it had been an accident and one that brought all of them a great deal of chagrined amusement but if he were to eavesdrop now it would be deliberateand since he had not been invited he was not going to intrude on this most private of moments for them or at least he had not intended to intrudebut he was given no choice after all everything seemed quiet up by the swamp and he didnt think there was any particular reason to double back and check the area beside the ruins the gryphons themselves had made an aerial patrol of the forest before the flight he doubted that anything large would have gotten in under cover of the trees on the other hand it wouldnt hurt to check the trails for signs of intruders it wouldnt take all that long he had just called to vree and was halfway through this particular patch of forest he was heading in the direction of the path to the swamp and the hertasi when a scream of agony cut the sky a second scream answered the first a heartbeat later the world came apart for an instant at least that was what it felt like he knew what it was as he slammed down another kind of shield and fought his senses clear the resonating effect of a magicblast powerful crude and close at hand and the tortured scream that had accompanied it that echoed across the sky and pierced all his mental shields had come from treyvan vree was already shooting up through the treetops s off m the direction of the shriek of rage and pain screaming a battle cry of his own running all out darkwind followed on the ground as best he could this was wild land hard to cross at any speed he ran through it without any of his usual carebreaking branches leaving behind tracks an infant could read crashing through the undergrowth like a clumsy young deer in a panic but still the terrain itself held him back brushes clutched at him roots tripped him up thickets too thick to be forced blocked his way heedless of his own risk he opened his mind to the gryphons but heardnothing and that was even worse than the cries had been rage and fear blinded him to pain rage and fear drove him through plum thickets across a tumble of razorsharp stone fragments and loaned him wind and strength his heart pounded too loudly for him to have heard danger coming up behind him his soul was torn with claws of agony for what that silence might mean ahead called vree shooting under the tree branches like a winged arrow turning faster than the eye could follow and shooting away again here the bird was too excited and angry to manage anything more coherent than that darkwind plunged after him his lungs burning his side pierced with a lance of pure pain just when he thought that he could not possibly run any farther he literally stumbled into a tangle of broken branches then over a furcovered leg and fell into a mass of broken brush before he could regain his balance the leg belonged to hydona who was sprawled in an unconscious tangle bleeding from one torn and wounded wing come on treyvan darkwind crooned cradling the gryphons head in his hands and slapping his beak lightly come on old boy wake up come on hydona needs your help i cant move her without you treyvan lay in the middle of a halfcrushed bush it had obviously saved him worse injury when he hit the ground but darkwind couldnt free him from the snarl of broken branches unless he could revive the male gryphon and get some help from him the eyelids fluttered the beak opened a fraction and closed again the head stirred in darkwinds hands and treyvan protested his treatment wordlessly arrwkrrrrdaaadaaarrrwk thats right its darkwind come on darkwind slapped the beak a little harder pulled at treyvans crestfeathers come on say something with some sense in it wake up old friend rrrrrrr the eyelids fluttered and stayed open this time the weight of the gryphons head left darkwinds hands as treyvan raised it a trifle hydona the gryphon croaked whining wordlessly with pain as he tried to turn his head hydona t shes hurt darkwind told him but i think shell be all righther wings hurt i dont think shes broken anything and shes kind of halfconscious but i cant get her out i need to get you out of this tangle so you can help me get her out of hers cantmove the gryphon said starting to thrash weakly in alarm it was obvious then to darkwind that treyvan wasnt really hearing himthat in fact he was only halfconscious he opened his shields to the gryphon and touched him directly mind to mind dont move till i tell you youre caught hydona is all right but shes hurt and tangled up in some brush and im going to need your help to move her he glanced back over his shoulder to the right where the female gryphon lay eyes halfclosed one wing folded awkwardly beneath her the other oozing blood from a wound vree sat right beside her head his eyes closed in concentration he was in complete mental contact with her helping to keep her calm and unmoving hed done this before with wounded bondbirds and he was remarkably good at itin fact if there were such a thing as a healer among the bondbirds vree might well qualify he might not have been able to hold hydona if she had been completely awake and aware enough to fight him or if shed been delirious and raving but like treyvan she had beenat best halfconscious when the two of them arrived the mental contact seemed to steady treyvan he stopped thrashing and held still satisfied that the gryphon wasnt going to lose control panic and disembowel his rescuer a very real possibility with a predator as large and strong as a gryphon darkwind moved over to his side all right old friend im going to start with your left wing lift it just a littlethats it it took them much longer than darkwind wanted to get treyvan free by the time they finished hydona had slipped a little farther away from consciousness it took all three of them vree included to rouse her and all three of them to get her on her feet what happened darkwind asked glancing sideways at what appeared to be fresh human remainsshreddedas they finally got hydona swaying into a standing position idont rrrremember treyvan said unhappily we completed the flightyesssand aahhh said hydona she shook her head and gave a faint cry of pain there wasssa man below usss with a weapon a crosssbow yesss a man treyvan nodded as he put his shoulder to hydonas to support her he sssshot hydonathat isss all i remember can you hold her up a moment by yourself darkwind asked i think i see something and i didnt get a chance to look over there treyvan nodded and winced as if his head hurt that gave darkwind another little piece of information confirming one of his suspicions the male gryphon had been the one receiving the blast of magic that darkwind had felt smash into his own shields as if it had been nonspecific and unfocused magic was a poor way to render someone unconsciousrather like taking a boulder to smash a fly the amount of sheer power required to overwhelm was ridiculousin fact it was far easier to shape a bit of energy into a dart and shoot them with it better far to use a true mindblast if one had the gift or a physical weapon like the crossbow a magic blast to the mind had certain side effectsand a headache was only one it was not the weaponofchoice even against a flighted target that meant that the gryphons attacker had no mental abilities of his own and might not have had any magical ones either darkwind made certain that hydona was balanced well before leaving her side and walking over to what was left of the human who had attacked them he bent over the remains and poked at them with the tip of his dagger where he saw a glint of metal sure enough there was a tarnished amulet of some sort about the neck and the remains were as much blackened and burned as they were clawed he checked back over his shoulder hydona seemed to be doing better by the moment so he spent some little time investigating the state of the corpse when he stood up and returned to the gryphons hydona was standing on her own and vree had taken a perch in the tree above them showing not the slightest interest in treyvans crestfeathers well it looks like i can piece together what happened darkwind said as he reached out for the leading edge of hydonas injured wing at least i think i can i wisssssh i could treyvan fretted i do not like thisss not rrrememberrring treyvan you may never get the memory back darkwind told him fighting off his own guilty feelings i should have stayed nearby i should have guarded them it wouldnt have taken that long just to wait around until they were through and on the ground again heres what i think happened this fellow was watching you and when hydona got within range he shot wounding her treyvan when you dove at him he hadnt yet had time to reload the crossbowi think he was counting on you to be very slow since youre very large i think your speed took him by surprise he has an amulet around his neck the kind that can be used to store very basic magic when you dove at him he blasted you with it as kind of a reflex action butwe have defensssessss treyvan said in surprise magic defensssessss truebut they were partially down because of your mating i remember noticing that as you took off then thinking it wouldnt matter now i wish id said something treyvan hissed trrrue it isss neccesssary i had forgotten that not fully down butreduced he nodded anyway they were down enough that the blast knocked you unconscious but up enough that you reflected part of it back to him since he didnt have any defenses at all you got him with the backblast i dont know if you killed him but in the end it didnt matter if he wasnt hydona you definitely killed him when he fell and was within your reach see he pointed to her foreclaws theres blood on your talons and hes fairly well shredded but why dont i remember she asked unhappily because you werent more than halfconscious at the time he told her it was mostly reflex on your part ah she accepted that carefully putting one foot before the other while darkwind walked beside her holding up the drooping wing so that it wouldnt drag on the ground i will have an aching head for a while then treyvan said ruefully and i did not even rescue my mate oh you did it was just rather indirect darkwind soothed him i wouldnt worry about the headache im going to get the hertasi to send over their healer as soon as i leave you shell put you both right he was making light of the incidentbecause he was afraid it might mean more than a simple trophyhunter trying to shoot down the gryphons how had he found out about them whoever he was how had he traced them here where had he gotten a protective amulet powerful enough to have knocked treyvan out of the sky why did he use the crossbow instead of magic if hed had access to magic that formidable and why had he gone after them in the first place there were more questions what were those faint traces darkwind had seen before he had gotten the two gryphons to their feettraces of a second person who had been moving about the two of them hed been forced to destroy those traces much against his will there was no way to get to the gryphons without doing so getting in to disentangle their limbs and move brush away was the only way to help treyvan and hydona up and get them moving he hadnt seen the scuffs and prints anywhere else not even entering the areaand they had been quite clear around treyvans body which meant whoever it had been the printmaker had not been the same person as the archer the archer had been stone cold by the time the unknown had meddled with treyvans unconscious body if i had gotten here sooner i could have caught him yet another lance of guilt none of which was going to be assuaged until treyvan and hydona were safely back at their nest and both of them were healed enough to take to the skies again the gryphlets boiled out of their nest as the quartet approached hysterical with fear so completely incoherent that not even their parents could get any sense out of them they simply crowded under the adults wings pressing as closely to their bodies as they could whimpering and trying to hide this of course did not help at all but the little ones were too terrified to be reasoned with darkwind couldnt tell if something had frightened them directly or if they had linked in with their parents and experienced what had happened to the adult gryphons indirectly whatever had happened it rendered them completely irrational and also turned them into complete nuisances he wanted to comfort themand hydona was nearly frantic with maternal worrybut they were in the way underfoot and demanding the total attention and protection of their parents neither of whom were in any shape to give it finally in desperation he tried the only one of them who wasnt already fully occupied vree he called hoping the bird might be able to at least chase the little ones out of the way the gyre came down from his protective circle above them in a steep dive braking to a clawsout landing on the top of one of the stones he looked sharply at the shivering meeping gryphlets and opened his beak to give a peculiar piercing call the little ones looked straight at him suddenly silent then they resumed their cries but ran away from their parents and straight for vree vree for his part hopped down to a rock that stood just shoulderheight to the youngsters he spread his wings and the little ones huddled up to the rock one on either side trying to cower under his wings the tone of their cries changing from frantic to merely distressed vree replied to them with reassuring chirps of his own protecting them with his wings it would have been funny if the little ones hadnt been in such distress whatever the cause of their fear it could be dealt with later once treyvan and hydona were settled into their nest and the hertasi healer brought to help them he left treyvan leaning up against the stones with vree and the little ones while he helped hydona into the nestarea to clean her wing wound the bolt had passed completely through the wing leaving a ragged round hole it needed a healer there was no way for him to bandage it properly and it continued to ooze blood despite the primitive pressurebandage he put on it she clamped her beak shut and obviously tried not to complain but moaned softly despite her best efforts as he bound the cloth in place darkwind found himself sweating and apologized clumsily for her pain he returned to help treyvan into the nest keeping the little ones back until the stillunsteady gryphon had settled himself im going to get the healer he said do you want me to leave vree with you yesss treyvan sighed as the forestgyre herded the youngsters in with all the skill of an expert nursemaid if it would not leave you in danger he issss much help and after thisss he concluded with a hint of his old sense of humor i may even give him my cressst featherssss one thing at a time he told himself first the gryphons then the little onesand then i find out who and whyand what this attack on them really means one thing is certain the quiet weve been enjoying was just a momentary lull were in for more and worse trouble i can feel it he had felt trouble ahead like the ache before a storm in oncebroken bones like a storm that trouble would strikeand with no warning where or when he little thought that this time the fury would strike straight at his heart he gave nera and the rest of the hertasi a brief explanation of what had happened while nyara listened unobtrusively in the background the healer gesta left halfway through without waiting for permissionso like the healers of the tayledras that darkwind had to smile no one gave them orders either and they were not much inclined to wait for permission when they thought their services were needed vree came winging in over the swamp just after he answered the last of the lizard peoples questionsmostly concerned with their own safety and what if anything they could do to safeguard it with vree back there was no reason to postpone his regular patroland every reason to complete it there might be traces of those invadersthey might even still be within tayledras territory though darkwind doubted it in the past those who had invaded to strike at the hawkbrothers generally moved in made whatever action they had come to take and moved out again and there was still no telling if this was a danger to the tayledras or simply the foolishness of a trophyhunter but when in doubtassume the worst the hawkbrothers stayed alive by that rule and it had always been the precept darkwind operated on he went over his ground with eyes sharpened by anxiety looking for traces of the interlopers he found only vague tracks places where something had passed through but the ground was too dry to hold marks and it was impossible to tell what had made those traces it could have been the marksman and his presumed companion a thread caught on a thorn showed it was not simply an animal despite the trace of lynx hair below it at sunset he completed the last of his circuits being replaced by starsong wintermoons current lover he thought she looked at him strangely when she passed hima pitying glance as she vanished into the underbrush he puzzled over that odd expression as he headed back toward his ekele thinking only of changing getting food for himself and vree and going back to the gryphons but as he hurried up the path vree suddenly swooped down in front of him crying a warning he froze one hand on his dagger as a manshaped shadow separated itself from the rest of the shadows beneath the trees then vree swerved away his cry changing from warning to welcome as a huge cloudwhite owl rose on silent wings to meet him darkwinds hand fell from the hilt of his dagger as he recognized wintermoons bird ktathi brother he called softly what brings you out here i thought you were on huntduty for a while wintermoon said nothing only came forward slowly worriedly searching darkwinds face with his eyes thenyou have not heard darkwind shook his head alarmed by his brothers expression and his words heard nonothing from the vale anyway why what wintermoon clasped darkwind in his arms in a rare display of emotion and affection little brotheroh little brother i wish it were not so i grieve for you sheyna dawnfire is dead he searched his brothers face and saw only regret darkwind was prepared for almost anything but that he stood within the protection of his older brothers arms and tried to make sense of what he had just heard dawnfire butthis was her rest day she wasnt even going to leave her ekele she told me so surely you must be mistaken no wintermoon said his voice soft with seldomheard compassion no there is no mistake she was found in her ekele then it hit him with all the force of a blow to the gut no he shouted pulling away and staring at wintermoon wildly no it cant be i dont believe you but wintermoons pitying expressionexactly like starsongstold him the truth that he did not want to hear he was too welltrained and disciplined to break downand too overcome with shock to move his knees trembled and threatened to give way beneath him wintermoon took his shoulders and gently steered him over to a fallen tree at the side of the trail he urged darkwind to sit as vree dove in under the tree branches and landed making soft whistling noises in the back of his throat darkwind felt blindly behind his back and got himself down on the log before his legs collapsed whathappened he asked hoarsely his throat choked his eyes burning he blinked and two silent tears scorched down his cheeks no one knows wintermoon replied quietly thundersnow came to see if she wanted to go hunting for game birds and found her this afternoon she was he hesitated little brother did she fullbond with her bird often sometimes darkwind croaked leaning on his left side he stared out at nothing more tears following the first shecould not fullbond without trance but kyrr was so bright she didnt need full trance often how can she be dead who could have touched her in her own home his fists knotted and his stomach more tears welled up and flowed unnoticed down his face little brother it appeared that she was in full trance that at least is how thundersnow found her there were no signs of violence or sickness upon her wintermoon paused again i would say she must have undergone fullbond with her bird and that something befell the two of them he paused she was not known for caution it may be that she sent kyrr into the outlands and met something she could not escape from he rested his hand on darkwinds shoulder i am very sorry little brother iam not known for words but if i can help you darkwind seized the comfort he had thrust away earlier and clasped wintermoon to him sobbing silently into his older brothers shoulder wintermoon simply held him in an embrace of comfort and protection while vree whistled mourning beside them nyara twisted on the sleeping mat in her little cave a ball of misery and confusion when darkwind came to the hertasi with his story of attack on the gryphons she had been as confused and alarmed as any of them but now shed had some time to think about what he had saidand to think back to that last confrontation with her father mornelithe falconsbane had always hated gryphons just as a general rule although she was not aware that he had ever had contact with the species not directly at least but he had been very interested in treyvan and hydona to the extent of pulling every detail she knew about them out of her she had the horrible feeling fast growing into certainty that he and no other was behind this attack and yet a direct attack was so unlike him mornelithe never did anything directly he always layered everything he did in secrecy weaving plots and counterplots into a net not even a spider could untangle why would he send someone to shoot at them and why would he send someone armed with the crudest of amulets a protection that was bound to fail it made no sense at allthe hertasi healer passed the mouth of her cave gesta paused a moment peering shortsightedly into the doorway nyara she said softly are you there are you awake nyara blinked in surprise yes she responded yes i could not get to sleep is there something you need from me gesta coughed politely a favor perhaps the winged ones are better but they need a full nights sleep yet they are fearful to sleep fearing another hunter this time in the dark you i think can see well in the dark no yes i can nyara responded and in spite of her worries a pleased little smile curled the corners of her mouth they trust meor gesta does anywayand theyre willing to give me something to do i think i see where youre tending you want me to guard them do you not so that the winged ones may have some sleep yes gesta breathed in what sounded like relief you need not defend them you need only stand watch and pledge to rouse them if danger comes you can do that i think without harm to yourself and they asked after you saying you were a friend we would but the thin little figure silhouetted against the twilight sky shrugged and leaned against its walking stick but you do not see or move well by darkness i know nyara responded i should be happy to attend them she uncoiled from her mat and glided silently out to the hertasi who blinked at her sudden appearance do you go across the swamp gesta asked taking an involuntary step backward and looking up at her nyara realized then that this was the first time the hertasi healer had seen her on her feet her slight build might have deceived the little lizard into thinking she was shorter than she actually was in reality she was perhaps a thumblength shorter than darkwind but certainly no more than that no she replied wrinkling her nose in distaste at the thought of slogging through all that mud and waterand in the dark no less noif i go around about the edge i shall find the ruins no it will be longer that way gesta warned but swifter if i need not feel my way through water in the dark nyara chuckled i go good healer thank you for giving me the task she slipped down to the path that led to the edge of the marsh before the hertasi could reply and once out of sight of the hertasi village she slipped into the easy run she had been bred and altered for a grounddevouring lope that would have surprised anyone except those who were familiar with the plains grasscats on which she had been modeled while she ran she had a chance to think it was odd but running always freed her thoughts as if putting her body to work could make her mind work as well she thought mostly upon the notion that her father might have been involved in this attack upon the gryphons if he was what was she to do about it treyvan and hydona are my friends she thought unhappily they are perhaps the only true friends i have ever had and darkwindoh i wish that father had not ordered me to seduce him he makes my blood hot my skin tingle never have i desired anyone as i desire himnot even father father i hate and needdarkwind i only needthe very thought of darkwind of his strong gentle hands of his melancholy eyes of his graceful body made her both want to melt into his arms and to pounce on him and wrestle him to the ground preparatory to another kind of wrestling altogether but mornelithe has ordered me to take himand thereforei will not she set her chin stubbornly tucked her head down and picked up her pace a bit but what if mornelithe were behind this what then i think it may depend upon if he sends more creatures against them tonight or if he has left a taint of himself that i can read if i find nothing i shall be silent but if i find tracesthen if i cani must speak the decision seemed easy until she realized that she had actually made it the realization took her by surprise why have i thought that what are they to me besides creatures who have been friendlykindly no one had ever been friendly or kindly to her not since mornelithe had eviscerated her nurses and given her sibs and playmates failures by his reckoning to his underlings to use as they would as he would give me to his underlings if he judged me a failure as he would kill me if he knew of my rebellion therefore he must not learn of itshe reached the border of the ruins before she expected she slowed to a walk and sharpened her eyes to catch the glow of body heat she knew in general where the gryphons nest was but not precisely she also freed her ears from her hair and extended them to catch any stray sound it didnt take her long to determine where the nest was she heard the murmur of voices echoing among the stones of the ruins and traced them back to their source she froze just behind the shelter of a brokendown wall hearing not only the gryphons but darkwind as well there was a redshouldered hawk circling around you when i left he was saying his voice sounded odd thick with emotion and hoarse dawnfires kyrr was a redshoulderedyou know i made her promise me that she wouldnt come around here today which may have been a missstake treyvan interrupted wearily nyara peeked around the end of the wall sssshe wasss curiousss very curiousss it isss entirely posssible ssshe did fullbond with her birrrd and whoeverrr it wasss that attacked usss may have attacked and killed herrr asss well if the birrrd diesss the bondmate diesss no yes darkwind replied but he sounded uncertain if they are in fullbond at the time but i didnt see any dead he faltered birds you might not hydona said emerging slowly from the entrance of the nest the little ones trailing after her it might not have ssstruck the grround perrrhapsss it wassss caught in a tree she went on to say more but nyara didnt hear her all of her attention had been caught by the female gryphon and the nestlings they bore the unmistakable stamp of her fathers taint hydona wore the contamination only lightly a glaring red tracery like burst veins and it was fading as if mornelithe had attempted something against her and had failed but the gryphlets she moaned silently to herself as she had learned only too well to do now she knew that it had been her father who had masterminded the attack on the gryphons and how and why the physical attack had never been intended to succeed it had been intended to bring the gryphons down out of action and only incidentally into his reach he had attempted to subvert hydona to insert his own will and mind into hers he surely found her too tough for him to take at least given the short amount of time he had to work in she knew he had never really meant to do more than make a cursory attempt to take them on the off chance that he would succeed by sheer accident because what he had really wanted was the opportunity to get at the little ones and work with them undisturbed she knew from bitter experience that it would not take him long at all with a young thing to subvert it to his will the gryphlets would not be as useful as quickly as the adultsbut they were more malleable and far less able to defend themselves against him and they had one thing the adults did not a direct tie into the powernode beneath their birthplace mornelithe wanted that he could pull power away from nodes by diverting some of the powerflows into them but he had no direct access to any nodes the only nodes anywhere near this area were the one beneath ktreva and the one beneath the gryphons nest both were within ktreva territory and out of mornelithes reach the powernode here was very deep but very strong and its leylines ran into ktreva vale through the young tainted gryphons mornelithe would have direct access to the node the line and very possibly could drain the node beneath ktreva or move it to his own stronghold it was entirely possible he would also have access to lines and nodes in the plains she had no idea if the node here was connected there or not and these ruins themselves could conceal artifacts from the ancient mage wars mornelithe had been trying to collect those for as long as she had been aware of his activities he had only been marginally successful in his quests gathering in creatures and devices either flawed broken or only marginally useful his ambition was to acquire something of great power one of the legendary permanent master gates for instance one of those would give him access to the old citadels of the lord adepts and those however ruined wherever they were hidden would undoubtedly contain things he would find useful but having access to this node is going to be bad enough she shuddered at the idea of mornelithe with that much power in his hands this nexus was far more important far more powerful than the birdkin guessed if they had known they would have either drained it or built their vale here nyara closed her eyes and saw her fathers face slit eyes gleaming down at her gloating with power beyond her weak imagination as she trembled with that much power she would never be free of him she straightened and walked into the circle of stones before the nest her foot stirred a tiny stone as she moved and the human and gryphons sprang up gryphons with talons bared darkwind with his dagger drawn they relaxed when they saw her treyvan sitting back down with a sigh gesssta sssaid that ssshe would assk nyarrra to some ssstand watch thisss night for usss treyvan told darkwind ssshe sssseesss well by night and we trussst herrrr you shouldnt nyara replied stifling a sob oh you should not have trusted me darkwind seized her by the arm and pulled her into the stone circle just what do you mean by that he snarled and slowly holding back tears she told them chapter eighteen elspeth this was possibly the strangest land elspeth had ever crossed there were no roads and no obvious landmarks just furlong after furlong of undulating grass plains there were clumps of brush and even treelines following watercourses but grassland was the rule down on the dhorisha plains it was truly a trackless wilderness and one without many ways of figuring out where you were once you were in the middle of it right now the plains were in the middle of high summer not the best time to travel across them nights were short days were scorching and long the grass was bleached to a pale gold insects sang night and day down near the roots otherwise there wasnt much sign of life no animals running through the grass no birds in the air or rather there was nothing they could spot the plains might well teem with life as hidden in the grass as the insects but silent here where the tall waving weeds made excellent cover there was no reason for an animal to break and run and every reason for it to stay quietly hidden where it was a constant hot breeze blew from the south every day dying down at sunset and dawn and picking up again at night and not just hot but dry parchingly dry thirst was always with them it seemed that no sooner had they drunk from their water skins than they were thirsty again elspeth was very glad of the map since they had descended into the plains near a spring shed puzzled out the shinain glyph for water the water that was very precious out here in the summer this was not a desert but there wasnt a trace of humidity day or night and there would be no relief until the rains came in the fall the mouth and nose dehydrated skin was flaking and tight and eyes sore and gritty most of the time many of the water sources shown on the map were not springs or streams which would have been visible by the belt of green vegetation along their banks but were wells there was no outward sign of these wells anywhere in fact they were frequently hidden from casual searching and could only be found by triangulating on objects like rocks a mark on the cliff wall a clump of ancient thornbushes there were detailed incredibly tiny drawings of the pertinent markers beside each waterglyph elspeth marveled again and again at the ingenuity of the shinain and their mapmakers and she was very glad that she did not have to travel the plains by winter a bitter winter wind howling unchecked across those vast expanses of flat land would chill an unprotected horse and rider to the bone in no time and there was little fuel out here except the dried droppings of animals and the everpresent grass would it be somehow possible to compact the grass into logs there were no natural shelters from the winter winds either at least that she had seen small wonder the shinain were a hardy breed since their goal was the northern rim of the plains they had chosen to follow the edge keeping it always on their right as they rode but elspeth wondered aloud on their third day out just how the shinain managed to find their way across the vast plains once they were out of sight of the cliffs and soon or late they must be out of sight of those natural walls how could they tell where they were skif shrugged when she voiced her question homing instinct like birds he hazarded landmarks we cant see he didnt seem particularly interested in the puzzle the sword snortedmentally of course they use the stars of course like seafarers with the stars and a compass you can judge pretty accurately where you are i expect some of those little scribbles on your map are notes readings based on the compass and the stars and i know the lines they have crosshatching it are some way of reckoning locations they have that you dont elspeth nodded shed heard of such a thing but no one in landlocked valdemar had ever seen the sea much less met those who plied it they both had compasses bought in katashinain though skif had complained that he couldnt see what difference knowing where north was would make if they got lost shed bought them anyway mostly because she saw them in places where the shinain often bought madegoods she reckoned that if the clansmen needed and used them she should have one too she bit her tongue when he complained and somehow kept herself from pointing out that on a featureless plain if he knew which way north was he would at least be able to prevent himself from wandering around in a circle the cliff wall loomed over their heads so high above them that the enormous trees on the top seemed little more than twigs and one couldnt hope to see a human without the aid of a distanceviewer elspeth had one of those too purchased again in katashinain skif hadnt complained about that but he had coughed when hed learned the price it was expensive yes but not more than the same instrument would have been in valdemarif you could find one that the guard hadnt commandeered here they were common and every caravan leader had one the lenses came from farther south carried between layers of bright silk and were installed in their tubes by jewelsmiths in katashinain the workmanship was the equal of or superior to anything she had seen in valdemar elspeth ignored skifs silent protest over the purchase of the distanceviewer as shed ignored the vocal one over the compasses she had saved a goodly amount of their money on the road by augmenting their rations with hunting she also had a certain amount of discretionary money and some real profit she had made by shrewd gemselling she had a notion that quenten had known these gemstones amber and turquoise changestone and amethyst were rarer here and therefore in high demand for he had invested quite a bit of their valdemaren gold in them she was very glad the mage had it enabled her to make those purchases without feeling guilty about the expense shed done very well with her first attempt at jewel trading so she didnt feel that skif had any room to complain about how she spent some of that money there was a curious slant to his complaintsa feeling that it wasnt so much that she had spent the money but that she hadnt first consulted him she also had a sneaking suspicion that if she had spent that same money on silks and perfumes he would not have been making any complaint and that plainly and simply angered her not that she hadnt wanted silks and perfumes but this was neither the time nor the place for fripperies instead of buying those silks and perfumes she had bought other things altogether the compasses and distanceviewer some special hotweather gear and a full kit of medicines new to her but which the healers here seemed to depend on if she could get them home intact she would let healers collegium see what they could do with these new remedies she had bought two sets of throwing knives in case she had to use and leave the set she now wore she had purchased an enveloping cloak and had gotten one for skif as wellbecause as they left katashinain at the break of dawn they had been wearing their whites again and she had wanted to disguise fthe fact until they were well down onto the plains wearing their whites again was not something shed insisted on just for the sake of being contrary though skif seemed to think so it had seemed to her that since the shinain already knew what heralds were it would be a good thing to travel the plains in the uniform of their calling skif argued that theyd been in disguise to avoid spies she pointed out that it would make no difference one way or another insofar as possible spies were concerned if ancar could get spies near enough the plains for them to be seen he was more powerful than any of them had ever dreamed and whether or not they wore their whites would make no difference but if he were not that powerful then wearing their uniforms could provide them with a modicum of protection from the shinain the plainsfolk had a reputation for shooting first and questioning the wounded being able to identify themselves as nonhostile at a distance was no bad idea except that even with all the best reasons in the world skif didnt like that idea either she was just about ready to kill him in his saddle now that he had her alone he seemed determined to prove how devoted he was to her safety but he was going about it by looking black every time she did something that was unfeminine or rather something that asserted her authority by disagreeing with her decisions and by repeating whenever possible his assertion that this was a mistake and they should go back to the original plan if that was devotion she was beginning to wish for detestation tonight they camped beside a spring easy enough to spot from leagues away as a patch of green against the goldenbrown of the waving sea of grass because of that she had decided to bypass the well they encountered earlier in the afternoon and journey on into darkness to reach the spring after all they were supposed to be making as much time as possible right they couldnt possibly bypass the place it was the only spot ahead of them with trees they couldnt even miss in the dark theyd smell the difference when they reached water and the vegetation that wasnt scorched brown and even if against all odds they did miss it the companions would not skif predictably had not cared for that either he only voiced one complaint that he didnt think it was a good idea to push themselves that hard in unknown territory but he did broodshe was tempted to think sulked but did not give in to the temptationright up until the moment they made camp she couldnt think why he should have any objections not when theyd already agreed to make as much time as possible all she could think was that it was more of the samehe didnt want her to make the decisions once there they had chores mutually agreed on she avoided him with a fair amount of success while he set up camp she collected water and fuel not too much of the latter they didnt need much more than to brew a little tea elspeth was nervous about grass fires one spark could set the entire area ablaze as dry as this vegetation was in her view skif was simply not careful enough when she returned with her double handful of twigs and fallen branches she discovered he had etched a shallow little pocket in the turf just big enough to hold the fire she intended to build plainly that was not good enough but skif was a child of cities and likely had never seen a grass fire it was hard for someone like skif to imagine the fury or the danger of a grass fire a city fire now that was something they could comprehendbut grass grass was tinder it wasnt serious it burned up in the blink of an eye and was gone with no damage right elspeth knew better it was tinder it caught fire that easily and burned with incredible heat but there was a lot of it out hereacres and acresand that was what skif couldnt comprehend she had never ever forgotten the description kero had given her of a patrol caught in the path of a grass fire during her days as merc captain of the skybolts kero had described it so vividly it still lived in her memory it was a wall of flame as tall as a man driving everything before it herds of wild cattle were followed by a stampede of sheep that was followed by a sea of rabbits frightened so witless theyd charge straight up to a man and run into his legs that was followed by the little birds that lived in the grass and a river of miceand then the wall was on top of you you could hear it roaring a league away and nearby it was deafening it moved as fast as a man can run and it sent up a great black pall of smoke a regular curtain that went straight up into the sky the burning area was farther than i could jumpat the leading edge the ends of the grasses were afire in the middle all of this years growthbut on the trailing edge all the previous years growth that was packed down was burning as fiercely as wood and hotter kero paused and passed her hand over her eyes everyone let go their beasts you couldnt hold em not even shinainbreds a couple of the youngsters im told tried to run across the fire it was unbelievably hot their clothing anything that was cloth and not leather or metal caught fire not that it mattered the hot air stole the breath from them they fell down in the middle of the flames trying to scream and with no breath to do it burning alive the rest the ones that survived wet their shields and cloaks down with their water skins put their shields over their backs and their wet cloaks over that and hunkered down under bothlike turtles under tablecloths is what one lad told me they stuck their faces right down into the dirt and did their best to breathe as little as possible that was how they made it and even some of those got scorched lungs from the burning air she shook her head dont ever let anyone tell you a grass fire is nothing girl i lost half that patrol to one and the rest spent days with the healers for burns inside and out its not nothing its hell on earth my cousins fear fire the way they fear no living thing no a grass fire was nothing to take lightly on the other hand there was no purpose to be served in giving skif a lecture especially not the way she felt right now anything she told him would come out shrewish anything she said would be discounted not that it wouldnt anyway rather than risk sounding like a fishwife she simply took out her knife and cut a larger circle in the turf removing blocks of it and setting them aside to replace when they were finished she made a clear space about half as wide as she was tall skif sat and seethed when he saw her kindling a tiny fire in the middle of this comparatively vast expanse of clear earth but he didnt comment then again he didnt have to she didnt even have to see his face his posture said it all even without her saying a word he took what she did as criticism was it she couldnt help it better to do without a little tea than risk a fire she decided that he was going to seethe no matter what she did whether or not she said anything and when the tea was boiled and their trail rations had been toasted over the fire she put the fire out and replaced the blocks of turf enjoying in a masochistic kind of way the filthy mess she was making of her handsagain to the accompaniment of odd looks from skif he thinks youre doing this just to avoid him the sword observed cheerfully i dont particularly care what he thinks she retorted i do care about making sure any watchers know that were being careful with their land it seems to me that since were here on their sufferance wed better think first about how theyre judging us and i know theyre out there watchers the sword responded theyre there she replied therere at least four need said after a moment i didnt know you could see through shields you must be much better than i thought she came very close to laughing out loud i cant i simply guessed the shinain are notorious for not allowing strangers on their land and that they not only allowed us they gave us a map says that they are bending rules they prefer to leave intact that didnt mean that they were going to leave us on our own they dont trust us that much if we didnt actually see anyone watching us it followed that they were hiding they arent going to stop us but ill bet that if we did something wrong wed be disinvited and if we strayed from the path wed be herded back she thought about it for a moment it was the first thing that had offered her any amusement all day might be fun to do it and see how theyd get us back on track i bet it wouldnt be as straightforward as riding up and helping us back to the right way i bet theyd start a stampede or something the sword was silent for a moment convoluted reasoning that if we cant see them they must be there merc reasoning elspeth replied and let it go at that when she finished replacing the turfs she looked up to see skif still sitting there watching her there was no moon tonight only starlight but his whites stood out easily enough against the high grass and the night sky and seemed to shimmer a little with a light of their own he looked like something out of a tale or a maidens dream she thought scornfully a hero a stalwart man to depend on for everything perfect strong handsomeand ready to take the entire burden of responsibility on his shoulders she stood up so did he she moved off a little experimentally he followed more than followed he came closer and put his arms around her and she stiffened she couldnt help herself it just happened automatically without thinking she didnt want him to touch hernot like that not with the touch of a lover dont he said sharply dont what she asked just as sharply trying to pull away without being obvious about it dont be like that dont be so cold elspeth he replied softening his tone a little you never used to be like this around me you never used to follow me like a lovesick puppy she retorted getting free of him walking away a little to get some distance and turning to face him you used to be my big brother until all this started that was before i paid any attention tohow much youd grown up he responded all right so i was a fool before i wasnt paying any attention to what was in front of my nose but ive oh gods its a bad romantic play she didnt know whether to laugh or cry both would have been so full of anger that they would have made her incoherent youve been paying too much attention to idiot balladeers she interrupted rudely all of which say that the young hero is supposed to finally notice the beauty of the young princess fall madly in love rescue her and carry her off to some ivywreathed tower to spend the rest of her days in sheltered worship she took a deep breath but the anger didnt fade ive heard all of that horse manure before i didnt believe in it then and i dont now youre not a hero and neither am i im not a beauty i just happen to be the only woman whos a herald around here i dont need rescuing and i dont want to be sheltered but he said weakly taking a step back and overwhelmed with her vehemence stop it skif she snapped ive been nice ive hinted ive tolerated this and i am not going to take any more leave me alone if you cant treat me as your partner go home nothing is going to happen to me in the middle of the dhorisha plains for havens sake she waved her arm out at the expanse of trackless grass to the south of them therere half a dozen shinain out there right now and i doubt any of them is going to let something get past them thats not the point elspeth he said pleadingly the point is that i dont you dare say it she snarled dont you dare say that you love me you dont love me you love what you think i am if you loved me you wouldnt keep trying to prove you were better than me that i should follow your lead let you take over permit you to make all the decisions but im not but you are she retorted every decision i make you find a reason not to like every job i try to do you try to do better every idea i have you oppose except in those times when im acting thinking like a good little girl who shouldnt bother her pretty head about warfare and should go where shes been told and learn the pretty little magics shes been told to learn im not like that he bristled some of my best friends are female she very nearly strangled him soany female youre not interested in can be a human being is that it she said her voice dripping scorn but any female you want had better keep her proper place or is it just that every female who outranks you can have her position and be whatever she needs to be and anyone whos your peer had better let you be the leader oh thats noble that truly is how nice for you how terribly broadminded just who do you think you are he shouted myself thats who she shouted back not your inferior not your underling not your child to take care of not your doll not your toy not your princess and not your property and with that she turned and stalked off into the grass knowing she could lose him in a scant heartbeatand knowing that gwena could find her immediately if elspeth needed her she ducked around a hillock and dropped down into the dusty smelling grass she held her breath and listened for his footsteps waited for him to blunder by in pursuit of her but there was nothing gwena she mindcalled tentatively hes just sitting here on his bedroll she said and the disapproval in her mindvoice was thick enough to cut that was cruel elspeth slammed her shields shut before gwena could reproach her any further she didnt want to hear any more from that quarter gwena was on skifs side in this like some kind of matchmaking mama shed escaped her real mothers reach and she wasnt about to let someone else take over the position she lay back into the fragrant grass it was surprisingly comfortable actuallyand looked up at the night sky the night was absolutely clear and the stars seemed larger than they were at home her back and neck ached with tension her hands had knotted themselves into tight fists her stomach was in an uproar and her throat tight this was no way to handle a problem she tried to empty her mind just empty it of all the anger and frustration the need that was driving her out into the unknown and the heavy burden of responsibility she was bearing gradually the tension drained out of her her stomach calmed her hands relaxed she concentrated on the muscles in her back and neck until they unknotted she stopped thinking altogether she simplywas watching the stars letting the warm everpresent breeze blow over her inhaling the dry dusty scent of the grasses she lay in feeling the earth press up against her back this place felt very much alive as if the warm earth itself was a living being it calmed her she found her tension all drained out of her down into the earth which accepted it into a tranquillity that her unhappiness could not disturb gwenas right i was cruel she felt her ears flushing hotly and yet if she had the chance to do it over there was nothing she would not have repeated what happened to us there was a time i would have gladly heard him say he loved me there was even a time when i might have been able to fall in love with him gwena was right i could do so much worse tears filled her eyes they stung and burned not from what she had done to skifhe was resilient hed survive but from what she was going to face in the years ahead if we all survive this i probably will do worse ill probably have to marry some awful old man or a scrawny little boy just to cement an alliance well need all the help we can get and that may be the only way to buy it if i took skif id at least have someone who loves me for a little whilebut that wasnt fair to him it was wrong absolutely wrong shed be using him and the affection he was offering and giving him nothing in return she didnt love him and there was no use pretending she did furthermore he was a mindspeaker hed know besides when she married that awful old man whoever he was shed have to break with skif anyway so what was the point what was the point of all of this at all when it all came down to it she was just another commodity to be traded away for valdemars safety and intellectually she could accept that but emotionally she asked the stars fiercely as tears ran down into her hair why do i have to give up everything why cant i have a little something for myself thats not being selfish thats just being human talia has dirk kero has eldan even mother has daren why isnt there anyone for me there was no answer she held back fierce sobs until her chest ached maybe she wasnt as sophisticated as she had thought after all maybe all her life she had believed in the bardic ballads where after long struggle the great true love comes riding out of the shadows all right maybe its childish and stupid but ive seen it happenhappen for other people that fact was the notion was childish and stupidand worse if she spent all her time waiting for that one true love shed never get anything done for herself but oh it hurt to renounce the dreamchapter nineteen interlude dawnfire woke all at once her heart racing with fear but her body held in a strange kind of paralysis she couldnt see anything all she could feel was that she was so hungry she was almost sick and that she was standing her position seemed to be oddly hunched over butno it wasnt hunched over it was a perfectly normal positionfor kyrrs body she was still in the body of her bondbird onlykyrr was gone she was alone she opened her beak to cry out and couldntand then the paralysis lifted and a hazy golden light came up about her gradually so that her eyes werent dazzled she was on a perch as she teetered on the perch clutching it desperately trying to find her balance without kyrr to help her she saw that there were bracelets on her legs and jesses attached to them and that the jesses were fastened to a ring on the perch the light came up further she moved her head cautiously at the sound of a deepthroated chuckle to discover that now she could see the entire room an empty windowless roomexcept for a bit of furniture one couch and its occupant she couldnt help herself panic made her bate and she flapped uncontrolled right off the perch she couldnt fly even if she hadnt been jessed she hadnt kyrrs controland she hung at the end of the leather straps upsidedown swinging and twisting as she beat at the air and the perch with her wings i cant get back up that sent her into a further panic and she flailed wildly in every direction but the right one with no result whatsoever she twisted and turned tangled herself up and banged her beak against the perch support and never once got a claw on the perch itself finally she exhausted herself she hung in her jesses with her heart beating so hard she could scarcely breathe listening to it thunder in her ears growing sicker and weaker with every moment she stayed inverted she had gone as any raptor would from a state of uncontrolled panic to a state of benumbed shock she was hanging facing the wall not the room beyond and its bizarre occupant she didnt even hear the footsteps coming toward her because of the sound of her own heart suddenly there was a hand behind her back and another under her feet she clutched convulsively as she was lifted back up onto the perch she released the hand as soon as she was erect transferring her grip to the sturdy wood as the changechild took his gloved hand away and smiled enigmatically down on her having trouble dear child he purred stepping back a pace or two to observe her the glove was the only article of clothing he was wearing and now he pulled it off and tossed it on a shelf next to her perch he really didnt need much in the way of clothinglong silky tawnygold hair covered him from head to toeexcept for certain strategic areas if she could have blushed she would have it wasnt as if she hadnt seen nude males before certainly there was no nudity taboo among the tayledras but he seemed to flaunt his sexuality like some kind of weapon it was somehow obscene even though he wasnt doing anything overtly to make it so it was all in posture unspoken bodylanguage he seemed to sense her embarrassment and take amusement from itand that made it even more obscene he looked like a cata lynxand he moved like a cat as he padded back to his couch that was where she had seen him when the light came up reclining with indolent grace on a wide couch piled high with silken pillows in black and golden tones that matched his hair he resumed his position with studied care and a fluidity not even a real cat could have matched then rested his head on one hand to watch her with unwinking slitted eyes her feet twitched a little and she teetered on the perch that was when she realized just how helpless she truly was he didnt need the jesses except to keep her from falling to the floor every time she bated without kyrr she was as helpless in this body as a newborn chick she could do simple things that were largely a matter of reflexlike perchingbut anything more complicated than that was out of the question she could no more fly now than she could in her own body she stared at him in despair he smiled and slowly sensuously licked his lips i he said in a deep echoing voice am mornelithe falconsbane you made the fundamental mistake of attacking me and i am afraid that you dear child are my prisoner to do with as i will fear chilled her and made all her feathers slick tight to her body as he said that mornelithe falconsbanethis must be the adept that darkwinds changechild had fled from the adept that had trapped and tormented her dyheli herdhis name did not invoke a feeling of comfort in a tayledras its a pity that you managed to have yourself trapped in that birds body he continued the ways that i may derive pleasure from it are so limited but im sure you can be flexible he mocksighed and lowered his lids over his slitted greengolden eyes looking at her through thick lashes she clutched the perch nervously swaying back and forth her mouth dry with fear as she waited for him to do something he raised a single finger the door beside his couch opened and a human in goldenbrown leather that clung to his body as if it had been sewn around him entered the room carrying a deep pannier he went straight to her perch as she flapped in alarm and put the basket down underneath it then he untied her jesses from the ring tied a leather leash to it instead and attached the leash to her jesses then he turned his back on her and left her all without saying so much as a single word she looked down into the basket cowering in fear and looking up at her were three live mice now her stomach growled with hunger even while her mind rolled with nausea she stared down at the mice ravenous and feeling just as trapped as they were she was starvingthis was food and she didnt have the slightest idea of how to kill and eat it kyrr would but kyrr was gone then it hit her kyrr was gone not waiting patiently in the back of the birds mind but gone completely dead part of her soul her heart her lifegone without a trace she was completely alone in a way she had not been since she was ten the grief that descended over her was so total that she forgot everything including her hunger oh kyrrher beak gaped but nothing happened not even a single sob she couldnt cry she wasnt even human anymore how could she mourn as a hawk she didnt know and the inability to cry out her pain and loss redoubled it they were both lost she and kyrrand they would never come home again she closed her eyes and rocked from foot to foot trapped in a sea of black grief drowning in it a satisfied chuckle made her snap her head up and open her eyes wide mornelithe was watching her with amusement her grief turned to rage in the blink of an eye she mantled and screamed at him her cry piercing the silence and shattering itthough she was careful to keep a tight grip on the rough wood of her perch as she shrieked her defiance at him he found that even more amusing his smile broadened and his chuckle turned into a hearty laugh perhaps you wont be a disappointment after all clever birdchild he caressed her with his eyes and her rage spilled away leaving her weak and frightened again he returned his gaze to something in his lap and as he shifted a little she could see that it was a dark crystal scryingstone he stared at it his gaze suddenly going from casual to penetratingand what he saw in it made him frown chappter twenty darkwind starblade turned away from the little knot of tayledras adepts and healers surrounding dawnfires ekele in despair and sought the sanctuary of his own ekele the fools were trying to thrash out what could have killed dawnfire and whywhen it was obvious as obvious a taint on the girls body as the taint on his own soul and the contamination that had cracked the heartstone he knew it the moment he saw it and he could not say a single word he felt old oldburdened with secrets too terrible to hide that he could not confess to anyone weary with the weight of them sick to his bones of what he had done as he had so many times he climbed the stairs to his ekele then sought the chamber at the top and stood looking down on the vale wondering if this time he could find the strength to open the window and hurl himself to the ground but the crow on his shoulder flapped to its perch as soon as he entered the room and sat there watching him with cold derisive eyes and he knew even as he fought the compulsion to turn away from the window and suicide that mornelithe falconsbane still had his soul in a fist of steel and there was nothing he had that he could call his own not his thoughts not his will not his mind he flung himself down on the sleeping pad hoping to lose himself in that dark oblivionbut sleep eluded him and falconsbane evidently decided to remind him of what he was the memoryspell seized him smoke wreathed through the trees as he paused in an area he had thought safe and the acrid fumes made him cough the fire was spreading far faster than it should have for a moment starblade wondered if perhaps he should go back for help but other emergencies had emptied the vale of all but apprentices and children and he had a reputation to maintain he was an adept after all and a simple thing like a forest fire shouldnt prove too hard to handle he sought shelter from the smoke down in a little hollow a cup among some hills and closed his eyes to concentrate on his first task no you fool starblade cried at his younger self go back get help nothing trivial would frighten that many firebirds but this was a vision of the past and his younger self did not heed the silent screaming in his own mind he reached out with his mind seeking the panicstricken firebirds first of all until he could get them calmed and sent away he would never be able to put the flames out one by one he touched their minds turned their helpless panic into need for escape instead of defense and sent them winging back to the vale one of the beasttenders the tayledras who spoke easily to the minds of animals would take care of them he had a fire to quench there were more firebirds than he had expected and they were in a complete state of mindlessness it took time to calm them but while he had stood there like a fool the fire had jumped the tiny pocket of greenery where he worked and ringed him he opened his eyes weary with the effort of controlling the birds to find himself surrounded by a wall of flame and heat the leaves were withering even as he watched the vegetation wilting beneath the heat of the hungry flames fear chilled him even as the heat made him break into a sweat that was when he realized when he reached for the power to quench it that he had exhausted himself in calming the birdsand that he was cut off from the node and the nearest leylines something had sprung up while he worked something had arisen to fence him away from the power he needed not only to quell the fire but even to save himself he was enveloped in a wall of shielding as dangerous as the wall of flame smoke poured into the hollow something brushed against his leg and he glanced down to see that a rabbit blind with panic had taken shelter behind his ankle the heat increased with every passing moment it wouldnt be long before this little valley was afire like the rest of the forest here he was not clothed for a fire he had run out in his ordinary gear a light vest and breeches he had nothing to protect him from the flames nothing to breathe through there was only one thing he could dowrap the remains of his power about him in as strong a shield as he could muster and runas the nearest flames licked toward him he sent his bird up into the safety of the skies and sprinted for what he hoped was the easiest way out straight into hell on the sleeping pad his body writhed in remembered agony his mouth shaping screams of pain he was not permitted to voice flames licked his body hungry tongues reaching out from burning scrub a tree trunk there was no pain at firstjust a kind of warm pressure a caress as he ran past then came the pain after the flame had touchedred heat that blossomed into agony sparks fell on him as he dashed under a falling blazing branch he wrapped his hair around his mouth and still the air he breathed scorched his lungs within moments there was nothing but painand the fear of a horrible death that drove his legs thencool smokeless air he burst out past the fireline into the unburned forest freedom but not from pain he fell into a stream moaning extinguishing his smoldering leather clothing and hair the stream cooled him but did nothing for the pain for the horrible burns where the skin was blackened and crisped on his arm how long he lay there he did not know smoke wreathed over him but the flames did not grow nearer he could not tell if it was the smoke that darkened his sightor his pain only that after a dark breathless time of agony salvation loomed out of the smoke a spirit of mercyvague and ghostlike no he screamed no dont believe him kill yourself draw your knife kill yourself while you have the chance he reached out toward the mistwreathed shape who seemed to be someone he knew yet could not identify hazy with an intimation of power the strangers white hair was a beacon that drew his eyes white haira tayledras adept surely yes he knew this one he must rainwing frostfire both were recluses no matterhe managed a croak and the other started and turned his steps in starblades direction no he moaned no i thought i heard someone call said the other stooping over him in concern i see i was right his lips shaped words he could not speak for lack of breath help mesilver hair wove a web of light that dazzled his eyes the adepts own eyes gildedsilver held his i will have to take you to my home the other said worriedly the fire has cut us off from tayledras vale but i can tend you there never fear will that be all right starblade nodded giving consent and as a consequence of that consent relaxed all of his defenses and as the other bent closer over him to lift him in amazingly strong arms he thought he saw a peculiar gleam in the others eyeshe awoke again resting on something soft his arms thrown over his head with a tawny silken coverlet swathing him from chest to feet he still hurt but he was no longer covered with angry blackened burns and he took a deep experimental breath to find his lungs clear again then he tried to move his armsand couldnt he tried harder struggling against silk rope that bound him hand and footwith no better success a deep chuckle answered his efforts he twisted his head to face the source of the sound so eager to take leave of my hospitality said the tall catlike changechild smiling as he paced toward the couch on which starblade lay tethered the creature had modeled himself on a lynx was clothed mostly in his own tawnysilk hair but wearing a supple elaborately tooled and beaded leather loincloth howuncivilized of you ithesmiled with sensuously parted lips starblade wrestled furiously against his bonds my clan will know where i am he warned even if you kill me they will know where i am and they will they will do nothing the changechild yawned examining the flex of his own fingers for a moment admiring his needlesharp talons you accepted my offer of help consented to come away with me you will leave no trail of distress for them to followand you are behind my walls and shields now call all you like they will not hear you starblade snarled his defiance you forget misborni am tayledras my bird will bring them here he sought for karrys mind with his own even as the changechild moved slightly aside and gestured if you mean thatit tried foolishly to attack me starblade followed the gesture to a shadowshrouded corner where something thin and almosthuman looked up with wild unfocused eyes its hands and mouth full of feathers perlin falcon feathers karrys feathers silent tears ran into his hair silent sobs shook his body none of it brought karry back the crow cawed it sounded like scornful laughter the changechild sat on the edge of the couch and flicked away the covering leaving him naked and unprotected even by a thin layer of silk he shrank away involuntarily i am called mornelithe rash birdman the creature said idly gliding a talon along starblades side i think i shall take another name now falconsbane he glanced sharply at starblade who continued to fight his bonds though his eyes blurred with the tears for karry he would notyetshed and believe me my captive in a shorter time than you dream possible you will have another name for me he paused and a slow lascivious smile curled the corners of his mouth master he said savoring the word then he bent over his captive and transfixed him with a pair of green slitpupiled eyes that grew and grew until they filled starblades entire field of vision i think we shall begin the lessoning now mercifully he could no longer remember that lessoning not even under the goad of mornelithes spell it involved pain it also involved pleasure both hovered at the edge of endurance mornelithe was a past master at the manipulation of either of combining the two when it was over mornelithe had the keys to his soul he knelt before the changechild abasing himself as fully as he could worshiping his master and detesting himself for doing so all that was in his lineofsight at the moment was the golden marble of the floor and mornelithes clawed feet thankfully he had not yet been required to kiss them this time ah birdman mornelithe chuckled you grovel so charmingly so gracefully it is almost a pity to let you up starblade felt himself flush with shame then chill with fear too many times in the past such seemingly casual words had led to another lesson you have learned your place in the scheme of things quite thoroughly i think mornelithe continued it is time to let you return to your lovely home instead of elation the words brought a rush of sickness bad enough what he had becomebut to return to the vale bringing this contamination with himhe wanted to refuse he wanted to rise take the dagger at his belt and slay his tormentor he wanted to take that same dagger and slay himself he tried to assert his will he closed his eyes and concentrated on placing his hand on the hilt of that dagger he was an adepthe had training experience his own personal powers his will had been honed to an instrument like the starblade of his usename surely he could reclaim himself again yes yes he could he could feel his will stirring and opened his mouth to denounce his captor yes master he heard himself say softly if it is your will he felt his lips stretching in an adoring smile his head lifted to meet mornelithes unwinking eyes his hand did not move from the floor there were two starblades inside his mind one worshiped mornelithe and looked to his master for all direction that was the one that was in control and there was no unseating it but buried deep inside away from all control bound and gagged and able only to feel was the real starblade mornelithe could have destroyed even this remnant he had not only because it amused him to see his victim continue to suffer long after the contest of wills had ended i do not entirely trust you dear friend mornelithe said softly as he reached down and touched starblades cheek you were a stubborn creature and i do not entirely trust you away from my sight so i shall send you a watcher alsoone that the rest will take for your new bondbird here he snapped his fingers and held out his handand a huge crow identical in every way to those the tayledras bonded with flapped out of the shadows beside mornelithes chair to land on the outstretched arm the changechild gestured with a lifted finger that starblade should rise from his crouch to a simple kneeling position the tayledras body obeyed instantly even while his helpless mind screamed a protest the crow lifted silently from mornelithes wrist and dropped down onto his shoulder and what little remained of starblades will was frozen with paralysis there mornelithe said with satisfaction that should take care of any little problems we may have hmm the crow cawed mockingly joining mornelithes laughterthe memoryspell released him leaving him limp and shaking with the echo of that laughter in his ears from the moment he had left mornelithes strongholdwhich leavetaking he did not rememberhe had been completely under the adepts control and mornelithe was an adept there was no doubt of that all that he lacked to make him a major power was control of a node the only two for any distance around lay in the hands of the tayledras mornelithe intended to change that and at the time of his release that was all that starblade had known he had no idea what mornelithe planned nor when he was found wandering in the heart of the burned area did he even remember that he had been taken instead he had false memories of being overcome with smoke of losing karry somewhere in the heart of the fireof taking a blow to the head from a falling tree then vague and confused recollections of crawling off and hiding in a wolverines hole until the fire passed of smokesickness that pinned him in the area for several days of bonding to a huge crow who brought him fruit to feed him and supply his fevered body with liquids and his final desperate attempt to get back to the vale and the false memories passed muster the crow was unremarked upon he had only an unusually touchy temper that caused his friends and son to give him some distance until he should regain his normal calm any changes in him theyand heascribed to the trauma he had endured and they all felt that those changes would pass in time all else seemed well until the ritual to move the heartstone only then after the disaster did his true memories return and it was then that the rest of his hidden memories emergedmemories of going to the heartstone every night and creating a flaw in it leeching the power away from a place deep inside and creating an instability that would not be revealed until the entire power of the vale had been loaded into it preparatory to bridging the distance between the old heartstone and the new that was the first night he had tried to fling himself from the top of his ekele once again mornelithe exerted his power over him through the compulsions planted as deeply within him as he had planted the flaw in the stone the crow was the intermediary of those compulsions and since it never left his side mornelithes hand was always upon him and when he tried to confess his pollution he found his tongue uttering simple pleasantries when he tried to open his mind to let others see the traitor within their ranks he found himself completely unable to lower his own shields as he had been in mornelithes stronghold he was bound gagged and paralyzed a prisoner within his own mind still toyed with and controlled for falconsbanes pleasures and purposes at least half of the time that tiny portion of himself that was still free was buried so deeply that it was not even aware of what passed what mornelithe made him do and say all he could do in the moments he was free to speak and act however circumspectly was to alienate his son in the barren hope that once made into an enemy anything starblade supported darkwind would work against it looked as if the ploy was working at least it had until the deathno murderof dawnfire once again the hand of mornelithe falconsbane had reached out to take what he wanted and again starblade had been helpless to prevent it there was only one further hope darkwind had withdrawn from the company of mages after the disaster darkwind lived outside the influence of the flawed and shattered heartstone so darkwinds powers should be uncontaminated by mornelithes covert influence if he could just get darkwind to take up his powers againdarkwind would call for help from the nearest clan the deceptions that had held for so long would shatter under close examination and mornelithe would find himself locked out once again but how to get darkwind to resume his powers after all that starblade had done to keep him from doing just that starblade groaned and threw his arm over his eyes there seemed no way out not for him nor for anyone else ksheyna was doomed and his was the hand that had doomed it the only way out was death and even that had been denied him damn you falconsbane he shrieked inside his own mind and it seemed to him that he caught a faroff echo of derisive laughter darkwind felt torn in a hundred pieces divided within himself by conflicting emotions responsibilities and loyalties treyvan had kindled a magelight a dim orange glow in the center of the ceiling of the lair yet another surprise to darkwind he hadnt known the gryphon could do that either he slumped in one corner of the gryphons lair with his head buried in his hands and his mind going in circles hydona curled protectively around her youngsters trying to minimize whatever harm falconsbane had already done them her shields were up at full strength with treyvans augmenting them darkwinds shields augmented both of theirs he had never renounced that part of his magecraft and he squandered his own energies recklessly to stave off any more disaster that might befall his friends nyara sat curled into a ball in the opposite corner of the lair with as much distance between herself and the rest of them as she could manage after his initial outburst of rageduring which he had come very close to breaking her neck with his bare handsdarkwinds anger toward the changechild faded after all none of this was of nyaras plotting he should have known better than to leave her with the hertasi who were mostly creatures of daylight to keep her watched at a distance by tervardi and dyheli who also moved mostly by day i should have found a nightscout willing to watch her he thought distractedly hindsight is always perfect all right he said breaking the silence and making everyone jump he turned to nyara who shrank farther back into her corner her eyes wide and frightened stop that he snapped his tightlystrung nerves making him lash out at her as the only available target im not going to kill you yet treyvan rumbled he had taken nyaras news much worse than hydona his mate tended to ignore the past as beyond change and was interested only in what she could do to fix what had been done to her younglings treyvan felt doubly guilty because he had failed to protect hydona and because he had failed to protect his offspring darkwind knew exactly how he felt nyara tried to melt into the rock behind her her eyes now wide and focused on treyvan darkwind recaptured her attention i want to know everything that you know about us and what he knows that youre sure of i mean not only what youve told your ffalconsbane but what he knew before this nyara shivered but looked as if she didnt quite understand his question he stood up walked over to her and towered over her what does he know about the vale he asked speaking every word carefully begin from the very first thing you knew nyara began stuttering to tell them fairly simple bits of intelligence that anyone could have figured out for himself that the only nodes falconsbane could possibly access were in tayledras hands that he had made several attempts to get at one or the other of the nodes she identified each attempt that she knew of going back to long before the arrival of the gryphons most of these trials had been lowkey tentative feints and as she spoke she gained confidence until she was no longer stuttering with fear and no longer speaking in short choppy sentences most of the feints she described darkwind had already been aware of but then she took him by surprise then ffather decided to take the vale from within i think she said her hands crooking into claws as her eyes glazed a little this was when he was angry with me and he washe washe was angry with me her expressive face was as still as stone and darkwind sensed that this had been one of those periods when falconsbane had trained her using methods it made him ill even to contemplate but this was important she had said that falconsbane meant to take the vale from within he had to know what that meant and what had happened what did he mean by that he prompted she gave him a frightened startled look as if she had forgotten he was there he set a trap she replied tightly he set a very clever trap he sent many of his servants to create diversionsemptying the vale of all but one of the adepts this was beginning to sound chillingly familiarbut she was continuing when that one was alonehe knew that there was but one adept still present by the level of power within the valehe created a disturbance that required an adept she licked her lips nervously and gave him a pleading glance i truly do not know what that was she said i was not in favor he did not grant me information i understand that he said quickly go on when the adept came to deal with the disturbance mornelithe sprung the trap and closed him off from the vale he was hurtand that was when mornelithe cast illusions to make him appear to be of the birdkin so that the adept would accept him as rescuer the bird father slew it was not deceived and attacked him but by then the adepts hurts were such that he was unconscious and did not know father took him to the stronghold and imprisoned him to break him to fathers will and you know who this adept is darkwind felt himself trembling on the brink of a chasm if it was his fatherit would explain so much and yet he dreaded the truthshe looked directly up at darkwind and said clearly and forcefully i did not know until father called me on the night of moondark who that man was it was your father darkwind it was he that is called starblade she licked her lips and raised one hand in a pleading gesture he wanted you as well the son as well as the fatherhe wanted me toentice you i told him yes but i told myself no and i kept myself from working his will as he worked it upon your father there it was the blow had fallen he surprised himself with his steady cold calm so falconsbane succeeded she nodded dropping her eyes her voice full of quiet misery when he sets out to break one to his will he does not fail i waspresentfor much of it it was part of my tttraining that this could be happening to me both the pleasuring and the punishment i can tell you some of what he did what he ordered starblade to do when he returned to the vale you do not want to know what was done to control him darkwind tried to speak and could not treyvan spoke for him in a booming angry rumble continue all that you know he was firstly to forget what had happened to him mornelithe gave him false memories to replace what had truly occurreduntil mornelithe chose otherwise then he was to creep in secret to the heart of the vale she gave darkwind a look of entreaty i have not the words the heartstone darkwind supplied at her prompting feeling sick the heartstone she said yes he was to go to it in secret and change ithe was one who created it so he would know best its secrets father did not know that his trap would ensnare someone of that quality but he was so pleased that he had he forgot often to mete out punishment to me return to the subject changechild treyvan growled she wilted losing some of the confidence she had regained what was it starblade was supposed to do to the heartstone darkwind prompted her with a bit more gentleness she turned gratefully to him he was to make a flaw in it a weakness one that would not appear until the birdkin prepared to move then he called back all his creatures to make it appear that all was made safe here he even sent his creatures to guard beyond your borders so that you would be prepared to shift your power elsewhere darkwind held up his hand how much does he knowhow can he continue to control starblade and does he know our strength she shrugged i do not know what he knows but he has long patience and is willing to move slowly so that each move he makes is sure but as to how he controls starblade it is with a crow his bondbird somehow that was simply the crowning obscenity to take the closest tie possible to a tayledras other than a lifebond and pervert it into an instrument of manipulation he cannot speak move or let his thoughts be known all that is under fathers control from compulsions planted when he was broken and held in place by the crow she hesitated a moment there is little i think that he can learn unless starblade goes to him and that he has not done the barriers still in place about the vale prevent that but there is much that he can do with the compulsions already in place not for long darkwind said with grim certainty heading for the door of the lair hydona forgive mei cant do anything about the younglings yet but i can do something about this go she replied frrree thisss placsse of the viperrr then perrrhapsss we can frrree the little onesss asss well i will guard the changechild treyvan said before darkwind eve thought of it and before darkwind could think to ask how the gryphon turned to face nyara his eyes flashing she looked surprisedand then she slumped over unconscious darkwind returned to nyaras side she was asleep deeply asleep but otherwise unharmed treyvan sighed i have not hurrrt herrr darrrkwind but it isss better to have the enemy underrr yourrr eye she isnt exactly the enemy darkwind said uncertainly she isss not exactly a frrriend treyvan replied ssshe isss at bessst a weaknesss i will watch herrr for my magic isss ssstronger than hersss go darkwind did not have to be told twice he was out the door of the lair and running for the vale before the last sibilant s had left treyvans beak dawns first light flushed the eastern horizon and vree shot into the sky from his perch on a stone beside the lair crying greeting to his bondmate projecting an inquiry while running darkwind tried as best he could to give vree an idea of what he had learned in simple terms the bird could understand he conveyed enough of it that vree screamed defiance as he swooped among the forest branches preceding darkwind and making sure the way ahead was clear of hazard the bird was angered but he had not lost his head or his sense of responsibility where vree demanded his thoughts hot with rage the vale darkwind replied as he leapt a bush and took to the game trail that led most directly to the ksheyna stronghold i go the bird said i go in with you once again darkwind was surprised but this time pleasantly i go vree repeated firmly that took one worry off his mind it would be a great deal easier to handle that thricedamned crow with vree around now he concentrated on running as hard and as fast as he could keeping his attention fixed on the ground ahead and leaving his safety in vrees capable talons where would starblade be at this moment he was an early riser as a rule by the time the sun was but a sliver above the horizon he was generally in conference with one or more of the adepts there was a kind of informal ceremony there as the memorial fire at the foot of the heartstone was fed with fragrant hardwoods and resinous cedar those adepts remainingeven the most reclusivegenerally attended at least one of of these meetings they remembered those who had been lost and monitored the heartstone very carefully looking for changes in it morning and night with father carefully making sure they accomplish nothing he thought with nausea now i know why he never misses a meeting now he was on safer ground he passed his own ekele and that of his brother passed nightscouts coming in and dayscouts going out both of whom stared at him in equal surprise he ignored the ache of his lungs and his legs dredged up extra reserves of energy and ran on long hair streaming out behind him he caught sight of other bondbirds flying beside him peering down at him curiously and guessed that their bondmates were somewhere behind he ignored them he would take no chances that a carelessly shielded thought would warn starbladeor more importantly the thing that controlled him in the guise of a blackbird up hills and down again he took the easiest way not the scouts wayusing game trails when he could find them finally he came out onto a real path one that led to the border with the dhorisha plains and had in better days been used by visitors from both peoples it terminated at the entrance to the vale and darkwind took deeper breaths forcing air into his sobbing lungs it would not be long now the shimmer marking the shields that guarded the entrance flickered between the hills this was where vree usually left him a cry from above alerted him and vree swept in from behind in a stoop that ended with the forestgyre hitting him hard enough to stagger him and sinking his talons into the padded shoulder of darkwinds jerkin a fraction of a heartbeat later he was through the shields a tingle of pure power passing through him as the shields recognized him and let him by he was inside the vale but this was no time to slow down he flung himself down a side path bursting through the overgrown vegetation and leaving broken branches and a flurry of torn leaves in his wake he was nearing the heartstone he heard voices ahead and he felt its broken rhythms and discordant song shrilling nauseatingly along his nerves vree tightened his talons in protest but voiced no other complaint he staggered winded into the clearing holding the heartstone taking the occupants by complete surprise vree did not wait for orders he had an agenda of his own before darkwind could say a word the forestgyre launched himself from darkwinds shoulder straight at the crow that sat like an evil black shadow on his fathers shoulder as if it was whispering into starblades ear the crow squawked in panic and surprise and leapt into the airheading for the shelter of the undergrowth no doubt counting on the fact that falcons never followed their prey into cover but the evil creature did not know vree his speed or his spirit the gyre hit the crow just as he penetrated the cover of the lower branches hit him with an impact audible all over the clearing rather than taking a chance that his stunned victim might escape instead of letting it fall vree bound on with both sets of talons and screamed his victory as he brought his prey to the ground and starblade collapsed the action of darkwinds bird stunned the adepts all but stormcloud who shouted something unintelligible and flung out his hand in darkwinds direction the scout found himself unable to move or speak and fell hard on his sidevree bent and bit through the thrashing crows spine ending its struggles darkwind fought against his invisible bonds as the outraged adepts converged on himbut as they started to move an entirely unexpected sound made them freeze where they stood free starblade moaned the relief so plain in his voice that it cut to the heart oh gods at last at last the adepts turned to stare at their leader and darkwind took the momentary distraction to snap his invisible bonds he stumbled to his fathers side and reached for his hands starblade took them his mouth trembled but he was unable to say anything it seemed as if he was struggling himself fighting against a horrible control that even now held him in thrall hes been under compulsion put a damn shield on him darkwind shouted throwing his own around his father and startling the others so much they followed suit and just in time darkwind felt a furious blow shuddering against his protections as the others added their strength to his another followedthen another a half dozen in all before the enemy outside gave up at least for the time being and now i know your name and face darkwind thought with grim satisfaction i know who you are now its just a matter of hunting you down starblade groaned still fighting the binding that kept him silent i know father darkwind said urgently as the other adepts gathered around them i know at least some of it thats why vree killed that damn crow well help you father i swear it well help you starblade nodded slightly and closed his eyes silent painful tears forming slowly at the corner of his eyes and trickling down his ghostpale cheeks as darkwind explained what he had learned from nyara as succinctly as possible the others wasted no time in argument starblades own reactions told the truth of darkwinds words let me tend to him iceshadow said when darkwind had finished the scout moved over enough for the older adept to take a place cradling starblades head in both his hands iceshadow stared intently into starblades eyes but spoke to the son not the father tell me in detail everything you know darkwind obeyed detailing nyaras explanations of how falconsbane had caught starblade and how he had broken the adept and set the compulsions iceshadow nodded through all of it i think i have enough he said then looked down into starblades eyes but first old friend i must bring down your shields he has trained you to respond only to pleasure or pain and since i do not have time for pleasureforgive me but it must be pain as starblade nodded understanding iceshadow caught darkwinds attention take his left hand the adept said spread it flat upon the ground as darkwind obeyed mystified starblade closed his eyes and visibly braced himself take your dagger and pierce his hand iceshadow ordered and when darkwind stared at him aghast the older tayledras frowned fiercely do it now young one he snarled that evil beast has tied his obedience to pain and i cannot break his shields to free his mind without driving him insane now do what i tell you if you wish to help him darkwind did not even allow himself to think he simply obeyed starblades scream of agony sent him lurching to his feet and away tears of his own burning his eyes and blurring his sight when he could see again he found vree standing an angry and silent guardian over his victim the crow that mornelithe falconsbane had used to control starblade and shatter the lives of everyone in ksheyna showing a sophistication that darkwind had not ex pected of him vree had neither eaten his victim nor abandoned it the first might have left him open to falconsbanes contaminationthe second might have given falconsbane a chance to recover his servant perhaps even to revive it almost anything was possible to an adept of falconsbanes power it only depended on whether or not he was willing to expend that power even if they buried the crow it was possible that falconsbane could work through it to a limited extent there was only one way to end such a linkage destroy it completely there was always a fire burning beside the heartstone that memorial flame to the lives of those who had died in its explosion darkwind picked up the bird carefully by one wing and took it to the stone basin containing the fire of cedar and other fragrant woods long considered sacred by both the shinain and the tayledras he raised his eyes to the shattered heartstone truly facing it for the first time since the disaster the surface of the great pillar of stone was cracked and crazed reflecting the damage beneath the invisible damage was much much worse and none of itnonewas his fault the personal burden he had carried for so long the ghost of guilt that had haunted his days was gone darkwind bent over the basins edge and closed his eyes in a prayer to the spirits of the woods and an apology to the spirits of the tayledras that had died when the heartstone sundered mornelithe falconsbane you have a great deal to answer for he drew back and hurled the body of the crow into the fire pitso hard that something shattered with a splintering crunch as it hitperhaps the birds bones perhaps the branches of the firethe adepts were so intent on starblade that they didnt even look up but a sudden heavy weight on his shoulder and the soft trill in his ear told him that vree approved the feathers caught fire quickly the rest took longer to burnbut the flames from the resinladen branches were hot and eventually the flesh crisped and blackened then burst into flame he watched until the last vestige of the bird was ash and glowing coals and only then turned back to the rest iceshadow still cradled starblades head in both his hands a pool of blood had seeped out around starblades hand with darkwinds knife laid to the side the expression on iceshadows face was just as intent but starblades expression had changed entirely darkwind wondered now how he could ever have mistaken the changes in his father for anything other than a terrible alteration in his personality here was the father he had loved as a childdespite the pain the grief and the suffering etched into his face starblade opened his eyes for a moment and saw him he smiled and tried to speak and couldnt once again he came up against a terrible compulsion his face twisted as he strove to shape words that would not come keep trying iceshadow urged in a low compelling voice keep trying im tracking it down iceshadow was seeking the root of the compulsion and reversing it since falconsbane had changed his fathers will rather than placing a simpler block it was not a matter of removing a wall instead starblades mind had to be altered set back to normal bit by bit as each compulsion was found and changed so he could regain the use of all of his mind the internal struggle mirrored in starblades face ceased as iceshadow found the series of problems and corrected them one by one darkwind dropped to his knees beside his father and took the poor wounded hand in his own blood leaked through an improvised bandage but starblade managed a faint ghost of a smile fleeting and full of pain i made you my enemy he whispered i made you hate me so that anything i told you to do you would do the opposite then when mm his face twisted with effort mornelithe darkwind supplied starblade sighed when he twisted my thoughts so that they were no longer my own i knew that he would want you to take up magic again if you did eventually he would find a way to take you too through me and blood of my blood you would have been vulnerable he almost had what he wanted darkwind replied grimly thinking of all nyara had told him starblade nodded the only way i could think of to protect you was to drive you away from me so that the more i tried beneath his compulsion to bring you back to magic the more you would fight it then when my mind was not my own you were safe he looked up tearfully entreatingly at his son can you ever forgive me darkwind blinked away tears of course i can forgive you he said quickly and took a deep breath to calm himself he looked up at iceshadow how clear is he he asked iceshadow shook his head ive only begun the adept replied exhaustion blurring his words a little its going to be a long process the bastard set the compulsions in a few days but theyve had all this time to work and develop well have to keep him under shield the whole time put him in the work area darkwind suggested it has strong shields and there arent any apprentices who need it right now those shields are the best we have which is why i was notpermittedto go there starblade whispered the bird would not let me then that is a good indicator that the shields will hold dont you think darkwind responded he started to let go of starblades hand but his father clutched it despite the pain that must have caused wait he coughed dawnfire darkwind froze iceshadow asked the question he could not manage to get out what about dawnfire the adept asked shes dead no starblade said urgently the bird was never found but mmhis sign was on her body i think he has hertrapped in her bird still alive but helpless aanother toy starblades face was twisted but this time with what he remembered it wouldplease himvery much chapter twenty one elspeth the sky burned blue but eight hooves pounded their own frantic thunder on the earth of the plains grass stems lashed their legs and the barrels of the companions as they fled elspeth risked a look back her hair whipping into her face and making her eyes water the pack of fluid brown shapes streaming through the grasses behind them seemed a little closer it was hard to tell for certain they were visible only as a flowing darkness in the grasses and the movement of the vegetation as they disturbed it then the lead beast leapt up showing its head and she was sure of it theyre gaining on us she shouted at skif he looked back then bent farther down over cymrys neck like a jockey she did the same trying to cut her wind resistance the companions were running as fast as they couldwhich was very fast indeed the ground flowed beneath their hooves at such a rate that after one look that made her dizzy she kept her eyes fixed ahead she could not imagine how any creature could be capable of keeping up with them it seemed impossible that they could be moving this fast what are these things she asked gwena who flattened her ears a little more and rolled her eyes back at her rider i dont know the companion replied bewildered ive never heard of anything like them sweat streamed down her outstretched neck and the ends of her mane lashed elspeths face and got into her mouth i have the sword cut in gruffly damn things are magical constructs beasts put together by an adept probably all theyre good for is running elspeth looked back again nervously the pack leader gave another of those jumps that took it briefly above the level of the grass stalks this time showing its head clearly its mouth was open its tongue out like a dogs all she really saw were the jaws a mouth full of thumblength fangs wellrunning and killing need amended whatever theyre not of a type ive seen before that makes them twice as dangerous i cant tell you what theyre capable of thanks elspeth muttered under her breath she peered ahead wishing there was any way she could use her distanceviewer somewhere on the cliff ahead of themhopefully somewhere nearwas a path like the one they had descended this trail was next to a waterfall and she strained her eyes for a glimpse of water streaming down the side of the cliff into the plains if they could reach that path they could probably hold the things off they might be able to climb it faster than the beasts could certainly they would be able to hold the narrow trail against their pursuers if they turned to stand at bay at the top of that path lay the place circled on the map whether or not there was any help for them therethe companions were getting tired how long could they keep this pace up her nose caught the scent of water as they topped a rise just as she saw the line of green a line of verdant trees and bushes at the edge of a long slope down below them there was a glint of reflected light from the cliff she assumed that was the promised waterfall she closed her eyes for a moment and set loose her farsight looking for a place to make a stand there wasnt much else she could do at the moment other than make certain she was in no danger of being tossed off if gwena had to make a sudden move nothing at the bottom of the cliff no that was definitely no place to make a stand the waterfall splashed down onto rocks right beside the beginning of the trail the rocks were wet and slippery marginal for booted feet treacherous for hooves in fact the entire path was like that winding beneath the waterfall at times skirting the edge of it at others this was not a straight fall the water dropped through a series of basins and down many tumbles of rocks keeping spray to a minimum it might almost have been sculpted that way and the path appeared to be an afterthought cut into the stone around the fall as best as could be the path was narrow too narrow to allow more than one rider at a time she scanned the entire length of it and found no place wide enough for the four of them to hold off their followers if they made a stand it would have to be at the top so she turned her farsight to the topand there at last was the shelter she had been searching for there were ruins up there tumbles of massive rocks identifiable only as ruins because of the regular size and shape of the stones and the general shapes of what might once have been walls right where the path reached the top there was a good place to hole up theres magic there need said suddenly looking through elspeths eyes do you see that kind of shimmer thats magic energy with luck i can use it to help with defense i dont intend to get close enough to those things to have to use a blade elspeth retorted dunce i didnt mean for you to fight i mean to channel my magic through you i was a fairly good mage you may even learn something elspeth felt stunned i thought you only protected that was when i was asleep the sword said shortly why dont you see what you can do about picking off some of those beasts maybe if you kill one the others will stop to eat it well it was worth trying the long slope gave the companions some relief though tiring they were running with a bit less strain gwenas coat was still sweatfoamed but her breathing beneath elspeths legs was easier elspeth pulled her bow from the saddle sheath freed an arrow from the quiver at her knee she clamped her legs tight around gwenas barrel and turned sitting up a little higher in her saddle as she did so the leader of the pack had a peculiar bounding rhythm to his chase it was she discovered rather like sighting on a leaping hare and she had done that so many times she had lost count hunting had been one of the few ways she could escape the palace and her rank and position although i wish i had a hawk right now to set on them a big hawk with long long talons the leaders bound carried him below the grass she nocked and loosedand he leapt right into the arrows path soundless they were on the chase soundlessly he fell and he fell right under the feet of his pack whether or not they wouldas need had so gruesomely suggestedstop to eat him it didnt matter at least not at the moment not while at least half the pack tumbled over the body of the leader and the rest stopped their headlong chase to mill aimlessly around the dead and the fallen she nocked and loosed another arrow and a third both finding targets before gwena carried her out of range never once did any of those she hit utter a single sound good work the companion said without slowing that should buy us some time assuming something else doesnt take their place or join them the sword pointed out grimly i hate to say this but i do sense things stirring energies being disturbed and some kind of communication going on that i cant read im afraid were going to have something else on our trail before long she didnt say what she was thinking it wasnt as if need had willfully called these things up will we have a chance to get up on that path first i think well make it up to the top but theres more trouble up there its at the border of a bad area and it has its own energies that are reacting to the changes elsewhere i think you should know that disturbance brings predators and scavengers alike well that was no more than the law of nature she sheathed the bow again and looked back down their trail there was nothing immediately in sight but there was a dark golden clot of something on the horizon something tall enough to be visible above the grass and it was coming closer she rather doubted it was a herd of shinain goats the scent of water was stronger she turned to face forward the belt of greenery was near enough now to make out individual trees and bushes and the waterfall dashed down the side of the cliff with a careless gaiety she wished she shared she knew what awaited them and held gwena back a little to let skif shoot ahead of her cymrys headlong pace slowed as she met the slippery rocks of the trail gwenas shoulders bunched beneath elspeths knees as she prepared to make the climb the scramble up the trail was purest nightmare if it had not been that the companions were far more surefooted than the heralds were and far far faster even on footing this treacherous she would have stopped to dismount as it was she clung to the saddle with legs and both hands drenched with water spray and her own sweat of fear if she dared she would have closed her eyes gwena skidded and slipped on the sprayslick rocks she went to her knees at least once for every switchback and there seemed to be hundreds of those every time gwena lurched sideways elspeth lurched with herfurther unbalancing the companion and hindering her recovery the only good thing was that the slower pace enabled gwena to catch her breath again ahead cymry and skif were in no better shape that presented a second danger that they might lose their balance and careen into gwena and elspeth sending all four of them to their deaths gwena might have read her mind the companion stopped for a moment sides heaving to let cymry put a little more distance between them she stood with her head hanging breathing deeply extracting everything she could from the brief rest elspeth used the respite to peer through the spray down to the foot of the trail the entire trail was visible from this vantage point and there was nothing on it except them yet but peering up at herat least she presumed they were peering up at herwere several creatures of a darkgold color that would have blended imperceptibly into the grasslands they stood out now only because of the brilliant green of the vegetation below the waterfall moving around them were some darkbrown slender beasts whose fluid movements told her that the pack that had pursued them had recovered from the loss of its leader in fact there seemed to be more of them i think i know what that blot on the horizon was now i wonder where the otherimnds came from thoughand mingling with those creatures was something else black small animals that hopped rather than walked she guessed from their behavior that there was some kind of consultation going on the black creatures seemed to be the ones in charge or conveying some kind of orders as she watched the thin creatures arrayed themselves below the cliff providing a kind of rear guard the goldenbrown forms lined up in an orderly fashion and started up the path with a sinister purposefulness and the black dots sprouted wings and rose into the air crows she realized then as they drew nearerdearest godstheyre so big they were heading straight for the heralds and they could do a great deal of damage with those long sharp bills those fierce claws without being prompted by the sword she pulled her bow again hoping that dampness hadnt gotten to the string she nocked and sighted and released and repeated the action filling the air below her with half a dozen arrows only three reached their mark and one of those was by accident as a crow flew into the path of one of the arrows while trying to avoid another of those three one was only a wound it passed through the nearest crows wing and the bird spiraled down to the earth cawing its pain and keeping itself aloft with frantic flaps of its good wing poor as the marksmanship had been it was enough to deter the rest of the birds they kited off sideways out of her arrow range caught a thermal and rowed through the air as fast as their wings could flap to vanish over the top of the cliff gwena lurched back into motion and elspeth was forced to put her bow away and resume her twohanded clutch on the saddle pommel they were barely a third of the way to the top of the cliff and the shelter of the ruins she hoped they would see that shelterand that what awaited them at the top was not a further nest of foes wherever the crows had gone they had not managed to herd another clutch of magicallyconstructed creatures to the ruins to meet them and they didnt return to harass the heralds themselves elspeth heaved a sigh of relief that was echoed by gwena as they approached the edge of the cliff without seeing any further opposition to their progress they reached the end of the path without meeting any other dangers than the treacherous path itselfthough the last third so high above the floor of the plains had put elspeths heart in her throat for the entire journey she tried to use her farsight to spy out the land ahead but either her fear or somethi ng u tap f herself interfered her ability to see she thought the way was clear but she drew her bow againjust in case it wasnt they scrambled up the final switchback with elspeth praying that there wasnt anything lying in ambush and found themselves on a smooth apron of masonry uneven and weathered with weeds growing through the cracks but there was no time to marvel a new threat climbed the trail behind thema threat that was surefooted enough to have closed the gap between them elspeth had not had any chance to shoot at these new followers but they were much bigger than the first creatures that had pursued them across the plain as well as being armored with horny plates and she was not terribly confident that their arrows would make much of an impression on these beasts and they were barely two switchbacks behind the heralds she and gwena pushed past skif and scrambled for the shelter of that ruined towerlike edifice she had seen he followed right on gwenas crupper the companions hooves rang on the stone in perfect rhythm sounding like one single horse they reached the shelter of the stones just barely ahead of their pursuers the first of the creatures came over the edge of the cliff as they whisked into a narrow cleft between two standing walls a cleft just wide enough for the two of them or one of them and a companion but deep enough for several to work unhindered behind whoever held the front skif and cymry reached the cleft last which put them in the position of initial defenders as elspeth threw herself from the saddle she reached for bowcase and quiver as she fumbled with the straps that held both in place on the saddleskirt the sword at her side uncoiled its power and struck at her her hand closed on the hilt of the blade before she was quite aware of what was happening but as need moved to take over the rest of her body she fought back it was a brief sharp struggle it ended in the blades surprised capitulation what in hell is wrong with you girl need shrilled in her mental ear i thought you were going to let me work magic against those things through me not using me she snarled back thats my body youre trying to take over you didnt ask you just tried to take need seemed very much taken aback while the blade pondered elspeth retrieved her bow and quiver and counted out her shots there were depressingly few arrows left what she had she would have to use carefully youve got a motheringstrong magegift the blade said as elspeth positioned herself behind skif with one arrow nocked to her bowstring i think if i guide you through it we ought to be able to fend these things off long enough to give us a breathing space relax a little will you elspeth let down her guard reluctantly thats all i need need said this will be like learning how to shoot my hands on yours guiding thats all now look with your farsight below us elspeth obeyed wondering if this was a waste of time but to her amazement there was something down there a kind of web of light with a bright glow where the lines all met those are leylines the thing in the middle is a node reach out and touch it ill help you there was an odd sensation that was similar to that of having hands on hers she followed the guidance of those invisible hands reaching out to touchjust barely touchthat bright glow although her physical hands merely pointed off into the heart of the ruins those other hands penetrated deeply beneath the grounddeeper she sensed than the plains below them it was not effortless she was sweating and trembling by the time she made contact weakkneed with the effort as if she had run up a second cliff trail as long as the one they had just traversed then she touched this nodeand was hit with a blast of power as if she stood in the path of an onrushing torrent if she could have cried out she would have she had never felt so entirely helpless in her life dammit those invisible hands caught her steadied her she saw how they were holding her against the power and altered her stance opening to it instead of resisting it opening what she didnt know in point of fact it felt like opening a door that she hadnt been aware existed now instead of being swept away by the flood of power she had become a conduit for it it filled her rather than overwhelming her good the sword said with grudging admiration i wasnt that quick it teetered on its hind legs it bellowed again then collapsed and did not move while its fellows began to look about confusedly skif darted out of cover before elspeth could stop him as a third arrow skimmed past him just beyond his shoulder and bounced offthe hide of the nearest beast distracting it he flung one of his throwing knives at the beasts eye it hit squarely the tiny knives were razorsharp and heavy for their tiny size the second beast threw up its head and collapsed like its brother skif darted back into cover before he had done more than reach the shelter of the cleft a huge shadow passed overhead they both looked up as a second shadow followed the first and a cry like that of an eagle but a hundred times louder rang out dear godselspeth gasped and for one moment she could not even think whatthe hellare those the sword asked elspeth shook with nerves and fear as the huge gryphons stooped on their pursuers she had known intellectually that gryphons existed heralds had seen them in the sky north of valdemar but no one she knew had ever seen one this close or at least if they had theyd not lived to report the fact for one panicked moment she thought they had come to join the other beasts against themand these creatures would not have the limitations of the hooved ones in prying the heralds out of their shelter but they attacked the strange creatures with talons and beaks knocking one of them entirely off the cliff and killing another before elspeth could react shrieking defiance as they shredded flesh and flew off again well whatever they are even if they arent on our side they arent on their side either the rest of the beasts turned to defend themselves forming a headsout circle and it was clear that there would be no more easy kills it was also clear that the gryphons were not going to give up nor from the carefully placed arrows was their stillunseen ally and damn if im going to let them do this alone maybe theyve heard the old saying about how the enemy of my enemy is my friend she ran out nocking another arrow to her bow before skif could grab her and haul her back to safety come on she shouted back at him allowing a hint of mockery to enter her voice what are you waiting for winter elspeth rested her back against a rock and slid down it skif slumped nearby with his head hanging his forearms propped on his bent knees and his hands dangling limply there was a long shallow gash in her leg that she didnt remember getting and another wound a bite on her arm that she only recalled vaguely it was a good thing she had more clothing with her all whites though the merc outfits were filthy shed taken both hits after shed run out of arrows and knives and the damned sword had insisted on getting in close to fight handtotooth horn whatever neither wound was bleeding and neither one hurti told you thats my doing that was need still unsheathed and in her hand it was covered in dark sticky blood and she had not yet regained the energy to clean it she had the feeling that the sword wouldnt carebut if she ever put any blade in its sheath without cleaning it she knew in her soul that kero and alberich would walk on air to beat her black and blue the smug satisfaction in the swords tone would have been annoying if she hadnt been so tired i let em bleed enough to clean em out then i took care of em well you were the one that was responsible for my getting hurt in the first place she retorted watching the gash and bitemarks heal before her eyes i should think youd take care of themthe sword muttered something about ingratitude elspeth ignored it the gryphonsand presumably the archerhad gone in pursuit of the enemy creatures once their combined attack had broken the beasts circle and forced them into flight neither the heralds nor their companions had been in any shape to join the chase gwena plodded over to elspeths side and nosed her armat least that piece of tin is useful as a healer the companion observed are we going to find somewhere safe to rest do you think someplace secure id really like to go sleep for a week or so unless those gryphons saved us just to eat us themselves i think we are elspeth responded unable to muster much concern over the prospect of becoming gryphonfodder she had just learned the truth of something quenten had warned her about it took energy to use energyand hers was spent and overspent right now she was just about ready to pass out safe or not but the sound of a falcons cry made her look up there was an enormous raptor skimming along barely clearing the tops of the stones winging his way out of the forest an omen that would be all they needed now something more to wonder about for a moment she thought it was her weary blurring eyes that made the vegetation behind him seem to move as if part of the forest had separated and was walking toward her but then the vegetation stepped a little farther out into the open and became a man her hiss of warning brought skifs head up and they both struggled to their feet to meet the stranger standing their companions moving a little into the shadows out of immediate sight as they rose she stood so that need was not so obviously still in her hand no point in looking belligerent he was a somberlooking young man tall taller than skif and slender and handsome strikingly handsome with a sculptured face and tough graceful body hed already slung his bow across his back a longbow much more finelycrafted than anything elspeth had ever seen in use before his green gray and brown clothing blended so well with the forest that he faded into the background every time he paused his long hair was an odd mottled brown that helped with the camouflageeffect considerably as he neared elspeth saw that he had the same piercing iceblue eyes and bone structure of the shinain she had seen though his complexion was a paler gold than theirs as the man drew nearer the falcon wheeled and returned without looking the stranger held out his gauntleted wrist and the falconmuc larger she realized than any bird she had ever seen other than say an eagledropped down gracefully to his fist and settled itself with a flip of its wings that was when she finally made the connection dear godshe must be one of the hawkbrothers she felt as if she really had stepped into the pages of a legend first she was visited by a shinain kalenedral then chased by monsters then rescued by gryphonsand now here was a hawkbrother a creature out of legends so remote that she had only found references to them in vanyels chronicles moondance and starwind vanyels friendsmages adepts in fact from the clan of ktreva the man paused at a polite distance from the heralds and frowned as if he wasnt certain how to address them or which of them to speak to first she wondered if she should solve his quandary but before she could speak he made up his mind who are you he demanded arrogantly in tradetongue what are you doing in tayledras lands why are you here and who are you to ask i didnt see any boundary markers she drew herself up answering his arrogance with pride of her own herald elspeth and herald skif out of valdemar and we were chased here by monsters as you likely noticed she replied stiffly in the same language we didnt exactly plan on it and we didnt stop to ask directions any more questions to her surprise he actually started to smile at least a little but that was when gwena poked her nose from behind her chosen and looked at him with a combination of inquiry and tentative approval his eyes widened and to elspeths amazement he paled she took an involuntary step backward and that brought need into view he glanced down took a second very surprised look and went a little whiter he mumbled something under his breath that sounded like shinain but was different enough that she couldnt make out what he was saying it seemed to have something to do with bodily functions well as long as hed seen the damned sword and hadnt interpreted it as hostility she might as well put it away properly she turned a little fished a cleaning rag out of gwenas saddlebag as he watched her warily and began wiping the blade clean it practically cleaned itself then again maybe that wasnt surprising all things considered the hawkbrother mumbled something again and she looked up as she sheathed her sword properly and wiped off her filthy hand what did you say she asked politely but with a touch of the same arrogance he had been showing them he shook his head but he did seem to be unbending just a little never mind he said it matters not it would seem that i am to add you to the colony of outlanders i am collecting and what if we dont want to go she retorted taken aback by his assumption that she would obey him without a second thought there are four of us and only one of you this is our land you trespass on there are four of us he corrected mildly as the gryphons swooped in from behind her to land at his side the wind created by their wings as they landed making a tiny tempest that blew dust into her face and made her squint and two of us are bigger than all of you she tightened her jaw refusing to be intimidated is that a threat she snapped i think we might surprise you if it is he sighed no it is not a threat if you wish to descend to the plains you are free to do so but i must tell you there are four of us that stand guard here i will not permit you to pass through tayledras lands and your escort still awaits you below the cliff our shinain brethren have not chosen to disperse them and we above do not trespass upon the plains without invitation oh she said deflated what do you know about these people she asked the sword not a damn thing need replied never heard of them and i dont recognize the language theyre either something i never ran into or they sprang up after my time the young man cleared his throat delicately recalling her attention i feel as if i must point out that you would not be safe from anything with that at your side he pointed to the sword with his chin she raised an eyebrow and looked back at skif he shrugged i dont think we have much choice he said quietly your friend speaks wisely the hawkbrother put in it may be your escort was attracted by you or by the weapon you carry it is magic and such things are drawn by magic i think that you would be safer in the company of two mages two mages boomed out a new voice elspeths heart leapt right out of her body and only gwenas shoulder behind her kept her on her feet as her knees dissolved from a combination of startlement and fear two mages repeated the smaller of the gryphons darrrkwind do my earrssss decssseive me it talks elspeth thought faintly the hawkbrotherdarkwind if the gryphon had called him by his correct nameshrugged again this is neither the time nor place to speak of my decisions he replied and turned to the heralds i phrased myself poorly i think that you have no real choice i think you must accept my hospitality for your own safety and the safekeeping of that which you carry though what the council will say of this he added looking at the gryphon who had spoken and shaking his head ruefully i do not care to contemplate the arrogance was back an imperious quality more suited to a prince of some exotic realm than thiswhatever he was she wanted to angrily deny the fact that they needed protection of any kind much less his but much as she hated to admit it she didnt want to have to face any more bizarre monsters not right away anyway i think wed better go along with him elspeth skif mindspoke tentatively as if he expected her to turn on him and lash him with her anger for such a suggestion i dont know about you but we cant face any more without some rest and i really would like to know a little more about whats going on around here before we go charging off on our own hes some kind of border guard she thought though not without some resentment it is his land i could do with a little less of an attitude thoughshe would have preferred to tell him exactly what he could do with his socalled protectionto tell him that she would be perfectly fineto inform him in no uncertain terms that whatever he thought she had been sent here to this very place by those shinain brethren of his and that she intended to wait here for them on the other hand she had no idea why the shinain had sent her here nor if they themselves intended to meet her maybe all they had meant was to put her in the hands of these hawkbrotherswhat do you think she asked gwena that he is right we have no choice came the companions prompt reply it is not necessarily a bad thing you were in search of mages he is a mage so is the gryphon and according to the chronicles many of the hawkbrothers are mages they taught vanyel did they not when the heraldmages could not lets see if someones willing to come with us or teach me first she replied sourly so it was fairly well unanimous hes right she told skif shortly in their tongue much to the older heralds relief and so are you were all tired and as long as this isnt an imprisonment i dont think it is skif replied i think hed let us go if we really wanted to ive got the feeling that were kind of an annoyance to him not something hed keep around if he had the choice that didnt make her feel any better all right she told the hawkbrother trying to conceal her annoyance where is it you want us to go instead of replying he gestured curtly for them to follow she seethed a little at the implied discourtesy as the gryphons lofted themselves into the air she stood aside for skif and cymry to get by her she did not want to follow him too closely just now she was afraid she would lose what was left of her temper she had gotten used to being the one making the decisions now she was again following someone elses orders that galled her as much as this darkwind fellows arrogance in fact she decided somewhat guiltily as she led gwena in cymrys wake it probably galled her more chapter twenty two darkwind led the way for this strange parade of outlanders winding through the piles of stone on the weedgrown path that led from this end of the ruins to the gryphons lair it was a good thing that they had enlarged it between two outlanders their spirithorses and nyara it would have been crowded otherwise he wished strongly for something to ease his aching head or to make him able to forget everything that had happened for the past several days or both well perhaps not everything i have my father back again that was no small gain even when weighed against all the grief and pain he concentrated on staying on his feet glad beyond telling that this incursion would likely mean there would be nothing more today if only he were in his ekelehe had begun this day wearied and emptied of all strength or so he thought he had not found anyone able to take his patrol for him so he had taken to the border resigned to another stretch without rest it had been two days without sleep now but it had been quiet amazingly sountil when of course he was at the very opposite end of his patrol he sensed magic powerful magic being used somewhere near the gryphons lair hed thought it might have been treyvan doing something to free the gryphlets from falconsbanes control but any hope hed had of that had been shattered by treyvans mindcall there was a massing of misborn beasts falconsbanes creatures in pursuit of two humansand one of those humans was using magic to try and drive them off without success as it happened the gryphons were going to their aid it was his territory so must he he and they had arrived on the spot simultaneously to play rescuer to outlanders that had irritated him beyond reason he was tired and he saw no reason to save ignorant fools from the consequences of their own folly he had intended to send them back where they came from whether they were still in danger or notuntil he actually saw who or rather what he had rescued he glanced back over his shoulder at them trying not to look as if he was doing so unsettled was the mildest term for the way he felt right now shaken probably came closer profoundly shaken well it is not every day that a pair of guardian spirits and a premagewar artifact fold wings on your doorstepand when one added the fact that the person bearing the artifactand in the charge of the more potent of the guardian spiritswas a completely untutored mage of adept potentialif this is a trial of my abilitiesthe gods have no sense of proportion he was exhausted bewildered and one step short of collapsing all he could think of was to take these outlanders to the gryphons lair where they had left nyara treyvan agreed and concurred with his judgment that they did not dare let these twofourfivewander about with things as unsettled as they were if falconsbane got his hands on them as he was so obviously trying to do darkwind was not willing to think about what uses he might make of them with any luck the elders were so concerned with starblade that they would not find out about these visitors until they were long gone and meanwhile perhaps he could find somewhere safe to send them to the shinain no they had forsworn magic could these two have stolen that sword from the soil of the plains that horrifying thought nearly stopped him in his tracks until he remembered that the blade did not have the air of disuse about it that something of that nature wouldand that it did have the air of something that was alien to the kind of magics that lay buried in the plains womans magic that was it no this was nothing that had been created by the thoroughly masculine mage of silenceand it did not have the look or feel of anything forged by the shinain weapons made for the servants of the stareyed were as sexless as the kalenedral this artifact was as female in its way asas nyara he staggered a little as he neared the i recovered himself before the outlanders noticed above all he had to present a strong front to them there was no telling what kind of unwitting havoc they could cause if they thought he was less than vigilant ineffectualhe was certain now that they meant no harm not with guardian spirits hanging about them but they could cause a great deal of trouble if they chose to meddle without knowing what they were about i could wish they were shinain then we would have two more useful allies at this momenthydona was already in the lair when they reached it treyvan waited outside in there he said shortly wishing he dared shake his head to clear his eyes if you have gear hydona will tell you the chamber you may use when the young man looked from him to the spirithorse doubtfully he added the white ones too we will find them food if you do not have it he bowed a little to the mare zhaihellva lady you honor ksheyna with your presence the spiritmare looked flattered and surprisedso did the young man you do not look well treyvan noted i do not feel well but i shall survive he replied he gave vree a toss to send him to a perch above the lair doorway and stood leaning he hoped casually against the doorpost the young man entered with his spirithorse the young womans spirithorse started to follow and he averted his eyes with discomfortthen he found himself sliding dizzily toward the ground clinging notsocasually to the rock as his knees buckled quickly the young woman knelt beside him and unsheathed her sword peace brother she means no harm treyvan said calmly darkwind wasnt so sure he tried to get up a hand to fend her offbut instead she put the hilt of the thing in his hand and he heard a strange gravelly voice in his mind she says if i dont heal you shes going to drop me down the nearest well the sword told him annoyance warring with amusement in the overtones of itshermindvoice i think she must have been taking lessons in rudeness from her predecessor and knowing her highness she probably would he nearly dropped the thing in shock and only long trainingnever never never drop a bladekept his numb fingers clutched to the hilt huh nothing too badoverwork underrest and he felt the thing probing him and his memory then suddenly pulling back oh youngling the sword said dropping all cynicism youve had more heartbreak than anyone should ever face in a lifetime and that much i cant heal but ill do my best for you open your shields to me she sounded so much like one of his teachers an old old adept who had ordered him about as if she had been his mother that he obeyed without thinking twice she took instant action in the next moment a gentle warmth stole over him making him relax still further he closed his eyes gratefully and let it in healers had worked on him before but that had been for a major injury not for general exhaustion first came the warmth and relaxation then came new energy new strength it rose in him like a tide rather than a flood a rising tide of warmth and goldengreen light that touched him within and without folding him in great wings of brilliance sheltering him as he had not been protected since he was a child but the blade not only filled him with renewed physical energy she also reopened his longunused magechannels replenishing him with magical power as well he was vaguely offended at first but then practicality took hold he had said he was a mage any reasons for renouncing powers were gone there was in fact every reason why he should take up magecraft again thank you he told the blade thank the girl need responded oh i was an adept but never with the ability she has she and her teacher were the first in i dont know how long that fought me and won and all this powerits coming through her so save your thanks for her ill be done soon the blade was as good as its word the dizziness and weakness were gone and shortly after that he felt as refreshed as if he had never endured the stresses of the past five days he stood up and gingerly passed the sword back to its bearer that was kindly done he said with all the courtesy he could muster embarrassed by the awareness that his dealings with her had been woefully short of courtesy up until this moment thanks is not adequate but it is all i can offer she seemed first surprised then pleased then blushed averting her eyes thats all right she said i mean you looked like you needed help she doesnt like men much but i figured i could convince her to do something for you he looked to the young lady and spiritmare nodding gravely there have been troubles here he told her there still are troublesevil onesand you have tumbled unwitting into the midst of them my time is short my powers are strained and my patience alas never was particularly good please even if i offend you never hesitate to follow my orders or treyvans it may well mean not only your life but ours she looked back up at him resentment warring with respect in her eyes respect won i will she said a little grudgingly and he sensed that she was not often minded to follow anyones orders much less a strangers youre right i suppose were not from around here we cant possibly know whats going on imperious he noted thoughtfully used to giving the orders not taking them the sword called her highness that may well be truth rather than sarcasm i am darkwind ksheyna he told her this ruin is nominally part of ksheyna territory treyvan and hydona are the actual guardians here there are few who would care to dispute boundaries with them he meant that as a subtle warning but she cocked her head to one side looked from him to treyvan and back again and said accusingly there is something very wrong here you said weve walked into a situation we dont understandbut everything absolutely everything ive seen tells me that its worse than that you people are in trouble he narrowed his eyes speculatively why do you say this he asked before he thought well im thinking of you for one thing she said need says you were exhausted that youd gone days without rest you dont do that unless youre in some kind of trouble everything around here seemswell it feels like being on the edge of a battlefield on the eve of a war and if thats what weve walked into id like to know she gulped i think on the whole id just as soon take my chances with those things you chased off id rather not get caught in another allout war especially not a war involving magic again he spoke before he thought with a little more scorn than he had intended to show and what do you know of warfare she scowled ive fought in a few battles she snapped have you and you still havent answered my question why should i he retorted he raised his head proudly planting his fists on his hips i know nothing of you other than that you came across the plainsand that you likely did without the knowledge of the shinain what you want my credentials she scoffed now obviously very angry but keeping a firm grip on herself she turned quickly to her saddlebag and turned round again with a roll of vellum and something else all right ill give you what youll recognize my teachers teacher was tarma shena talesedrin my teacher is captain kerowyn of the skybolts cousin to most of the talesedrin she no longer rides a warsteed but when she did it was always called hellsbane i came to katashinain looking for talesedrin one found me a kalenedral he she or it gave me these she thrust the roll and an enameled copper disk at him the latter he recognized it was one of the clan tokens customarily used to identify clansfolk passing through tayledras lands and it was indeed a genuine talesedrin token he even recognized the makers glyph on the back that they had given this outlander one meant that they expected her to be passing through both the plains and tayledras territory and had granted her as much safe passage as they could but the other thing the roll of vellum proved to be as great a shock as the spirithorse it was a map of the plains darkwind had heard of such things but the normally secretive shinain had never before let one out of their hands to his knowledge not even to their cousin captain kerowyn and it was a genuine map not a fake it showed every well and spring in the plains used the correct reckonings and showed the correct landmarksat least as far as he could verify for that much it was priceless it showed more than that it showed if you knew what to look for the locations of common campsites of the four seedclans and the offshoot clans anyone who had that information would know who held which territories and where to find themand it also showed the ruins here on the rim circled in red ink fresher than anything else on the map that was where i was supposed to go at least thats what i guessed she said assertively stabbing her finger at the red mark i dont know what it was i was intended to find but it certainly looks to me as if i was to come here if you know better id be pleased to hear where im supposed to be no he replied vaguely still staring at the solid evidence of shinain cooperation in his hands no i would say that you are correct this incident was rapidly turning into something he was not ready to deal with it had looked like a simple case of outlanders wandering where they didnt belong then it became a case of keeping these people out of falconsbanes hands but now it looked as if the shinain had sent these outlanders here and what that could mean he did not know please he said rolling up the map and handing it back to her please if you would only rejoin your friend the young man i need to speak with treyvan she set her chin stubbornly but he could be just as stubborn he crossed his arms over his chest and stood between her and the pathway out silent and unmoving except for his hair blowing in the breeze finally she stuffed the map back in her belt with an audible sniff and turned to enter the lair she went insidebut the white spirithorse did not the mare stared at darkwind for so long he began to feel very uncomfortable it was very much as if she was measuring him against some arcane standard only she knew in fact she probably was given the little he knew about manifesting spirits starblade had once seen a leshyae kalenedral but he never had and he had been perfectly content to have it remain that way evidently the gods had other ideas a word with you the spiritmare said then she looked up at treyvan and included him in the conversation both of you she amended treyvan looked down at the little mare from his resting place atop the lair and rumbled deep in his throat we have many problems and little leisure my lady he replied in mindspeech i do not mean to belittle your troubles but we have no time for yours she tossed her head and stamped one hoof with an imperiousness that matched her riders that is exactly what i wish to speak with you about your troubles you are being very foolish to dismiss us so lightly i tell you you need us and i swear to you that you may trust us with every word she glowed a little brighter to his magesight until he finally had to shield against her lady i know you think i can trust you he replied stubbornly but you and she are not of my people your ways are not ours and what you think important may mean nothing to us and please to dim yourself treyvan added you do not need to set the forest afire to prove what you are her glow faded and she pondered for a moment it is true that we are not of the same peoples but i will tell you what brings us here the child needs tutoring in magecraft that is the most important of our tasks other than that we have no agenda to pursue and we are four more to stand at your side in your troubles she snorted delicately we have departed from the road that had been planned for her at this point i do not see how further deviation from that plan can matter the road that had been planned for her interesting words and ones that explained a great deal about the girls temperament i doubt i would much care for being blown about by the winds of fate in facti just might become as belligerent as she has he began to feel a bit more in sympathy with the girl and quite a bit more inclined to trust her lady we may not agree on what is to be done here he warned this is tayledras land we follow the task given to us by our lady and nothing is permitted to interfere with that she shook her mane impatiently does it matter in whose name good is done evil done in the name of a power of good is still evil and good done in the name of a power of evil is still good it is the actions which matter not the name it is done for you stand against evil here we will help if you will have us and thenperhapsyou may help us well that seemed reasonable enough he raised an eyebrow at treyvan the gryphon adroit at reading human faces cocked his head to one side she seems sincere she issomething that cannot speak falsely and darkwind we and ksheyna are not strong enough that we can afford to neglect any form of aid especially if we are to free dawnfire and my children he nodded if thats the way you feel then i agree he turned to the mare lady we accept your offer with thanks the spirit nodded emphatically good shall we confer on what needs to be done things to be donethe rescue of dawnfire for one thing after starblades revelations he was certain that she was in falconsbanes hands he could not leave her therehe told himself it was for ksheynas sake that the clan could not afford another like starbladebut it was as much for his sake as the clans over and over the thought had plagued him intruding into everything that if he had only been more vigilant if he had only taken the time to explain why he had wanted her to stay clear of the gryphons that day none of this would have happened to her he knew now that he was not to blame for the shattering of the heartstonebut this he was guilty of he had allowed falconsbane to lure him into relaxing his guard and this was the result bring your people out he told the spiritas soon as they are ready to talk and i will see if i can explain this before night falls and explain he added grimly just what it is that we mean to do to his surprisealthough he should not have been surprisedthe outlanders had a very good grasp of the situation once he sketched it as the young man said its not much different from our position at home except that the scale is a lot smaller the girl sat with her chin resting on both her hands as she listened then offered a question why is it that this falconsbane hasnt made a frontal assault on ksheyna he has to know that youre in trouble and this would be the perfect time to take you this elspeth seemed much easier and more relaxed now that her blade was out of its sheath and away from her the spirit penned within the swordneed was its namehad stated that there was very little it could contribute it had never been a tactician or a leader and did not care to begin learning the craft now furthermore there was a great deal she could do to shield the gryphlets from further tampering so that was what she had been left to do elspeth had been a leader and a tacticianat least in small skirmishesand she had studied her craft under one of the legendary mercenary captains of the modern times word of the shinain cousin had penetrated even into tayledras lands via the few bards that had congress with tayledras and shinain and her pupils question had merit i do not know he replied frankly i am fairly certain that he has the power to pursue a frontal assault it may be that he has not simply because he does not think in those terms because he prefers to weaken from within and gnaw away from without until little by little he has wrought such damage that he can overcome his target with little effort or losses that only works if you dont know what hes doing she pointed out once his victim knows it may be too late treyvan rumbled i sssussspect hisss tacticsss have done verrry well in the passst he probably enjoys working that way the young manskif a very odd sort of name to darkwinds mindput in i mean its obvious from what the catlady said that he positively revels in making people suffer seems to me he wouldnt get half the pleasure out of being straightforward elspeth bit off an exclamation thats it she exulted thats his weakness thats what makes him vulnerable hes so busy with his convoluted plans that if he sees us trying one thing he might not expect a second attack that was perfectly straightforward look darkwind if i were you thats what id do id pretend to try to negotiate with him and while he thought he was tying me in knots id make a straight assault to get dawnfire free id also try and do as much damage as i could on the way out she added thoughtfully but then im well known to be a vindictive bitch she glanced sideways at skif as she said that and the young man looked sour evidently she was using words he had thrown at her at some point and he was not enjoying hearing them now tossed back in his face for his part darkwind was a little surprised by this interchange he had been under the impression that these two were lovers but evidently this was not so he tucked the information into the back of his mind for later use in dealing with them there were niceties needed with a pair of lovers that could be disposed of when working with a pair of friends or colleagues such as splitting them up for instance sending one on one mission and the second on another it is a good notion he told the girl except that we are not supposed to know that falconsbane even exists much less that he holds dawnfire damn she said with a frown id forgotten that well what about that daughter of his nyara can she be useful now that was a thought treyvan rose anticipating his next words i sssshall wake herrr the gryphon said folding his wings to fit more easily through the door of the lair we ssshall sssee if ssshe isss rrready to be morrre frrriend than enemy asss ssshe claimsss darkwind nodded grimly now was the time for nyara to show her true allegiances there was a great deal about her father and her fathers stronghold and abilities that she could tell them if she chose andjust perhapssome of his weaknesses and if she did not choose to help themwell she would see the vale after all as she had often wished from inside as he turned her over to the adepts to be judged he wondered what they would think of the creature that had eaten starblades bondbird before his eyes no matter how extenuating the circumstances he did not think they would be inclined to kindness dawnfire stood on her squeaking mouse killed it messily and leaned down to pick it up headfirst she started swallowing it whole trying her best not to think about what she was doing at least im not like a poor stupid eyas that doesnt know which end to start on she thought unhappily at least i know enough to kill the things before i try to eat them and i knew how to kill them in theory if not in practice in fact she had learned a lot more than she was displaying she blessed the many times shed spent in fullbond with kyrr and blessed kyrrs memory for the way the hawk had shared every experience with her no she was not a birdbut she had the memories of what it had been like to be a raptor and once she had overcome her initial despair those memories had helped her learn the ways of her new body they did not help her overcome her fear fear of falconsbane was only part of it there was another fear a constant fear that never left her waking or sleeping she knew what would happen as she remained in kyrrs bodythe longer she remained the more of herself she would lose until there was nothing left but the hawk the fact that she had adapted to the body so quickly was both bad as well as good the more comfortable she felt the easier it would be to lose herself she tried to hold onto herself with utter desperation she tried to remember everything about the scouts the vale darkwindand she panicked when she found herself in the midst of a memory and could not remember a face a name a setting was it just that these things had slipped her mindor was it that her mind was slipping there was no way to know and what had happened to her body back in the vale what if falconsbane had killed that along with kyrrs soul what would she do then the past two days had felt like two months time stretched out unbearablyand there was nothing to distract her from fear and brooding when those thoughts drove her into a state of frenzy there was only one way to break the cycle she plotted her escape she had been taken outside enough times on a creance to know all the places where escape might be possible if she could get awayno when she got away she would not think ifshe would head straight up as high as a redshouldered could go from there she would have an unparalleled view of the countryside her scouting experience would tell her where she was if she didnt recognize anything she would circle until she did see a landmark she knew and falconsbane shouldnt be able to touch her planning kept her sane planning and practice when falconsbane was not in the room she practiced as she had seen the fledglings practice flapping until she lifted herself just above the perch hopping down the length of her jesses and flying back to her perch when she had to kill her food she did so with a clumsiness that was feigned more and more often she took out her anger on the hapless mice ripping them with talons and beak after she had killed them though it was still all she could do to force herself to eat the mice afterward falconsbane was not paying a great deal of attention to her but she continued the charade lurching clumsily up to the perch and taking a long time to get settled she watched him carefully as she cleaned her talons and beak hed been very preoccupied today and he had evidently forgotten if he had ever known just how wide a field of vision a raptor had she could watch him easily without ever seeming to pay attention to him he had been staring at the scrying stone no longer relaxed and no longer so infernally pleased with himself she had finally decided that the scrying stone wouldnt work anywhere except this room certainly he never took it with him and there was nothing else here but her perch his couch the cabinets he kept his toys of pain and pleasure in and the stone for the past two days he had spent more and more time here watching the stone and getting very intent about something she overheard him muttering to himself evidently he had also forgotten how sharp a raptors hearing was there was something about heralds though what that would have to do with anything she had no notion there was more about valdemar and a queen hardorn and ancar he seemed very preoccupied with two quite different sets of people one set seemed to be traveling and they had something he wanted wanted that was like saying that she wanted her freedom he lusted over this object whatever it was with an intensity she had never seen him display before the other people were connected with this ancar who seemed to be the enemy of the first group of people from the pacing and muttering that went on after he had watched this person she gathered that he was toying with the notion of contracting with this ancar and proposing an alliance that was something new for him or so she gathered he wanted toand yet he did not want to chance losing the slightest bit of his own power then this afternoon something had changed the people he had been watching escaped what he had thought was a perfect trap and they had taken the thing that he wanted with them falconsbane flew into a rage and flung the stone against the opposite wall with such force that he splintered the rock of the wall and reduced the stone to fragments and she shrank back onto her perch doing her best not to attract him to her by moving or making a sound he paid no attention to her whatsoever he roared for one of his servants to come and clean up the mess and stood over the trembling boy looking murderously at him as the terrified child carefully gathered the sharp shards in his shaking bare hands dawnfire trembled herself expecting at any moment that he would take out his temper on the boy as he had on the stone there would be true murder thenwith a sick feeling she watched him reach down slowly clawed hands spread widebut before he touched the boy the door flew open and two men in some kind of ornate uniform flung themselves into the room to abase themselves at his feet babbling of failure and mercy falconsbane started then grabbed the child to cover his surprise he pulled the boy up to his feet by his hair and threw him bodily toward the door showering the shards around him this time the boy did not try to pick them up he simply made good the chance to flee the guards blanched and immediately went back to groveling with more heartfelt sincerity than before he listened to them a while then cut them short with a single gesture enough he growled the fingers of his right hand crooked into claws with the talons fully extended the two men fell absolutely silent you failed to capture the artifact he said his voice rumbling dangerously you failed to corner the quarry you failed to keep them from finding aid and you failed to acquire the artifact when you had the opportunity i should take your lives i shouldremake you the men whitened to the color of fresh snow there is nothing you can say that will redeem your complete stupidity falconsbane continued you will report to drakan for your punishment i have not the time to waste upon you the two men started to get up a single snarl from falconsbane sent them back to their faces i do have time to retrieve from your worthless bodies a modicum of the power you wasted in this effort he stretched out his right hand and spread it over the two prone men dawnfire was not certain what exactly he didbut she saw the result clearly the two men sat back on their heels suddenly jerked erect like a pair of puppets their white faces were frozen in masks of pain and their limbs trembled and jerked uncontrollably their mouths were open but they uttered not so much as a single sound what was truly horrible about the entire tableau was the expression on falconsbanes face he looked like a creature in the throes of sexual ecstasy he had tossed his long flowing hair back over his shoulders and he stared off into nothingness with his eyes halfclosed in pure pleasure his fingers flexed every time they did the two mens bodies jerked and their faces took on new lines of agony falconsbanes eyes closed completely and he lifted his face to the light in obscene bliss finally he knotted his hand into a fist the men shuddered then collapsed he opened his eyes slowly and gazed down on his victims with a slow sated smile you may go he purred now limbs stirred feebly heads raised and the two men began to move too weak to do anything else they crawled toward the door slowly and painfully and that wasnt even their punishment that was just falconsbanes way of reminding them that he was their master in all things the first man reached the door and crawled out all of dawnfires feathers slicked down flat to her body in fright she couldnt have moved now if she had wanted to greden falconsbane said as the second man started out the door the guard stopped frozen in a macabre way he looked funny like someone caught pretending to be a dog greden send daelon to me on your way out falconsbane turned ignoring the mans whispered acknowledgment and began pacing beside his couch in a few moments another man entered an older man lean and fit with elaborate flowing garments and dark gray hair and beard my lord he said waiting prudently out of reach falconsbane ignored him for a moment his face creased with a frown of concentration the man waited patiently patience was a necessity with mornelithe falconsbane it seemed patience and extreme care finally falconsbane stopped pacing and flung himself down on the couch daelon i am going to propose an alliance to king ancar of hardorn very good my lord daelon responded bowing deeply alliances are always preferable to conflict falconsbane smiled as if he found the mans opinions amusingive been in contact with him for some time as you know with him and some other rulers of the east he agreed to meet with me in person but he would not set a time falconsbanes smile faded when he would not specify a date i insisted that he must come here and that it was to be within three months of the initial agreement i assume that he has set a date my lord daelon asked smoothly finally falconsbane scowled he told me just before that disaster greden was in charge of that he will be arriving in three days time very good my lord by gate my lord daelon asked with one eyebrow raised falconsbane snorted with contempt no the fool calls himself a mage yet he cannot even master a gate that it seems was the reason he would not set a date he had to travel overland if you will and he did not wish anyone to know that he was en route daelon produced a superior smug smile then you wish me to ready the guest quarters my lord exactly falconsbane nodded i expect i will be able to persuade him to accept my hospitality after several weeks of primitive inns and the like dacion raised one eyebrow do i take it he will not be coming directly here once again falconsbane snorted he prefers he says to remain in neutral lands i directed him to the valley i flooded with deathsmoke a while ago it is secure enough the horned vermin will not be using it again soon and if he proves unreliable well the adept shrugged rippling his hair and mane i flooded it once and can do so again very good my lord daelon bowed and smiled better to eliminate a menace than deal with a conflict falconsbane chuckled the deep rumbling laugh that dawnfire knew only too well she crouched a little smaller on her perch ah daelon your philosophy is sounique daelon bowed again smiled but said nothing falconsbane waved negligently at him go he said then as daelon started for the door he changed his mind wait he called and scooped something up from beside his couch as daelon turned he tossed something at him and as the servant caught it dawnfire saw it was the falconers glove take that bird with you he yawned i am fatigued and she no longer amuses me take her to the mews it is time for her to learn her place in life very good my lord daelon repeated when the servant approached dawnfire she tensed expecting trouble but evidently he was so unfamiliar with falconry that he did not even attempt to hood her he merely took the ends of her jesses clumsily in his free hand and stuck his gloved hand in her general direction if he didnt know enough about falconry to hold her jesses properly he might not know enough to hold them tightly she hopped onto his hand as obediently as a tamed cagebird and remained quiet and wellbehaved and as he carried her out of the room and away from falconsbanes sight she saw with elation that he was barely holding the tips of her jesses of course she had fouled them she couldnt have helped that he evidently found that very distasteful and he was avoiding as much contact with the chalked leather as possible and he was holding the arm she rested on stiffly far away from his body lest she supposed she also drop on his fine robes and if that particular function had been within her control she would have considered doing just that he could not find a servant anywhere as they passed through silent stone corridors on the way to the outside door that elated her even further even as it visibly annoyed him he was going to have to take her outside himselfhe dropped the jesses leaving them loose as he wrestled with the massive brassbound wooden door trusting in her apparent docility she rewarded that trust as he got the door open a real hawk would have bolted the moment a scrap of sky showed but she was not sure enough of her flying ability to try for an escape the man was so fussy she was hoping he would take the time to make sure the door was closed before reaching for her jesses again please lady of stars please dont let him see a servant out here he looked about him squinting in the light as he emerged from behind the bulky door into the flagstoned courtyard frowning when he found the courtyard as empty as the corridors he held her with his arm completely extended away from his body as he started to shove the door closed yes she crouched and launched herself into the air wings beating with all her might just as she had practiced with a cry of despair daelon made a grab for her dangling jessesbut it was too late she flung herself into the freedom of the blue sky putting every bit of her strength into each wingbeat exaltation giving her an extra burst of power as daelon dwindled beneath her waving in wild despair chapter wentythree skif sat very quietly in his corner of the gryphons lair and made up his bedroll with meticulous care elspeth had complained a few days ago that she felt as if she were being written into a tale of some kind now he knew how she felt strange enough to see gryphons this closebut to be rescued by them hear them talkno one at home is ever going to believe this the fighting had been real enough and hed seen plenty of misshapen things in the ranks of ancars forces too many to be surprised by the creatures that had been sent against them but talking gryphons hawkbrothers no theyre going to think we made this up he tried not to show his fear of the gryphons but one of his friends was an enthusiastic falconer and he knew what a beak that size and talons that long could do the bigger of the two gryphons was already inside the roofedover ruin when he entered it the place was ten times larger than his room at haven but it seemed terribly crowded with the gryphon in it excuse me my lady hed said humbly hoping his voice wouldnt break but where would you like me hydona said the gryphon he coughed to cover his nervousness excuse me my name isss hydona youngling the gryphon said and there was real amusement in its voice it means kindnessss you may put yourrr thingsss in that chamberrr the changechild will ssshow you that was when he noticed a girl in the next chamber over peering around the edge of the opening obediently he had hauled his saddlebags and bedroll across the threshold wondering what on earth a changechild was then the girl moved out of his way and fully into the light from the outer door and his eyes nearly popped out of his head she didnt have fur and she didnt walk on four legsbut she had sharply feline features slitpupiled eyes and the same boneless liquid grace of any pampered housecat hed ever seen he managed to stammer out a question about where he was to put his things she answered by helping him and that was when he noticed that once the initial shock of her strangeness wore off she was very attractive quite pretty really he smoothed his bedroll and watched her out of the corner of his eye as she brought armfuls of nestmaterial to put between it and the hard rock she was more than pretty she was beautiful especially when she smiled thank you he said just to see her smile again which she did a smile that reached and warmed those big golden eyes there hadnt been a lot of smiles out of elspeth lately it was nice to see one let me aid you she said softly and knelt beside him to help him arrange a more comfortable bed without waiting to hear his answer there hasnt been a lot of help out of elspeth either lately he thought sourly in fact this girl was elspeths utter opposite in a lot of ways quiet softspoken where elspeth was more inclined to snap at the most innocent of questions whats your name he asked her as they took the opposite ends of the bedroll and laid it over the bedding prepared for it nyara she said and looked shyly away that was when elspeth came in and put her own gear away efficiently and without a fuss but it broke the tentative conversation between himself and nyara and the girl retreated to her corner shes somechanical shes like a welloiled perfectlyrunning clockwork mechanism shes just not human anymore in fact for all of her exotic strangeness nyara seemed more human than elspeth did he stripped off his tunic and changed his filthy sweatsodden shirt for a new one with sidelong glances at elspeth she changed tom shirt and breeches both cut and stained with blood although there was no sign of a wound on her she took no more notice of him and nyara than if they had been stones no heart no feelings no emotion no patience with anyone who isnt perfect as cold as nyara is warm a sound at the door made him start as he laced the cuffs of his shirt the man who had rescued themdarkwindstood shadowing the door skif had not heard him until he had deliberately made that sound he spoke with gryphons moved like a thought hid in the shadowshe was far more alien than nyara and colder than elspeth helooked slowly and deliberately into skifs eyes then elspeths then nyaras come he said it is time to talk why does it seem as if a whole week has passed since this morning and a year since we first entered the plains elspeth asked her dark brown eyes fixed on the horizon as the last rays of the sun turned the western clouds to gold and red streaks against an incredibly blue sky the young man called skif was contemplating nyara as he had been since she had been awakened darkwind was watching elspeth and her friendthough mostly elspethrather than the sunset she had washed and changed into another of those blindingly white uniforms and he found himself wondering idly how she would look in one of the elaborate robes tayledras adepts favored in better days hed had time to design clothing for his friends tayledras art had to be portable because they moved so often and clothing was as much art as it was covering his designs had been very popular back then not as popular as ravenwings feather masks but she had been practicing her art for longer than hed been alive in fact he had been proud terribly proud that his father had worn some of his designs one of the things that had hurt him had been finding those outfits discarded soon after he had joined the scouts in the pile of material available to be remade into scoutcamouflage now he knew why his father had done that discarded the clothing where he would be certain to find it hed meant to drive darkwind farther away to save him the knowledge turned what had been a bitter memory into something more palatable as he contemplated elspeth he imagined what he would design for her something hugging the body to the hips perhaps showing that magnificently muscled torso then with a flaring skirt slit to properly display those long athletic legsdefinitely in a bt emerald green or maybe something that would enable her to move and fight with complete freedom tight winered leather trews laced up the side an intricately cut black tunic a soft red silk shirt with an embroidered collar and sleeveswhat in hell am i doing how can i be thinking of clothing right now maybe it was that she cried out for proper display white was not her color the stark uniform only made her look severe like a purposeful unornamented blade after talking with her at length there was no doubt in his mind that she was a completely competent fighterthat this was an important part of her life but there was more to her than that much more her outer self should mirror her complicated inner self she needed that kind of setting with her spare hardedged beauty unlike nyara who would never look anything other than lush and exotic sleek and sensuous no matter what she wore nyara sat on the opposite side of skif glancing sideways at him skif couldnt take his eyes off her she had proved once revived not only cooperative but grateful that all treyvan had done was put her to sleep her reactioncompletely genuine so far as darkwind was able to determinehad shamed him a little for behaving with such suspicion and cold calculation toward her on the other hand she herself had confirmed what darkwind and treyvan had suspected that she was a danger she confessed that she could be summoned by her father at any point and if unfettered she would probably go to him awake or asleep she did not know if he could read her thoughts at a distance but was not willing to say that he couldnt if you have any doubt you must send me to sleep again and tie me she had said humbly do not waste shields upon me that you may give to the little gryphons that last had won treyvan darkwind was still not so sure but his own misgivings were fading she had given them an amazing amount of information about mornelithes stronghold the problem was the place was a miracle of defensive capability nyara bitterly attributed her easy escape now to the fact that her father had wanted her to get away extracting dawnfire from that warren was looking more and more difficult active discussionad died before the sun sank into the west but elspeth was still thinking about the problem and not simply admiring the sunset darkwind shes a bird right what about getting in turning her loose and making some other bird look like her elspeth turned toward darkwind as the last sliver of sun vanished one person maybe two could get away with that now that is the kind of sortie i know how to run the sword put in darkwind looked pointedly at nyara she coughed politely this would be a good time for me to absent myself could i take a walk perhaps she asked could someone go with me and she glanced significantly at skif who flushed but did not look as if he would turn down the invitation darkwind found himself torn by conflicting emotions he knew very well what was likely to happen as soon as those two found themselves alone and while on the one hand he was relieved that nyara had found herself a safer outlet for her needs than himself he also was unreasoningly jealous he didnt trust himself with her he didnt trust her she had already told them that falconsbane had ordered her to seduce and subvert him doing anything except exchanging pleasantries with her was the worst possible idea at the moment that didnt stop his loins from tightening every time she looked at him and it didnt stop him from being envious of anyone else she cast those golden eyes upon ive done my share of breaking into buildings in my misspent youth skif said hesitantly with one eye on nyara but i have the feeling youre thinking of using magic and thats where you lose me i suppose we could go take that walk out of earshot if only one person goes in i guess it wouldnt be one of us heraldsso what i know is pretty superfluous darkwind glanced at elspeth he thought he saw a little smile playing at the corners of her mouth but the light was fading and he couldnt be sure he wondered if she would be so amused if she knew what he knew about nyara but there didnt seem to be any reason to object stay within the ruins he said curtly skif i hold you responsible for this woman remember what shes told us she cant even trust herself skif nodded but he also rose to his feet and courteously offered nyara his hand to help her rise as well nyara took it though she didnt need it any more than darkwind would have and she held it a moment longer than she needed to i dont think he has any idea of what hes in for she just may eat him alive he stopped himself before he could say anything she isnt my property shes too dangerous right now for me to touch it doesnt matter what i want acting on what you want is something only children think is an adult prerogative so he held his tongue and watched the two of them walk slowly into the shadows of the ruins sidebyside but carefully nottouching the sexual tension between them was so obvious that they might just as well have been bound together by ropes i know im being incredibly obnoxious to ask this elspeth said behind him but were you two lovers no lady he said absently as he struggled to get his jealousy under control no we werent she has that much control of herself her father ordered her to seduce me therefore she would not otherwise he paused then continued sensing that this particular young woman would not misinterpret what he was saying and sensing that he could somehow reveal anything to her without fear of coming under judgment otherwise we might well have been she was created for pleasure i think you know that or have guessed it drives her before hunger or pain she is probably quiteadept at it she has had most of her life to learn it and practice elspeth considered his words for a moment as he turned back to face her you arent angry at skif i hope he uttered a short humorless laugh angry no she cannot help what she is enviousyes much as i hate to admit it envy is not a pretty trait and you her soft laugh was genuine i am so relieved that he has finally found someone towell drag off into the ruins darkwind suggested delicately exactly i cant tell you how relieved i am he has been a very good friend for many years she said tilting her head to one side as she sat silhouetted against the indigo sky and he has been under a great deal of strain lately and were you lovers darkwind asked sharply in a tone that surprised even him why should i care he wondered theyre outlanders theyll get what they need and leave like the breath of wind on a still pond the only impression they can make is a fleeting one she didnt seem to notice i havent been entirely candid with you darkwindthough mostly it was because i didnt think rank was going to impress you any and might have made you reject us out of hand ah so my surmise was right she took a deep breath im next in line for the throne not that i particularly want it she added and there was a kind of chagrined surprise in her voice which is odd because when i was little i thought that being made heir was the highest possible pinnacle of success but there it is now i have it and i rather wish i didnt skif has always been a kind of big brother to me and there were always rumors about the two of us but were they true he persisted he shifted a little not because he was uncomfortable outside but because he was acutely uncomfortable inside jealousy again and this time for no damned reason it must be overflow from nyara he decided gods of my fathers this is embarrassing have i no selfcontrol no she said calmly relieving his jealousy by her answer no he always thought of me as a little sister until we went out on this trip together then he suddenly decided that he was in love with me she sounded annoyed to his great satisfaction i cannot for the life of me imagine why but thats what he decided and ive been trying to discourage him maybe once i would have been happy for that butits not possible darkwind i have duties as the heir if i ever get back in one piece if i were to make any kind of alliance i have to consider my duties first and anything permanent would be weighed against them loveeven if genuinecould only be secondary mother married for what she thought was love the first time and it was a total disaster skif is so blinded by his own feelings that he wont even consider anything else ah he replied i take it that you are far from convinced that what your friend feels is love she snorted infatuation more like it ive been trying to emulate my teacher kerowynsince we left valdemar and he worships her that may have been the problem so she feels no tie beyond friendship for this skif he thought with a feeling of satisfaction well if she is going to learn magic thats just as well shell have a great deal to learn coming to it this late and shell have no time for anything but study that may have been the situation he responded sensing she was waiting for some kind of a reply butyou sounded very annoyed just now with him may i ask why if there is friction other than what you have told me i need to know nothing other than that once he became infatuated he wanted to wrap me in silk and stick me in a jewel box she replied the annoyance back in her voice i think i have him cured of that but in case i havent the problem may come up again he nodded forgetting that it was dark enough that she wouldnt see the nod then coughed politely thank you elspeth that could cause some problems i hope i have not caused you distress by asking you these questions no not at all she replied surprise in her voice you are a very easy person to confide in darkwind thank you for giving me the chance to unburden myself my companion thinks skif is perfect for me and need thinks hes an utter loss so any time i say anything to either of them all i get is lectures companion oh that must be the spiritmare but she said it as if it were a namecompanion he asked as the first breath of the evening wind flowed through the stones and breathed the hair away from his face my nothorse she replied and there was a smile there that he felt across the darkness between them the one you have very graciously been treating not like a horse we call themcompanions every herald in valdemar has onethey choose us to be heralds they he hesitated in confusion could you please explain certainly if you dont mind my coming closer she replied he peered through the darkness at her to see if she was being flirtatiousbut she appeared to be swatting at her legs there seem to be some kind of nocturnal insects on this rock and they like the taste of herald by all means come sit beside me he replied grateful to the nightants there are no nightant nests here she rose brushing off her legs as he moved over on his rock to give her room now he continued about thesecompanions of yours shouldnt we be discussing how to get dawnfire free she replied as she seated herself her tone one of concern its easy to get distracted we are discussing dawnfire he told her a little grimly you and thiscompanion of yours may be better suited to the task than i i need to know as much as possible about you but skif wont be back for some time he assured her and i have but two concerns regarding him the firstthat her father not attempt to contact or call her while he is with her and the second she asked he sighed and leaned back on his hands that she leave enough left of him to be useful she chuckled and he felt the corners of his mouth turning up in a smile now he continued about thiscompanion nyara could have shouted her joy aloud as darkwind gave them tacit permission to go off alone skif could have been ugly foulbreathed potbellied bowlegged bald and obnoxious and she would not at this moment have cared he was safe that was what mattered mornelithe had not ordered her to seduce him did not even know that he existed so far as she knew she could ease the urges that had been driving her to distraction since her body began to heal and do so without the guilt of knowing she would be corrupting himdo so only to pleasure herself and him and not with any other motive of any sort that he was cleanly handsome wellspoken wellmanneredthat turned the expedition from a simple need to a real desire she wanted him in the same way she wanted darkwind but without the guilt likewise he wanted her she guessed however that he was shy else he would have proposed dalliance when they were first alone in the gryphons lair so it would be up to her she had a cats hearing to be able to discern a mouse squeak in the high grass a furlong away and a cats eyes so that this light of a nearfull moon was as useful to her as the sun at full day so when he had just begun to turn to her to tentatively reach for her hand she already knew that they were well out of earshot and that there was a little corner amidst the pile of rocks to their left that would suit his sense of modesty very well no ears but those equal to hers would hear them and no eyes but an owls would spy them out thank the godsnot mornelithethat she had learned tradetongue and that these strangers spoke it well nyara skif said shyly oh she had been right taking heart when she did not pull her hand away im sure this sounds pretty stupid but ive never met anyone like you you have no changechildren in your lands she asked stopping turning to his voice and standing calculatedly near him near enough that her breast brushed his arm he did not oh joy step away no he replied his voice rising just a little no chchangechildren no magic ah she purred and swayed closer you know what my father made me for darkwind has told you a slight increase in the heat of his body told her he blushed yyes he stammered good she replied and fastened her mouth on his he only struggled for a moment mostly out of surprise and the anticipation that this was part of a ruse that she meant to escape since that was the last thing on her mind she told him so with every fiber of her body he stopped struggling believing her unspoken message she molded herself to him each and every separate nerve alive and athrill then as he finally began responding instead of reacting she led him back into the little alcove step by slow careful step she was on fire with need and so was he she felt it and for the first time in her life felt it as well a flood of emotion and urgency that washed over her and mingled with her own that was such a surprise that she came near to forgetting her own desire she melted in his need pulling him down into the shadows marveling at this precious gift from out of nowhere to feel his pleasure his desireit heightened her own beyond any past experience i am an empath i had never dreamedmy own hatred and fear must have shielded me but that didnt matter at the moment all that was truly important was getting him out of his clothing or part of it anyway he pulled away and she clutched him ripping his shirt with her talons why was he trying to evade her she could feel his overwhelming need so clearly rocks he gasped as she tried to fasten her mouth on his again youll hurt your she proceeded to prove to him that the setting didnt matter and neither did the rocks soon they were writhing together joined in body and mind and she bit her hand to keep from screaming her pleasure aloud mornelithe knew her body as no one else he knew every way possible to elicit reactions of all sorts from her but this was pleasure unmixed with anger hate selfhatred she had never been so happy in all of her short life he reached the pinnacle she followed and they fell together they lay entwined panting sweatsoaked and exhausted he stroked her hair with a gentle hand murmuring wonderful things that she only half heard how amazing she was astonishing a dream come to life these things were never to be believed if a wouldbe lover whispered them before the beddingbut after she probed his feelings delicately taking care with this new sense and there was some truth there a little something more than mere infatuation yes he was infatuated but he thought her brave for even trying to resist her father he thought her admirable for giving them the aid that she had and he thought her lovely desirable beyond any dream nor did he despise her for using her body as she had or even and she held her breath in wonder for being used by her own father but there was a bitterness to the joy he imagined her to have been forced into submitting he could never understand the forces that had been bred and formed in her that her father would call and she would come willingly abjectly desiring him as fervently as she desired anyoneshe resolved not to think about it the chances were she would never see him again after the next few days if they freed dawnfire she would use the tayledras gratitude to enable her to put as much distance between herself and her father as her feet would permit if they did notshe would not think of it not now and there was a most excellent distraction near at hand she reached for skif again he pulled her closer pillowing her head on his shoulder thinking she only wished comfort she was going to give him such a lovely surprise in speaking to elspeth darkwind found himself baffled and dazzled by turns by the time skif and nyara returned disheveled and sated smelling of sweat and sex darkwind had begun to realize that there was even more to this complicated princess than he had thought she had her flaws certainly an overhasty tongue not in saying what she should not but in doing so too sharply too scathingly a habit of speech of speaking the truth too clearly and too often that could earn her enemiesand probably had a hot temper which when kindled was slow to cool the tendency to hold a grudgehold a grudge dear gods she treasures a grudge long past when it should have been dead and buried she would without doubt pursue an enemy into his grave then make a dancingfloor of it then return from time to time for a jig just to keep the triumph alive she flung herself into the midst of disagreements before she entirely understood them basing her response on what had just happened rather than seeing what had led to the situation she was impatient with fools and scornful of those who were ruled by emotions rather than logic and she took no care to hide either the scorn or the impatience without a doubt that had earned her enemies as well but to balance all that she was loyal faithful and truly cared for people so blindingly intelligent that it amazed him and not afraid of her intellect as so many were she tried to the best of her ability to consider others as often as she considered herself her sense of responsibility frightened him it was so like his own so too her sense of justice dawnfire had beenwas he told himself fiercelya paragon of simplicity compared to her of course dawnfire was ten years her junior or thereabouts but he wondered if elspeth had ever been uncomplicated even as a child probably not not with all the considerations the child of a royal couple had to grow up with every friend must be weighed against what he might be wanting every smile must be assumed to be a mask hiding other motives such upbringing had made for bitter friendless rulers in the outlands it was a very good thing that these people had their heralds a very good thing that the monarch was a herald and could know with certainty that she would always have a few trustworthy friends he didnt entirely understand what the heralds did but he certainly understood what they were about they embodied much the same spirit as the kalenedral of the shinain like them it appeared that they were godchosen for if the companions were not the embodiment of the hand of the gods then he would never recognize such a thing in his lifetime like them they were guided but subtlyfor the most part left free to exercise their free will and only gently reminded from time to time if they were about to err it seemed that the unsubtle attempt to steer elspeth down a particular course was the exception and not the rule and it appeared to him to have failed quite dismally and as a result elspeths companion gwena was now grudgingly going to admit her defeat and permit elspeth to chart her own way from this moment on the heralds were very like the kalenedral in another way for as each had his companion so each kalenedral had his leshyae kalenedral the spiritteacher that drilled him in weaponry and guided his steps on the stareyeds road and the heralds themselves were blissfully unaware of the fact if they didnt knowand the companions chose not to tell themhe was not inclined to let the secret slip it is not wise to dispute the decisions of the powers he thought wryly quoting a shinain proverb they have more ways of enforcement than you have of escape the decision to set elspeth on a predetermined path was probably less a decision than a plan another shinain proverb plans are always subject to change he found himself making a decision of his own when all this was settled he would teach her himself he would find a teachingadept perhaps in another clan like ktreva and as he relearned he would teach her he had the feeling that she respected what he had done and she would continue to respect him for going back to pick up where he had left off besides as tayledras had learned in the past those who were in the process of learning often discovered new ways and skills just by being unaware that it couldnt be done perhaps they would discover something together but that was for the future now there was a rescue to be staged we have decided he said as skif reclaimed his boulder and nyara seated herself near it not quite at his feet but very close darkwind suppressed a last fading twinge of jealousy we think we have a plan that will work its going to need a lot of coordination though elspeth added its going to involve more than just us skif can you get cymry listening in on this i just called gwena cymry he responded sounding confused uhsure they dont need to be with us to be in on conferences elspeth said in an undertone to darkwind the heraldcompanion link is even closer than a lifebond in many ways no matter how weak your gift of mindspeech is your companion can always hear you and if you choose listen to what you hear and right now they need very badly to be eating he supplied indeed the dyheli are so after a long hard run he felt her smile though he could not see it why dont you start darkwind since this was your idea what of me nyara asked in a small voice should i you are going to be inside the vale by midmorning darkwind told her i am going to tell iceshadow something of your past and put you in his custody asking him to keep you always within the shields of the apprentices working place where my father is if your father can break the vale shields and the workingshields he is merely toying with us and anything we do is trivial against him i am going to ask you to answer all of iceshadows questions about my fathers captivity no matter how painful they are to you why she asked huddling a little smaller because you will be helping iceshadow determine what was done to him and so break the bonds falconsbane placed upon him darkwind told her letting the tone of his voice inform her that he would grant her no more mercy than he granted himself that much at the least you owe him skif made a little movement as if he wanted to leap up and challenge darkwind but wisely kept himself under control i will then summon the nonhumans that dawnfire worked with he continued they will help be our diversion tervardi and dyheli they will concentrate on a place where you heralds will be in the neutral area as if you had passed across tayledras lands and were going westward it will look to falconsbane as if you have summoned them and he will assume it is through your sword elspeth elspeth took up the explanation where he paused all he can tell is that its magic skif thats probably why those things were chasing us across the plains he wants it and he hasnt got a clue that he cant use it oh he could try i suppose the sword said dryly but he doesnt know im in here its quite likely that it would be impossible for him to make any real use of me without destroying me i suspect he will decide that it is one of the ancient devices used to control the nonhumans in warfare darkwind rubbed the bridge of his nose i can tell you that if he thinks that he will be mad to have it and he will be equally determined after his last failure that he will not leave the task in the hands of others so hell come in person skif stated and he was plainly not pleased with the idea where does that leave us standing inside the vale darkwind chuckled wishing he could see skifs face it will be your images and your auras in the neutral area and no more it is a spell that is not often cast for it is broken as soon as one moves more than five paces in any direction need reminded us of it in fact need intends to be the mage casting it he made a little bow in elspeths direction thank you for the confidence but save your applause for if it works and itll be elspeth casting it ill just be showing her how that leaves me outside he continued and i shall be the one making the attempt to free dawnfire if i have the time i shall place the illusion of the proper hawk on some other bird in his mews and blank the beasts mind he will assume that dawnfires personality has at last faded or so i hope he hated to subject an innocent bird to that but with luck it would be one of falconsbanes own evil creations if i do not have the time he continue i shall simply free her and attempt to escape i do not think he will return before i am away again skif whistled softly thats going to take some good timing he observed and youre the one taking the packleaders share of the risks but it could not be done without all of you he responded i cannot ask you to take the kinds of risks that i willbut i cannot make this succeed without you and afterward elspeth asked softly when you have dawnfire free but still trapped in a hawks body her true self fading with every daywhat then you didnt speak of that he remained silent because he didnt knowand he didnt want to contemplate it having to watch her struggle against the inevitable and lose a long unhappy silence descended which the sword finally broke oh worry about it when shes free the blade replied irritably for one thing i know a bit about transfer spells maybe i can get her into something with a big enough brain that she can stay herself or maybe i can get her into something like a sword would that not be just as bad nyara asked doubtfully voicing exactly what darkwind was thinking he suppressed a groan at least shed stay herself girl the sword retorted with annoyance therere worse fates than being hard to break heart included darkwind decided to end the discussion right there enough we have a great deal ahead of us and not much time elspeth said firmly and best to work on it in the morning they returned to the lair and gave treyvan and hydona the basics of what they had decided treyvan did not ask about the fate of his own young but darkwind could tell that he was gravely worried and weary evidently falconsbane had tried something while they were talking and had been beaten back but at a cost they were all too tired for anything more and put off further discussion nyara bedded down in the same chamber as skif and elspeth with darkwind across the door and treyvan blocking the entrance for added security but darkwind could not fall asleep as easily as the rest he lay staring at the silhouette of the sleeping gryphon watching the shadow climb up the wall as the moon set and over and over the question repeated in his mind what do i do once she is free she would never again wear the body of the girl he had traded feathers and favors with at worst case he would watch her fade slowly into the hawk if falconsbane had slain the spirit of her bird with dawnfires body she might well hold on longer but the end would be the same and whether she stayed in the hawk or need managed to find a way to put her in another form the result was the same she would never again be dawnfire she would be something else something he could no longer touch what in the gods names do i do when she is free chapter twentyfour the alarm cry of a falcon woke him at dawnand the answering deeper scream of a hawk he started awake all at once and knew he was not at home the rock floor the lack of movement and the darkness told him that much before he even opened his eyes his hand was on his knifehilt as he blinked the haze of sleep away running rapidly through all the possibilities of where he was and what had become of his eheletreyvan s lair that was all he had a chance to remember as the falcon cried alarm again he cast about for the door still disoriented by the strange surroundings thats vreebut whose was the hawk out vree demanded his mental cry as shrill and penetrating as his physical scream out now hurry help that wasnt the help me version it was i need your help he scrambled over treyvans prone body as the gryphon struggled up out of sleep grrrruh treyvan responded as darkwind slid down his haunches and into the sunlight what there were two birds up above one flapping as clumsily as a just fledged crow the other unmistakably vree the gyre circled in guardfashion above the first protecting it as it tried to come in to land it was a redshouldered hawkit was dawnfire help me help me came the faint and faltering mental cry she doesnt know how to land he realized just as treyvan shouldered him aside leapt into the sky rose to meet her and scooped her from the air with his outstretched talons he wheeled and dropped her safely in his foreclaws coming to rest delicately on his hind feet only in a thunder of wingclaps before darkwind realized what he was doing treyvan balanced precariously as he had alighted keeping himself from falling with his outstretched wings the bird lay exhausted in treyvans claws every last bit of energy long since spent darkwind took her from the gryphon and held her in his arms like an injured shocked fledgling she lay panting eyes closed as he folded her wings over her back and stroked her head another hand joined his a hard but feminine hand it was elspeth wearing only a thin undershift and hose but carrying her blade unsheathed in her other hand her eyes were closed a slight frown was her only expressionbut the moment her fingers touched dawnfires back the bird began to revive her head lifted and she craned it around to stare up at him darkwind she mindspoke softly is this real or some illusion he created to torment me am i truly free and home youre free kechara he replied anger and grief combined to choke off his words it was one thing to know intellectually that she might have been trapped in her birds body it was another to see it sense it i saw vree or he saw me i forget she said closing her eyes again and bending her head as if she did not want to see him through the hawks eyes he brought me here but i was so tired the sword will work better through direct contact elspeth said quietly i if you can put her down on my bed and i can lay need next to her no sooner spoken than done and with the blade touching her dawnfire gained strength quickly asking for water and food the latter darkwind fed her as he would an eyas little morsels cut from a fresh rabbit that vree brought back within moments of her asking for something to eat she took each tidbit daintily and it was plain from her condition that she had not been feeding well in mornelithes hands outwardly he was calm inwardly he was in turmoil how to tell her that her body was deadthat she was still as trapped now as she was in falconsbanes hands there was no hint of kyrr in her thoughtsso the blades guess that mornelithe had killed the birds spirit with her body was probably right that gave them a little more time than if shed had to share kyrrs mindbut it would only postpone the end a little longer joy at her recovery anguish at her condition rage at the one who had brought her to thisguilt because he was partly to blame warring emotions kept him silent as he fed her wondering what to say and how to say it dawn he began hesitantly darkwind youre in danger she interrupted urgently she twisted her head to look at the strangers youre all in danger terrible danger quickly she told them of all she had heard and most importantly of falconsbanes new plan his decision to make outland alliances alliances oh blessed gods he forgot his other worries in the face of this new threat for falconsbane alone was bad enough falconsbane with allies was a prospect too awful to contemplate allies with magepowers allies with armieseither would spell disaster for the precarious hold ksheyna maintained on power here but this ancar evidently had mages and armies according to elspeth ksheyna would be obliterated and every other vale faced with a formidable threat if he gets help like that there wont be anything beyond himthe heraldsand their companionsquestioned dawnfire closely as he closed his eyes and tried to think of all the possibilities their reaction was identical to hisnot too surprising given that he thought this ancar that dawnfire said falconsbane was meeting was undoubtedly the same man who had been doing his best to level their land it was not a common name it was beyond likely that there were two of them and although it seemed a terribly long way to travel just for a meeting with a possible ally mornelithe was a powerful adept and a desirable acquisition so far as ancars position was concerned the king of hardorn needed mages hed been actively recruiting them he might not yet have any adeptclass it might be well worth it to him to come this far and a similar search had already brought elspeth and skif just as far he said he was meeting the man in three days dawnfire was saying when he opened his eyes again to pay attention to what was going on around him now there were seven sets of eyes fixed on the exhausted hawk the two heralds the two gryphons the pair of companions and nyara who seemed as upset as any of them he thought he knew the reason why perhaps she sees herself in dawnfires entrapment that was two days ago dawnfire continued i escaped that afternoon and ive been flying in circles ever since trying to find my way home so today or the day after they will meet ancar wouldnt have come all this way just to turn around elspeth said grimly he wants this alliance wants it badly hes got no other reason to leave his own realm and i dont care how much hulda taught him he wouldnt leave the place even in her hands if there was any other way out godswith falconsbanes power and ancars armiesand his recklessnesswe wont have a chance weve got to stop this before it happens we have an opportunity to put paid to both our enemies darkwind growled his hands clenched into fists not only to stop this alliance but take both our enemies at one stroke i must talk to the elders he started to get up skif caught his elbow and his attention youd better include elspeth in your plans no matter what else you do he whispered or shes likely to march right in there on her own she who holds a grudge like an eyas binds to a kill he nodded curtly annoyed but knowing skif was right the gryphons had a grudge of their own to settle they probably wouldnt try to stop her settle down you lot need growled suddenly startling all of them i dont know whats set the burr under your tails so you arent thinking children but i stopped falling for tricks like this one a millennium ago and im not going to let you cart me into a trap now i said he likely wouldnt be able to use me id prefer not to put that to the test if you dont mind they stared at each other in shock dawnfire included what darkwind asked let me spell it out for you dawnfire was allowed to escape so that she could bring you this trumpedup story so that you lot would go charging off straight into his loving arms nyara was the first to recover oh no she whispered it is too too like my own escapean escape that was not this sword is right elspeth set her chin stubbornly her eyes flashing for a moment then sighed and threw up her hands bright havens i want to believe it i really do because its such a good chance to get the bastard now while hes away from his support and his armybut youre right youre both right its too damned pat too coincidental mothers intelligence web had ancar safe in his own palace when we left we made much better time than he could have because were riding companions the only way he could possibly have matched our time would be to ride in relays and how would he manage that off his own lands he has farther to come than we did on top of all that so how could he possibly be arriving here just at the same moment we did and why sssshould he perrrmit dawnfirrre to overhearrrr hisss plansss treyvan rumbled mossst essspecially why ssshould he have given herrr to one who wasss not competent with hawksss to take to the mewsss he wanted herrr to fly to usss with thisss and then wanted us towhat elspeth asked falconsbane never does anything for just one reason he wants us not only to try and break up this nonexistent meeting he wants us moved why whats so special about this neutral area where the supposed meeting is is it a particularly good place to stage a double ambush theres nothing special about it that i know of darkwind replied frowning with concentration he cant have meant to catch you as he caught the dyheli can he dawnfire asked drooping a little as she too acknowledged the fact that her escape had been too easy he deliberately reminded me of what he had done to them there which probably means he wanted us to concentrate on that as well skif mused aloud we know he wants the sword from what quenten told me he probably wants elspeth as well oh yes nyara agreed nodding her head vigorously yes an untrained mage he uses such as tools he would be pleased to have you in his hands lady so is there anything else he wants something wed leave unprotectedsomething even the whole clan might leave unprotected if we went to them and got more help for this skif continued elspeth glanced sideways at darkwind the vale itself she hazarded or your father he shook his head no the static protections are too much for him to crack easily we could return and entrap him before he had even begun to break the outermost shields the heartssstone asked treyvan then answered himself no it isss the sssame as for the vale the squall of a hungry young gryphon cut across their speculations and sent all eyes in the direction of the inner lair no treyvan whispered his eyes widening yes nyara cried in mingled pain and triumph yesthat is what he wantsas much as sword and mage and starblade and starblades son revenge and the souls of your younglings and i treyvan whispered his eyes wide with horror nearrrly gave it all away to him again it had taken darkwind no time at all to create a scalemodel of the area around the lair using rocks twigs and the flat expanse of sand near the entrance it was the only place big enough for all of them elspeth shook off the many memories of time spent bending over a sandtable with kero and paid close attention to darkwind she wondered now how she could have mistaken simple stress for arrogance not thinking clearly lately are we she asked herself not observing at all well when this is over it might be a good idea to take a few days to rest and think about a lot of things youll be here darkwind said to skif placing a pinecone on the bits of rock representing the ruins to the left of the lair and ill be moving around if i cant get a good knife or bowshot from there skif added the hawkbrother nodded exactly so you are best as mobile as possible now the little ones dawnfire and the sword will be here in front of the lair he placed a cluster of weedstripped seedheads and a sliver of wood before the large stone representing the lair and gave elspeth a penetrating glance you are certain you are willing to give up the use of the blade it seems unfair elspeth shrugged it was needs choice remember she pointed out weve got to protect the bait somehow and two of the three of them are female crap ill take care of the little male too the blade said gruffly what do you think i am some kind of bab ard w ld vkiller besides the bast ou twtst him up as badly as he has nyara if he got his claws on the lad you are not such poor bait yourself bladelady darkwind replied he wants you as well as i recall just make sure he doesnt get me no help coming frrrom the vale asked hydona leaning over skifs shoulder to look at the setup darkwind shook his head not since the message i sent them by bondbirdrelay they are rightly fearful that this may be a double rusea feint at the little ones a pretense that draws us into ambush and a real strike at the vale they have been badly shaken by what they have seen done to my father and do not share my confidence in their own shields they have called in all the scouts but myself and are bracing for attack firrrssst ssssmarrrt thing theyve decided in agesss treyvan growled even if it doesss leave usss to bearrr the burrrden of ourrrr own defenssssessss i take it we are herrre and herrrre the gryphon pointed a talon at two feathers stuck in the sand on the opposite side of the lair from skifs initial position behind a line of rocks representing the wall the lair had been built into precisely darkwind agreed and here are elspeth and myself he dropped two rough quartzcrystals opposite the gryphons and nearer to the lair than skif then the companions watching for his creatures coming at us from behind two large white flowers one beside skifs pinecone one beside elspeths crystal treyvan we will try to bracket him with magic once that occurs i do not think he will be looking for a physical attack that is where you come in he nodded at skif and you because of that are the pivotal point of the defense you look for your opening and take it the man is as mortal as any to a wellplaced knife or arrow you are our hidden token our wild piece what about me nyara asked in a small voice is there nothing i can do elspeth bit her lip to keep from saying what she was thinking that there was no way they could trust the changechild enough to give her a part to play they certainly couldnt make her part of the bait neither the gryphons nor darkwind wanted her near enough to be in range for an attack on them if her father regained control of her falconsbane does not know you are still with us darkwind said after an uncomfortable silence the longer this remains so the better stick with me skif suggested im staying out of sight is this wise darkwind asked elspeth worriedly she shook her head just enough to make her hair stir imperceptibly hes assassintrained she replied wishing there were somewhere safe they could leave nyara until this was all over and cymry will be with him watching his back the way gwena will be watching ours she wont be able to catch him with an unexpected attack i just hope he doesnt find himself in the position of being forced to let cymry kill her or killing her himself darkwind added anything more he might have intended to say was lost for at that moment vree sounded the alert from overhead he comes the bird shrieked with mind and voice he comes now they scattered for their posts falconsbane prowled the woods that the birdmen thought were theirs with an ease they would have found appalling noting the increased levels of shielding about the vale with a mixture of contempt and anger there was no doubt of it they had poured more power into their old shields added new and every adept within the vale was undoubtedly on alert the tentative plan hed formed to extract starblade from his protectors and retrain him for further use was obviously out of the question now he paused in the shelter of a wild tangle of briars and searched for a weak point there was nothing of the sort since there was no one to see him he permitted himself a savage snarl all that work all the patience the careful planning the investment of power in starblades transformation to puppet and in the construct that controlled himall wasted he wished he had been able to see through the simulacrums eyes but the protections about the vale had made that impossible he still ut the prote n e a d ad no real idea what had happened when hed lost his contact with the uul laaccrum starblade had been near the heartstone he knew that i incee it had been near dawn falconsbane assumed that he must ducting his usual nonproductive assessment of the state of hen out of nowhere a flash of panic from the crow of power as the bird was destroyed why or the uncontrolled power killing one daelon who had the misfortune do you him up k c aelon had been useless as a mage you and r t cretary but any loss at all angered lb he wamf q ely flinging spells intended to resnare ust mak ct otect him it might have been an accident it might have been the foolish simulacrum venturing into someones protected area or even bumbling into somethingdoing something as stupid as frightening a pet firebird any of those things could have killed it but as his spells battered against a new and powerful set of shields it became obvious that it had not been accident that killed the simulacrum it had been deliberate his plots had been discovered and later tries against starblade had proven just as fruitless the birdman had been well protected within shields that predated falconsbanes interference with the heartstone strong unflawed shields that he could find no way past now he passed within easy striking distance of the vale striking distance only if hed had that alliance with ancar of hardorn that he had feigned if hed had a dedicated corps of mages masters and adeptsand as he saw the shimmer of power above the vale he could only curse at his own impotence somehow some way someone within ksheyna had learned what he had done to starblade had surmised how he controlled the handsome fool perhaps it had been one of the adepts former lovers in retrospect it had been a mistake to force starblade to retreat into hermitlike isolation but he had been afraid that the new persona he had laid over the old would not withstand the scrutiny of close examination i should have let him keep his lovers should have had him employ some of the pleasuring techniques he learned at my hands that would have kept them quiet enough nothing stops questionings like unbridled lust and the exhaustion afterward it was too late now hed not only lost starblade hed lost the vale the birdmen were alert now there would be no subterfuge clever enough to bypass their protections and though weakened they were too formidable for him to take alone with luck the two outlanders and starblades son were on their way to the trap hed laid for them camped within the valley even now were a host of human servants garbed in the livery of ancar of hardorn led by one who was like enough to that monarch to be his twin and no illusion had been involved the conscript was already similar in height build and coloringthe same spells that sculpted changes into falconsbanes flesh had been used at a subtler level to reform this humans face there would be lingering traces of magic but that was what the outlanders would expect ancar was a mage after all once the outlanders were in place watching the rest of his army would take them from behind if i cannot have starblade i will have starblades son if i cannot take my vengeance upon the vale i can take it upon his sweet young flesh there would be that other young manmalleable possibly of some use as well certainly an entertaining bit of amusement likely to be a bargaining chip in some way and then there was the girl her potential as a mage was high she was curiously naive in some areas and that left her a wide range of vulnerable points for falconsbane to exploit it had been a very long time since hed broken a female adept to his will he was going to take his time with this one there would be no mistakes that wayand it would not incidentally prolong the pleasure as well he slid from shadow to shadow beneath the trees as surefooted and quiet as the lynx he had modeled himself for as keen of ear swift of eye and cunningnot even the birdmen the scouts and their soclever birds had ever caught him he had been wandering freely amid their woodlands since ksheyna first settled here and they never once guessed at his silent presence my fighters will take starblade and the outlanders and kill or catch the gryphons i hope they can catch them i want the satisfaction of killing them myself the deep hatred that always rose in him at the thought of gryphons choked his throat and made him grind his teeth in frustration no matter remote the memories of his other lives were that one was clear ear they had foiled his bid for supremacy in the magewars ower ruined his plans destroyed his kingdomqsts they were no more than jumpedup kof themselves as sentients equal to dependence how dared they ow dared they breed at all d reduce them to the position he would achieve the sweetest d irything that the wretched beast and worked for only then would i ndranon the black gryphon with snarling as he slipped through the cc doyot qj him ul you a he wants lust make underbrush without leaving so much as a footprint behind but most importantly i will have the children and through them i will not only control the node but have the downfall of the entire race in my hands through them i can spread a plague and a poison that will destroy the minds of any gryphon they meet and turn them into mere carnivorous cattle my cattle to use as i wish and it is time and more than time that i have that pleasure he entered the area of the ruins skirting the edge just within the cover of the forest the lair lay beneath the shadows of the trees in the morning though it enjoyed full sunlight in the afternoon this was the nearest he had been save for that one quick foray to place his hand and seal on the youngsters binding them to himself they cant have left the young ones alone without some form of protection there may be shields or some of the beastguardians he paused for a moment one deeper shadow within the shadows his spotted pelt blending with the dappled sunlight on the dead leaves beneath the trees with the mottled bark of the trunk beside him he wore scouting leathers very similar to what the birdmen wore that was one subterfuge that had stood him in good stead in the past if he was seen he had only to create a fleeting illusion of birdman features and other scouts would assume he was one of their number a quick glance upward showed him nothing was aloftnothing but what he expected two tiny specks hardly large enough to be seen circling overhead waiting that would do he set out a questing finger of magesight looking for what might have been left behind with the gryphon young a shimmering aura flickered about the lair in a delicate rainbow of protection but beneath the shimmera brighter glow of power the shields i knew ofyesand something morehe paused looked and looked again hardly able to believe his luck they had left the artifact behind to guard the young ones its protections were unmistakable and just the touch of them awoke avarice in his heart the agethe powerwomans power but there is little i cannot overcome and turn to my own usei must have this thing i must and they have left it for my taking elation faded replaced by cold caution perhaps the outlanders would be that foolish and even the gryphonsbut would darkwind the boy was a canny player surely he had left more protections behind than that for all that he had renounced magic falconsbane looked farther deeper into the ruins than he had ever bothered before looking for traps for any hint of magic even old or apparently inactive magic it was always possible that some ancient ward or guardian still existed here that darkwind had left armed against him but there were no signs of any such protections he looked farther still he had assumed that they knew by now what he had done to the young ones was it possible barely possible that they did not know of his hand on the gryphlets had he overestimated their intelligence their caution was it possible after all that they had been so caught up in what he had done to starblade and dawnfire that they had missed his sign and seal on their own young or could it be that the advent of the outlanders had distracted them no no that is why they left the artifact i am sure of it to protect the young against me the shields are too obviously set against my power even the shields of the artifact itself then just when he thought perhaps he was searching in vain for further traps he caught a hint of magicenergy a tremor of power old magic very old magic it was not active but the presence of magic that ancient attracted his curiosity anyway he had time to spare such potentials were worth investigating it was probably nothing perhaps some longabandoned shrine or an ancient talisman buried beneath a mound of rubble it might be worth retrieving at some point if only as a curiosity he moved in for a closer look halfclosing his eyes his talons digging into the bark of the tree beside him as he concentrated and he tore an entire section of bark from the tree trunk as his hand closed convulsively a gate no yes it couldnt be not the site of a temporary gate but one of the rare powerful permanent gatesno more than a handful of adepts at the time of the magewars had ever constructed permanent master gates they required endless patience vast expenditures of energy that could have gone into constructing armies and weapons those few who had done so had made a network of such gates all tied into one another crisscrossing their little kingdoms urtho had been one of those that was how the kaledain had survived the downfall of his kingdom to become the shinain and tayledrasthey had fled through the gate at the heart of his citadel to one on the edge of the area possibly even this one falconsbane had never built onenot in any of his lifetimes hed known of the network urtho had built of course but he had never once entertained the idea that even part of that network could still exist a gate even a master gate couldnt have survived the wars or the years could it it simply wasnt possiblefalconsbane could not ignore the proof of his own senses it was possible and the gate had survived the touch of it drove him wild with the desire to have it under his control the node the gryphons the artifact and now thishe had to have it he would have it then he would excavate it study it learn how to set itand use it use it to penetrate to the remains of urthos stronghold at the heart of the plains with a gate like this one he could bypass all the protections of the damned horselovers get in get what he wanted and get out with no interference he could go anywhere there was another permanent gate whether or not he knew the territory he could construct temporary gates no matter where he was and link into this one at any distance once he keyed it into himself working that way would drain only a fraction of the energy of an ordinary gatespell from him that was the deadly burden of gating the energy for the gate came from the mage or from someone tied to the mage with the kind of bond as deep as a lifebond not many knew that a mage tied by a lifebond to another mage could feed his beloved with the energies needed to fuel the gatespell fewer knew what falconsbane knew that there was another bond as deep as a lifebond the bond he built between himself and his victim when he made that victim an extension of himself as deep as a lifebond it had to be to survive the endless struggle of his victims to be free built out of both pleasure and pain at the most primitive instinctive levels it made his servants need him more than they needed food drink sleepthat opened all their resources to him to the point if needed that he could drain them to their death he could use those resources to open the gate and make it his in a way that no other adept ever had but firsthe had to make the area his and that meant retrieving and subverting the young gryphons to open up the node to his use right now there didnt appear to be anything in the way of that he released the trunk of the tree dropping bits of wood and bark as he shook his tingling hand and stepped cautiotsly out into the sunlight he kept to the shadows still there was no point in walking about in she had no chance to ask him what was wrong even as he rose to a halfcrouch falconsbane whirled and dropped to one knee arms outstretched hands palm out elspeths stomach knotted with fear darkwind uttered a strangled cry and rose to his feet flinging one hand protectively toward skif too late elspeth choked on a cry of horror as falconsbanes bolt of magic struck skif and threw him into the stones of a ruined wall and too late for cymry as well a second bolt struck her dropping her where she stood like a stricken deer elspeths horrified no was lost in the scream of pure hatred that tore the air like a jagged blade as skifs limp body dropped to the stones beyond cymrys it was nyara leaping in defense of skif who attacked her father with the only weapons at her disposal her claws and teeth her face a snarling animalmask of pain anguish and hatred he intercepted her in midleap and with a single blow of his powerful arm flung her across the open space to land stunned atop the largest of the young gryphons there was no time to wonder if skif and cymry survived no time even to think she bottled her fear her anger though they made her want to run to her old friends sideor run and hide the hawkbrother had joined in combat with the changechild adept and there was no turning back now elspeth joined her power to darkwinds feeding him with the raw energy she drew up from the node he knew how to use it she could only watch and learnfor when he tired it would be her turn to strike from the other side lances of fire rained down on falconsbane power pouring from the outstretched claws of treyvan with his mate backing him as she backed darkwind for a moment it was impossible to see the adept beneath the double attackand during that moment she dared to hope but then a shadow appeared amid the glare of powerthen more than a shadowthenpain she thought she cried out she certainly fell back a pace or two and covered her eyes with her upraised arm as darkwinds blast of power reflected back into their faces when she blinked her tearing eyes clear falconsbane stood untouched within a circle of scorched earth darkwind had taken the brunt of the blast on their side as had treyvan on the gryphons treyvan crouched with head hanging panting darkwind was on his knees beside her shaking his own head dazed and unable to speak falconsbane ignored the rest and concentrated his cold gaze on her her stomach turned into a cold ball of ice he smiled and she stepped back another pace her hand reaching for a sword she no longer wore palms sweating feeling the blood drain from her face well he said his voice full of amusement so you have some fight still i will enjoy breaking you outlander his eyes narrowed and his voice lowered to a seductive purr i will enjoy taking both your mind and your body not this day called a high voice in pure shinain from the ruins behind falconsbane falconsbanes head snapped around elspeth gathered her primitive clumsy power just in case this was nothing more than a ruse but there were people behind the adept perched atop rocks peering from behind walls an entire line of people blackclad one and all some veiled some not but all with the same cold implacable purpose in their iceblue eyes and one and all with drawn bows pointed at falconsbanes heart not this day nor any other darkwind coughed struggling to his feet elspeth gave him a hand and stood beside him helping him balance he did not look to be in any shape to enforce those brave words he swayed as he stood even with elspeths unobtrusive support and his face was drawn with pain but there were all those arrows pointed at falconsbane surely they had him nowdidnt they or did they after the first flash of surprise falconsbane straightened again and laughed sending a chill down elspeths back do you think me so poor a player then to show all my counters before the game is over elspeth did not even have a chance to wonder what he meant she had no idea of where the thing came from but suddenly it was dropping down out of the cloudsa huge black batwinged creature that seemed big enough to swallow her whole and have room for gwena afterward it buffeted her with its wings knocking her off her feet with a single blow then slammed her into a rockall the breath was driven out of her by the impact her head snapped back against the stone and she slid down it seeing stars she blacked out for a moment but fought back from the dark abyss that threatened to swallow her consciousness as she struggled back shaking her head and swallowing the bile of nausea falconsbane laughed again her eyes cleared that was when she saw that there were two of the things one of them had hydona trapped beneath it its talons on her throat ready to rip it out if she struggled she looked out helplessly as the creature drew blood and looked expectantly at its master then elspeth could only stare in horrorthe other had gwena in the same position darkwind lay in a heap just beyond her eyes closed unmoving treyvan faced the beast that had his mate with every feather and hair standing on end killlust making him tremble muscles rippled as he restrained himself from attacking and the stone beneath his talons flaked away in little chips from the pressure of his claws gwena she sent dont the companion shot back dont move dont anger it her mindvoice died to a whisper as the beast tightened its grip on her and little beads of blood stained her white coat under its talons dont do anything please stalemate i think falconsbane said genially the arrows of the shinain did not waver but neither did the archers loose them well then in that case i think i shall fetch what i came for hydona uttered a wail that was choked off by the brutal grip of the beast prisoning her treyvan seethed with rage eyes burning with fury it is not yours changechild said one of the shinain in a hollow voice that sounded as if it came up from the depths of a well it was not made by you it does not obey you it is not yours falconsbane lifted an eyebrow and halfturned to lash out with yet another bolt of power this one aimed at the young gryphons a flood of poisonous red no the cry was torn from elspeths throatbut from others as well one of those others was free to act nyara leapt to her feet her hands full of needs hilt holding it between herself and her father the bolt of power struck the blade instead of the young gryphons and built with an earshattering wail as need collected the blast and changed it from sickly red to burnished gold elspeths hea stopped as she watched not fully understanding what was happening but fearing the worst she heard darkwind utter something about transmuting and then he trailed off into a stream of what she guessed to be incredulous tayledras curses need split the sphere of power in two one half enveloping each young gryphon filling them with light falconsbanes scream of rage drowned elspeths gasp of joy but it could not stop what was happening the golden light burned away at a kind of shadow within the two youngstersthe shadows melted even as she watched melted and evaporated leaving them clean of its taint distracted by the light and their masters cry of outrage mornelithes dark beasts loosed their grip a little darkwind moved faster than a striking viper he whipped the climbingstick that never left him from the sheath on his back and hooked it into the beasts throat he never gave the creature a chance to realize what had happened he yanked the hook toward himself giving gwena the opening to kick and buck herself free of it as the creature tried to both right itself and disengage the hook that was tearing its flesh from inside the companion scrambled out of the way sides heaving legs trembling blood pouring from a dozen puncture wounds to collapse at elspeths feet the creature paid her no heed all of its attention was taken up with darkwind elspeth hovered protectively over gwena the companion was shaking like an aspen leaf in the wind but her wounds were already closing she leapt up to stand between gwena and the beast but there was no need for her protection she had wondered about darkwinds peculiar weapontool now she saw how an expert used it darkwinds face was contorted into a snarl of rage as he attacked the creature forcing it to go on the defensive the spiked end of the tool drove into an eye blinding the beast as darkwind backed it into a rock and it staggered he slashed in a broad flat stroke laying the beasts belly open and it fell forward to protect itself it screamed and darkwind reversed the stick hooking the beasts mouth and tearing at the tongue and lips it tried to buffet him with its wings screaming as its eye and mouth dripped thick brownish blood he simply hooked the membrane of the wings and tore them while he ducked under clawstrikes or fended them off with the spike every time there was an opening he darted in and stabbed again with the spike he wasnt yet doing the beast lethal damage but he had to be causing it a lot of pain it bled from a dozen wounds now and darkwind showed no signs of tiring screams of bestial pain from across the court made her dare a glance in that direction hydona bleeding but still full of fight stood defiantly between falconsbane and her children her wings were at full spread mantling over her young every feather on end treyvan clung to the back of the other beast trying to sever its spine each strike succeeding in removing a footlong strip of meat from its neck the creature screamed and tried in vain to throw him off leathery wings flailing no matter the gryphon was half this beasts size he was going to win treyvan was astride the beasts back even if it tried to roll his claws gouging deep and holding fast with its every swift move then moving upward as if he was walking up the things back like it was a rock driving deep holes in with every step and taking a clump of meat with him at every opportunity elspeth swallowed in surprise she had imagined what the gryphons fearsome natural weaponry could do but actually seeing it was another matter falconsbane seemed to be ignoring both the beasts his attention fixed on the shinain a moment later she knew why as a flight of arrows sang toward him only to be incinerated a few arms lengths away another scream in her ear reminded her that there was equal danger nearer at hand darkwinds beast was holding its own against him now and even regaining a little ground its one good eye mad with rage and fixed on its target even if treyvan won his contest he could still lose if this beast killed darkwind she had to help him somehowone good eyeshe acted with the thought dropped one of her knives into her hand from its armsheath aimed and threw as one of the beasts lunges brought that good eye into range it missed bouncing off the eyeridge the creature didnt even notice she swore and dropped her second knife as darkwind slipped on bloodslick rock and fell crap the beast lunged with snapping jaws managing to catch his leg in its teeth he screamed and beat at the beasts head with his stick trying to pry the jaws apart stabbing at the eye suddenly calm elspeth waited dispassionately for her target to hold still a momentand threw the creature let darkwind go throwing its head up and howling in agonyand instead of scrambling out of the way as elspeth expected darkwind lunged upward with the pointed end of his staff plunging it into newlyrevealed soft skin at the base of the things throat and leaning on it as hard as he could the creature clawed at the stick at him falling over sideways and emitting gurgling cries as he continued to lean into the point thrashing and trying to dislodge it from its throat all with no success darkwinds eyes streamed tears of pain and he sobbed under his breath but he continued to drive the point deeper and deeper it died breathing out bubbles of blood still trying to free itself across the stretch of scorched earth treyvan had clawed his way up his enemys back to the join of neck and spine as elspeth looked briefly away from darkwinds beast treyvan buried his beak in his foes neck and jerked his head once the beast collapsed beneath him treyvans battle shriek of triumph was drowned in falconsbanes roar of rage before anyone could move the adept howled again his eyes black with hate his hands rending the air as he clawed at it elspeth did not realize he was making a magical gesture until an oily greenbrown smoke billowed up from the ground at his feet filling the space between the ruined walls in an instant completely obscuring everything that it rolled over poison that was her first panicstricken thought as the cloud washed over her before she could scramble out of its path there was a hum of dozens of bowstrings as the shinain loosed their arrows but though the thick fetid smoke made her cough uncontrollably and brought tears to her eyes it didnt seem to be hurting her any she reached out a tentative mindtouch for gwena ill be all right came the weak reply dont move the nomads are still shooting and indeed she heard bowstrings sing and the hiss of arrows nearby but not a great deal else darkwind she called are you all right as well as may be lady he replied promptly pain filling his voice he coughed stand fast i am going to disperse this i have enough power for that at least a moment later a fresh wind cut through the fog thinning it in heartbeats blowing it away altogether as elspeth took in deep grateful breaths of clean air and knuckled her eyes until they stopped tearing she looked first for falconsbane he was no longer there but where he had stood were dozens of arrows stuck pointfirst into the earthand leading away from the place was a trail of blood that was all she had time to recognize in the next moment a surge of powerful energy somewhere nearby disoriented her for a moment she might have written it off as a spasm of dizziness had she not seen darkwinds face he stared off into the ruins his mouth set in a grim line he used the last of his energies to set a gatespell back to his stronghold the hawkbrother said bitterly shaeka he has escaped us chapter wenty five this isnt finished yet tension still in the air knotted her guts like tangled yarn and it wasnt just falconsbane either something was going to happen there was unfinished business herebut whose it wasshe couldnt tell the trail of blood ended in a little pool of the sticky scarlet directly in front of an archway in a ruined wall or so said the shinain who had followed it to its end there wasnt any reason for them to lie and although they did seem a bit too calm and detached for elspeths liking she assumed she could trust them darkwind apparently did he made no effort to see for himself but simply allowed the vale healer to continue working on him although his lips moved with what elspeth suspected were curses elspeth swore under her breath herself as she tested cymrys legs for any more damage than simple bruises and sprains skifs companion was suffering mostly from shock somehow between them the companion and darkwind had managed to shield skif and herself from the worst of falconsbanes blows that was nothing short of a miracle gwenas talonpunctures had been treated and would soon heal completely on their own she was in pain but it wasnt as bad as it could be and she said so skif was in the hands of one of the shinain the one who had introduced himself as the talesedrin shaman kraheera and who had seemed oddly familiar to elspeth skif had evidently suffered no worse than a cracked skull that would keep him abed until dizziness passed and several broken ribs that would keep him out of the saddle for a while he was unconscious but not dangerously so nyara had satisfied herself on that score even before elspeth and had taken a place by his side with need in her hands since the blades healing power was working on the catwornsins hurts and might well aid kraheeras efforts with skif if nyara managed to persuade the blade elspeth saw no reason to take it away from her she herself had gotten off lightly with scratches and cuts but darkwind and treyvan looked like badlybutchered meat when hyd na had flown limpingly into the vale to fetch help the vales own healer had timidly come out of protection to treat them and bandage them then had scuttled back to safety like a frightened mouse elspeth didnt think much of him oh his skills were quite excellentbut she didnt think highly of any healer who wouldnt stay with his patients until he knew they were well darkwind saw her thinlyveiled scorn though and hed promised an explanation it better be a good one the shinain were still searching the ruins for falconsbane though darkwind was certain that he was long gone out of reach and elspeth agreed with him of them all only the gryphons were happy despite wounds and pain somehow need had transmuted the power of falconsbanes magic into something that burned the little ones clean of his taint need might not think much of her own abilities compared with elspeths potential but darkwind was impressed transmuting was evidently a very rare ability the adults had taken the young ones to the lair and curled up in there refusing to budge unless it were direst emergency beside her darkwind leaned back against the rock supporting him and stared at the redshouldered hawk perched above the door of the lair her head up and into the wind her wings slightly mantled he looked haunted somehow as she studied his face elspeth thought she read pain and anxiety there though it was hard to tell what the hawkbrother was truly feeling but when he looked at dawnfire that was when the feeling of tension solidified its her thats what isnt finished she cant stay the way she isshe wrapped cymrys foreleg to add support and looked over at the bird herself dawnfirewhat were they going to do about her she was still trapped in the body of a bird even the shinain seem to feel sorry for heror something the shinain were returning from their hunt by ones and twos all of them gathering as if by prearrangement on the area below dawnfires perch all of them silent they seemed in no hurry to leave and elspeth mostly ignored them in favor of the task at hand despite the growing tension in the air even if something was about to happen there wasnt much she could do about it then cymrys nervous snort made her look up as far as she could tell all of the shinain had returned and now they were standing in a rough circle below dawnfire all but the shaman that is he had left skif and now knelt beside darkwind with an odd expression as if he were waitingthis is it this is what ive been feelingthis is the cause of all the tension and pressure were they glowing slightly or was that only her imagination there seemed to be a hazy dome of light covering them all one of the shinain a woman by the build finally moved kraheera grabbed darkwinds shoulders and physically restrained him from standing up as the woman put up a hand to dawnfire the bird stared measuringly at her for a moment then stepped down from her perch onto the proffered hand and the woman turned to face the rest like all the others this one was clad entirely in black from her long black hair to her black armor to her tall black boots but there was something wrong with her eyes something odd darkwind struggled in earnest against the shaman but he was too weak to squirm out of kraheeras hands be silent boy the shaman hissed at him as he continued to fight have you any life to offer her would you watch her fade before your eyes until there is nothing left of her elspeth paid scant attention to them concentrating instead on the blackclad woman who had taken dawnfire there was something very unusual about hera feeling of contained power elspeth felt the stirring of a kind of deeplyrunning energy she had never experienced before and found herself holding her breath the woman raised dawnfire high above her head and held her there a position that must have been a torment after a few moments and as she did so the entire group started to hum softly then increasing slowly in volume until the ruins rang with the harmonicsand dawnfire began to glow at first elspeth thought it was just a trick of the setting sun touching the birds feathers and making them seem to give off their own light but then the light grew brighter instead of darker and dawnfire straightened and spread her wingsand began to grow larger as well as brighter within heartbeats elspeth couldnt even look at her directly in a few moments more she was averting her face though darkwind continued to stare squinting into the light a look of desperation on his face the light from the birds outstretched wings was bright enough to cast shadows the blackclad shinain seeming to be shadows themselves until the bird appeared to be ruling over a host of shades the shinain shaman caught her staring at him he met her eyes then returned to gaze fearlessly into the light and seemed to sense her questions dawnfire has been chosen by the warrior he said as if that explained everything oh thanks now of course i understand i understand why a hawk is flaming brighter than any firebird i understand why darkwind looks as if hes at an execution what in havens is going on gwena looked at her as if the companion had red those thoughts its business she said shortly and not ours and i suppose thats going to tell me everything darkwinds eyes streamed tears and she longed to comfort him but she sensed she dared not not at this moment anyway the light was dying now along with the humming as she looked back toward the circle of shinain the bird on the female fighters fist was no longer a redshouldered hawk it was a vorcelhawk the emblem of the shinain clan talesedrin and the largest such bird elspeth had ever seen the light had dimmed in the birds feathers but it had not entirely died and there was an otherworldly quality about the hawks eyes that made her start with surprise then she recognized it the same look as the female fighters there were neither whites nor pupils to the womans eyes nor to the birdsonly a darkness sprinkled with sparks of light as if rather than eyes elspeth looked upon fields of stars that was when she remembered where she had heard of such a thing the chroniclesroalds description of the shinain goddess her mouth dried in an instant and her heart pounded if she was rightthis was a goddessand dawnfire was now her chosen avatar and at that moment she found she couldnt move she was frozen in place as a string of bridleless black horses filed into the clear area led by no one each going to a shinain and waiting the shinain mounted up quite literally as one and rode out in single file the woman and the hawk last heading for the path that wound around the ruins and led down into the plains those two paused for just a moment black silhouettes against the redgold sky sunlight streaming around them as they looked back darkwind uttered an inarticulate moan it might have been dawnfires name it might not then they were gone sunset did not bring darkness darkwind and treyvan used their magecraft to kindle a couple of magelights apiece and they all crowded into the lair right now no one wanted to face the night shadows darkwind looks as if hes lost not that i blame him he and dawnfire were were close whatever happened to her i have the feeling shes pretty well gone from his life wheres nyara skif said struggling to sit up the bandage around his head obscuring one eye right there elspeth glanced at the niche among the stones by the door that nyara had been occupying since the fight need on her lap only to find her gone and she didnt recall seeing the girl move darkwind glanced up at the same time on hearing skifs voice their eyes met across nyaras nowempty resting place i didnt see her leave darkwind began nor did i elspeth replied grimly and shes got my sword what do you mean your sword needs mindvoice asked testily the quality hollow and thin as if crossing a bit of distance elspeth had started to get to her feet she froze at the touch of the mindvoice and a glance at darkwind showed he had heard it too im not your sword elspeth im not anybodys sword i go to whom i choose and frankly child you dont require my services anymore youre a fine fighter a natural in fact youre going to be a better mage than i am and you are ridiculously healthy in mind and body nyara on the other hand a feeling of pity crept into the swords tone lets just say shes a challenge to any healer and if shes not going to fall back into her fathers hands i figured id better take an interest in her she needs me more than you ever would the mindvoice began to fade fare well child well see you again i think then it was gone elspeth stared at darkwind with a mingled feeling of relief and annoyance at least this meant there was one less thing to fight but shed gotten used to having the blade around to depend on id gotten used to itwell maybe she was right if what she told us was the truth she never let anyone depend on her powersdo you think the artifact will be strong enough to keep nyara out of his hands darkwind asked worriedly elspeth shrugged i dont know she was strong enough to turn falconsbanes spell against him darkwind nodded slowly his face was in shadow so that elspeth could not read it but she had the feeling he was somehow at war within himself as if he was both relieved that nyara was gone and regretting the fact then he moved a little and the cold light showed a look of such naked loss and loneliness that elspeth looked away unable to bear it she turned to skif instead who was still trying to sit up nyara he said fretfully squinting at her he was doubtless experiencing double vision and a headache bad enough to wish he were dead wheres nyara is she all right needs taking care of her elspeth told him giving him the bare truth shes fine satisfied he stopped trying to fight his way into a sitting position and permitted her to feed him one of the herbal painkillers she had picked up in katashinain shortly after that he was snoring and she looked up to find darkwind gone as well taking his thoughts and his pain into the night she hugged her knees to her chest and waited for a while but he did not return finally she went to bed where she lay for a long time listening to skifs druginduced snores and the young gryphlets making baby noises in the next room it was a long night darkwind returned to the gryphons lair late the next morning it had been a long night for him as well and it had ended with a morning session of the council of elders he had found himself in the odd position of council leader he was not certain he liked it virtually anything he thought to be a good idea would be adopted at this point when his credit was so high with the rest of the elders but how was he to know whether what he wanted was going to be good for the rest of the vale especially where these outlanders were concerned but he wanted them to stay although he was tired heartsore and uncertain of many things of that much he was sure he found the young woman outside the lair taking advantage of a cool breeze and a chance at last to rest in the open without fear of attack she rose on seeing him and he made idle talk for a moment before finally coming to the subject falconsbane is gone perhaps for good your sword is no longer with you i can and will direct you to a teacher among the vales and ksheyna is not likely to be a comfortable place to live for a while so what is it you would do now he asked refusing to meet elspeths eyes there is no need for you to stay she set her chin stubbornly you promised to teach me magic are you going back on that promise no he replied slowly is this wise perhaps notbut i am weary of being wise but does the council want us to leave she looked very unhappy at that idea he rubbed his hand across his tired eyes was it only she thought there would be opposition that she would have to fight without an advocate if she went to another vale no not at all he said wearily noit isi thought perhaps you and skif skif isnt going to leave here unless you force him to she told him bluntly its that simple he cant travel any time soon and after that she shrugged he may go home he may decide to stay thats up to him nyaras out there somewhere he may decide to try to find her and personally i think he will but i plan on staying if youre still willing to teach me i am he replied soberly but i must warn you that i have never taught before and you are a dangerous kind of pupil you come late to this and you wield a great deal of power very clumsily she bristled a little i havent exactly had a chance to practice she retorted i dont think youll find me unwilling to work or too inflexible to learn i too will be a kind of pupil he reminded her i have not used my powers in a long time i shall have to relearn them before i can teach you but it is easier for two than one and my friends are few enough elspeth has become one she shrugged if you dont care i dont what i do care about is that you can teach me as quickly as i can learn i dont have a lot of time to spend here dark thoughts shadowed her face he guessed they were thoughts of home and all that could be taking place there he softened a little understanding those worries only too well if you will give me your best i will give you mine he replied she met his eyes at last i never give less than my best she said he glanced at the slumbering skif out of the corner of his eye not even to him he asked a little cruelly but unable to help himself you must know yourself strengths and weaknesses before you dare magic i gave skif my best she replied instantly without a wince it just wasnt what he thought he wanted hes still my friend he nodded satisfied and rose holding out his hand to her in that case lady gather your things again this time she did wince why did you change your mind just now about throwing us out she sounded a little desperate no he stared at the forest for a moment wondering again if he was doing the right thing but he was doing something and his heart told him it was right and that was infinitely better than doing nothing no no elspeth he replied after a moment tasting the flavor of the strange name and finding he liked it i have not changed my mind as soon as you are ready i will have skif brought to the vale and conduct you there myself he turned toward her and found himself smiling at the look of complete surprise she wore you have succeeded in winning a place where no outlander has been for generations he clasped her forearm in his hand searching in her eyes for a moment then speaking to her softly as council leader of vale ksheyna i offer you the sanctuary and peace of the vale i offer you the honor and responsibility of the clan if you will take it i give you the name elspeth ksheyna kvaldemar somewhere overhead a forestgyre called his approval as he rode the winds watching over the forest for vrees bondmate had begun his healing at last authors note just as the companions are not horses as we know them so the tayledras bondbirds are not hawks and falcons they have been genetically altered to make them larger more intelligent telepathic and far more social than any terrestrial bird of prey the real thing bears the same resemblance to a bondbird as a german shepherd does to a jackal the ancient art of falconry can be thrilling and enjoyable but the falconer must be prepared to devote as much or more time to it as he would his job the birds must be fed trained and exercised every day without fail and frequently will not permit anyone but their handler to feed them for the most part the falconer must make all his own equipment and in order to obtain the licenses for his sport he must pass a lengthy federal examination and the facilities for his bird must pass a federal inspection the licenses themselves must be obtained from both the federal and state governments all native birds are protected species and possession without a permit is subject to a federal fine as well as confiscation of the bird the apprentice falconer is only permitted to train and fly the redtailed hawk or the kestrel north american sparrowhawk and must do so under the auspices of a master this is not a hobby to be taken on lightly nor is it one that can be put in a closet on a rainy day or if the falconer doesnt feel well that day for the most part birds of prey are not capable of affection for their handler and the best one can expect is tolerance and acceptance falconers speak of serving their bird and that is very much the case for this is a partnership in which the bird has the upper hand and can choose at any moment to dissolve the relationship and fly away and frequently she does just that falconers are singlehandedly responsible for keeping the population of north american peregrine falcons alive they were the first to notice the declining numbers the first to make the connection between ddt and toofragile eggshells and the first to begin captive breeding programs to save the breed from extinction they are intensely involved in conservation at all levels and are vitally interested in preserving the wilderness for all future generations
