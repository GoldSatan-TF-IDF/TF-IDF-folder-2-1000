the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy by douglas adams some notes about this script first i think it would be wise to tell you that im not a native english speaker and therefore my spelling might just be off at some times if you do happen to find a typo dont hesitate to mail me about it also with this being a transcript of a radio show you cant expect me to catch every single word spoken by every single person if you think you know what someone is saying when im not sure about it do mail me about that too this indicates a sound effect this indicates something im having trouble hearing correctly or something i dont really know how to spell this indicates that ive inserted an explanation or a small note about something episode presenter the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy by douglas adams starring peter jones as the book with simon jones and the book this is the story of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy perhaps the most remarkable certainly the most successful book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of ursa minor more popular than the celestial homecare omnibus better selling than fiftythree more things to do in zero gravity and more controversial than oolon colluphids trilogy of philosophical blockbusters where god went wrong some more of gods greatest mistakes and who is this god person anyway and in many of the more relaxed civilazations on the outer eastern rim of the galaxy the hitch hikers guide has already the great encyclopedia galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom because although it has many omissions contains much that is or at least wildly inaccurate it scores over the older more pedestrian work in two important ways first it is slightly cheaper and second it has the words dont panic inscribed in large friendly letters on the cover to tell the story of the book its best to tell the story of some of the minds behind it a human from the planet earth was one of them though as our story opens he no more knows his destiny than a tea leaf knows the history of the east india company his name is arthur dent he is a sixfoot tall ape decendant and someone is trying to drive a bypass through his home prosser come off it mr dent you cant win you know look theres no point in lying down in the path of progress arthur i got off the idea of progress its overrated prosser but you must realise that you cant lie in front of the bulldozers indefinitly arthur im game well see who rusts first prosser im afraid youll gonna have to accept it this bypass has got to be built and it is going to be built nothing you can say or do arthur why is it got to be built prosser what do you mean why is it got to be built it is a bypass youve got to build bypasses arthur didnt anyone consider the alternatives prosser there arent any alternatives but gee why didnt you make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time arthur appropriate time prosser yes arthur first i knew about it was when a workman arrived at the door yesterday i asked him if he had come to clean the windows and he said hed come to demolish the house he didnt tell me straight away of course no first he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver then he told me prosser look mr dent the plans have been available in the planning office for the last nine months arthur yes i went round too find them yesterday afternoon you hadnt exactly gone out of your way to pull much attention to them have you i mean like actually telling anybody or anything prosser the plans were on display arthur ah how many avarage members of the public are in the habit of casually dropping around the local planning office in the evening its not exactly a noted social venue is it and even if you had popped in on the off chance that some raving buereucrat wanted to knock your house down the plans werent immediatly obvious to the eye were they prosser that depends where you were looking arthur i eventually had to go down to the cellar prosser thats the display department arthur with a torch prosser the lights had probably gone arthur so had the stairs prosser well you found the notice didnt you arthur yes it was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying beware of the leopard ever thought of going into advertising prosser its not as if its a particularly nice house anyway arthur i happen rather to like it prosser mr dent arthur yes hello prosser have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if i just let it roll straight over you arthur how much prosser none at all the book by a strange coincidence none at all is exactly how much suspicion the apedecendant arthur dent had that one of his closest friends was not decended from an ape but was in fact from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of betelguese arthur dents failure to suspect this reflects the care with which his friend blended himself into human society after a fairly shaky start when he first arrived fifteen years ago the minimum research he had done had suggested to him that the name ford prefect would be nicely inconspicuous he will enter our story in thirtyfive seconds and say hello arthur the apedecendant will greet him in return but in difference to a million years of evolution he will not attempt to pick fleas off him earthmen are not proud of their ancestors and never invite them round to dinner ford hello arthur arthur ford hi how are you ford fine look are you busy arthur well ive just got this bulldozer to lie in front of otherwise no not especially ford theres a pub down the road lets have a drink and we can talk arthur dont you understand prosser mr dent were waiting arthur ford that man wants to knock my house down ford well he can do it whilst youre away cant he arthur but i dont want him to ford well just ask him to wait till you get back arthur ford ford arthur will you please just listen to me im not fooling ive got to tell you the most important thing youve ever heard ive got to tell you now and ive got to tell you in that pub there arthur why ford because youre gonna need a very stiff drink now just trust me arthur ill see what i can do it had better be good hello mr prosser prosser yes mr dent have you come to your senses yet arthur umm well can we just assume for a moment that i havent prosser well arthur and that im going to be staying put here till you go away prosser so arthur so youre going to be standing around all day doing nothing prosser could be arthur well if youre assigned to standing around doing nothing all day you dont actually need me here all the time do you prosser umm no not as such arthur so if you can just take it that im actually here i could just slip off down to the pub for half an hour how does that sound prosser umm that sounds umm well very resonable i think mr dent im sure we dont actually need you there for the whole time we can just hold up the confrontation arthur and if you want to pop off for a bit later on i could always cover for you in return prosser oh oh thank you yes yes that would be fine yes very kind of you mr dent very kind arthur and of course it goes without saying that you dont try and knock my house over while im away prosser oh good lord no mr dent arthur you think we can trust him ford myself id trust him to the end of the earth arthur yes but how fars that ford about twelve minutes away come on i need a drink the book by drink ford prefect meant alcohol the encyclopedia galactica describes alcohol as a colorless volatile liquid formed by the fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effect of certain carbonbased life forms the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy also mentions alcohol it says that the best drink in existance is the pan galactic gargle blaster the effect of which is like having your brains smashed out with a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick the guide also tells you on which planets the best pan galactic gargle blasters are mixed how much you can expect to pay for one and what volentary organisations exist to help you rehabilitate ford six pints of bitter and quickly please the worlds about to end barman oh yes sir nice weather for it care to watch the match this afternoon sir ford no no point barman conclusion you reckon sir arsenal without a chance ford no its just that the worlds going to end barman ah yes so you said lucky escape for arsenal if it did ford no not really barman there you are sir six pints ford keep the change barman what from a fiver thank you sir ford youve got ten minutes left to spend it arthur ford will you please tell me what the hell is going on ford drink up youve got three pints to get through arthur three at lunchtime ford time is an illusion lunchtime doubly so arthur very deep you should send that in to the readers digest theyve got a page for people like you ford drink up arthur why three pints ford muscle relaxant youll need it arthur did i do something wrong today or has the world always been like this and im been too wrapped up in myself to notice ford alright ill try to explain how long have we know each other arthur arthur five years maybe six most of it seemed to make some kind of sense at the time ford alright how would you react if i said that im not from guildford after all but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of betelguese arthur i dont know why do you think its the sort of thing youre likely to say ford drink up the worlds about to end arthur this must be thursday i never could get the hang of thursdays the book on this particular thursday something was moving quietly through the ionosphere miles above the surface of the planet but few people on the surface of the planet were aware of it one of the six thousand million people who hadnt glanced into the ionosphere recently was called lady cynthia fitzmilton she was at that moment standing in front of arthur dents house in cottington many of those listening to her speech would probably have experienced great satisfaction to know that in four minutes time she would evaporate into a whiff of hydrogene ozone and carbon monoxide however when the moment came they would hardly notice because they would be too busy evaporating themselves cynthia fitzmilton i have been asked to come here to say a few words to mark the beginning of work on this very splendid and worthwhile new bypass and i must say immidiately what a great honor and a great privilige i think it must be for you the people of cottington to have this gleaming new motorway going through your cruddy little village i am sorry your little country village of cruddy cottington i know how proud you must feel at this moment to know that your obscure and unfound hamlet will now arise reborn as the very splendid and worthwhile cottington service station providing welcome refreshment and sanitory relief for every weary traveler on his way and for myself it gives me great pleasure to take this bottle of very splendid and worthwhile champagne and break it against the noble of this very splendid and worthwhile yellow bulldozer arthur whats that ford dont worry they havent started yet arthur oh good ford its probably just your house being knocked down arthur what ford it hardly makes any difference at this stage arthur my god it is what the hell are they doing we had an agreement ford let them have their fun arthur damn you and your fairie stories theyre smashing up my home stop you vandals you homewreckers you ford arthur come back its pointless hell id better go after him barman quickly can you just give me four packets of peanuts barman certainly sir here you are twentyeight pence ford keep the change barman are you serious sir i mean do you really think the worlds gonna end this afternoon ford yes in just over one minute and thirtyfive seconds barman what isnt there anything we can do ford no nothing barman well i always though we were to lie down and put a paper bag over our head or something ford if you like yes barman well will that help ford no excuse me ive got to find my friend barman oh well then last orders please arthur you barbarians ill sue the council for every penny its got ill have you hung and and and whipped and boiled and then ill chop you up into little bits until until until you had enough ford arthur dont there isnt time get over here theres only ten seconds left arthur and then ill do it some more and when im finished ill take all the little bits and ill ill jump on them and ill carry on jumping until i get blisters or i think of something even more unpleasant to do to you and then ill arthur what the hells that ford arthur quick over here arthur what the hell is it ford its a fleet of flying saucers what do you think it is quick youve got to get hold of this rod arthur what do you mean flying saucers ford just that its a vogon constructor fleet arthur a what ford a vogon constructor fleet i picked up news of their arrival a few hours ago on my subetha radio arthur ford i dont think i can cope with any more of this i think ill just go and have a little lie down somewhere ford no just stay here keep calm and just take hold of this vogon captain people of earth your attention please this is prostetnic vogon jeltz of the galactic hyperspace planning council as you are no doubt aware the plans for the development of the outlying regions of the western spiral arm of the galaxy require the buliding of a hyperspace expressroute through your star system and regrettably your planet is one of those scheduled for demolishion the process will take slightly less than two of your earth minutes thank you very much vogon captain theres no point in acting all surprised about it all the planning charts and demolishion orders have been on display at your local planning department in alpha centuri for fifty of your earth years so youve had plenty of time to any formal complaints but its far to late to start making a fuss about it now vogon captain what do you mean youve never been to alpha centuri oh for heavens sake mankind its only four lightyears away you know im sorry but if you cant be bothered to take an interest in local affairs thats your own energize the demolishion beams god what the heck does he say here bloody planet ive no sympathy at all ford i bought some peanuts arthur what ford if youve never been through a matter transference beam before youve probably lost some salt and protein the beam shouldve your system a bit how are your feeling arthur like a military academy bits of me keep on passing out if i asked you where the hell we were would i regret it ford were safe arthur oh good ford were in a small galley cabin in one of the spaceships of the vogon constructor fleet arthur ah this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that i wasnt previously aware of ford ill have a look for the light arthur alright how did we get here ford we hitched a lift arthur excuse me are you are you trying to tell me that we just stuck out our thumbs and some bugeyed monster stuck him head out and said hi fellows hop right in i can take you as far as the basingstoke roundabout ford well the thumbs an electronic subetha device the roundabouts at barnards star six lightyears away but otherwise thats more or less right arthur and the bugeyed monster ford its green yes a little mistake here arthur never said the monster was green in the first place but in the book he does arthur fine when can i go home ford you cant ah i found the light arthur good grief is this really the interior of a flying saucer ford it certainly is what do you think arthur well its a bit isnt it ford what did you expect arthur well i dont know gleaming control panels flashing lights computer screens not old matrasses ford these are the dentrassi sleeping quarters arthur i thought you said they were called vogons or something ford the vogons run the ship the dentrassi are the cooks they let us on board arthur im confused ford here have a look at this arthur what is it ford the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy its a sort of electronic book itll tell you everything you want to know thats its job arthur i like the cover dont panic its the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody said to me all day ford thats why it sells so well here press this button and the screen will give you the index youve got several million entries so fastwind through the index to v there you are vogon constructor fleets enter that code on the tabulator and read what it says the book vogon constructor fleets here is what to do if you want to get a lift from a vogon forget it theyre one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy not actually evil but bad tempered bureucratic vicious and they wouldnt even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal without orders signed in triplicate sent in sent back queried lost found subjected to public inquiry lost again and finally buried in soft for three months and recycled as firelighters the best way to bet a drink out of a vogon is stick your finger down his throat and the best way to irritate him is to feed his grandmother to the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal arthur what a strange book how did we get a lift then ford well thats the point its out of date now im doing the field research for the new revised edition of the guide so for instance i will have to include a revision pointing out that since the vogons have made so much money being professionally unpleasant they can now afford to employ dentrassi cooks which gives us a rather useful little loophole arthur who are the dentrassi ford the best cooks and the best drinks mixers and they dont give a wet slap about anything else and they will always help hitch hikers on board partly because they like the company but mostly because it annoys the vogons which is exactly the sort of thing you need to know if your an hitch hiker trying to see the marvels of the galaxy for less than thirty altarian dollars a day and thats my job fun isnt it arthur its amazing ford unfortunately i got stuck on the earth for rather longer that i intended i came for a week and was stranded for fifteen years arthur but how did you get there in the first place ford oh easy i got a lift with a teaser you dont know what a teaser is ill tell you teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do they cruise around looking for planets which havent made interstellar contact yet and buzz them arthur buzz them ford yes they find some isolated spot with very few people around then land right by some poor unsuspecting soul who no one evers going to believe and then strot up and down in front of him wearing silly antannae on their head and making beepbeep noises rather childish really arthur ford i dont know if this sounds like a silly question but what am i doing here ford well you know that i rescued you from the earth arthur and what has happened to the earth ford its been disintegrated arthur has it ford yes it just boiled away into space arthur look im a bit upset about that ford yes i can understand arthur so what do i do ford you come along with me and enjoy yourself youll need to have this fish in your ear arthur i beg your pardon arthur what the devils that ford listen it might be important arthur what ford its the vogon captain making an announcment on the pa arthur but i cant speak vogon ford you dont need to just put the fish in your ear come on its only a little one arthur eeeuuggh vogon captaintime message repeat this is your captain speaking so stop whatever youre doing and pay attention first of all i see from our intruments that we have a couple of hitch hikers aboard our ship hello wherever you are i just want to make it totally clear that you are not at all welcome i worked hard to get where i am today and i didnt become captain of a vogon constructor ship simply so i could turn it into a taxi service for degenerate freeloaders i have sent out a search party and as soon as they find you i will put you off the ship if youre very lucky i might read you some of my poetry first secondly we are about to jump into hyperspace for the journey to barnards star on arrival we will stay in dock for a seventytwo hour refit and no ones to leave the ship during that time i repeat all planet leave is cancelled i just had an unhappy love affair so i dont se why anyone else should have a good time message ends arthur charming these vogons i wish i had a daughter so i could forbid her to marry one ford you wouldnt need to theyve got as much sex appeal as a road accident and you better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace its unpleasantly like being drunk arthur why whats so unpleasant about being drunk ford you ask a glass of water arthur ford ford yes arthur whats this fish doing in my ear ford translating for you look under babel fish in the book arthur what an extraordinary book ford help me write the new edition arthur no i want to go back to earth again im afraid or its nearest equivalent ford youre turning down a hundred billion new world to explore arthur did you get much useful material on earth ford i was able to extend the entry yes arthur now lets see what it says in this edition then ford okay arthur lets see e earth tap out the code theres the page it doesnt seem to have an entry ford yes it does see right there at the bottom of the screen just under eccentrica gallumbits the triplebreasted whore of eroticon six arthur what there oh yes the book harmless arthur harmless is it all its got to say one word harmless what the hells that supposed to mean ford well there are a hundred billion stars in the galaxy and a limited amount of space in the book and no one knew much about the earth of course arthur well i hope that you managed to rectify that a little ford yes ive transmitted a new entry out to the editor he had to trim it a bit but its still an improvement arthur what does it say now ford mostly harmless arthur mostly harmless ford well thats the way it is were on a different scale now arthur okay ford im with you im bloody well coming with you were are we now ford not far from barnards star its a beautiful place and a sort of hyperspace junction you can get virtually anywhere from there ford that is assuming that we actually get there arthur whats that ford well if were lucky its just the vogons come to throw us into space arthur and if were unlucky ford if were unlucky the captain might want to read us some of his poetry first the book vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the universe the second worst is that of the of kria during a recitation by their poetmaster grunthust the flatulent of his poem ode to a small lump of green putty i found in my armpit one midsummer morning four of his audience died of internal and the president of the midgalactic artsnobling council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off grunthust was reported to have been disappointed by the poems reception and was about to embark on a reading of his twelvebook epic entitled my favourite bathtime gurgles when his own major intestine in a desperate attempt to save humanity leapt straight up though his neck and throttled his brain the very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator paul niel millen johnstone of redbridge in the destruction of the planet earth vogon poetry is mild by comparison and when the vogon captain began to read it provoked this reaction from ford prefect ford nnnnhhhhggghhhh the book and this from arthur dent arthur nngghh nnaaaaghhh vogon captainsee if i dont yes i know he recites more of the poem but right now i dont want to sit and listen to every word he says and i dont have the book here right now expect to see more in a future update vogon captain so earthlings i present you with a simple choice i was going to throw you straight out to the empty blackness of space to die horribly and slowly but there is one was one simple way in which you way save yourselves now think very carfully for you hold you very lives in your hands now choose either die in the vacuum of space or tell me how good you thought my poem was the book will our heroes survive this terrible ordeal can they win through with their integrity unscathed can they escape without completely compromising their honor and artistic jugement tune in next week for the next exiting installment of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy presenter in that episode of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy peter jones starred as the book simon jones was arthur dent and ford prefect bill wallace was prosser and the vogon captain with jane candal as lady cynthia fitzmilton and david as the barman the program was written by douglas adams and produced by simon with the assistance of patty kingsland at the radiophonic workshop and a small furry creature from the crab nebula arthur i quite liked it really the imaginery was really particularly effective and the metaphysical
