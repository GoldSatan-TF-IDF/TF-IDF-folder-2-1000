allan mallinson the sabres edge the bay of bengal the commanderinchief can hardly persuade himself that if we place our frontier in even a tolerable state of defence any very serious attempt will be made by the burmans to pass it but should he be mistaken in this opinion he is inclined to hope that our military operations on the eastern frontier will be confined to their expulsion from our territories and to the reestablishment of those states along our line of frontier which have been overrun and conquered by the burmese any military attempt beyond this upon the internal dominions of the king of ava he is inclined to deprecate as instead of armies fortresses and cities he is led to believe we should find nothing but jungle pestilence and famine the adjutantgeneral of the presidencys army to the government of bengal november part one jungle pestilence and famine chapter one the wooden walls the rangoon river noon may sileeence the gundeck of his majestys ship liffey at once fell still the big fourth rate had furled sail dropped anchor and beat to quarters and her first lieutenant would have the gun crews silent to hear the captains next order astern of liffey were the sloops of war larne slaney and sophie their guns likewise run out and trained ashore and astern of these with great pyramids of white sail still set was the rest of the british flotilla close on a hundred menofwar and transports sailing slowly with the tide up the broad brown rangoon river the stockades at the waters edge were silent too like the gun crews aboard the warships the burman soldiers crouched behind their wooden walls but teakbuilt walls not oak with their spears and ancient muskets they had no doubt that the whitefaced barbarians would pay for their effrontery in sailing up the river without acknowledging the supreme authority of king bagyidaw lord of the white and all other elephants on liffeys quarterdeck commodore laughton peto turned to majorgeneral sir archibald campbell general officer commanding the burmese expeditionary force well sir archibald they have had their time peto but the commodore required a more emphatic order firing first on an almost defenceless town was not a decision to be entered lightly you wish me to commence firing sir before the general could reply the shore battery erupted in smoke and flame two or three heavy shot whistled harmlessly through liffeys rigging the general was obliged but amazed his flotilla had violated the sacred waters of the kingdom of ava but in such force that could not be resisted he sir archibald campbell kcb veteran of the peninsula had offered suitable terms of surrender by all the usages of war the burmans should have accepted at once presumption and folly he declared snapping closed his telescope commence firing peto nodded to his first lieutenant commence firing the lieutenant raised a speaking trumpet to his lips fire hervey started the roar of cannon was like nothing since waterloo fourteen twentyfourpounders firing as one nearly the weight of shot that the whole of the horse artillery could dispose that day along the ridge of mont stjean he gripped the taffrail as if he would be shaken off his feet but before the smoke rolled back over the quarterdeck he just managed to glimpse the destruction that the broadside had wrought the guns in the shore battery toppled and the great teak doors of the stockade beaten down there was another broadside this time from larne and even closer to the bank not as heavy as liffeys but almost as destructive it battered down yet more of the stockade the ninepound shot from the guns on her upper deck firing high and sending showers of bricks and tiles from the buildings within hervey did not think the business could take much longer now sidneys and sophies guns were bearing on the walls and soon too were those of the east indiamenofwar astern of them so that there was a drumroll of fire as the crews worked their pieces like demons no the burmans could not take a pounding like this for much longer no one could campbell agreed he turned to the little knot of staff officers behind him how our work might have been easier in spain eh gentlemen had we been able to sail our artillery about so and had the enemy been so obliging as to call a pile of logs a fortress said hervey to himself major seagrass the generals military secretary turned to his temporary assistant where are these war boats of yours hervey hervey nodded he had warned of them albeit from limited experience and the flotilla was taking particular precautions against surprise it seems our luck is great indeed and the burmans too for those boys yonder are bruising for a fusillade he indicated the lines of red at the gunwales of the transports private men and sepoys alike in their thick serge muskets trained ready to repel the war boats the attack would be a swift swarming affair if it did come the general judged it the moment signal the landing a midshipman had the signalflag run up in a matter of seconds there was cheering from the transports audible enough even with the crashing broadsides soon boats were being swung out and lowered or hauled alongside by their tow lines and redcoats began descending to them as they began pulling for the bank fire erupted once more from the battery liffey answered at once and there was no more firing from the stockade the landing parties scrambled from the boats and raced for the breaches they exchanged not a shot and soon there was more cheering as the union flag rose above the shore battery campbell saw his success called off the bombardment and ordered the rest of his force to follow in half an hour two brigades were ashore with still not a musket discharged by either side later the general would learn that not a man of his had been so much as grazed and he would remark again on the address with which battle could be made with artillery such as he had he turned now to the little group of officers on liffeys quarterdeck well he said with a most satisfied smile his thick red sidewhiskers glistening with sweat in the clammy heat of the season before the monsoon lets be about it we have a great need of beef and water and it is there ashore for the taking my boat please commodore peto captain matthew hervey had watched many an infantry action in his dozen and more years service but always from the saddle the quarterdeck of one of his majestys ships was undoubtedly a more elevated vantage point and perhaps preferable in that respect but it was no less frustrating a place for an officer to be when there was hot work to be done with the enemy but then the only reason he was able to observe the action at all was that he had a friend at court or more exactly on the supreme council of the presidency of bengal who had arranged that he join the expedition on general campbells staff the general being clearly of a mind that there was no place for cavalry on this campaign indeed the general had planned his operations certain that everything would be accomplished by his infantry kings and companys with the sole support of the guns of the royal navy and without any transport but that which floated or supply other than obtained locally it was by any reckoning an admirably economical expedition herveys regiment his majestys th light dragoons had been scattered about bengal on countless trifling errands these past three years frustrating to officers and men alike they had hoped to be employed against this impertinent king of ava who threatened the honourable companys domain insulted the crown and boasted of his invincibility but it seemed that nowhere on the eastern frontier were their services required especially not in this coup de force by which it was calculated that the burman king would at once capitulate no their value to the company which after all paid the crown handsomely for their services in india lay in their ability to be fast about hindoostan in the event of trouble the commanderinchief would not easily be persuaded therefore to tie down a single troop of kings cavalry that constituted his meagre reserve and so with the prospect of further months of tedium before him any diversion had seemed attractive to hervey even as assistant to an officer who himself had little to do but it had truly been an unexpected delight to learn that his revered friend peto had the naval command not that in other terms hervey had been ill content with the years since chittagong chittagong had been an affair indeed of real cavalry daring if through country wholly unsuited to the arm and we shall shock them that had been his intention and how they had cavalry and guns appearing from the forest like chinthes routing the burman invaders and burning their war boats yes he had hazarded all and the sixths reputation in calcutta had been made and he had watched his troops star continue to rise afterwards he had taken real pleasure in advancing several of his men though he had had occasion more often to shed a tear when the fever or some such had claimed one of them the regiments corner of the cemetery in the calcutta lines now held the bones of more dragoons than any single troop could muster above all however the regiment was at ease with itself that was their colonels doing sir ivo lankester may have been an extract but he had his late brothers blood in his veins and never did the sixth have a finer officer than sir edward lankester until they had had to bury him at waterloo and the regiment was no less handy for being at ease for sir ivo managed somehow to have the best of them always without recourse to any more rebuke than he might for an inattentive hound it was said that he had only to look pained for the hardest of sweats to feel shame and only to smile for the same to believe they were as good as chosen men he had returned to england for his long leave two months before and he had done so with utter confidence the major eustace joynson for whom sick headaches and endless returns had been the miserable order of the day under the previous colonel was now modestly selfassured sir ivo knew that joynson would always err on the side of kindness and that since the troop captains and lieutenants and the noncommissioned officers were all sound enough a right judgement would be reached in those things that mattered most one of those judgements had indeed been to permit hervey his attachment to the generals staff despite having almost nothing to do hervey had from the outset found the appointment fascinating for it allowed him a seat at the generals conferences albeit in an entirely attendant capacity he had thus been privy to the plan of campaign throughout almost its entire evolution it was like all good plans in essence simple the governorgeneral lord amherst was of the opinion that it would be necessary only to occupy rangoon the countrys great trading port for the king of ava to lose courage and ask for terms and that the burman people in their condition of effective slavery to king bagyidaw would welcome the british as liberators thereafter it would be an easy enough business to sail the four hundred miles or so up the irawadi to ava itself and take it opposed or otherwise even the timing was propitious for the rainy season was soon to begin and the river would thereby be navigable to commodore petos flotilla furthermore since this was to be a maritime indeed a riverain expedition there would be no need to embark the transport required to maintain the army it was altogether a very thrifty way of making war and general campbell was justly pleased with the speedy accomplishment of the first part of his design pleased and relieved for he had provisioned his force only for the crossing of the bay of bengal and there had been delays now he had the better part of eleven thousand mouths to feed and the sooner they were ashore the sooner they could begin buying beef and water hervey beckoned to his coverman to get into the cutter before him besides the sailors at the oars they were the only occupants of the generals two boats not wearing red they settled towards the bow and hervey took off his shako then mopped his forehead and fastened closed the front of his tunic did you see anything of the cannonade no sir said lancecorporal wainwright grimacing i was helping bring shot my ears are still ringing mine too said hervey looking at his watch it was not yet one oclock pull called the midshipman and a dozen oars began ploughing the flat brown water of the rangoon river in not many minutes they were grounding on the shallow slope of the bank in front of what remained of the great teak gates of the stockade no need even for wet feet tidy files of redcoats kings and companys alike marched ahead of them with sloped arms as if at a field day hervey jumped from the boat wondering if his misgivings had been wholly unfounded after all eyre somerviles misgivings rather for it had been his friend at court who had voiced them first his own doubts could be only those concerning the military arrangements although in truth these he found worrying enough somervile had been convinced that the greatest peril lay in king bagyidaws selfdelusion the third in council of the bengal presidency had his own sources of information in ava which told him that the king was surrounded by sycophants and believed all their blandishments about the invincibility of the burman soldier indeed somervile had learned that the king had not even been told of herveys spoiling raid at the headwaters of the chittagong river three years before that instead the king believed it had been the hand of nature that had laid a torch to his boats for no barbarian could set foot on avan soil without the authority of the lord of the white and all other elephants and anyway did not he bagyidaw have the greatest of generals maha bundula to pit against an impertinent invader eyre somervile was therefore of the decided opinion that the fall of rangoon would merely presage a long and arduous campaign and he was by no means convinced either that the burman people would welcome the invader as a liberator why indeed should they if they too believed that maha bundula would throw him back into the bay of bengal whence he had come and if that were to happen death would follow automatically for anyone who had in the least part aided the invader eyre somervile after years of study and years of practical business did not believe for one minute that a single burman would risk his neck in the companys cause but this landing at rangoon was so easy the resistance so lacking in spirit that perhaps thought hervey somervile had given too much credence to his admittedly wellplaced agents there were things he must see for himself and quickly if you have no direct need of me sir he said to his principal as matteroffact as he could i should like to make a reconnaissance of the town of course hervey of course replied major seagrass distracted general campbells military secretary had somehow contrived to be the only member of the staff to get his feet wet and was trying to rid his boots of water therell be scarce enough for one of us to do till the headquarters are open hervey had used the military term to describe his intended survey of the town and it was certainly the case that he had a military purpose to his perambulation but in truth he was just as curious to see the sights of the fabled seaport of the burmans by all accounts some of its temples were singular very well then sir i shall report back by sunset at the latest he saluted and made away before seagrass could have second thoughts corporal wainwright unclipped his carbine and took a cartridge from his crossbelt pouch he bit off the end tapped a little powder into the priming pan then poured the remainder down the barrel dropped in the ball from between his teeth and rammed it home with the swivel rod hervey noted with satisfaction that it was done in mere seconds just in case sir said wainwright feeling it necessary to explain the precaution even with so many redcoats abroad hervey smiled grimly dont be too sure that youll draw the charge corporal wainwright the burmans may have fled but i doubt theyll count themselves beaten there were so many infantrymen about the streets however even if the burmans counterattacked hervey thought they must be repulsed before they could get a footing on the stockades but in fleeing before the bombardment they had made a good job of leaving little for the comfort of the invader house after house was empty of portables the heavier furniture was broken up and hervey was further disquietened by the evident system with which it had been accomplished it spoke of a discipline that might be turned to good effect against an invader it was evidence certainly that calcuttas assumption of cooperation was wholly illconceived as he made his way past groups of infantrymen waiting for the serjeants to allocate a billet at least they would have a roof over their heads when the rains came hervey began to fear the worst that the rice stores and granaries had been emptied too and the cattle driven into the jungle he tramped the town for an hour it proved an unlovely place with few buildings of any solidity and aspect even the official ones in the wake of the redcoats he saw not a house whose doors or windows remained barred but neither did he see a man with anything more valuable in his hands than an iron cooking pot or a pan here and there a buddhist shrine would impress as much by the gilded contrast with its surroundings as by any true merit and from time to time he would catch sight of the soaring pagoda of shwedagon a league or so to the north rising above the squat meanness like st pauls above the rookeries of the city i would lay odds that yonder place will be a regular hornets nest said hervey to wainwright as they climbed a wall to get a better view ill warrant thats where theyve bolted with the treasury there was shooting still sporadic shots from the redcoats searching the streets but it did not trouble him he knew they were aimed not at the enemy but at obstinate locks it had been the same every time they had captured a place in spain it took a while always for the officers to regain order hot blood the exhilaration of being alive after the fight the prospect of a bit of gold the certainty of finding something to slake a thirst that was all it was but it could be brute enough when it ran unchecked for too long at least he would not see the worst of it today for there had been no fighting to hot the blood no long march beforehand only the wretched clammy heat of the day they pressed on several much smaller pagodas bore the signs of the infantrys passing ah this looks worthier said hervey stopping at one of them as resplendent id say as any of the shrines around calcutta except of course its all sham he prodded at the gold leaf with his sabre in calcutta it would be marble instead of this teak and the inlay wouldnt be glass evidently our redcoated friends thought little of it the pillaging seemed to have consisted in dashing all the lattices to the floor and then being disappointed to find that the imagined rubies and emeralds became so many cheap shards hervey sighed to himself hed seen a lot worse the prussians for one after waterloo they had been thoroughly wanton in their destruction but knocking down even gaudy pagodas was hardly the way to win the hearts of the burman people let alone their active support and support was what general campbells plan of campaign depended on he just hoped the officers would have their men in hand soon but solid enough sir said wainwright having made his own assessment of the structure he pointed to the roof look at that an iron shot from one of the broadsides was embedded in a joist it had not fully penetrated but had somehow caused the wood to splinter on the inside hervey had heard peto speak of the especial danger in teakbuilt menofwar unlike oak peto said a teak splinter invariably meant a septic wound he had been most insistent on it most insistent that while the indies might be a place of sickness for the soldier the sailor faced his trials too many would be the trials in this campaign right enough hervey sheathed his sabre and took off his shako you know corporal wainwright it is one thing to enter the roads of a seaport and bombard the town many a captains done that but its quite another to sail upstream for all of five hundred miles when the degree of resistance is uncertain corporal wainwright had been a dragoon for nearly five years and had worn a chevron for two of them hervey held him in particular regard not least because he was recruited from his own town but more so because of his thoroughgoing decency and unwavering sense of duty he reminded him of serjeant strange yet without that fine ncos somewhat chilly piety hervey had made him his covering corporal at the first opportunity well it couldnt be less resistance than here sir it was true that the defenders of rangoon had been scarcely worth the name so far but was the town defensible against so powerful a cannonade as that which petos ships had delivered at pointblank range hervey sat down on the pagoda steps and loosened his collar but what does the disappearance of every living soul and all their chattels and livestock bode corporal wainwright had not been on campaign he had tramped through the jungle three years before with herveys troop to fire the burman war boats but that was a mere raid scarcely comparable in military organization with the scale of this expedition this indeed was war nevertheless he could make a fair estimate one way or another sir were going to be here longer than we thought hervey nodded he knew from peninsula days that general campbell could make battle but he had no idea if he could make war what he had seen so far not least the delays even in getting to rangoon was not auspicious well corporal wainwright he said taking a draw on his canteen i think that it is a show of resistance and we might expect more i think the battalions had better get this place into a state of defence quickly lest the burmans counterattack our menofwar wouldnt be able to support them it may well be why the burmans abandoned the town as if in response to herveys assessment redcoats of his majestys th foot now came doubling past except that things werent quite right hervey sprang up come on corporal wainwright theres the glint of gold in those eyes more men rushed by without ncos almost knocking wainwright to the ground or liquor sir either way itll be trouble they drew their sabres wainwright lashed out with the flat of his to check the barging of another gaggle this time from the thirteenth hold hard dont you see the officer he bawled they took off after the thirtyeighth hervey cursing the narrow ways between the houses were soon choked with men some without their muskets then it was impossible to go any further wainwright clambered onto the roof of one of the more solidlooking houses to try to see ahead he was down again as quickly bringing a shower of tiles with him and a foul string of abuse from the infantrymen below drink sir theyre tossing bottles of it out of a warehouse there must be two hundred men there at least well we cant do anything of ourselves where are their ncos hervey turned and began pushing his way past men still homing on the irregular issue always the same he snarled using his own sabre freely to force his way through and these not even irish down one of the side streets they found a picket of the fortyfirst in good order the corporal came to attention where is your officer asked hervey raising his sword to acknowledge the colonel is only just in there sir replied the man in a pronounced welsh accent indicating an officiallooking building with a highcanted roof the picket officer as just been round sir hervey nodded and sheathed his sword then made for the battalions headquarters the fortyfirsts colours were hanging from a window with a sentry close to i am captain hervey of general campbells staff i should like to speak to your colonel hervey touched his shako in reply to the private mans butt salute sir the sentry turned and went inside hervey shook his head between the fortyfirst and the thirtyeighth and for that matter the thirteenth there was nothing to choose as a rule they were all steady on parade he had seen it with his own eyes in calcutta but once the ncos had lost their hold the adjutant came out hatless captain hervey he made a small brisk bow the colonel is with the brigademajor may i assist you theres a riot towards the north gates began hervey indicating the general direction the thirteenth and the thirtyeighth two companies and more arriving and no sign of their officers theyve found a drink store the adjutant did not hesitate serjeantmajor out came the shortest regimental serjeantmajor hervey had ever seen shorter even than private johnson yessah theres a riot of the other two battalions summon the picket sah til have the reserve company under arms at once captain hervey but the picket a stitch in time hervey was not certain he understood i dont think a picket will be the rsm reappeared his eyes blazed as he struck the palm of his hand with the silver knob of his cane right sah the picket a dozen men were already falling in the rsm was impatient for the off twenty years in a red coat told him that indiscipline was contagious and he was not about to have his welshmen tempted from military virtue by intemperate roughs from other regiments follow me corporal jones double march hervey had no choice but to take the lead a curious sight they made a captain and a lancecorporal of light dragoons doubling through the alleyways of rangoon with a dozen redcoated infantrymen in file behind them muskets at the high port and the diminutive rsm at their head but the stitch was not in time enough to prevent the drink from doing its worst when they reached the warehouse there was hardly a man on his feet and those that were staggered hatless and without their muskets lord deliver us said the rsm holding up his cane to halt the picket what in the name of god have they got inside them he seized a canteen from the hand of one of the capering privates and sniffed it brandy he poured what little remained to the ground the thirteenths private objected very foully corporal jones stepped forward and felled him with a butt stroke to the chest stand up you men bellowed the rsm jabbing his cane here and there officer present they were too far gone they neither knew nor cared about their delinquence right growled the rsm if thats the way it is to be picket fix bayonets hervey had a moments doubt but there seemed no alternative more men were appearing with every minute all in search of their dues the rsm began pushing through the mob of redcoats shouting orders cursing lashing out with his cane while to his left and right a single file of bayonets marched ready to do the worst if anyone should resist with more than abuse hervey and corporal wainwright with his sabre drawn followed as best they could they reached the source of the intoxication for the cost of a mere three further men succumbing to the muskets butt the point of the bayonet had only been threatened and the rsm had still not drawn his sword hervey marvelled at the mans selfpossession and resolve by his reckoning there were the best part of three hundred soldiers about the streets in abject disorder yet the rsm seemed no more perturbed than if he were stepping between two brawlers in a barrack room right corporal jones two men on the doors then get inside and clear them out sir shouted the corporal turning to look at the picket morgan and jonessevenseven on the doors the rest of you inside with me of all the things them burmans took sir and they have to leave brandy behind said the rsm rapping his hand again with the cane hervey shook his head i shouldnt be surprised if they left it for the purpose sarntmajor its halted more men than their muskets have that is true sir a european merchant do you suppose probably hes doubtless taken to the jungle with the rest of them i hope he had more sense than to try to guard his stock it took fifteen minutes to secure the warehouse and another thirty to have the comatose occupants carried out the rsm pressing disappointed new arrivals to the task only then did officers and ncos from the offending regiments begin arriving it seemed that this was not the only brandy warehouse though hervey was past caring what had detained them one of the lieutenants told him plaintively that liquor had gone about the ranks faster than hed ever seen hervey could believe it it was no excuse but it happened when the taut discipline of going into action was suddenly let down when ncos their eyes on other things for the moment lost their firm grip of the ranks it was no more than a horse let off the bit surprising its rider with a nap except here it was getting on for a whole battalion off the bit hervey saw smoke rising above the rooftops beyond the warehouse he thought the redcoats better left to their own and set off instead with corporal wainwright to investigate the source they felt the heat even before they saw the flames hervey now alarmed began running to see what had taken hold almost every building hed seen was made of wood and the streets were so narrow there would be nothing to check the spread of the fire a few sepoys were doing their ineffectual best but there was yet no organized attempt shall i get the rsm again sir asked wainwright seeing the sepoys willing but without means hervey saw a havildar and then a lieutenant no i think the native battalion will have to cope better return to general campbells headquarters and report ill warrant hell have no notion how perilous things are in this part of the town it took a long time to reach headquarters the streets and alleyways were a press of men some fully under discipline some imperfectly some not at all smoke kept barring progress and from time to time flames for the fire was spreading aloft and others had been started as carelessly as the first when hervey finally arrived at his destination the customs house close by the main gates and begged leave to report he found the general in a deal of agitation and his face the colour of his red sidewhiskers what in gods name is going on campbell spluttered staring at the smoke now filling the sky over the northern part of the city what are the brigadiers about hervey told him as much as he knew the general looked fit to burst however his staff colonel appeared with news that relief was at hand sir i have just learned that commodore peto seeing the fires has ordered ashore as many of his and the other ships men as possible to our assistance hervey allowed himself a smile at the thought of the choice words with which peto would have given his opinion of affairs on land but it was peto through and through as prompt to take action as any man in the service general campbell turned to his colonel get me the brigadiers he rasped by the sound of things we stand close to being burnt out and the burmans could put half the brigades to the sword if theyd a mind not for the first time did hervey find himself making unfavourable comparisons between the wooden world and the ranks of red and he had no doubt that peto was at this very moment doing likewise chapter two against the tide that evening f lowerdew poured two glasses of madeira he offered the silver tray first to hervey and then to his captain before peto dismissed him with his customary nod well a damned sorry start to a campaign said the commodore when his steward had gone half the men ashore drunk and incapable of standing to their posts and all the signs of a country as hostile as any other thats invaded hardly half the men peto i grant you the native troops may be in good order but ive a thousand hands and marines ashore doing others duty therell be no relief for those in the guard boats tonight its certainly dark enough for the burmans to get alongside agreed hervey its not the war boats that trouble me but fire boats the tides still running out they could run them down all too easily and itll be the best part of tomorrow before we have the boom finished hervey grimaced there was no doubting the havoc that fire boats would wreak for a topman could very nearly climb from ship to ship cthe generals sent pickets for a mile upstream they ought to be able to raise the alarm at least peto took another sip of his madeira we must believe it but i am already uneasy about what campbell intends next i assume the native provision will remain elusive but that he will march on ava nevertheless in which case how does he expect me to supply him with both banks of the river in hostile hands how may i risk a merchantman up or down without escorts and i have not the ships hervey thought peto uncommonly downcast after all here was the man who but six or seven years ago had sailed the frigate nisus up the godavari until there was nothing beneath her keel and had then dismounted her guns and sent them in boats to the aid of his friend you have the ships to force the river to ava though have you not four hundred miles hervey four hundred and i have but one steamer just imagine it hervey could memories of the peninsula had not faded with the years i dont suppose it would be any easier to stretch a line of communication here than the french found in spain and there at least to begin with the people supported them peto nodded there should have been warning enough in what was learned these twenty years past in holland folly to embark on an expedition in the hope of a country turning its coat cbut now we are come i dont see that the general has any choice but to go to ava peto refilled their glasses and shook his head nor i but as soon as the burmans learn what were about theyre bound to bring back every last man from arakan and assam thered be the very devil of a job fighting through them all campbells only course is to make lightning work of the advance do you see any prospect of that hervey frowned it has been an inauspicious beginning let us say but in fairness these are early days we wasted enough of them at andaman looking for beef and water ive never heard of an army that marched without provisions before you know began hervey measuring what he had to say as if not completely certain of it himself eyre somervile told me the commanderinchief and the governorgeneral had disagreed very profoundly over the campaign i had not heard but then why should i ive met with paget only once and that was to present my compliments the governorgeneral i have never set eyes on hervey looked surprised this was their first opportunity for intimacy since the expedition had got under way and he had imagined peto might have had at least some say in events it seems the reason for our expecting the populace to rise is that lord amherst had intelligence from ava to the effect that king bagyidaw would at once lose heart if we took rangoon it would appear that bagyidaw knows all too well that his officials so oppress the people they would see us as come to lift their yoke so to speak perhaps they believe their yoke is easy compared with what a foreigner might bring on them what was pagets opinion general paget was convinced that operations should be directed principally towards securing chittagong he believed the burmans were best punished then by striking from the sea it doesnt seem to amount to any great difference as far as we are concerned at this moment there was a distinct note of disdain in petos voice i do despair of our great men at times they show so little propensity to think a matter through they seem always to think it somehow sufficient for the navy to put ashore redcoats and that by that very act there will be fearful trembling at the heart of the enemys enterprise i blame pitt he was forever breaking windows with guineas hervey merely raised his eyebrows peto knew his mind in these matters without need of words i should say that it is too somerviles opinion and he i think sees the whole very well peto shook his head despairingly so it seems we have embarked on a strategy which may already be turning turtle he rose to fetch a chart from the table then sat down again and began peering at it we descend upon ava from the sea so to speak because we cannot do so from land and we bring no provisions or transport with us because consequent on the taking of rangoon the populace will not only desist from interfering with our progress upstream but supply us with all our material needs as my ships take the army to gain its object hervey raised his eyebrows again the course of petos logic was evident rangoon is burned and the populace driven off and the irawadi will need clearing with the bayonet to enable my ships to reach ava i count that a major reverse in design hervey could only nod and of course to give us every facility in the venture the expedition is timed so that the rains which begin any day will swell the irawadi to enable my ships to make easy progress peto laid down the map shaking his head and looking as sad as he was angry you and i know those same rains will fix the army here in rangoon the countryll be turned to swamp ill warrant even amherst would want to rethink his stratagem if he were to think through these little matters he smiled but wryly i concede however that these are early days still hervey found himself in an unusual position he was a mere observer of events however all his instincts demanded still that he took his commanders view and that required that he forgo too much criticism and look for advantage instead let us see what the day brings rain will at least make the country equally impassable to the burmans you must hope so said peto he sipped his madeira in a way that spoke to hervey of the chalkandcheese difference in their fighting milieus but i shall want the general to take the offensive upstream tomorrow for we have to have all the burman boats burned within a league i cannot sit here beyond another day you may take that message ashore with you if you will it might be best if you were to impress it upon campbell in person peto shook his head again no ill not go ashore when theres the threat of fire boats ill see him early in the morning and we can agree on what support i can lend him i take it hell want the rest of the divisions landed im sure of it hervey made to rise peto rose with him and clapped a hand on his arm im sorry you will not stay longer it is very good to see you though i could wish for better circumstances hervey smiled ours are not professions that would prosper in better circumstances indeed no and i had at one time thought i should never get a command again once bonaparte was put in his box should we not still be saying god rest his soul then peto returned the smile perhaps it will be an unquiet one otherwise for sure thank you for my dinner i have a premonition of its being the last of any substance or quality for some time not if you can find reason to come aboard my ship i assure you flowerdew brought hervey his cape by the way said peto his smile turning wry again i did not say how very active and smart your corporal seems a considerable improvement on your private johnson hervey remembered the first time his groom had presented himself to petos ship almost ten years ago no one would have declared him a model of military bearing i could not bring the two of them and johnsons place is properly with the chargers but i suspect i shall miss his resource peto came on deck just before dawn the officer of the watch touched his hat but said nothing it was not his place to extend even a greeting without invitation and had he been sure of which side the commodore wished to stand he would have quitted his place at once to take the other peto looked quickly about searched the heavens to see what they revealed of the coming rains then went to the starboard rail there was the faintest glow in the sky above the jungle the sight was not new to him but he was fascinated still in another ten minutes the sun would rise and the creatures of the earth would begin the drama of another day unseen unseen but noisy and here in the indies there was no leisurely beginning as in temperate parts no lengthy overture in which to settle to the change to come it was night and then it was day at full throat peto watched wondering he thought for a moment of the sunrise in his native norfolk of the times as a boy he had slipped out of his fathers vicarage to run the mile or so to watch the sun come up over the grey waters of the north sea he had been so many years in his majestys navy could he ever imagine himself on land again he shivered though the air was warm enough it was not the thought of the land itself so much as the want of companionship there for his family were few and he had never taken a wife indeed he had scarcely been in the habit of speaking to a woman beyond what was necessary for courtesy except perhaps herveys sister he had spoken of elizabeth with hervey at dinner not much for their preoccupations had been the here and now but he had praised her calling her a woman of spirit and discernment to which hervey had replied that she was greatly more than that worthy though the description was she had devoted herself wholly to familial duties not least indeed the care of her own niece her brothers child she made sacrifices that were humbling to contemplate and peto had been moved to hear it as well as in truth disheartened by the degree of nobility it spoke of he looked over his shoulder towards the stockaded town it was dark now where last night it had been ablaze fires by night always looked worse than they were he turned to the officer of the watch has there been gunfire at all he asked so abruptly that the lieutenant half stammered his answer none that i have heard these past two hours sir and there was none reported on my relieving mr afflick peto made no reply merely turning back to watch the eastern sky so hervey had had a peaceful night too maybe these were early days after all maybe the populace had taken to the forest in fear for their lives and would return as soon as the invaders showed themselves benevolent maybe the burman soldiers had no fight in them when it came to facing regular troops maybe they had fled the ranks peto sighed there were altogether too many maybes hervey too was awake in the early hours general campbell had given orders for the th foot to be landed and to make ready for a sortie from the stockades at first light the general had not been idle he had applied his mind to the situation his brigadiers had reported and had become convinced that the shwedagon pagoda was the rallying point for the burman defenders major seagrass had not objected when hervey had asked if he might accompany the eightyninth and so he now stood with corporal wainwright next to the two ensigns carrying the regiments cased colours waiting for the gates at the northern end of the stockade to be swung open he was not greatly apprehensive for like the eightyninth he was only too glad to be unconfined at last on the other hand he was at a loss to know why the general had not ordered a reconnaissance during the night it was but normal practice after all someone had said the reason was that the fires would have lit up anyone moving outside the stockade but the flames had been doused by three oclock and the pagoda was little more than a league distant the commanding officers orders had been straightforward the battalion would advance in column of route by companies the light leading and in double time for the first mile or until contact with the enemy was made in the cool of the dawn doubling would be no hardship on meeting the enemys pickets the light company would deploy to skirmish and the others in column of companies would take the position with the bayonet the men looked eager even on a breakfast of biscuit and rum corporal wainwright had spoken to several of them as they formed up it seemed there were many irish that some had fought on the niagara frontier a decade before but for the most part the battalion had not been shot over i have never marched in a regular advance by infantry said hervey looking about him at the novel order i dont think i care for it much in truth sir replied corporal wainwright unclipping the carbine from his crossbelt you cant see anything in these ranks just the man in front it was true although in the dark there was little enough to see beyond the man in front yes said hervey drawing on his gloves from a horse theres a good view of things and a troop of them now would be worth their while that is for sure the great gates at last swung open commanding voices front and rear animated the ranks company atteenshun trail arms hervey took up his sabre scabbard company will advance by the front double march the battalion company in front set off as one an impressive feat thought hervey since breaking off at the trot was always a ragged affair with cavalry colour party double march barked the senior ensign the two ensigns and their serjeantescorts took off in step with number one company colours now uncased and at the slope the commanding officer and serjeantmajor to a flank and hervey and wainwright to the rear hervey found it surprisingly easy to keep time serjeants called out continuously and with such authority that to break step would have required a marked will he had not marched to a serjeants command since joining the depot troop as a newminted cornet straight from school there was something of a comfort in it no need at all to think but that was the purpose of drill was it not to make a man act as if he were a machine oblivious to all else and hervey for one was pleased to be relieved of the need to think too much this morning he had slept little there had been a continual coming and going at general campbells headquarters during the night and at one stage there had been a general alarm with reports that burman soldiers were observed creeping up on the stockade from the west but it had proved false and then there had been another alarm when one of the bamboo cottages near the headquarters had burst into flame for no reason that the sentries could see it had been past four oclock by his reckoning when he had at last fallen into a good sleep only to be woken by corporal wainwright at five with tea and a bowl of hot shaving water exactly as private johnson had instructed after five minutes the companies changed to quick time and sloped arms prudently thought hervey for the eastern sky was now lightening he had walked these paths before so to speak the affair at the river three years ago how determined he had been to time the moment of the attack perfectly with the appearance of the sun above the jungle canopy almost a ritual it had been like the sun rising at the stone circle on the great plain at home in wiltshire it was curious how marching freed the mind to wander how many hours more would they have to wait in wiltshire before this same sun rose on them and how did it rise on his daughter did it fall directly on her or did it light her room only indirectly did she wake to see it did she fear the dark when it was gone how strange not to know the answers to such simple questions but it had been five years almost since last he had seen her her first letter he carried in the pouch of his crossbelt along with henriettas likeness though he had taken neither from their oilskin in a year the sky was heavier than that day at the river there was rain to come they all knew it but when he looked back towards the town a pall of smoke hung over the greater part of it and mean as the place was he thought it as sorry a sight as at badajoz or vittoria or any other of the spanish towns that had fallen prey to the revels of the drunken soldiery in their celebration of victory the duke of wellington had cursed the army often enough the sixth not excepted for being too drunk to follow up victory and usually the men had resented it officers too they had had to make long wearying marches they had had to fight desperately they had lost friends they thought they had earned their rowdy ease not since waterloo had hervey been surrounded by so many redcoats and even that day he was first amidst his own regiment and at the very end in their van it felt different from being in ranks of blue yet their common bond was discipline the prime requirement of an army for without it no other quality was guaranteed could it really be the lash that guaranteed these mens good order were the eightyninth and for that matter every other battalion of infantry of the line so different from his own the sixth abhorred the lash they had abhorred it since before he had joined they took it as a point of pride that a dragoon was animated by something more noble than fear of a flogging but the duke had always supported the lash and his judgement had been long in the forming and tested in the worst circumstances he held that without it all the lesser punishments could not have effect who would bear to be billed up but for the fear of a stronger punishment hervey had once heard him say he would knock down the sentry and walk out and had he not heard many a man in the old light division say that crauford had flogged them through the mountains to vigo and that had he not done so they would never have got there but how far would men acknowledge that the lash kept them alive when the going became desperate and did general campbell have the determination to see the expedition through to ava as black bob crauford had seen the retreat through galicia company will break into double time double march in another five minutes there was but a halfmile to go and it was light enough to make out shwedagons soaring dome hervey thought it unlikely that the burmans would have abandoned it unless they had no intention at all of fighting its like pissproud pat of a sunday morning came a voice from the ranks behind a welter of reproach followed from an nco dye think therell be much gold serjeant came another voice stick to the drink mick you wont have to carry it as far he cant hold on to either for long came yet another voice from the ranks hervey smiled the banter was not so very different from the sixths though he did not doubt the capacity for riot in the eightyninths wild irish ranks it was as well that its ncos brooked no disorder there was a shot then half a dozen others a couple of hundred yards ahead it was difficult to tell hervey felt the momentum check just a fraction then came the shouting quick time and the companies breaking from the double march serjeants barked out the step left right left right pick it up the ensigns raised the colours the commanding officer took off for the front of the column runners began coming and going the thrill of action flashed through the ranks like a quickmatch it would have been the same in the sixth thought hervey but perhaps more so here for the ranks were tighterpacked the men shoulder to shoulder rather than knee to knee skirmishers out he heard the order ripple along the column and then a bugle he didnt recognize the call supposing it must be for the light company if they were deploying it couldnt be many minutes before the battalion companies did the same number one company halt company will incline left left incline company will form right at the halt right form it took less than a minute for number one company to change from column of route to face front in two ranks and with no more seeming effort than if they had been on parade and this in spite of the semidarkness and the broken ground with ball cartridge load the best part of a hundred men reached as one into black leather pouches to take out a greased paper cartridge they bit off the end poured a little of the powder into the pan of the musketlock closed it emptied the remainder down the barrel spat in the oneounce ball of iron pushed in the paper tube and rammed it home with a clattering noise like a mill full of flying shuttles then up came the east indiapattern muskets to the port even after so many years hervey found himself awed by the drill rough men these unlettered for the most part the sweepings of the gutters yet they worked like the wellturned mechanism of a fine watch he could feel the swagger in the drill the pride and confidence in what each man was about as if he were saying there was no one better at this no company better no battalion better and certainly no army the th foot well to the left of the line had no royal lace to distinguish the regiment only green facings like many another but the th prince of wales irish counted themselves second to none and neither burman nor monsoon would stop them getting to ava if that was the generals command it would have been the same too had the battalion been the th foot or the st indeed it would have mattered not what number was worn on the pewter buttons or the blackened trotters except to the men who wore them hervey smiled to himself the drill would be the same anywhere along the line and the spirit no less so company will fix bayonets fix bayonets more clattering then sudden silence shun number one company stood stiffly at attention no man dared move a muscle lest it bring the withering rebuke of an nco it was a moment that could not long hold neither was it meant to it was just the captains final check before the off that he had his men in hand as a dragoon might bring his horse up sharp onto the bit before pressing him forward to a gallop company shouldeer arms the line seemed to sway eager to be on with it though not a foot moved poort arms by the right quick march it would be full light in not many minutes hervey strained to see their objective as they struck off but too many shakos stood in his way there had been no more firing it didnt surprise him the shots came from the outposts for sure theyd done their job raise the alarm then fall back he wondered how many cannon the burmans had and how close theyd let the battalion come before putting the slow matches to the touchholes but he didnt suppose there was a man afraid nor even for a moment anxious as soon as the burmans fired the battalion would give them a volley and be in on them with the bayonet before they could reload a ball might take a head off and grape might tear through flesh and bone but there was nothing anyone could do about it so there was no point in having a care of it but there was no thunder of cannon nor rattle of musketry only the sudden command at the double and then they were running again faster this time not quite charging speed he imagined but definitely faster still he could not see where they were doubling to only the dome of the pagoda itself a couple of hundred yards away in no time they had closed the distance without another shot and officers and ncos were shouting orders for sections and halfsections to follow up the steps to the pagoda itself or to either side of its balustrades or to beat out the cover to right or left or to search the shrines that lined the great maidan at the bottom of the steps they went at it like harriers into kale hervey saw relief and disappointment in equal measure in the faces around him the prince of wales irish did not load with ball cartridge here except to discharge it at a live target they had discharged shot enough at practice ones these several past years but at least there were not the screams of fallen comrades to heed could there be such contradictory feelings in any other craft for his part hervey had no particular desire to blood his sabre again nor to discharge the pistol that was lodged in his belt his only thought was what this peculiar absence of resistance portended he came upon the commanding officer a man not much older than he who wore an expression of both determination and perplexity what in gods name is going on hervey they had first met at vittoria a dozen years before when each mans sword had been red for there had been no doubt what they were meant to be doing that day i cannot say colonel but there seem to be only two possibilities indeed sighed the eightyninths man ramming home his sword in its scabbard and i wonder how long we shall have to wait to discover which its to be theres a degree of confusion so far that i havent seen since corunna the captain of the light company came up and asked for orders to which the colonel replied that his men should beat towards the jungles edge it was exactly as hervey would have done i fancy the answer will only be found in there sir he said as the captain made off ci think sooner or later the general shall have to send patrols some way into the forest to see if the burmans make a stand or no ay sighed the colonel and it wont be easy but first campbell had better strike upstream for if the burmans mount any sort of attack along the river well be at sixes and sevens and fire boatsll be giving yonder commodore a deal to think about too ill warrant sir was all hervey thought it necessary to say for they were but commodore petos own strictures of the night before well this place has the makings of a decent billet at least said the colonel beckoning over his adjutant come merrick let us have a look inside that pagoda before alltofts men do it any great injury hervey smiled again here was the dry humour of one who sat permanently atop a powder keg an officer whose easy victory might yet turn to ruin at the hands of the same men who had delivered him the prize and shwedagon was a place where riot even on a small scale would not do a religious site of prominence of some grandeur indeed the general would certainly want to see it in one piece no doubt the colonel was half disbelieving in his good fortune in not having had the battalion ashore when the brandy was flowing hervey wondered how the eightyninths discipline would hold now they were no longer in close order how active were the subalterns how true were the corporals once in spain he had seen an entire company fire its muskets at the windows of an empty palace rather than draw the charges the smashing of every pane seemed to give satisfaction to men denied a shot at the french and gilded carvings and finials were an awfully tempting target now there was more shouting preseeent arms hervey looked about to see what the sudden fuss was and saw general campbell coming up with colonel macbean commander of the madras brigade the general looked pleased and well he might thought hervey yesterday had been one of mixed honours at best and this mornings work was a model of method and celerity by comparison general campbell raised his hat to the saluting muskets the guns will be up with you within the hour ireson he said eyes twinkling his red whiskers as bright as his coat this without doubt is the key to rangoon hold on to the pagoda ireson and any attack on the town must falter very good general said colonel ireson sounding matteroffact the colonels luck was indeed great thought hervey what any man would do to be in a position of the first importance though he wondered why the burmans must attack from the north through shwedagon but he had not seen a good map and he supposed the general had the general had certainly not seen him until that moment ah hervey what brings you here major seagrass had no need of me general and you had a mind to see how infantry work well you might sir well you might i imagine this campaign shall go down as the first to be made without benefit of cavalry hervey checked himself indeed sir the generals novelty knew no bounds it was already a most singular campaign having no transport or supply yes indeed audacity and the bayonet hervey that is what this campaign is about the general slapped his neck but the mosquito evaded his hand it would be the first of many to do so an hour later it was raining the rain fell not in drops or even in torrents but as a single sheet of water so that it was impossible to see more than a dozen yards and only then with a great distortion hervey did not think he had seen anything like it neither was it how the monsoon was supposed to begin but for once the poor redcoats the infantrymen of the line and the sepoys on whom alternately rain fell and fierce sun beat were dry for the shrines that surrounded the pagoda of schwedagon afforded cover for all cooking fires blazed inside teak burned very satisfactorily and there was skilly and tea in every belly before the hands of herveys watch showed nine sharing a canteen with the men in whose billet he had taken cover might have seemed an unlikely pleasure for him but it was almost like being in the peninsula again he stood a little apart with corporal wainwright trying to make out the language of their gestures and method as strange to him at times as the accents in which they spoke as flesh and blood they could not in truth be so very different from the sixth but they were men who drilled as a body whose military utility was solely as part of that body they marched as a body took aim as a body and they fired in volleys they did exactly as they were told when they were told he could certainly admire them for it he had seen enough redbreasted lines stand rocklike in the face of bonapartes columns and he had seen those lines go forward with the same unshakeable resolve his dragoons were different at his best each was his own man who used sabre and carbine as he himself judged fit yet who knew how to combine with others to multiply the effect was a man better suited to the one method drawn to the bringers of a particular regiment by some unknown process perhaps or was it only drill that made them different hervey wondered it could not be other than drill surely for the recruiting process was haphazard to say the least he had only to look at corporal wainwright to be reminded of quite how haphazard wainwright would not have been in uniform at all had not he hervey and serjeant collins gone that day to warminster common to search for the odd lad who had sunk to where he could sink no further who was more likely than a husbandman or mechanical to be tempted by the kings shilling it could only be the process of drill that made a soldier what he was the drill and how it was imparted and on this latter the difference was plain enough to him for he had already noted how awkward these men seemed at being spoken to directly addressing their remarks in return to corporal wainwright no doubt it was necessary in drilling men to volley and manoeuvre as one body but it must be deuced awkward never being able to speak directly to a man by the time the downpour had eased a full hour later hervey had concluded that of the seven private men five of whom were from dublin and thereabouts four might take to being dragoons with very little effort supposing of course they showed a modicum of aptitude for the saddle and that of the other three two were inveterate machine men happy only when their every action was preceded by a word of command from the corporal while the other was quite probably unsuited even to his present position so sullen was he that hervey imagined the serjeants pike a regular prompter however much as he admired the eightyninths drill that morning and the relish with which they had gone to the expected fight he would admit to missing e troop with its cheery sometimes outspoken dragoons whatever general campbell might say now about the utility of cavalry hervey was certain he would feel the want of them before the month was out as the rain had become little more than a drizzle he stood up and went to the door of their shelter he could now see the river again pulling upstream were a dozen boats filled with marines and men from the calcutta brigade not yet blooded in this curious inaction he had helped write their orders the night before they were off to do what he and his dragoons could have done in a fraction of the time and with far less effort if only those who had conceived this adventure had allowed the possibility of action over land rather than solely from water he had heard it said in calcutta that horses could not pass over such terrain how could anyone doubt that where a man could go in this country there for the most part could a horse nor indeed that when the monsoon turned the country to nothing but swamp there would be no passage for beast or man hervey thought of hailing the boats it would be diverting to join them for there was nothing to do here but watch the eightyninth put the place in a state of defence but he reluctantly concluded that it was time he reported himself back to campbells military secretary he was sure there would be nothing for him to do nothing at least of the slightest consequence but if he exhausted major seagrasss indulgence too soon it would be so much the harder to get leave for when the infantry made a determined foray he slapped his neck with left and right hand in rapid succession but too late to prevent the bites and he cursed it was worse than the fleas in the lousiest billets in spain chapter three the point of the bayonet four days later hervey slipped into the room where majorgeneral sir archibald campbell was about to hold his council it was not very large enough for a couple of dozen people and the lamps and candles were making the otherwise coolest time of the day hot hervey wondered what could be the imperative for calling the conference three hours before dawn he supposed he would have heard of any alarm so the general must have intelligence new come by or else he had resolved on something that he had been privately turning over for days the two brigadiers rose as the general entered and with them the dozen or so officers on the headquarters staff sir archibald campbell nodded all sat and then he nodded once more to his quartermastergeneral who pulled loose the knot that held furled a sheet on the wall down rolled a handdrawn sketch of the stockaded port and the rangoon river to the extent of some two leagues to the north at the furthest point of the river on the eastern bank there was a red circle gentlemen began the general briskly seizing the bayonet on the table beside the wall and tapping the map with it in the five and onehalf days since we hove to in the river yonder he inclined his head to indicate the direction our circumstances have changed so decidedly that i am obliged to conceive a wholly new plan of campaign hervey as every man in the room was all attention he was hardly surprised to hear the assessment only that it had been the best part of a week in the making and he was as much relieved as he was surprised to hear it stated so candidly there had never been any doubting majorgeneral sir archibald campbell as a fighting officer word was that he had been given the exacting command of a portuguese brigade in the peninsula because of his impressive physique and offensive spirit and because the duke himself knew at first hand of his youthful exploits in mysore but fearless and spirited fighting was one thing the design of a campaign the decision how to fight was quite another and the design of a campaign was not something to which general campbell had had any apprenticeship or perhaps gentlemen i should say that it is necessary to recognize that our circumstances are not as were earlier imagined it is evident that the burman people are either too afeard to rally to us or have no heart to do so we are therefore in want of supplies from calcutta and any expedition to ava will be through hostile territory indeed it will need to be supplied through hostile territory every man in rangoon must be of the same opinion thought hervey indeed peto had told him yesterday that the sloops he had sent to reconnoitre the mouths of the irawadi had reported the channels running close in to numerous forts but at least now they might proceed openly on the presumption of burman hostility they might even be allowed to butcher the few cattle that remained immunity from the slaughtermans axe had been one thing five days ago but there was scant reason now to let the troops starve so that sacred cattle could live it is also evident continued general campbell his voice slowing a little as if to emphasize the importance of what was to follow that the enemy have built themselves stockaded forts upriver and that thence they are in a position to assail us at will by land and what is more by river and not least is the renewed threat of fire boats hervey wondered which might be the generals inference for there were two that he and peto had drawn would he require to hold rangoon as a base for operations against the interior or did he intend to abandon the port since its capture was evidently not the calamity the governorgeneral had anticipated although in fairness there had scarcely been time for the news to shake ava the general brandished the bayonet again and so gentlemen our first object is to destroy the burman capacity for the offensive the declaration of the objective and the jabbing of the bayonet had an immediate effect there was such a hubbub that the sentry posted outside peered round the door the general raised his other hand and there was silence again today therefore we make a beginning colonel mccreagh you will seize the stockaded village of kemmendine here he stabbed at the red circle on the map and i wish the assault to be given to my own regiment the thirtyeighth colonel mccreagh simply nodded there was no need of questions it would be boat work and the bayonet colonel macbean i wish the madras brigade to ascertain where to the west of rangoon the enemy are encamped and what their intentions are the general pointed vaguely at the left of the map where the forest was represented by pictures of trees of very english appearance hervey hoped that no one imagined it would be like taking a walk in an english park he had memories enough of the jungle and he counted that he had been very lucky in his adventures very well general replied colonel macbean there was no need of questions in this either for the colonel saw it much like searching for the needle in the bottle of hay and now the matter of supply the generals voice did not falter but hervey thought he detected a note less assured it beggared belief that within hours of the start of englands first war since waterloo as campbell had grandly announced it to his officers in calcutta the regiments had been placed on half rations and sentries set to guard the water butts in the decade since that battle had every hardlearned lesson been forgotten gentlemen as i speak the royal navy is taking in hand the unsatisfactory state of affairs in which we find ourselves they shall provision the expedition direct from bengal there was much nodding of heads and murmurs of hear hear hervey smiled to himself the navy would have to keep them alive in the old way it were better without doubt that the extended exterior lines were afloat rather than on land even on a river whose banks were not free of the enemy but he couldnt help wondering if it would end in the old way like walcheren and corunna there followed detail that would much occupy the staff in the days to come and then the general stood up again i shall have a word in private with the brigadiers he said laying the bayonet at rest on the table for the remainder you may dismiss to your duties except for captain hervey if you please major seagrass eyed his deputy curiously and well he might thought hervey for he himself could not imagine why the general had singled him out poor seagrass he was not enjoying this expedition one bit and now he was looking in distinctly poor spirits an ague coming on perhaps when the room was empty but for those bidden to stay which also included the generals chief of staff the quartermastergeneral hervey stepped forward and stood at attention take a seat hervey said general campbell evidently finding the room rather too close and opening the collar of his jacket hervey found himself admiring the tartan lining of the lapels evidently the generals own for it was well known that he had commanded an english regiment there was no doubting it campbell had the crack in battle men followed officers like him captain hervey general you appeared distracted my regrets sir the general frowned but benignly gentlemen captain hervey is the only man in the division to have any experience of fighting the burmans you may find his counsel of assistance therefore hervey stood up no no sit at ease hervey give the brigadiers time to reflect but in any case you shall place yourself at their disposal as they contemplate their plans very good general he turned to the brigadiers at your service gentlemen neither mccreagh nor macbean looked to him as though they would be eager to engage that experience is there anything you would say here and now asked the general hervey wished he had a few minutes to marshal his thoughts before waterloo by a happy accident of the chase he had found himself riding beside the duke of wellington who had asked him what he thought bonapartes design would be there had been no alternative but to answer at once and he had done so to the dukes approbation but that was with the carefree confidence of youth and the assurance that the duke was merely sporting with him sir my experience of the burmans is very limited and i am not sure what general principles may be drawn from it i should say that they are not fighters as good as the sirmooris or rajpoots they can be deadly enough when at close quarters but i observed they were reluctant to close with us i judge however that they would be ferocious adversaries in the way of the spanish guerrilleros and i know by accounts i have a regard for that they are most active in stockading and entrenching this much reluctance to close we have witnessed already i should say said the general looking at the brigadiers they nodded hervey nodded too but i say again sir they have a reputation in developing an assault akin to how we would go about a siege they are prodigious builders of these stockades and they dig holes in which their men conceal themselves very cunningly they can advance upon a position very surely is this how we shall find them in the jungle asked colonel macbean i cannot say for certain colonel but i would suppose that would be their practice and if you should find them so then it would indicate they are intent on fighting the nodding of heads said the logic was sound hervey felt encouraged to develop his appreciation further but i must add he began and with a distinct note of caution i believe the burman may be in want above all of generalship there is perhaps no telling how much better would their fighting men be if led well and they do have one general at least of repute maha bundula said general campbell hervey nodded it was the first time the general had given any intimation of prior knowledge just so sir he is by all accounts in assam said the quartermastergeneral hervey was encouraged here indeed was evidence that the expedition was not entirely blind to the significance of what the enemy might do then we must hope he is tempted here said campbell most emphatically the defeat of their best general would indeed be the likeliest way to bring about a surrender hervey raised his eyebrows before he could stop himself why campbell supposed he was the superior of maha bundula he could not imagine especially with the evidence of the past two weeks before them yet he could still admire the gallant confidence it might yet get them to ava but he greatly feared the cost is there anything else hervey no sir i shall try to recall those details which might be of help and communicate them directly with the brigadiers very well gentlemen concluded the general picking up the bayonet once more lets be about it but make no mistake we shall be sitting out the best part of the rainy season here and it will be far from pleasant in his quarters a wellmade brick affair which had been the rice store of the myosa the towneater the official whose duty it was to extort the most revenue he could from the citizens of rangoon hervey sat down to a breakfast of biscuit and coffee at least here though he was free of the plague of mosquitoes and plague they had become he had bought a good quantity of oil of citronella in calcutta which he burned in the lamps on the table and by his bed and no mosquito seemed inclined to linger but he knew now he would have to calculate very carefully the rate at which he could use it far from pleasant the general had said they were to all intents and purposes besieged in rangoon if not exactly by the burmans yet then certainly by the monsoon how long would it be before the siege was lifted or they themselves broke it the rains would continue until the end of september and during that time there would be nothing to stop burman reinforcements coming south by river meanwhile the sick rate in rangoon even once the royal navy had begun provisioning them would rise for the air would soon be corrupted by swamp and stagnant water he had written at length to eyre somervile the evening before and now he would have to write a postscript he calculated that operations could not begin in earnest before october at the earliest for until they were able to clear the forts the flotilla could not navigate the irawadi and so the burmans would attack first being in the position of greater strength the only thing campbell could do was keep making spoiling attacks to disrupt the preparations but they would be costly hervey was certain nothing would be decided before november the citronella would be long used up but by then it would be the least of his cares corporal wainwright came in im sorry i could find nothing better than biscuit sir he said tucking his shako under his arm i doubt even johnson could find better said hervey frowning and motioning to the other chair and he would not scruple to forage in the generals own kitchen i heard the eightyninth had beef last night sir indeed a regular oxroast i heard it was hervey was sure there had been no rescinding order corporal wainwright i cannot imagine the officers would allow all the officers were dining together a regimental day or something hervey smiled but not on beef i should imagine not sir mm well if you have half a chance of buying any then take it id be pleased to part with a fair few rupees for a plate of something other than maggoty biscuit sir wainwright tried not to smile they had been under pain of the lash not so much as to lay hands on a beast up until now the word is were to go after them by the way sir the burmans and it is right which is why you found me already about at reveille i was copying orders for two hours he pushed away the remains of the biscuit porridge the madras brigades to beat into the jungle to find where they have gone the other brigades to attack upstream and clear the stockades wainwright looked pleased do we go with them sir we do i hope i shall want you to go to the thirtyeighth and find out when they are to begin they have orders to take a stockade about two leagues north i intend going with them but ill first have to ask leave of major seagrass in the event the interview with the military secretary proved an unusual exchange by nine oclock it was raining again a steady downpour of the type that cruelly tested the builders art the myosd had built his rice store well and hervey remained dry while others in more exalted positions found themselves dodging leaks and inundations major seagrass was abed complaining of cramps and a sore head when hervey reported to him his quarters were almost adjacent to the generals but water dripped with the regularity of a ticking clock onto the floor near his head and mosquitoes hovered like wasps about a fallen plum on an english summers day hervey assumed at once that seagrasss indisposition would rule out his own hopes of slipping away from the headquarters to join the thirtyeighth but he was surprised to find instead that the major did not in the least object although his manner of reasoning was startling go on hervey he moaned hardly opening his eyes you may as well be killed in the cannons mouth as sickening and dying in this place hervey was appalled at the selfpity could a man sicken quite so quickly he looked down at the plump outline of the military secretary concealed beneath the grey blanket and he sighed how was it that men were appointed to commands and to the staff who were so manifestly incapable there was another way of looking at it of course and perhaps he ought not to be quite so contemptuous of seagrasss words for the major knew as well as he that sickening was not a soldiers business perhaps he was only lamenting his disability in any case hervey himself had no intention of either sickening or succumbing to the cannons roar he took his leave summoned major seagrasss servant to his quarters and sent him back with a phial of citronella hervey cursed himself and everything as he hastened to buckle on his sword and bind his pistols with oilskin it was barely an hour since reveille but the thirtyeighth had been quicker off the mark than he fancied even his own troop would have been liffeys boats were already on the water and pulling through the deluge as if it were nothing but a spring shower he ought to have known it he muttered fastening closed his lapels men who had been cooped up for so long would be off at their quarry like hounds on to a hare the door flew open sir the thirtyeighth yes corporal wainwright ive just seen for myself are you ready ay sir they ran all the way to the river slipping and sliding in the mud drenched within a couple of minutes corporal wainwright began hailing the boats there was no one else about in that rain so their object must have been plain enough and it was not long before a cutter began pulling towards them the boats were packed with the thirtyeighths biggest men the grenadier company and there was scarcely space for one more let alone two but the grenadiers looked happy enough that an officer in another uniform from the staff indeed thought their enterprise worthy the grenadier captain was welcoming it would not do for a dragoon to be overtaken by foot he said smiling and holding out his hand i am richard birch sir matthew hervey sir and very pleased to join your ranks though i fear my coat a little conspicuous in so much red i should worry not captain hervey for i have no doubt we shall all look the same within minutes of scrambling ashore seeing the colour of the grenadiers belts hervey could only smile ruefully the white pipeclay had run off onto their jackets and trousers and even the red dye was not holding fast i freely confess that your alacrity took me by surprise though it was but a few hours ago that the general gave the brigadier his orders captain birch smiled the colonel has had a company under arms since we landed it was my good fortune that it was the grenadiers turn for duty today hervey nodded even so he thought it was smart work the rest of the battalion will follow our intention is to test the strength of the stockade and to try to take it by surprise captain birch had to raise his voice against the beating rain and the sailors oar work and his resolve seemed all the stronger thereby hervey had no doubt that birchs company would carry all but the most determined resistance before them if they could make headway enough to reach their objective so strong was the current that the sailors were red in the face despite the cooling drench if ever they had need of the steamship to give them a tow it was now but commodore peto had said he would not risk diana until he was sure the banks were clear of cannon and the river of fire boats captain birchs little flotilla was not without resource however the naval officer in command one of liffeys lieutenants had as good an eye for water as hervey prided himself he had for ground as they reached the point of the big bend that hid rangoon from further observation upstream and as hervey observed vice versa and where the oars could shift no more water in that swollen flow he signalled for the boats to turn full about and for hands to pull hard for the slack water by the left bank it was done in less than a minute and very neatly thought hervey quicker for sure than trying to row broadside across the stream as he would have attempted the crews now put the boats about again and struck off with a will for there was an obvious danger in going for the slacker water too close to the bank easy prey to musketry no matter how illaimed it was a tense quarter of an hour before the lieutenant was able to lead the boats to the middle of the river again but there was no sign of life on either bank except for a solitary zebu that watched them pass mournfullooking can we make room in the boat for him on the way back corporal came a voice from the bows captain birch replied it will be yours if we take the stockade there were cheers hervey smiled to himself a beef dinner not a promise that would excite men ordinarily to great feats of arms but such was the miserable fare to which the expedition had been reduced that a pile of gold was worth nothing compared with boiled meat he turned his cloak collar up once more against the rain pull hard now lads pull hard though the lieutenants voice carried easily to the other three boats there was just something in his tone that coaxed the extra from his sailors rather than commanded it it promised them something if they did pull hard rather than threaten if they did not in truth they needed little encouragement months confined cruising the bay of bengal and now the prospect of action it would take more than the monsoon and the rangoon river in spate to damp their ardour after half an hours pulling hard the boats swung closer to the right bank to clear a thick knot of mangrove that reached into the river like a giants arm and then their first sight of the enemy or rather his work a hundred yards distant on the opposite bank still a mile to go by my reckoning at least said captain birch an outpost do you think hervey had no more prior intelligence than birch i think it best to work on that assumption its not a thing to have at your backs as you go for kemmendine or for that matter in front of you as you come back my view precisely birch cupped his hands to be heard above the fall of water mr wilkinson the lieutenant brought his boat within easier hailing distance and without once losing the stroke i want to put half the company ashore to assault yonder fort called birch gesturing with his pistol the rest i would have mr ash work upstream to assault the kemmendine stockade we can go at it from two sides at once but maintain a contact both officers signalled their understanding and put their boats for the bank out scrambled the grenadiers like ants swarming from a nest with hervey and wainwright almost knocked over in the rush there were no orders no formingup just a headlong rush with the bayonet shots rang out from the fort at a hundred yards the musketry was well wide though one ball sent a mans shako flying it continued as grenadiers splashed through the sodden padi and still no nearer the mark hervey could hear the whizz of balls high above or see the odd one spatter in front he was surprised the burmans stood their ground at all for they could neither volley nor snipe now they were under the bamboo walls breathless up up get up shouted the corporals as grenadiers clambered onto each others shoulders the burmans were only ten feet above them and the redcoats wanted but a fingerhold to claim first blood but the burmans wouldnt wait for them to gain the top they leapt from the parapet and ran for the gate for all they were worth the stockade was no longer a fort but a pen over the parapet came the thirtyeighth wildeyed and baying like hounds on to their fox the gate wouldnt open and then not wide enough and then the press of burmans was so great that it jammed closed again trapping three dozen of them perhaps four hervey picked himself up after half tumbling from the wall the grenadiers yelling was truly terrible the burmans turned to receive them on their spears but they had never faced english bayonets before the ferocity astonished even hervey two dozen of them fell to the point of steel in a handful of seconds a single man sometimes to three and more bayonets the rest would have fallen the same had not the gates been suddenly wrenched from their hinges terrorstricken burmans throwing down spear and musket and fleeing through the ooze in bare feet twice as fast as boots could follow they were lucky that the rain kept lead from following too hervey looked at the heap of dead a sight he was spared as a rule since the horse took him and his dragoons on from their slaughter the burman soldier looked the same in death as any other untidy unsuccessful he felt nothing for them had they stayed at their posts and fought they might at least have repulsed the first headlong attack was that not what they were paid to do perhaps calcutta was right perhaps there was no fight in the burman army good work this eh hervey called captain birch from outside the gates he bent to wipe his sword on a burman coat very good work indeed but i wonder they were not more determined you might have lost a fair few men had they stood their ground perhaps said birch returning his sword but in this rain they would not have been able to reload and wed have pushed them from that wall in no time see the size of these men compared with mine hervey did the grenadiers were picked men it had been many years since the biggest soldiers in a battalion had been mustered together to throw the grenade but the custom of putting the biggest men in the same company remained quite evidently so in the thirtyeighth he nodded but i doubt we shall be so fortunate every time i can but admire the ardour of your men though he added quickly not wanting to belittle it in the slightest captain birch turned to his ensign have them form up in column of route if you please and then to hervey shall you come with us indeed i shall good we all know of your exploits in chittagong hervey was gratified if surprised he made no reply he did not speak for the best part of one full hour they marched the while first through mud so gummy that it pulled boots from feet at every step and then through forest that from the outside looked deceptively like an english wood no no its too much said captain birch coming to a standstill in the middle of a particularly dense tangle of byaik ive never seen thicker agreed hervey wed better make for the river and reembark weve lost enough time and surprise too hervey could but agree again the shots may not have carried that far in this rain but the runaways will have theyre bound to know a way through this captain birch cursed hervey sympathized an approach march through difficult country for an attack from an unexpected direction was an admirable undertaking much to be preferred to a frontal assault from the direction they were expected but as he had heard say often enough the business of war was merely the art of the possible and passage of this verdure was not possible in the time they had at least this rains to our advantage said birch signalling the change of march with his hand to those behind hervey smiled here was an infantryman who knew his job a man who preferred a soaking to the skin in order that it might soak the powder of his enemy too pull hard again my lads pull hard called liffeys lieutenant as they struck off im grateful to you sir said captain birch who had decided to place himself in his barge as they reembarked the rain had not eased in the slightest he turned up the collar of his cloak again you kept a good contact did you see aught of the fugitives bolting the stockade we did indeed sir your lieutenant was all for putting ashore to give chase but they sped so there was little chance of taking any i fancy theyre hiding in that wilderness and wont come out for a week and i fancy theyre already halfway to kemmendine to raise the alarm what say you hervey hervey was trying to secure the bib of his jacket having pulled off a couple of buttons while scrambling into the cutter we must pray theyre not like the thirtyeighth birch but proceed as if they are well said and very wise i think wed better take their measure this next time before hurling ourselves at the walls anyway were number enough to give them a fright hervey was relieved it saved him the trouble of telling a man his job a bayonet rush may have overawed the stockade but kemmendine would be different a show of discipline and steady bearing and all in red might do better it would at least preserve a good many of them for he could not quite believe that kemmendine had as little fight in it as the place theyd just sent packing and we shall shock them ay indeed hervey naught shall make us rue i recall when last i said that just as we were about to attack a burman camp we thought ourselves very bold you were it was a comfortable affair compared with this you would count yourself happier in the saddle i suppose hervey smiled does it seem ill that i would not at all the cobbler is better at his last i wonder youve exchanged a dry billet at all for this hervey clapped a hand on birchs shoulder oh dont mistake me i would not miss this for all the tea in china even if i maynt be dryshod birch offered him his brandy flask what is your intention then asked hervey taking a most restorative swig it is not easy to say without seeing the object but i shall land out of musketry range and then advance with skirmishers i think the navy might feint beyond you never know we might yet bolt them as we did before it will be a famous business if you do said hervey taking another draw on the flask that and to put a torch to the place the reason they were making now for kemmendine was petos fear of fire boats for it was no hindrance to progress if the general struck for the irawadi that said if campbell could not proceed for a month or so and in this weather hervey thought it nigh impossible then it would not do to have the village become a fortress from which maha bundulas men might sortie the general himself believed that the same weather would also hold up the burmans but hervey had reasoned that they would be moving on interior lines and might therefore do so much swifter and he knew enough of maha bundulas reputation to know that he would march where others could not captain birchs work today might well be an affair on which the expedition turned he had better let him know it how those sailors pulled on the oars hervey marvelled at their skill and strength like the free hands that propelled the triremes of ancient greece faster than could the galleyslaves of their enemies the rain had stopped quite suddenly revealing how warm was the morning and how soon could the mosquitoes set about them again so that in a little while both red and bluejacket alike would have welcomed back the rain in whatever measure and of course the rain dispersed the miasma the mist that brought the fevers hervey having lowered his collar and unfastened his cloak quickly reversed the decision with the first bites at his neck he was lucky to have his hands free for it unlike the oarsmen theres the place exclaimed captain birch suddenly doublechecking his map its good and flat and kemmendine just around the bend ahead we land there hervey searched with his telescope it was an excellent place to disembark boats could beach and the grenadiers jump to dry land if that description was at all apt ware pickets though birch its altogether too likely a place it may be so hervey but were beggars in choice he hailed his ensign in the boat alongside secure a footing kerr ensign kerr looking half the years of any man in his boat saluted and put the cutter at once for the shoal pull bellowed the mate he would have it run well up the bank out scrambled the grenadiers as the boat stuck fast a full ten feet of keel out of the water at once a fusillade opened on them musket balls struck the clinker side a grenadier crumpled clutching his stomach one dropped to his knees his hip shot away another fell backwards into the water with a ball in his throat lie down shouted ensign kerr they did so willingly even in so much mud while kerr himself stood brazenly looking for the source of the musketry another volley white smoke billowed from a thicket not a hundred yards away bad soldiers tutted kerr no target for the volley and all to lose by giving away the position the bayonet should dislodge them easy enough but no his eyes deceived him it was no haphazard cover in which the musketeers hid but bamboo walls as before only this time most artfully cunningly concealed he looked up and down the bank there was no other place to land to advantage stand up men as soon as fire was opened captain birch had signalled for the other boats to row for the bank covered from view by abundant mangrove well just have to hack through he called to hervey gesturing at the tangle that overhung the river both were now standing in the stern trying to get a clearer picture of kerrs skirmish not two dozen muskets by the sound of it said hervey your man might yet do it on his own that indeed was ensign kerrs intention fix bayonets on guard he would waste no time trying to load certainly not to have so many of them misfire with damp powder and the clattering of bayonets locking home was a fine sound advance captain birch gasped at the audacity make after them he bellowed pull hard they fairly raced through the slack water of the bank but there wasnt the same room to get the boats run up the shoal out out roared birch leaping from the stern into water kneedeep followed by hervey and corporal wainwright the silting was so bad it took the greatest effort to make the five yards to the bank all right sir asked wainwright as they crawled out ay just said hervey sliding back a second time before getting to grips with a firmrooted clump of rushes to pull himself free of the silt id forgotten how much easier it is on four legs captain birch was only a stride ahead of them and ensign kerrs picket was halfway to the stockade come on you grenadiers form line he bellowed but his voice could barely be heard above those of the ncos all of whom had the same idea right marker a corporal was screaming his hand raised a line started to take shape in double rank if not as on parade then no very great distance from it birch doubled to the front and centre he would have regularity company will fix bayonets fix bayonets hervey coming up beside him drew his sabre behind him came the rattle of a full five dozen blades being rammed home company on guard up came the muskets bayonets thrust out to impale the luckless souls who stood in their way company will advance by the centre quick march the stockade had fallen silent the going was heavy but ensign kerrs dozen grenadiers had kept admirable dressing they had but twenty yards to go kerr raised his sword double march a ragged volley greeted them a ball struck the hilt of kerrs sword knocking it from his hand another struck him in the groin so that he staggered left and right then fell to his knees his mouth open the line wavered the serjeant his face a picture of horror shouted for them to keep going as he rushed to the ensign no no thats not the way groaned captain birch seeing plainly the loss of momentum he pointed his sword at the fort company double march it was not what hed wanted to do not to blow them all by doubling through this mud theyd need every bit of breath to scale the walls but he couldnt have the picket faltering hervey saw it too these burmans were a deal more resolute than the others if they could volley as fast as british infantry they had less than half a minute to get to the lee of the stockade it was as well the defenders were more resolute than capable for the mud clung to the grenadiers feet as if demons were trying to pull them into hell never did hervey think himself so powerless he could scarcely get his breath as they made the walls the others looked no better and some much worse furious musketry from above felled two corporals and enveloped the walls in smoke a ball struck a grenadier full in the mouth he ran back towards the river squealing like a stuck pig until another ball sent him sprawling in the mud choking his way to a merciful death hervey crouched watching as two grenadiers holding a musket between them put their shoulders to the wall a third a big irishman jumped onto it by jasus ill not spare one of them he cursed as they heaved him up full stretch hervey could only marvel at their strength and then at the irishmans raw fight as he withstood the rain of blows to his head and hands he got a footing on the parapet and at once the defenders shrank back but another rushed him with a spear and the point sank deep in his chest the irishman seized the mans head with both hands and they fell to the ground as one hervey drew his pistol to despatch the executioner but the grenadiers beat him to it there was no shortage of volunteers for the escalade the lieutenant himself not long out of his teens was now hauling himself up his sword in his mouth like a pirate boarding a prize where were the ladders wondered hervey why were they going against stockades without so much as a grapple and line will you be going sir called another of the grenadiers as if they were asking if he intended taking a walk me first sir said corporal wainwright his foot on the musket in an instant up it went before hervey could protest wainwright a jockeyweight compared with the grenadiers was almost flung over the parapet he rolled forward in a neat somersault and sprang to his feet facing the way he had come sabre already in hand a clumsy lunge from a spearman was met by a parry and then a terrible slice which parted the spear and the hand gripping it from its wielder another two spearman backed away at once clear sir he called hervey clambered up the same way seconds later by which time wainwright had accounted for the reluctant supports he looked at his coveringcorporals handiwork and nodded he could not have done it neater himself perhaps not even as neat left and right all along the parapet there were grenadiers duelling with burmans theirs was not so neat work the jabbing bayonet the boot the butt end there were few shots a pistol here or there it was the brute strength of beeffed redcoats and good steel that were carrying the day although the grenadiers had had precious little beef this month the parapet was now treacherous running as much with blood as rain hervey nearly lost his footing as he made for a downladder wainwright was first to the ground sabre up challenging any who would contest his entry but there were none that would those who could get away from the parapet were making for the back of the stockade some of them crawling with fearful wounds and a trail of blood the grenadiers pouring over the wall were looking for retribution and these men now obliged them with each point driven into burman flesh they avenged their comrades a very personal slaughter this hervey was only glad of the anger that could whip men up to escalade high walls with no other wherewithal than the determination to do so ferocious savage not a pretty sight but the proper way no question and then get the men back in hand so that blind rage did not lead them to their own destruction where was captain birch hervey soon learned the serjeantmajor was a colossus even among the giants of the grenadier company and captain birch lay across his shoulder like a rag doll have you seen mr napier sir he asked coolly seeing the fight was all but over no sarntmajor i havent replied hervey dismayed at the lifeless form of the company commander is the captain dead sir he took a ball in the throat just as he was broaching the wall very well sarntmajor will you have his orderly attend him and come with me if you please we must put the stockade in a state of defence at once hervey did not imagine a counterattack was likely but that did not remove his obligation to take measures to repel one ay sir but let me just lay the captain aside decently first hervey hurried to the back of the stockade close the gates he shouted to two grenadiers they seemed uncomprehending he cursed saw a corporal gave him the same instruction and at once the gates were pushed shut up came the serjeantmajor again set them shakos straight he bellowed at two men on the parapet hervey could hear armstrong in that command it was remarkable how quickly a wound began healing in a regiment that need to carry on the notion of nextforduty and all where was the lieutenant lieutenant napier had given chase he now returned with a look of thunder he saw hervey and shook his head theyve bolted damn them they beat us to the jungle by a minute no more but its so thick im afraid captain birch is killed said hervey napiers thunder was stilled he had already seen the ensigns death with his own eyes he looked about the stockade and saw redcoats lying wounded he knew there were more outside how many sarntmajor we can muster fifty sir thereabout that was a lot for the surgeon or for the chaplain to say words over a heavy butchers bill indeed the lieutenant set his teeth see if we can torch this place sarntmajor then we get our wounded back to the boats and the dead too and then press on for kemmendine he checked himself turning to hervey if you approve sir carry on mr napier said hervey grimly the lieutenant nodded the serjeantmajor saluted serjeant craggs bearers serjeant walker find everything you can that will light burmans included hervey took the lieutenant to one side do you judge that you will be in a position to take kemmendine he asked the doubt more than apparent in his voice the lieutenant looked as if the question had never crossed his mind those are our orders sir but i asked you if you considered that you had the strength to execute them still the lieutenant was incomprehending the thirtyeighth do not balk at trials sir however great hervey was becoming irritated i do not doubt it but to expend more life in a hopeless venture is base more than that however it would be hazardous for the expedition as a whole if you fail to take kemmendine then the enemy will be emboldened the essential thing while we stand on the defensive at rangoon is not to have a setback in combat with them that is as may be sir but the thirtyeighth were given orders to and i am now giving you an order to remain here until the rest of your battalion arrives the lieutenant visibly braced himself very well sir but i must ask for the order in writing you may have it in any form you wish mr napier but i counsel you not to protest too much in front of your troops they have fought bravely and it is no dishonour to them that they retire now corporal wainwright listened intently to the exchange he had seen his captain sword in hand display enough courage for a dozen men yet countermanding a generals orders must require a different courage from the everyday kind he wondered at it took careful note and hoped fervently that his captain was right as well as brave chapter four the sortie two days later hervey picked up a pencil pen and ink was no good the paper was damp and the ink spread so that even his carefully formed letters became indistinct in a matter of seconds damp paper damp powder damp biscuit mouldy even on which they now subsisted damp leather inside which mens feet chafed the sores then suppurating it was as inauspicious a beginning to a campaign as ever he had known indeed it was more than inauspicious it was ignominy in the making four hundred miles still to their object ava and here they struggled through the deltas mud to attack stockades with only bayonets and the breasts of brave men hervey was ashamed and not a little angry rangoon may my dear somervile i am very afraid that your strictures regarding the assumptions on which this war is prosecuted appear already to have been most sadly prescient we made a landing here but one week ago against opposition unworthy of mention but the populace has not risen in our support indeed the native people are nowhere to be seen and with them we may suppose are all the provisions and transport upon which the supply of the army was to be found there are some cattle hereabout but the order that they be unmolested remains and therefore our soldiers starve that the sacred cows might live the rains have come in such torrents as i could scarce describe and the river is now swollen in the manner required but petos flotilla is unable to make progress until the supply is ordered and the gun forts all about of which nothing was known hitherto are reduced two days ago i attended the grenadier company of the th which is campbells own regiment in two most gallant attacks upon stockades upstream of here their captain was killed and the ensign too and they lost one in three of the company but they were all for assaulting a third and stronger fort until i ordered them to await reinforcement by the battalion companies which in the event did not show because of some alarm here the fighting spirit of the men is admirable but i have a fear that it will be frittered away in ill conceived assaults the company had not even ladders for the escalade and perhaps the more so by sickness which is already rife major seagrass is dead of a fever and i am thereby now general campbells military secretary there is little for me to do however and yesterday when i gave my opinion of the parlous state into which we were lapsing my cause was in respect of the mounting sick lists campbell became so angered that i am still unaware if it were on account of his despair at our situation or with my candour though in this connection i must say that i do not believe he has a true grasp of our peril i see none of the energy for which he had reputation in spain nor any faithful imagination of the scale of the undertaking i pray most fervently that i am wrong in this assessment but there was the sound of spurs outside and then a knock the door opened and into herveys quarters stepped one of general campbells adcs wellscrubbed hat under arm and sword hitched high on his belt sir the general would speak with you at once if you please sir very well said hervey rising do you know in what connection i am afraid i do not sir the general has spent much of the morning in conference with his brigadiers hervey placed the letter to somervile in the pocket of his writing case gathered up his sword and shako and left his quarters certain that he was to hear another paragraph of sorry testimony for inclusion in the letter the generals door was open hervey knocked and stood to attention come in captain hervey come in general campbell looked tired or was it worry hervey had received no word from him after handing the quartermastergeneral a report on the thirtyeighths endeavours he was unsure even if he had read it for there had been nothing but routine orders from campbells office in days neither had there been any sort of conference peto had fumed about it when they had dined together the evening before good morning general said hervey a shade warily sit down sit down it was curious thought hervey how the general repeated his bidding he did it not infrequently of late especially was it a mere affliction of the nerves like blinking or twitching or did it reveal an uncertainty since the general could not doubt that any order would be obeyed it could only be that he tried to overcome his reluctance to give the order by repeating it for his own hearing yet in such small matters as entering a room and taking a chair what could there be by way of difficulty except perhaps that the general intended saying something disagreeable surely not surely a majorgeneral would not rebuke a captain direct when there were others to whom he might so easily delegate the unpleasant task hervey took off his shako and sat in a rushseat chair in front of the generals writing table i did not say that i approved of your conduct the other day on the river i mean hervey was perplexed the fact was indisputable but the words suggested one thing and the manner of their delivery another was this a statement of disapproval or not the general did indeed seem weary no sir i did approve most decidedly we can have no fritteringaway of our troops especially not our best ones we shall need every man hervey nodded he would once have said thank you to a sign of approval but now he saw no occasion for thanks i have intelligence that kemmendine shall be the base from which the burmans will launch their attacks on us it is in all likelihood in a strong state of fortification already hervey nodded again wondering what these remarks portended your observations on the burman manner of fighting would appear most apt it would seem they are advancing on us by degrees through the jungle digging and throwing up their damned stockades with each day hervey frowned that is exactly the manner in which i understand them to fight general but i must say that it is not by my observation as much as by study of what others have written before the general waved a hand dismissively yes yes but it was you who wrote the memorandum that is what i meant and now youve been inside one of these damned bamboo forts of theirs youll have other notions of how to deal with them no doubt hervey was about to say that he considered any attack without artillery to be iniquitous when the general pronounced his intention to deal with the encroaching threat i shall attack at once tomorrow i shall take them utterly by surprise hervey certainly was surprised indeed he was as intrigued by the notion as he was by the generals purpose in summoning him you think ill of my design then captain hervey hervey would once have been flattered by such an enquiry now he felt only anger for the reply he would have to make for it hardly seemed a design at all more a statement of hope i should not advise it sir the general looked taken aback whether by the sentiment or by its plain expression hervey could not tell nor indeed was he in the slightest degree concerned the general frowned how so again hervey would once have measured his words now he paused but a moment the jungle is the burmans habitude general it is where they would choose to fight us to fight them there we should have an approach through very trappy growth and could scarce keep formation or if we were in column it would be the very devil to deploy especially if there were skirmishers concealed and in all this it would seem to me utterly impossible to achieve the slightest degree of surprise general campbell looked astonished that is not the opinion of my brigadiers they must answer for themselves general replied hervey confidently with respect sir you asked me for my opinion the general made no reply for the moment he might at other times have been angry but now he was thoroughly baffled he might be newcome to india but he had fought here long ago and in mysore and it was the india rule that a prompt attack confounded the enemy was that not indeed the dukes own tactic at assaye it had certainly been their method at seringapatam then what would be your course hervey imagined the answer was obvious he managed nevertheless to hide his dismay let them expend their effort in coming to us fight them in the open or at the forests edge not when theyre behind their walls we might borrow some of the navys artillery too i dont care for the notion of waiting replied campbell shaking his head very decidedly i am not suggesting we sit idly sir there is much to be done by way of outposts and patrols and harassing the thing is this the burmans must come to us if they are to seek any decision they have no alternative in which case we can make their work devilish unpleasant the general sighed loud and rather peevishly then lapsed into silence after what seemed an age hervey judged his attendance no longer required he replaced his shako saluted and left for his quarters without a word he was not long there when the same adc announced that general campbell would see him again hervey put down the pencil once more and returned to the headquarter office unsure this time whether he would hear testimony for inclusion in his letter of denunciation or another outburst of anger campbell was hardly likely to reproach him for not seeking formal permission to dismiss in truth he did not much care what was the reason indeed there was almost an air of truculence about captain hervey as he opened the generals door you make a lot of sense hervey said campbell briskly a lot of sense i have decided to attack the burmans when they reach the forest edge but i shall not sit idly until then we must have very active outpost work patrols and the like day and night put the burmans on edge deny em sleep and ive decided to lead an attack myself on one of these stockades tomorrow cant abide sitting here another minute hervey was cheered also gratified by the generals confidences if uncertain as to their cause shall you want me to accompany you sir campbell looked rather surprised if you would like to yes but dont trouble yourself if there are other duties to be about hervey took his leave formally this time he returned to his quarters and resumed his letterwriting mystified in no small degree by the affair at long length he finished the deposition with its postscript on the generals new intentions and signed it wearily he laid down his pencil then he picked it up again adding after his signature we must however allow that the general is a gallant man in the afternoon there being no duties to detain him hervey went aboard liffey to dine petos mood had changed he was no longer merely exasperated flowerdew had to give him wide berth as he circled with the decanter the commodores gesticulations becoming more and more extravagant half my ships ply to calcutta like packets now and the rest all but careened here and the crews sicken marryat hasnt an officer or warrant officer fit for duty and hes had ten men die already im sending larne to sea for better air in a month ill have no ships in fighting trim at this rate he waved the decanter away and then waved it back again dammee this is no longer just a business of the companys sovereignty the honour of the service is at stake hervey sipped at his glass of hock chilled very tolerably by its immersion for several days in the river he could understand his friends dismay for this was his majestys navys first trial since cbut the two are in consonance surely ava is the object is it not peto subsided but frowned severely only up to a point hervey the company will have safeguarded its position by defeating the burmans design all they have to do is stop his offensives in arakan and force a treaty you know full well it was the commanderinchiefs opinion that we should have stood solely on the defensive whereas the royal navy shot its way into rangoon and cannotnow move but out the way it came ay but unless bagyidaw is deposed therell be no end of alarms countered hervey shaking his head and reflecting the commodores frown someone shall have to go to ava of that theres no doubt peto beckoned his steward to serve their dinner and what if he should delay so long as to be then unable to clear the irawadi it would be my ships that are seen to turn hervey blanched are you suggesting we abandon it how will that serve the honour of the navy i am suggesting no such thing i am suggesting that the commanderinchief will break off the campaign here when the attacks on the borders of the companys territory have been repulsed and we shall have to steal away from this place without a shot like thieves in the night hervey looked doubtful that is if the governorgeneral is of the same mind as the commanderinchief peto huffed amherst has the mind of a nincompoop as we have ample evidence what would be your design to reduce the garrison here to what is required only to repulse an attack what would that be a brigade no more surely and then to take off the remainder at once to force the irawadi rangoon will draw in the burmans from far and wide and that we should take advantage of but theres no profit in sitting here the while with so many and all my ships tied up supporting them and for that matter every day our numbers dwindling i grant you we might force the irawadi but without the strength to garrison it the lines of communication would be at the burmans mercy this general maha bundula he would see it at once peto looked put out t thought you might have allowed that i would see the same hervey frowned i dont comprehend peto all these transports and escorts now plying back and forth across the bay of bengal all theyre doing is feeding the garrison here cut the garrison by twothirds and thered be no need of external supply i could land half my own stores it would see them through any siege and the ships released thereby could keep open the irawadi hervey pondered the notion as flowerdew laid a plate of fish on the table have you shared this opinion with the general i have sent him a memorandum just before you came hervey wondered how it would be received the fall of ava was not essential to the generals reputation all that was necessary was for him to hold rangoon it was not his fault that the burmans hadnt flocked to his support if the commanderinchief wished him to take ava against such opposition then he would have to supply him with the means to do so and yet the taking of ava in such very trying circumstances against the odds would surely be his making he intends awaiting a general attack for a week or so he will certainly want the support of your guns and tomorrow he is going to lead an assault on one of the stockades and do you go with him yes he intends that i should write the despatch ive a mind to come with you but ive called my captains aboard hervey smiled therell be more opportunities i assure you the general is determined to have the garrison as active as possible while he waits peto helped his guest to a fair portion of fish bekti the best youll ever taste caught this morning and brought upriver by diana what a boon she is hervey had seen steam on water before first in a boat no bigger than liffeys cutter on the blackwater river in ireland and then the barge that had towed their transports steadily upstream on the st lawrence six winters ago but nothing like diana diana was a gunship her ports painted nelsonstyle and her smokestack half as high as liffeys mainmast the baby figure of things to come do you think of some things perhaps but diana could never stand off in a fight a twelvepounder would smash her paddles to pieces i cant risk her in the van too long if the river narrows and the forts get her range hervey tried his fish i dont know whether its because ive not had a spoonful of anything halfdecent in a week but this i agree is uncommonly good peto looked pleased he drained his glass and let flowerdew refill it then he leaned back in his chair let us speak of agreeable things for a time i never told you my news did i it is signed and sealed and i had a note of it only yesterday hervey indulged his friend by laying down his fork and sitting back to receive the evidently happy intelligence i have bought an estate near my fathers living can estate indeed said hervey as impressed as he was surprised nothing on any grand scale and the house shall need attention but it has a good park and is but a short drive from the sea hervey wondered why a man who so much disdained being ashore should take such a course cdo you plan going on half pay it will come to it hervey it will come to it i have a tidy sum invested in berrys cellars and another in twopercents but i have a notion of something a shade more substantial hervey smiled then you are not contemplating matrimony peto raised his glass and took a very urbane sip a man in his right mind who contemplates matrimony will never embark upon it hervey in any case a house has no need of a mistress only a keeper hervey said nothing peto realized the import oh my dear fellow i am so dreadfully sorry i hervey smiled and shook his head think nothing of it ill take another glass of your hock and drink to your arrangements in norfolk peto cursed himself for being the fool corporal wainwright came to herveys quarters before first light with a canteen of tea and returned shortly afterwards with hot water their exchanges were few its raining sir hervey wondered at the need of this news supposing that the hammering on the roof was the same that had been for the last fortnight and the guard says its been raining all night sir this much was perhaps of some moment since the going would clearly be of the heaviest perhaps even preventing the general from taking the field piece hervey sighed to himself at the thought of another affair of the bayonet the wretched infantry no better served now by the board of ordnance than if they had been with marlborough a century past for ten years more he hervey had had a carbine that would fire in the worst of weather yet the ordnance showed not the least sign of interest the notion of a percussion cap when a piece of flint would do seemed to the board an affront to economy and little wonder if its members were as fatheaded as campbell hervey sighed again as he drank the sweet tea in satisfying gulps perseverance that was the soldiers virtue it was both duty and consolation corporal wainwright i give you leave to remain here and keep things dry and i decline it sir if you please thanking you for the consideration that is sir hervey smiled it was not entirely for your welfare corporal wainwright i had a thought to my own comfort on return ill engage one of the sepoys sir hervey smiled again as he rose to his toilet its not what i said it would be corporal wainwright is it hardly the dashing campaign with gold to fill the pockets corporal wainwright pulled the thatch from herveys boots and began to rub up the blacking while hervey began lathering his shaving brush i dont hold with stealing sir and it seems to me from what ive heard that thats all it amounts to half the time prize moneys a different thing but plundering a place is no better than thieving your sensibility does you credit corporal wainwright the duke himself would applaud it hervey spoke his words carefully but only because he had regard to the razors edge pistols sir im taking mine i suppose so it is conceivable the rain will cease what i should like to know sir is how rain stays up in the sky before it begins to fall hervey held the razor still you know i have never given it a thought nor indeed do i recall anyone else doing so i suppose there is an answer he resumed his shaving ill bind the oilskin extratight sir wherever this rains coming from there doesnt look to be any shortage in a few minutes more hervey was finished he dressed quickly thinking the while of the rain question the rain is in the clouds that much is obvious yet that was only a very partial answer consistent with his knowledge of natural history the rain outside descended as a solid sheet of water the noise on the roof was if anything louder than when he woke yet how did it rise to the height of the clouds in the first place and then stay aloft steam steam rises he said pulling on his boots that diana works that way i think corporal wainwright said nothing content instead to listen to the emerging theory a great deal of this rain must have begun as steam but then why should it now fall as rain and where did all the steam come from in the first instance for the rest i must ask commodore peto the weather is his business for us it is just weather i fear he fastened closed his tunic it had become a poor affair with a daily soaking this past month wainwright took away the bowl of water hervey looked out observed the downpour and put off his visit to the latrines until after breakfast he sat down at his deskcumtable still turning over the rain question in his mind peto would surely know a great deal more all there was to know probably but what opportunity he would have to pose his query in the coming weeks he couldnt tell the commodore had declared he would be taking liffey and two of the brigs out to blow good sea air through her decks and give the hands practice with canvas again wainwright was soon back with herveys breakfast excellent coffee he had been careful to lay in a store of that before leaving calcutta and a very indifferent gruel hervey thanked his luck for the supper of bekti the night before and for the lump of salt pork that peto had pressed on him to bring ashore it would be their ration today for the salt beef had now gone and it was biscuit only again in half an hour the bugle summoned him general parade he put on his shako fastened his swordbelt and drew on his gloves he looked at the pistols wondering he picked up both and pushed them into his belt if the rain did stop hed feel undressed without them he wished hed brought his carbine but it had seemed the last thing he would need when he joined the generals staff in calcutta the sortie paraded outside the north gate they were six companies three british and three native together with two field pieces a sixpounder and a howitzer some five hundred men in all and another fifty dhooliebearers they gave an impression of unity by their red coats except for the artillerymen who wore blue but close to they were rather more disparate than a calcutta inspecting officer would have been used to it was but a fortnight since the landing and already some of the troops had a ragged appearance which spoke of their exertions and the flimsiness of their uniforms as well as the lack of supply for the most part the trousers were white summer pattern but heavily patched and the sepoy companies had abandoned their boots some of the officers wore forage caps the general indeed wore one hervey would have been appalled had he not witnessed all that had gone before an officer of the sixth never wore a forage cap but in the lines that it should have come to this in one month beggared belief there was no doubting the effect as a whole however in close order and from a distance these men looked like a solid red wall they would stand come what may and their muskets they would know how to handle them for sure five rounds in the minute at their best how could the burmans match or bear it the trouble was the best volleying was only possible with dry powder general campbell was rapt in conversation with the sorties lieutenantcolonel a short stocky man whose voice was said to be the loudest in the expedition hervey studied the general carefully he had not fully appreciated his height before for he seemed now to stand taller than any man on parade without doubt sir archibald campbell had the crack and physique to convince a subordinate of his competence hervey pushed all his doubting thoughts to the back of his mind would campbell address the sortie the rain hammered so loud it would be pointless but for a few men in the front rank so they would just turn into column of route and march off down the track into the forest poor infantry trudge trudge trudge a mouthful of black powder biting the cartridge a minute of rushing blood in a bayonet charge and then then it was the same for all of them kill or be killed the soldiers life was nearest nature lowly nasty brutish and all too frequently short it was of course why they made comrades of one another so quickly everyone knew that hervey had seen it in his first week at the depot squadron and he supposed it was why perhaps decent society could sometimes hail the soldier for all his licentiousness the quality certainly liked an officer in his regimentals he wondered if they ever imagined them as they appeared this morning however sodden tattered grubby or what they looked like when rent with grape ball or the point of iron and steel it was strange he should think now of henrietta now when things stood at their most brutish but henrietta had had a good imagination of the truth for all her feigning otherwise not so lady katherine greville hervey did not suppose she had ever thought of it let alone was capable of imagining it regimentals were not for this they were for the delighting of her and those like her a mark of potency rather than aught else he did not suppose it indeed he knew it her letters told him as explicitly as she had implied the day they had ridden together in hyde park that was four nearly five years ago and still she wrote he wrote too not exactly by return but with sufficient despatch to keep the correspondence lively it flattered him she might have her pick of officers in london and no doubt did and yet she penned him letters he smiled to himself now at her questions did he wish to be an adc did he wish for an appointment at the horse guards if he would not return soon to london did he wish a place on the commanderinchiefs staff or even the governorgenerals there was not much it seemed that lieutenantgeneral sir peregrine greville could not arrange if his wife were to ask him sir hervey turned i asked if you still dont want your cape sir said corporal wainwright water running down his shako oilskin as if it were an ornamental fountain i can fetch it quick enough hervey shook his head no i think were beyond all help in rain like this itll be sodden in minutes and then a dead weight why dont you take yours though no sir itll be just as sodden and id as soon kick off these boots he smiled hervey smiled back corporal wainwright had been wearing shoes when first he had seen him on warminster common though the rest of the inhabitants of that sink had been barefoot easier going in the approach i grant you but just wait till you get a bamboo splinter words of command now rippled through the ranks like dominoes toppling back up to attention came the companies they shouldered arms moved to the right in column of route then struck off to the dull thud of soggyskinned drums and watery fifes a cheery enough display for the general thought hervey even if the sepoys did look distinctly illused to marching in torrents of rain the kings men he didnt doubt would have marched in many times worse and some of them in the peninsula where the rain could fall as a stinging hail of ice rather than as a warm drench poor wretched infantry the regiments of foot and their feet often as not cold and wet the cavalryman knew privation and worked the harder for having a horse to look after as well as himself but his feet bore nothing like the punishment of the infantrymans nice tune sir chirped corporal wainwright as he picked up the step yes said hervey in a vague way dont you recognize it sir no corporal wainwright obviously thought it of significance the rain it fell for forty days of course he said smiling black humour the soldiers privilege but im afraid the drummajor is excessively an optimist the rains will be an affair of months i fear they were not set off more than half an hour and only a short distance into the jungle when the first shots were fired in this rain they defied belief hervey could not conceive how any powder might be dry enough especially in burman hands there was at once a great cheer and the leading men went at the pickets with the bayonet it was over in a minute hervey saw nothing the column halted and the general pushed his way to the front hervey with him they found a halffinished stockade built directly across the track and extending the length of a cricket pitch each side into the forest empty of all but redcoats and half a dozen burman musketeers too slow on their feet general campbell peered at the bodies as if they might reveal something of the campaign before him pull the place down he snapped press on colonel keen they left a sepoy company to the work and the column trudged on into jungle made increasingly dark by the heavy skies in another halfhour they passed three more stockades just as hastily abandoned and then not a sign of the enemy in five miles of swamp and thicket until the artillerymen were too exhausted to pull their guns any further in gods name get the sepoys to the ropes cursed the general hervey despaired he had taken gallopers into the jungle twopounders dismantled and carried by packhorses but guns like these it would not serve sir i believe the effort may not be worth it and when it comes to withdrawing we could never afford to abandon them i agree general said colonel keen campbell looked vexed he wanted to blow in a stockade and tell the burmans there was nowhere safe for them but he had brought the wrong guns and he knew it the madras artillerys commander had told him so last night very well the sepoy company will remain guarding them until we return there were no packhorses of course not one indeed there was not a single animal in the entire expeditionary force but this was to be an entirely novel campaign one that did not observe the normal usages of war hervey seethed who were these officers who would undertake a campaign without a few ready horses the next two miles were done much quicker without the guns they did not find the enemy however nor any sign of him and in an hour the column emerged from the forest into green padi fields six inches deep in water colonel keen halted the column to allow the general to come forward what do you make of it colonel asked campbell sounding confident still the colonel had the advantage of two minutes survey through his telescope but even so there was not much he could tell him i feel the want of a map very sorely general i suppose yonder village is fortified or at least has some hasty stockading erected for they must have known of our approach these several hours general campbell now surveyed the ground for himself the village lay half a mile ahead astride the track by which they had come without a map it was impossible to tell if it ran through the village and beyond in which case the village commanded further advance or whether it ended there colonel keen thought the question apposite since he reasoned the burmans would be bound to defend the former whereas they would probably have abandoned the latter the general nodded to the logic but either way he would have the place and if i find so much as a loophole in yonder buildings ill raze the entire village colonel keen folded his telescope column of companies i think general if you please the colonel turned to his adjutant column of companies if you please mr broderick while this evolution was taking place which required the sortie to advance a good hundred yards to make manoeuvre room and for the companies to extend left and right for about fifty into the padi hervey climbed to the lower branch of a sal tree and began his own survey to the right of the village perhaps a little closer than to the forests edge was water one of the deltas many creeks he supposed to the left and beyond the same distance was jungle he strained to make out something of the village but the cloud and the rain made it impossible to tell whether there was any stockading there was certainly no sign of life he looked at his watch a little past midday they could not advance much further without spending the night in the forest and there were the guns to think of the companies struck off at a good pace splashing through the muddy rice as if skylarking on a beach hervey climbed down and pushed his way along the track to where the general marched with the thirtyeighths lieutenantcolonel just to the rear of the leading company he fell in behind the adjutant counting himself lucky to have his feet out of the padi it was only then that he observed how effective was a generals cocked hat in a downpour campbell had his pulled over his ears and water ran down the points fore and aft clear of both face and neck strange the things one noticed at times such as these he mused view halloo hervey woke instantly where what he couldnt see beyond the shakos of the company in front skirmishers out he heard the lieutenantcolonel order men from the light company began doubling past on both flanks to form a skirmishing line how would they load in this weather smart work said the general hervey could now see the burmans forming up on either side of the village with officers on horseback he prayed there would be no cavalry however inexpert they would have the advantage for sure even in this going curse this padi it was taking forever to make headway hervey glanced left and right the lines were uneven and they were having to mark time in the middle the men on the flanks up to their knees in water mud sucking at every stride he thought it bordered on the reckless if there were cavalry behind the village they could be onto flanks in an instant he began unbinding one of his pistols but he had little expectation of its serviceability he cursed again a pistol which misfired perforce at short range was worse than useless he began rebinding he would trust to the sabre as the infantry would trust to the bayonet at a hundred paces musketry broke out from in front of the village left and right hervey could scarce believe it just as at kemmendine the burmans had concealed their stockades in byaik little more than shoulder high and kept their powder dry but again theyd fired too soon and not a ball struck home the skirmishers held their fire theirs was to discourage any who would stand in the open coolly as if at a field day the general took in the business before him one company if you please colonel he said matteroffact remainder to stand fast in reserve lest those there begin to advance he pointed at the burmans drawn up either side of the village it was promptly done eight dozen bayonets in two ranks inclined right and quickened almost to double time campbell following hervey was hardpressed to keep pace the musketry increased but it was ragged and had no more effect than before the ground now fell away three feet perhaps more down the slope to the bamboo walls ran the company eightfoot walls not five there were shots from the left hopelessly too far again as hervey and the general raced to catch them up he couldnt understand how the burman fire discipline could be so poor when their other skills were so admirable the general glanced left marked the smoke then drew his sword and sprinted the last dozen yards to the fort the thirtyeighth were already atop the walls hervey glimpsed the bayonets at work bloody vengeful work the general climbed on a corporals shoulders and heaved himself up hervey and the adcs followed as best they could hervey lost his footing on the wet bamboo several times until corporal wainwright leaned out and got hold of his crossbelt but it was over by the time they were up five minutes work at most to turn the fort into a slaughterhouse as bad as hed seen there were dozens of dead piled against the gates and as many more scattered about the stockade in ones and twos where they had stood and fought or cowered and craved mercy both in vain general campbell sword still drawn but unbloody at once ordered out the company to assault the second stockade hervey standing on the parapet glanced back at the other three companies formed up ready their colonel in front and wondered at the generals impetuosity was it that he was happy at last knowing exactly what he was about the simple certainty of fighting and with his old corps he might almost be seeking a glorious death he made work for his covermen for sure two ranks get fell in the serjeantmajor blew his whistle fiercely and waved his sword that was nothing look sharp damn you the voice of the black country made hervey think of ezra barrow dragoon to captain what would he make of it he would not have volunteered for it that was certain never volunteer for anything was a maxim barrow had long lived by and it had evidently served him well hervey might almost envy him at this moment undoubtedly taking his pleasure in an afternoons repose at last the company was fell in to the serjeantmajors satisfaction they were scarcely depleted for all the ferocity of the first assault though every man was as gory as a surgeons mate no matter the rain would wash them clean but by their look hervey wondered if it was what they would want the general now threw over all restraint and placed himself in front of the line he waved his sword at the objective two hundred yards ahead once more the thirtyeighth let em have brummagem there was a great cheer poor colonel keen sighed hervey the general was a captain again and nothing would stop him he took post on the right of the front rank along with the adcs with corporal wainwright beside him it would be the closest he had come to a bayonet charge just as hed wanted he could already feel the strength of a line of welldrilled men elbow to elbow the touch of cloth even blue with red if only the enemy were not behind a palisade but no he neednt worry the bamboo walls would delay them not stop them surely these mens blood was hotted they would take the place by escalade again and the burmans would once more rue their lot but the second stockade was not as easy as the first the walls were no higher and the defenders no greater but the burmans held their fire and then stuck at it just that bit longer the first volley came at about seventy yards some lucky hits enough to shock then another at fifty which felled several men including a serjeant charge the generals voice was louder than the rain and the firing combined and the cheering louder still as the rightflank company of his majestys th foot under their erstwhile colonel ran slipping and sliding to the wooden walls this time the defenders would not be bolted they held their ground and kept up a steady fire even as the first redcoats were scrambling up the palisade the second rank began desperately unwrapping their flintlocks to engage them few managed to fire the burmans had the advantage and the will this time and the fallen red coats began to show but little by little it seemed an age yet could not have been more than minutes red began to preponderate atop the palisade it defied reason for they could not be gaining it by fire hervey himself had fired both his pistols and the rounds were wide no it was not fire that let the redcoats escalade the fort he got a shoulder again from a thickset private yow mun gow sir me legs shot through this time he reached the parapet while there was still fighting wheres the general i cant see im sir said wainwright looking either side of the wall christ it wasnt his business to guard him but an earsplitting roar and the whizz of shrapnel smoke rolled across the stockade floor and hid all for an instant hervey leapt from the parapet and dashed for the gun a dozen redcoats beat him by a mile a dozen more lay full of iron he saw his man though spear couched hesitant but standing his ground up went the sabre as he ran in wainwright with him he didnt feel the ball strike he only saw the lights dancing in the sky as he fell and then the shadow of corporal wainwright over him saying something he couldnt hear chapter five the surgeons blade that evening the sight of a horse even a lone horse made the sentries at rangoons gates rush to their posts and the inlying picket stand to a horse was at best the bearer of a burman who wished to treaty at worst it bore the forerunner of a burman army shall i take a shot at im sir called the picketcorporal to his officer the lieutenant strained to make out the target two hundred yards he could not determine who sat astride and he was as certain that his corporal for all his reputation as a hawk eye could strike neither horse nor rider at that range with a common musket and with the extra windage of the french balls theyd been issued with hed have no more chance at half the range he looked for reassurance towards the field piece in the mouth of the gate the gunners were already ramming home shell no let him come on some more the guard company now stood to hastily dressing in two ranks their captain scaled the ladder to the palisade to see for himself he raised his telescope a hundred yards the rider had closed to the lieutenant rued his own want of so useful an instrument two men torrance one leading theyre not wearing red but theyre not niggers either he turned and hailed his ensign out wilks and give a hand they brought hervey to the surgeon in a dhoolie corporal wainwright every muscle weary stayed with him despite the serjeants entreaties to fall out and take his ease the horse exhausted too and lame was led away by a corporal fresh meat at last joked the men the hospital occupied the towneaters collecting house and every building around it now men lay everywhere barely tended the place stank worse than calcutta when the hooghly was on the turn out you go corporal said the surgeon he had come at once tired and redsmeared from his ministrations with the bleeding stick id rather stay if you dont mind sir i do mind youre no use to me in here hervey lay unconscious the assistants were already cutting away the left sleeve of his coat corporal wainwright did not move oh very well grumbled the surgeon but be out of my way you both reek of rum corporal wainwright stepped back allowing the surgeon and his assistants full play at the table one of them held a lantern up close to herveys shoulder too late said the surgeon corporal wainwrights jaw dropped itll have to come off it looks like a ball in there the shoulder will be a deal too smashed and putrefaction too far advanced he sounded as tired as he was certain sir with respect sir pleaded wainwright stepping forward captain hervey couldnt draw his sword and hold the reins with but one arm the surgeon spun round damn your impudence corporal ive a mind to have the guard throw you out another word and ill have that stripe from your arm he turned back to his assistants the saw please corporal wainwright did not flinch sir you must try and save captain herveys arm the surgeon went purple throw im out corporal wainwright drew his sword and pulled the pistol from his belt the assistants fell back ill take the captain with me then sir you damned fool spluttered the surgeon this is gross insubordination worse the arms got to be amputated and quickly otherwise it will gangrenate wainwright sheathed his sword sensible fellow said the surgeon nodding now why not wait outside wainwright levelled the pistol again no one moved a muscle he stepped forward crouched slightly beckoned an assistant to help and took hervey over his shoulder he stood full upright in one movement with a strength that awed the watchers and walked out of the hospital he walked past orderlies too alarmed by the fierce eyes and the pistol to stop him indeed so compelling was wainwrights bearing that soon there were sepoys supporting him at the river he found more allies this time in blue its captain hervey sir he called to one of liffeys officers in an approaching gig liffeys officer of the watch had also been observing from the quarterdeck fetch the captain he snapped at a midshipman and the surgeon i think its hervey peto came at once with surgeon ritchie both of them freshscrubbed and dressed for dinner hervey you say the edge to the tone was obvious peto leaned well out as the boat bore alongside i believe so sir said the lieutenant and his great heavens exclaimed peto springing back from the rail mr ritchie your best work your best work please he rushed to the gangway two marines leave your muskets the sentries at the foot of the companionways grounded arms and followed the captain down sir captain herveys shot sir in the shoulder said corporal wainwright as peto bounded down the gangway the army surgeon wanted to take his arm off sir peto pulled back the cloak to see for himself he grimaced when he saw how much blood there was the whole of the buff bib was redbrown a hammock there he shouted to the lieutenant who had already anticipated the need another marine scuttled down the gangway with it bear him up gently men said peto more a plea than an order gently as you can seamen and marines began lifting him into the hammock my cabin if you please ritchie he called to the surgeon surgeon ritchie raised his hand to acknowledge and sent the loblolly boys sprinting to the cockpit for his instruments and the medical chest the marines red in the face and sweating like pigs bore hervey up gently two more came to the job as they reached the main deck ill have your table if you will sir said the surgeon as peto came back on deck ay of course of course replied peto absently he pushed past calling for his steward together they began clearing the table of its silver and fine china save the tablecloth sir if you please called the surgeon sit captain hervey upright he said to the marines support him with the cloth until i know what were about back came his assistants lay it all out here and give me the sharpest knife corporal wainwrights stomach heaved sir i one way or another the coat will have to come off corporal said ritchie moving candles closer corporal wainwrights relief was palpable a bowl of hot water and some brandy if you will flowerdew to anyone who observed the preliminaries of the two surgeons the armys and liffeys the reason for the crews high opinion of theirs would have been clear whereas ashore the man had worked in stygian gloom though there was no obvious cause to and his prognosis was made after the most cursory of visual examinations surgeon ritchie made full use of the evening sunlight that streamed through the stern windows and his magnifying glass his prognosis however tended to the same not good im afraid lint please an assistant rummaged in a haversack clean lint lets not have any more stink than needs be hervey opened his eyes capital my dear friend said a delighted peto youre in good hands now hervey appeared not to register where he was or even who was there an illtimed recovery im afraid my dear sir muttered the surgeon pouring brandy on the lint and wiping away some of the blood caked about the wound herveys head rolled peto peered over the surgeons shoulder at herveys he reeks of rum ritchie he said shaking his head little wonder he nods ritchie threw the lint to the floor hold hard there my old friend peto called as if to a deaf man which to all intents and purposes hervey was how much rum has he drunk corporal asked ritchie only a very little sir replied wainwright standing to attention by a bulkhead i poured the most of it into captain herveys shoulder sir ritchie turned and looked at him before more rubbing with new lint and why pray did you do that i know lord nelsons body was preserved in brandy sir i thought it could help captain hervey you did did you well it cant have done too much harm though it might have been better had you poured it all down his throat he took off his coat and pulled up his shirtsleeves a digital examination then now the wounds exposed proper peto screwed up his eyes the better to see the work although it anticipated the flinch too ritchie inserted a finger the right index with the utmost care but the pain was so great that hervey let out a cry and at once passed out good said ritchie much the best way as he continued probing peto grimaced but more in anticipation of what ritchie might say wainwright stood stockstill at attention he could do no more now than trust theres been prodigious bleeding said ritchie after a while but no disruption of the glenoid cavity no bone splinters either and i believe i may feel the ball he withdrew his finger and wiped it on some lint taking good care to observe herveys breathing as he did so the marines shifted their weight a little keep him proper upright and hold his head back one of you said ritchie wiping the sweat from his brow with his left arm probepoint bistoury please magan one of the assistants handed him the curved knife corporal be aware that i might be doing your captain no favour in this i may remove the ball but if the shoulder is more damaged than i surmise it would be better that i disarticulate the limb now corporal wainwright nodded sir stand easy man said peto kindly but first therell be more blood warned ritchie wiping his forehead again turn him round a wee bit more to the light the marines turned him carefully with the linen sling first i have to enlarge the wound he dipped the bistoury in the hot water curious thing how the patient afterwards says he felt the cold blade nelson did might as well make things as comfortable as possible he wiped the bistoury on his sleeve then deftly elongated the wound two ways pulling the flesh apart either side with the thumb and finger of his left hand while he probed for the ball with the knifepoint blood began to run copiously again the assistants dabbed at it with lint forceps magan handed them to him and took the bistoury ritchie as he had done with the knife warmed the bulletextracting forceps before putting them to the flesh peto began silently to pray although he was not a praying man wainwright was a praying man he had scarcely ceased praying since first lifting hervey into the saddle hold him hard i dont want a struggle growled ritchie as he pulled aside the flesh again and inserted the forceps but hervey was in too deep a syncope to know how the instrument probed in the end it was done quickly out came forceps and ball in less than a minute ritchie examined the missile for signs of having struck bone then satisfied he tossed it to corporal wainwright your captain may want to see the intruder sir will that mean hell be well now sir ritchie was already back to work with magnifying glass and the smaller forceps i dare say so he tutted picking out particles of blue serge from the wound lord but this cloths bitty more light there a candle or two it was peto who obliged him quickest but no braid though it seems said ritchie in a tone of some relief and peering even closer well hes as good a chance as any ill suture now magan keep him steady my lads good work and then to my cot said peto nodding with the greatest appearance of approval well done mr ritchie well done sir i could do no better captain but your praise may be premature it will be two weeks perhaps three before we see the laudable pus the exuviae of the sickness only then can we say the arm is saved what he needs now is to rest and to be still ill bleed him tomorrow part two home truths chapter six camp followers calcutta four months later the girl ran a finger down the neat line of the scar hervey felt no pain quite the opposite for her touch was always delicate and accompanied by the gentlest of kisses he sighed with the pleasure of their intimacy you had better go neeta manu will be here shortly and you know how you dislike him the girl hissed i do not know why you keep him as your bearer when you have so good a servant as mr johnson hervey smiled manu is a good bearer too and he does johnsons bidding willingly the girl rose from the bed tied a lungi about her then sat at herveys dressing table and took one of his brushes to her long black hair as henrietta used to do what a solace she was companion these past two years and nurse these last two months yet how dismayed he had been when first she had come to calcutta looking for him chittagong had seemed so far behind he rose put on his dressing gown then took her shoulders watching in the mirror as she brushed so very like henrietta and yet in appearance so different it was all very safe therefore but he broke the rules a bibi did not visit she was but a sleepingdictionary he kissed the top of her head then went outside it was a quiet afternoon in the lines even allowing for the usual retreat to the shade and the punkah although the worst of the southwest monsoons clammy heat was long past there were a few mounted men about the cantonment but no hawkers no rumble of wheels the company was at war with ava but the war was so far distant that the seat of government was undisturbed it had no right to be hervey had seen the effects of that detachment men dying for want of the staples of war and if the calcutta quality and the clerks and the merchants really knew how badly went things they would be busy burying their silver and taking passage home not that the war would ever come to this ava might boast of marching into bengal and her great general maha bundula might lead the army but the burmans could never prevail against redcoats in the end he believed there was no one who could for however ill he was served a redcoat a kings redcoat fought with the ferocious conviction of his own superiority that was why so many of them died they did not accept defeat because redcoats were never defeated too many people had traded on that simple notion in years past they did so now with the army in the east hervey wondered how many of those good companions he had known in rangoon had since been stilled by the enemys shot or the fever he scarcely dared think of how peto was faring for he knew that gallant man would be everywhere his sailors faced danger be it the enemy or the country there would be so many widows letters or to other kin and none of them would say that such and such a good servant of the king had died because other servants of the king had been careless of his life but in the end the merchants of the honourable company would not need to bury their silver the burmans were no martial race their armies had been formed neither by the british the moghuls nor the french indeed by what right did they begin a fight they could not win but it would be some time yesterday eyre somervile had come as he had every day since herveys return weak with fever and the news from the east had been as dispiriting as might have been general campbells force had fewer than three thousand effectives and the flotilla was in a poor way too with whole crews laid low by remittent fevers even the bigger ships larne was so incapacitated she had had to be replaced by arachne there had been some successes but campbell was besieged still by nature and the burmans and now there was speculation that maha bundula himself at the head of his army of arakan twice the strength of anything campbell could muster might soon be marching through the irawadis delta well he must put it all out of his mind today he was to dine with somervile and emma for the first time since leaving for rangoon ledley the regimental surgeon had at last pronounced him fit hervey had pronounced himself fit more than a week ago it was near six oclock and his bearer would soon be here to supervise the team of bhistis who filled his bath with hot water the surgeon had been most explicit in his warning against any chill for he was advised that the fever was born of the malaria of the rangoon marshes and could recur at any time perhaps even in severer form hervey took care to put on a good lawn shirt when he had bathed and a linen coat for as soon as the sun set he would otherwise feel the cool of the evening keenly he took up his brushes and smiled as he picked the strands of black hair from them one evening soon he would dine with his bibi here whatever the rules said but she dared not return this evening he would go instead to her at the bibi khana beyond the civil lines towards the chitpore road where the rich bengali merchants lived it was a comfortable and private place he liked it there he was pleased he kept her properly emma somervile greeted him with a kiss to the lips i never doubted you would be restored she said smiling but it has been many weeks and you looked so fevered when last we visited hervey took a glass of champagne from the khitmagar and sat as she bade him beside her eyre will be here presently there is an express boy come he is much occupied i think it must be the hardest thing to be so at odds with the governorgeneral emma raised an eyebrow it wears him more than i could have imagined oh i do not mean the disagreements themselves but the dismay at seeing so much going wrong when he had counselled against it from the start and still lord amherst is not inclined to listen hervey frowned theres a certain sort of man who would rather exhaust all his stock than admit to a wrong course and take a new one at half the cost i fear theres many a grave that will be testimony to our governorgenerals obduracy im only glad there are men such as eyre who will expose the folly of it moments later eyre somervile entered the room with a look half triumphant and half exasperated he dispensed with formal greetings this is just as i had expected worse he waved a letter at them maha bundula is now in ava bagyidaws recalled prince tharrawaddy and bundula is to have command of the army theyve been assembling these past three months do you have any notion how large asked hervey thirty thousand over and above the same number back from arakan somervile consulted the letter again also three hundred jingals the cassay horse from manipur about a thousand of them artillery on elephantback what is a jingal asked emma a gun replied hervey turning to her very light the ball weighs less than a pound but they tote them anywhere and very destructive they are too campbell will be thrown out of rangoon in very short order indeed added her husband how do you come by the intelligence eyre somervile seemed rapt in thought eyre im sorry my dear i was thinking how much time we had for the report says that bundula boasted to tharrawaddy he would feast in rangoon in eight days he could not of course not from the time of making the boast the distance is too great in the best of weather i suspect he meant eight days after once besieging the place emma stayed her questions for the time being hervey looked uncertain unless that is bundula were to engage campbell piecemeal that is against the best precepts is it not as a rule but there would be advantage in bringing pressure to bear gently on rangoon for campbells so weakened that he might seek terms emma looked shocked do you mean to say that general campbell could surrender hervey shook his head i think it the last thing he would do but maha bundula might not the burmans do not have a very high opinion of the company well said somervile making to turn i must send to the commanderinchief and to amherst they will surely now wish to reinforce campbells garrison that or order its withdrawal you will excuse me for the moment hervey sat down again taking a second glass of champagne do you know the source of his intelligence matthew asked emma is it the same as before i imagine so he replied cautiously somerviles best intelligence had come thence and he knew of no other capable of yielding such precise and valuable information not the girl herself she had merely been the cause for the boundless gratitude of a father whose abducted daughter had been returned unsullied an unexpected prize from herveys action against the war boats on the chittagong three years before but somervile had played up herveys chivalry in the jungled hill tracts to great purpose like rama and sita he had described her rescue indeed he considered himself to be an intriguer of the first water on account of it and so a favourite of king bagyidaws had become a most willing collaborator with the company and very good intelligence it is too though i fear that neither campbell nor the commanderinchief can make the best of it how do you mean i dont know what plans paget has in hand to reinforce rangoon but if there are none it is almost certainly too late to do so and what will campbell do when he learns that an army twenty times his strength is bearing down on him he has the flotillas guns of course but they might not be in a position to intervene decisively if he is so reduced in numbers through sickness as we hear then he would be best advised to quit the place to use the ships to take off his force before it is utterly destroyed he is not likely to do that surely you yourself said as much i said he would not surrender but he was with moore at corunna and so was paget for that matter he has seen good precedent therefore emma suddenly looked worried matthew what if the intelligence is false hervey raised his eyebrows and nodded just so it is highly favourable to the burmans that is for sure and for that reason it must be regarded circumspectly campbells quitting rangoon on a false report would be a most sorry business indeed you will warn eyre of this matthew he will not need my warning but yes i will speak my mind emma was relieved she had felt the perturbation of the past year very keenly lord amherst had set his face very decidedly against her husbands opinion somervile was a relatively junior member of the presidency council although he was the acknowledged authority on the country powers and their neighbours but he was an interventionist or rather he advocated military action to obtain conditions favourable to the company the action itself as in the case of ava did not have to take the form of an offensive and so he found himself frequently in contention with the governorgeneral who thought him contrary one minute seeming to urge boldness in meddling in native affairs and in the next seeming to recoil from it somervile confided much in his wife but she knew he did not tell all that was too often apparent in his countenance and disposition what about the regiment matthew said emma abruptly if brightly tve not seen much of them since sir ivo left for england hervey was pleased to oblige her for although he could not give the best of reports or the fullest he would rather be speaking of the regiment now than contemplating the mournful situation in rangoon i think they are well but theres little for them to do save guards and drill says serjeantmajor armstrong and im not sure eustace joynson is happy with the regiments reins entirely in his hands how long shall he have them a full twelve months less the two already gone i do wish it were not so long we are in need of society here and lady lankester will be a welcome increase do you know anything of her her people are from hertfordshire lankesters seat her father is sir delaval rumsey i have not met her but it is said she is a very handsome woman i knew sir delaval at one time said emma just as brightly as before rather i knew lady rumsey she was a kindly woman and herself quite a beauty and a wit too then we should all be content did i say that poor joynson is having trouble with his daughter again indeed according to my lieutenant seems shes been a deal too wayward since first we arrived the attentions of so many officers have sorely tested her senses it would seem im sure joynson would wish you would take her in hand emma raised her eyebrows i should not say it but i have observed many times how it is the plainer girls whose senses are the least apt for testing hervey frowned again but more playfully frances joynson is not so very plain emma emma frowned but more determinedly i rather fancy that that is an acclimated opinion matthew hervey thought it indelicate and unsafe to proceed in any case her reputation has not been remarked on in the drawing rooms yet so her behaviour cannot be so very bad emma sipped at her champagne your name has been spoken of however matthew oh yes he intended to sound only the merest degree interested curious lately at the generals hervey simply raised an eyebrow and took another sip at his champagne i fancy by the time sir ivos bride is brought here it will be the talk of every drawing room hervey put his glass down scarcely troubling now to hide his real sentiments emma what is the matter with calcutta in madras she visits matthew that is what is the matter and do not be angry with me because i tell you he sighed i am not angry with you emma when i first came to india almost ten years ago things were i am just astonished at so much canting emma would not be drawn and another thing matthew you have refused all society with bishop heber hervey frowned impatiently and held out his glass to the khitmagar please do not think i include heber in my strictures emma he is a good man from all i hear but i do not feel the need of a bishops society he only presses his claim on your acquaintance because your mr keble wrote to him mr keble presumes a deal too much oh matthew she touched a nerve but he was not minded to give in i sometimes think that mr keble believes the prospect from his parsonage window is the only one in the world she frowned again and you have seen so much more of the world yes i have emma sighed deeply had she not known him better it might have been a sigh of despair instead it was the mildly rebuking but tolerant sigh that his sister might have breathed then i should be careful not to see excess of it matthew eyre somervile returned to herveys relief well it is done i have sent my opinion to both amherst and paget doubtless theyll think it unreliable but nothing ive sent them to date has been other than borne out by events pagets no fool he may be a little too ready to defer to amherst but hes no fool you are perfectly certain of your intelligence hervey held his gaze until an answer came somervile inclined his head very slightly there is of course the possibility that it was sent to me with but one object in which case i might well precipitate an evacuation of rangoon for no reason that is what you allude to i imagine this i have laid out in my memoranda to amherst and paget the veracity of the report is unknowable unless some corroboration is received but the possibility of it is certain and in consequence the peril of campbells force one way or another it is imperative to act that is the material point hervey glanced at emma and smiled somervile for once i do not fret at not marching towards the sound of the guns i fear it will be a wretched business either way campbell is a brave man but i give it as my opinion that he has no place in command of a campaign such as this and i for one am done with such men emma looked startled but her husband had heard this opinion often enough these past two months my dear he said half smiling and taking a glass from the khitmagar you must know that we have a dinner companion of very refractory military disposition i do have a notion that he believes all between him and the duke of wellington to be but deadwood hervey frowned but as things stood he felt little inclination to deny it come let us eat then said somervile content in the knowledge that there was no more a man in his position could do for the moment i would hear of how things are with the regiment emma rose hervey followed though not so nimbly as once he might does it matter very much how things are whatever course campbell chooses theres no place for cavalry in it hah somervile stepped aside to let emma lead them to the dining room you make the same mistake as those in council who seem capable of looking in only one direction at a time in india hervey as you must surely know one must be januslike with regard to whence the next blow shall come let me tell you what has been happening among the country powers while our eyes have been diverted eastwards next morning hervey rode out for the first time since returning to calcutta private johnson had brought gilbert to his bungalow just before dawn as hervey took his chota hazree sweet tea and figs he had never as a rule taken anything but tea before morning exercise even in the cold season but he had felt weaker than he supposed he would on rising he cursed the time it was taking for him to regain his full strength the shoulder had to all appearances knitted together well enough but the fever had left him like a woman in the first gravid months dizzy puking listless it had come and gone and each time seemed worse but in the last weeks he had felt himself recovering his proper spirits with each day it was just the mornings now that reminded him there was still a course to run is tha sure thas all right sir enquired johnson watching him curious gilberts manners were not as he would have wanted and hervey seemed unable to stop the jogging to tell the truth johnson id as soon be listening to one of the chaplains sermons that bad sir perhaps not but it cant go on he tried once more to sit easy to persuade the gelding to get off its toes but it made no difference what have you been doing with him all these months swap orses sir dont be impertinent johnson smiled ten years they had been together now more almost eleven longer than any officer and groom in the sixth or in memory indeed he had no pleasure in his captains infirmity but he could at least take satisfaction in the tables being turned just a little as tha eard trsms to be wed the dodge worked hervey looked astonished you would as well persuade me that the sarntmajor is to take the cloth he flicked his long schooling whip at gilberts quarters in mounting exasperation there was little reason why he should believe it mr lincoln had been regimental serjeantmajor for fifteen years it was generally imagined that he was the senior in the whole of the cavalry why should he suddenly feel the need of a wife except that johnsons canteen intelligence was almost invariably accurate id put any money on it sir who is she demanded hervey sounding almost vexed widder o one o tfootys quartermasters hervey for all his nausea and discomposure managed an approving smile she must be a redoubtable woman how is it known has there been any announcement johnson became circumspect there were canteen confidences to safeguard mr lincoln saw major joynson yesterday an asked is leave to marry hervey smiled again a clerk with an ear to the door and a thirst to be quenched by selling tattle in the wet canteen things hadnt changed not that johnson would have paid for his information hervey had learned long ago that johnson received word from many a source because the canteen attributed to him considerable powers of prophecy and intercession what a tamasha that will be then and colonel and rsm wed in the same year then he frowned oh i do hope this doesnt mean mr lincoln intends his discharge it was a curious thing and hervey knew as well as the next man and better than most that new blood was as necessary in the officers and senior ranks of a cavalry regiment as it was in its horses and yet with mr lincoln it was different it was scarcely conceivable that there could be any want in the performance of his duties and his grey hairs served only to add distinction to his appearance in any case the rsm would yield to no one in the jumping lane at the end of a field day to many indeed mr lincoln was the regiment no one in the sixth had served longer though his actual record of service with its attestation date had been conveniently lost years ago ci bet thats not what serjeantmajor deedes thinks said johnson screwing up his face that was the problem there could only be the one crown and for as long as the admirable lincoln wore it above his stripes no other could deedes was next in seniority and had been for five years or more and behind him were others wondering if the crown would ever be theirs to wear before they were obliged to leave the colours one of those indeed was armstrong hervey had never given it much thought before could he imagine geordie armstrong filling lincolns boots it was pointless his making any comparison for so different were the two men except perhaps that armstrongs formation had been at lincolns hands as much as anyones there was of course one man who would by now have been the acknowledged heir serjeant strange could have worn the crown a worthy successor in every respect except that by now another regiment might have made a claim on him or even a field commission might have come his way it was nigh on ten years ago in a corner of the battlefield at waterloo that strange had demonstrated his singular worth and had lost his life doing so hervey still thought about that day and his own part in stranges fall he asked himself the same questions and the answers were always as uncertain still dead mens boots are a sight easier to come by ere than at ome chirped johnson he did not actually nod to the garrison cemetery and its growing regimental plot but the timing of their passing could not have been more apt for heavens sake johnson have a little compassion johnson mistook herveys meaning sorry sir i didnt mean as i thought tha were oh thank you youll be sure to let me know when the canteen shortens the odds on my getting to the end of this posting wont you johnson looked only very slightly abashed come then said hervey sighing lets shorten the reins instead and see what we can do gilbert broke into a trot a fraction before the aids applied leaving hervey to curse his own lack of handiness as well as his horses it was going to be a long business this getting back to condition when they returned to the bungalow the best part of an hour later for he had wanted to ride right out of the lines onto the plain hervey slid from the saddle in better spirits and health and said that he would attend morning stables then he went inside for hazree and an hour with his pen there was correspondence long overdue and he meant to make a start today just as he intended taking back the charge of his troop on his desk were five letters two were from horningsham one from elizabeth the other from his father they had been written a fortnight apart but had arrived together that from his father contained the same warm paternal sentiment as that sent to shrewsbury when first he had gone up on his fourteenth birthday indeed it was in essence the same letter except for a line or two on diocesan affairs which hitherto archdeacon hervey had rarely mentioned and the news that his monograph on archbishop laud was at last nearing completion the letter from elizabeth was not greatly longer but contained altogether more information about the village their part of wiltshire the country as a whole garnered she admitted from the newspapers about their parents and relatives and last but at greatest length about his daughter georgiana was six months older than when elizabeth had last written and it seemed she was a favourite at both longleat and the vicarage she showed all the signs of a fine intelligence was able to read and she could sit a pony well she laughed a great deal it was a letter to reassure an absent father that he should have no concerns for the wellbeing of his child and yet this agreeable report had the effect of making hervey want to be with his daughter as keenly as would an unhappy one for georgiana was henriettas offspring he laid the letter to one side it would be as difficult to begin a reply to his sisters as to his fathers if for wholly different reasons he picked up the third from john keble he imagined it written with that same prospect before the writer against which he had inveighed the evening before at the somerviles it was a letter composed in a gloucestershire curates house an untroubled place where dreams could be dreamed a letter full of rebuttals of this divine and that with a lengthy description of the work he was jointly embarked on with herveys father a charge to the clergy of the archdeaconry of sarum there was the startling revelation that keble had been asked if he would go to the west indies as archdeacon of barbados no less and the wholly unsurprising addendum that he had declined the letter concluded with an evidently pained enquiry into whether or not hervey had yet had occasion to discourse with bishop heber it being more than a year since that prelate had been enthroned it was indeed so worthy a letter that hervey felt it required a peculiar state of grace before any response could be attempted he laid it down and picked up the fourth he already knew its contents yet even as he began rereading a third or fourth time it had its effect the hand was the freest of the four the sentiment likewise what it was to have a female of the likes of lady katherine greville bestowing her time on him how diverting seemed the gossip that had formerly repulsed him so how fondly now he remembered their brief company and her uninhibited pleasure in it and how lame his own response had been but it had been different then too close to events his mind encumbered by all sorts of notions and doubts things were not the same now india for all her heat had moistened that driedup interior of his first she had given him back his very being as a soldier it did not matter that in reality the affair of the headwaters of the karnaphuli had been unhonoured by calcutta or that the campaign he had so recently left in a dhoolie was the recreation of that muddle in the low countries a quarter of a century before india was a stage on which the soldier could expound his art learn stratagems and devices unheard of at home and above all might have that most prized thing the true exercise of command yes hervey was angry with majorgeneral sir archibald campbell and the campaign in ava but it and the other diversions of this singular country made him feel as alive as ever he could remember he took a sheet of paper from the drawer and picked up his pen perhaps as little as a year ago he would have begun his replies in the strict order of filial duty then sibling love then respectfulness for the cloth and then but this morning he began dear lady katherine an hour or so later having written rather more than usual to this wife of an absentee husband and likewise having returned her teasing and toying in fuller measure he put on cantonment dress the looserfitting cotton jacket that the sixth had adopted soon after arriving with light cotton overalls and forage cap and walked to the regimental headquarters to report himself back at duty major joynson heard him through the open door of his office and came at once into the adjutants room to add his salutation and a word with you as soon as you are done here he added in a manner that hervey could not quite determine as encouraging or otherwise he wanted to appear neither apprehensive nor indifferent and so after ten minutes with the adjutant in which he was apprised of the comings and goings of his troop and its defaulters hervey signed the orders book and then repaired to the majors office since the death of his wife an invalid to laudanum and the military demise of lord towcester eustace joynson had grown steadily in stature and affection in the regiment his reputation for painstaking administration had always been high but the demands made on him by his late wife had sapped his vigour and towcesters martinet command had all but eviscerated him now the sick headaches that had removed him from duty with monotonous regularity had all but gone and he enjoyed many a mess night where before he had found them a sore trial however he did not feel himself entirely a match for the decision before him now and there were none perhaps who would blame him for the decision was one of the utmost importance to every man in the sixth hervey close the door and take a seat have you had coffee would you like a little madeira no perhaps a shade early i never do not before eleven have you heard that mr lincolns to marry hervey sat in a tubchair that creaked with the slightest move of a muscle i have joyous news you think so possibly i suppose yes is there some objection to the lady oh no no indeed not she is a very respectable woman very highly regarded by the light infantrys colonel lincolns calling on him this very morning then why do you sound uncertain because marsh is to send in his papers says he wants to spend his declining days in ipswich rather than be quartermaster here singular joynson smiled a man who prefers ipswich to calcutta might rightly be said to have begun his decline already i could not say that even the worst of the stink here would drive me to such a decision hervey nodded returning the smile a sort of mock grimace ipswich indeed no but you will imagine that there must be a replacement quartermaster and a replacement for the replacement exactly so i am excessively pleased that lincoln shall join us at last in the mess indeed it is long overdue but the pleasure is dulled by the thought of having to determine his own succession the word was well chosen lincolns had been a long reign by any standard hervey wondered what the rsm himself thought of relinquishing the crown it should be deedes by rights is there any serious objection it has always been seniority tempered by rejection joynson took off his glasses and polished them with a silk cloth ive been disappointed with deedes these past twelve months theres a want of vigour i dare say that hell make no mistakes but if were to have him for any time then i fear hell begin to drop the bit rose thinks so too hervey raised an eyebrow deuced tricky superseding deedes hell fall right away and become a malcontent no doubt and the rest of his mess will be ill at ease if they perceive no very good reason for it who is next in seniority harrison telfer oh dear precisely who would you want hairsine exactly hervey frowned theyve all been too long in the rank even hairsine in that respect the war brought them on too quickly i can remember hairsine the night we had word of the surrender at toulouse he was orderly serjeantmajor it was ten years ago deedess time will be up in a couple of years in the normal course of things and harrisons not much later i suppose we could take a chance on him and hairsine could bide his time a while longer therell be more talk of dead mens boots but it wouldnt do any more harm i suppose what would sir ivo want to do strange to say we never spoke of it marsh looked the last man to give up so cosy a billet as quartermaster hervey supposed it an apt description of quartermaster in a station such as calcutta can he not be persuaded to remain in post a little longer joynson shook his head hes determined to leave by october to have the spring in ipswich he says and in any case all we should have is six months of jockeying and wagering and heaven knows what else all very unedifying no its a decision i shall have to take myself and be content with the notion that it will not be possible to make the right one hervey smiled again joynson knew his pack the only decision that had the remotest possibility of being acknowledged the right one was that made by the commanding officer himself the major might carry the horn this season but he was not the master anything else joynson hesitated are you sure you wont have some madeira thank you no in truth i think my gut ought still to be listed sick at present i list mine sick one week in every month and feel the better for it coffee then yes coffee joynson called for his bearer to bring two cups what do you make of barrow it seemed a strange turn in the conversation hervey looked wary if he has any he could call a friend it would be you i think said joynson polishing his glasses again i think it would be fairer to the three of us if you first said why you asked sir replied hervey especially since i have been absent for the best part of the year and he always tried that much harder with barrow for barrow was an officer from the ranks the ranks of another regiment indeed and hervey had not cared for him to begin with not that barrow had seemed to want to help himself in terms of popularity with his newfound fellow officers joynson nodded youre right it may come to nothing lets hope so but ive had word it doesnt matter where from its not the regiment that hes on the take with his remount fund hervey smiled i saw some of his remounts this morning how hes managed to find that quality and take a backhand glass i cant imagine i thought that too only yesterday when his troop paraded for escort however the accusation comes from one of the dealers it seems what are you going to do ci dont know i was only apprised of it yesterday the next board of officers isnt for another six months i cant very well roist his accounts about meanwhile without good cause we cant jump to every bazaarwallah who complains of backshee im inclined to have the dealer arrested if he wont make a proper deposition what do you want me to do joynson looked uncertain could you think it of barrow why should i think it any more or any less of barrow than of the others you know very well why so barrows coming from the ranks puts him more in the way of temptation dont sport with me hervey if it were hugh rose wed never hear the charge out hervey frowned i think that if we are making private means the touchstone then we would be obliged to enquire whether roses fortune had disappeared you are not being of much assistance the bearer brought their coffee hervey took his and began stirring the strong black liquid ill keep an ear cocked he said when the man had gone thank you the major took his coffee and heaped sugar into the cup hervey thought he would try to end the line of questioning how is frances i havent seen her in months he meant it not unkindly no regimental officer could be an island when it came to domestic troubles and it was as well to know if there were any vexations in that respect joynson sighed heavily i have been on the point of speaking to the colonel of the thirteenth and several of the companys many times these past six months i feel they have as much responsibility in allowing her to expose herself in so frequent a way i am very happy that she has such diversions as these levees and balls but hervey nodded she sorely misses a mother she always has hervey felt the footsteps over his grave are you quite well hervey asked joynson narrowing his eyes of course sir perfectly well very well indeed poor joynson his nickname had been daddy for the short time he had had a troop in the peninsula he had his weaknesses and he knew them but in intention he had served his country as well as anyone and he had a true attachment to his regiment hervey thought it most unjust that his standing should be risked by a silly daughter i think it would be ill to deny her any society properly ordered perhaps she might attach herself to some matron here it was as well as he could manage for he had little enough experience to draw on they sat awhile talking of how things were going in the east and of what the regiment might do in the autumn by way of field days at length hervey rose to take his leave so as to catch his troop at morning stables very well hervey said joynson a little brighter its good to have you back again come and dine with us soon i should like that sir thank you he put on his forage cap saluted then left the regimental headquarters pondering the peculiar trust that joynson had shown he liked the intimacy of the personal confidences even if they had momentarily reminded him of his own situation and in respect of the succession of serjeantmajors it was good to be assured periodically of ones own stake in the regiment e troops stables stood at the end of the single line of backtoback standing stalls that stretched for three hundred yards beyond the regimental maidan they were brickbuilt and whitewashed with a good thatch and khuskhus tatties that extended from the joists to about the chest height of a dragoon in the summer therefore the troophorses stood in shade and the doused tatties and punkahs provided some relief in the otherwise still ovenhot air while in the monsoon season and the winter the animals were protected from rain and wind be it hot or cold at the end of each troop block was the stabling for the officers chargers six loose boxes in line with a separate store for saddlery and tackling at nine oclock of a morning at this time of year early october the lines were all activity the rains were receding and the regiment had begun its coolweather routine horses had been fed two hours before and the dragoons had breakfasted it was a hearty meal a dragoons breakfast just right for a mornings work half a pound of bread the same of beef and plenty of coffee hervey wondered if he would be able to keep such a meal down ever again but a dragoon needed his beef for such a morning the fetching and carrying the brushing and strapping for there was only so much the native grasscutters were allowed to do the men clattered about the bricklaid floor in their clogs and stable dress like workers in a cotton mill but ten times as lively at ninethirty the trumpeter would sound boot and saddle and the serjeants would check every last buckle and strap and many a hapless dragoon who had thought the shine on his leather more than adequate as he polished by lamplight would find that the indian sun was a merciless revealer of insufficiency and then he might think for a moment but only a moment that he might prefer other employment for the time being however they were still at work with brush and currycomb it was just that bit easier while horses had their summer coats but there was sweat on every dragoons brow nevertheless it was not a time for shouted commands rather of careful observance of standing orders and the accumulated experience of the corporals above all it was not a time for officers it was the serjeantmajors hour it was he and his trusted ncos who turned out the troop to perfection both horses and men then the officers led them in the practice of war real or imagined and the serjeantmajor did not expect supervision herveys appearance in the lines this morning was therefore doubly unusual he had not even sent word to myles vanneck his lieutenant that he was reporting himself fit for duty and there was at once a buzz as the news passed from stall to stall the dragoons nearest the end stood to attention as others gawped or tried to steal a look hervey felt as if he were some ghost carry on harkness he said nodding and smiling as he began walking the line of stalls private harkness the broadest of shoulders making his trooper look shortbacked returned the smile confidently another dragoon came to attention as hervey reached his stall carry on hicks how is your leg now private hicks turned red his leg had been mended for all of three years but still his nickname in the troop was giles the cripple very good sir thank you sir the next man had neither brush nor comb in his hand and he therefore saluted hervey smiled again beneath the watering cap were thick black curls unmistakable good morning french what is the news from wales agreeable i think sir my father has taken another living and my brother is to be ordained too the voice was not perhaps so differently cast from the other recruits as first it had seemed on joining but it was still the voice of a man of some education the ringing of spurs made hervey turn good morning sor hervey smiled the more an indulgent sort of smile corporal mccarthy its good to see you on your feet again sor and back in time for all the drill too indeed indeed yes he had timed his return well as if he had had any say in it go and fetch the sarntmajor rudd said mccarthy addressing the next stall hervey looked across keenly he had not noticed private rudd and he watched with satisfaction as he doubled away for he had saved the boy from a cloying mother and the dubious occupation of milliner rudd ought to be corporal soon if only there were more places he carried on down the line corporal mccarthy by his side how is your section then on the whole well sor very well not a horse lame nor a man sick hervey nodded appreciatively it was as well at the beginning of what they called here the unhealthy season next he stopped by private needhams stall needhams hair almost covered the stub of his right ear but the old wound was vivid enough hervey recalled the bloody sight when the burman tulwar had sliced the flesh away needham stood to attention now with brush and comb clasped in each hand by his side as fit as the day hervey had enlisted him on warminster common but he did not smile good morning needham how is your mare hervey chose well needham and his mare were ever closer by the day shes doing a treat sir she won best turnout last week a credit to you said hervey nodding approval and he would say no more for the time being for they had buried needhams best friend private spreadbury barely a week ago and there were now but two of the original warminster pals left how well the pals had served him thought hervey that day five years ago when he had defied all his instincts and gone to warminster common to look for recruits it had repaid his efforts no end indeed would he be alive this day had he not done so for wainwright was first of the pals he smiled at the thought of what the kings shilling could buy and what the kings uniform could do for a man in return he hoped he would live long enough to see four chevrons on wainwrights sleeve good morning captain hervey sir the voice filled the stables there was no need for hervey to turn to see whose it was good morning sarntmajor he replied as cheerily as he had been hailed not a horse off the road sir nor a man neither troop serjeantmajor armstrong collierturnedcavalryman the only horse he had seen before enlisting was pulling a coal tub but what a source of strength always was that voice of the tyne herveys thoughts were at once of sahagun corunna albuhera and a dozen other places where armstrongs voice had done its work cursing checking cajoling to his mind armstrong was the sixth as much as was lincoln and god rest his soul as strange had been without him the regiment could surely never be the same or as good corporal mccarthy tells me so very good husbandry sarntmajor it was perhaps fortunate that hervey was enquiring this day and not a week before that the last man sick poor spreadbury had died was not something to be reflected in the days parade state in their five or so years in calcutta e troop had lost eighteen men to the agues and fevers that plagued the cantonments every season and before he had left for rangoon the sick rate had been three men in ten the other troops had fared no better but that was little consolation to mess mates nor to hervey and armstrong whose concern it was to maintain a decent muster but no men sick this morning not a bad way to begin command again the vetinrys round the other side sir if you want me to tell him youre here just doing his rounds that is no problems just say not to leave before im able to have a word armstrong nodded to rudd who cut away smartly they advanced another stall a new face i perceive the dragoon stood at attention as needham before him with brush and currycomb in either hand but his look was a touch anxious rather than melancholy private toyne sir said armstrong joined last month hervey looked him up and down a wellmade youth freshfaced and clean where are you from toyne appleby sir in a voice not unlike the serjeantmajors but hervey was none the wiser westmorland sir explained armstrong long years had taught him that officers spoke of counties not places hervey knew there were hills in westmorland but that was about all what brought you to the sixth then my cousin is in the fiftyfifth sir and e took me to enlist but i said i wanted to work with orses and so the fiftyfifth let me change did they indeed that was very generous of them and most unusual too no doubt the recruiting serjeant had sworn blind that the fiftyfifth were mounted on the best bloods and more besides if it would secure another man well sir i had to pay a bit of money a recruit buying into the cavalry now theres a thing toyne would not understand the humour just yet but armstrong smiled pityingly theres not much for company but sheep up there sir hes made a good start though sits well hervey nodded to show his appreciation you worked with horses in appleby then yes sir i used to help with the fair sir fair yes sir theres an orse fair twice a year people comes from all over to buy hervey nodded again well im pleased to have you in my troop carry on toyne turned as red as hicks had done a good un said armstrong voice lowered as they stepped off a real liking for horses hell make a good groom in his turn hervey took note it was difficult not to when a man had parted with money in order to be with horses at the other stalls it was reunion rather than introduction and sometimes banter hervey his spirits already lifted was content for here were a confident troop who thought themselves a cut above the others since the affair at the river three years before none of the other troops had so much as chased a dacoit let alone bloodied a sabre and a man who had not cut or thrust or even fired carbine or pistol in anger could hardly think himself a proper dragoon for sure it was the veterans of waterloo who were honoured above all others in the wet canteen not with exaggerated reverence but with the nodding respect that they had seen something never to be seen again and were therefore possessed of certain insights and certain rights and sometimes an e troop man who had overreached himself in the canteen on the business of fighting would be brought up sharply by a waterloo hand and reminded that the affair at the river sharp though it had been could never compare with that day in june but an e troop man stood in the veterans respect nevertheless it was no longer true perhaps that the army divided into two parts those who had been at waterloo and those who had not but the army was just as divided in its opinion of the future it was true certainly that no officer believed in his heart there would be a battle the like of waterloo again never so many men in the field at once never so great a number of guns and worst of all for those of herveys calling never again so many cavalry manoeuvring to decisive effect no not even in india what therefore would be their fate was it to be as mere spectators from afar even as in burma a pretty corps of escorts in uniforms more and more elaborate and less and less serviceable or would they just become a corps of skirmishers little better than pandours and croats hervey had his opinions they were formed in the peninsula confirmed at waterloo and proven often enough these past three years perhaps he would write of them write a book as peto had suggested many would sneer at his doing so of course but he didnt care not any longer good morning captain hervey said the veterinary surgeon ah david good morning david sledge was the only officer habitually called by his christian name from colonel to cornet the veterinary surgeon stood in a curious position regarding rank and seniority and the sixth had come to an admirable working arrangement you wanted to see me no not especially only to say that i am returned to duty i gather i have a fit troop armstrong took his leave there were things he would attend to with serjeant collins them gramgrinders sir still not sized off hervey nodded then turned to sledge again it says a good deal for armstrong that parade state yes very satisfactory said sledge checking his pocketbook not a cough nor a warm leg in the stables these past six weeks and i take my hat off to brennan too hervey had long been convinced that e troop had the best farrier and so much steadier was brennan these days with a fellow countryman in mccarthy to share tobacco and grog with and a fellow with stripes to boot i shall tell him but hes had light work in respect of numbers i see a good dozen short do you know what are the remount arrangements the purchase of remounts was not the business of the veterinary surgeon but he had an obvious interest nothings coming from the company studs this year apparently so its all down to dealers when youre ready to look ill come with you if youd like weve kept the lines free of infection all year and i shouldnt want anything brought in on approval hervey smiled david i should value your opinion on more than just the animals health but not for a day or so i think unless you say others will be looking too ill ask the rm as well sledge looked pained broads not been in best sorts of late ledleys had to dose him a good deal fever sledge still looked pained noo well i hope whatever is the cause he will not be indisposed long ive seen no better man with remounts i shall be seeing him later i will pass on your regard hervey scowled come david you are not telling me all sledge looked relieved to be explicit its a case for mercury and nitrate oh god groaned hervey but what of annie broad has she gone home or something sledge raised his eyebrows i should ask rose what been drawing his yard there it seems better not speak of it here hervey shook his head slowly is it much talked about what the mercury or rose both neither generally but the mercurys out in the ranks i think the rose business broad himself told me but not here hervey can you come to my dispense later hervey finished his tour of the horse lines alone then went to the troop office where he found myles vanneck and his new cornet green good morning hervey said vanneck and with evident pleasure even though his captains return meant he would no longer have charge of things hervey had found it easy leaving the troop in his lieutenants hands it was after all what was intended by the name of that rank but in myles vanneck he had especial trust as much as he had known in seton canning even vanneck had been with the sixth scarcely five years but he had taken to command with the greatest of ease the same ease indeed as that of his elder brother in the eighteenth whom hervey had known in the peninsula and vanneck had been lucky too for the means to buy a lieutenancy when the time came had been but a trifle to him at india rates though when it was his turn for a captaincy the regiment would for sure be back in england and he would thereby have to pay well over price not that that should present the honourable myles vanneck with too much difficulty however lord huntingfields sons did not go in want of anything and it was one of the reasons that hervey so liked him for he could easily have bought into a home regiment and enjoyed the pleasures of london or brighton rather than the dust and heat and the doubtful society of calcutta and of course the young cornet vanneck had comported himself so admirably in the affair of the river blue blood and not afraid to shed it it was hardly surprising the men regarded him hervey smiled and took off his cap this is cornet green hervey held out his hand which the cornet took a shade hesitantly how dyou do sir said green the cavalrymans coup doeil was not always faithful when it came to the man rather than the situation that much hervey would freely acknowledge but green was not of the usual stamp that much was impossible not to observe he looked ungainly a touch heavylimbed to be a man at home in the saddle and his features were a deal less fine than the subalterns prided themselves on in the few words of his salutation he revealed that he came from the north of england although that in itself said nothing for the proud and independent gentry of the northern counties had provided many a son to the regiment during the war but there was just something no thought hervey here indeed was a queer card when did you come he asked with deliberate kindness three months ago sir did you come via the depot no sir nothing more volunteered than the precise answer this was going to be heavy vanneck sought to help he has bought two fine chargers i might say one of them was that bay of williamss in the bodyguard hervey nodded i much approve i had a mind to buy him myself if ever he came up thank you sir greens hair was sticking up by his right temple like a ducks tuft hervey found himself staring at it vanneck kept trying green was just about to go to the adjutant hes picketofficer today so i see said hervey glancing at the cornets review order greens tunic and all looked in themselves immaculate but even mr gieves best efforts could not make a military coat hang well on a dumpling very good green said hervey trying hard not to sound dismayed cwell speak at length tomorrow when your duties are done cornet green coloured a little put on his shako askew but hervey thought best to say nothing the adjutant would correct it soon enough saluted and took his leave when he had gone hervey sat down and looked at vanneck quizzically vanneck sighed i know but he means well the others have given him quite a rousting though his nicknames grocer green i suppose vanneck nodded that and his fathers a tea merchant in lincolnshire he paused then added in stamford as if that fact might be of some use hervey smiled ruefully evidently they drink a lot of tea in stamford if he can afford williamss bay oh hes not short of money on the contrary the trouble is his ambition is rather in advance of his capability hes yet to pass out of riding school indeed i did tell him that he might buy a more tractable charger to begin with but he seemed keen to make a splash poor fellow yes and the rms been sick the while so the roughriders have had their fun with him im afraid hervey laid his cap and whip on the table cant you help at all myles im doing just that hervey i take him out beyond the syces huts late of an afternoon where theres no one to see but im not sure he has the hands or legs for it and im pretty sure he hasnt the head oh dear and the drill season about to start quite im afraid the dragoons have a poor opinion of him already hes too stiff about the place its hardly surprising from what you tell me but there have been stiffnecks before he can overcome that in time you will keep at him myles vanneck sighed yes hervey of course i will but the others have no such duty as they see it the trouble is he has no conversation and seemingly no interests at mess the other night even the chaplain gave up on him and then he fell off his chair quite stupefied the chaplain no green hervey smiled again well there at least is sign of a kindred spirit is there not vanneck smiled too you would think so but to hear them youd imagine the cornets had become temperance methodists seems a hopeless case then but vannecks sense of propriety took hold again there must have been worse hervey its perhaps because theres scarce been anything to do these last few months but bear the heat and the rain it was a decent response and hervey would not gainsay it though in truth he could not think of another officer who had made so unpromising a beginning how has armstrong been by the way it would be impossible to praise him excessively thats as i supposed how is his family all well i understand mrs armstrong is schoolmistress again theres an ayah for the three babies hervey faltered just an instant at being reminded there were now three big babies two of them yes they brought the eldest to stables the other evening hervey made an effort to collect himself now we must speak of the state of the troop i think i had better look at the order books of late and then perhaps the acquittance rolls but first he would need to see the muster and vanneck looked pained as he opened it at the first page for it seemed there were as many names struck through with red as not hervey stared at it forlornly he had shaken the hand of every man on attesting these had been his dragoons the red pen strokes looked every bit as bloody as the sabres and not a fraction as glorious chapter seven family matters three days later herveys little marwari stood motionless head down to her knees the fever so great that her neck and flanks ran with sweat as if she had just galloped a mile what do you think david the veterinary surgeon shook his head as he felt the mares chest and belly a most violent swelling malignant certainly when did it first come to notice private johnson answered last night sir when i came after watchsetting shed broken out a bit on er neck an shed left er feed what exercise had she had an hour in the mornin sir in hand sledge stepped back to look at the mare again by common practice i should draw at least two quarts of blood but i hold with it less and less he shook his head if the bloods poisoned it will have some beneficial effect but otherwise well only weaken an already weak animal and i think shes going to need her strength im content to follow your advice said hervey sounding mystified ive not seen a horse looking as she what do you suppose it is sledges brow furrowed more the inflammation quite possibly it is tumorous too early to say though it might be a case of the feltoric i think we had better purge her hervey nodded and turned to his groom johnson ay sir i can make up the purgative myself if you want said sledge putting his coat back on we can do that well enough cant we johnson sir sledge turned to herveys groom a full quart of hot gruel with four ounces of electuary of senna and double of castor oil put in a measure of glaubers salts too right sir you shall have to watch her carefully johnson i must know if theres any material change and the swelled part must be rubbed twice daily with the blistering oils come to the dispense and ill have my assistant give you a good measure right sir and ill make a fever ball she may take it at evening stables johnson nodded again writing carefully in his notebook give her only warm water in small quantities mind and the same with mashes three or four times in the day she might be tempted but she will require every attention of course sir good man they left johnson to begin his ministrations and walked back along the troop lines you dont think we need move her asked hervey sledge shook his head i see nothing she might transmit best keep her be hervey said nothing they walked a few more steps youll have heard about the rm last night no the rising cadence suggested hervey was now alerted however blind drunk and put to bed by the picket he was not surprised he hadnt heard it might be a shade embarrassing for the riding master this morning but hardly of great moment and he was ranting against rose oh yes hervey thought for a moment how did you come to hear of it i saw it i was called out to the colic in b troop broad could be heard the other side of the lines then it is known about officially i dont know for sure but i think not i told the picketcorporal to say nothing that was a bold thing to have done for an officer who held no powers of command thought hervey and humane too who was it someone from a troop i forget his name did you speak of broad and rose with joynson by the way when three days ago sledge had told hervey all he knew they had talked about it long and in the end they had decided that hervey would speak confidentially with the commanding officer but now he shook his head i had thought to speak first with rose as soon as he comes back from his shooting i think id better apprise joynson now though its not right that we dont warn him if its come to this rather a fine mess in the making id say well it wouldnt be the first time hervey you seem remarkably phlegmatical you misjudge me if you think i approve rose has not acted like a gentleman theres scarce more to say is there not acted like a gentleman i doubt rose would see it that way since hed not recognize broad as one just like a bit of foolery with a housemaid really dont be too hard david it seems ten times worse here than if we were in hounslow and mrs broads a deuced handsome woman sledge held his peace instead he stopped at one of the stalls to look over the new grey that hervey had bought for his trumpeter the talk in the wet canteen by the way is of money changing hands between barrow and nirmal sen hervey sighed two of the troopleaders on the primrose path and for all to see he felt sorry for the major ay johnson told me last night how do these things get abroad it could hardly have come from nirmal sen he cant very well own to bribing a company official so you suppose the talk is accurate i suppose no such thing you must not let on but the major spoke to me of it three days ago i told him there was no more reason to presume barrow capable of it than anyone else sledge stood up having run a hand down each of the greys legs very noble do you suppose any would agree with you hervey looked surprised if it were me or ledley or the paymaster it would be the same said sledge oh come that is a calumny on the regiment it might have been towcesters view but thats of the past sledge raised his eyebrows as if unconvinced i think you chose well this grey he said nodding to the trumpeters new pride i think it safe to pay the balance even to nirmal sen theres no question but that hes supplying good horses hervey smiled in a resigned way shall you come to evening stables of course and shall you dine i intend doing then so shall i hervey drained his coffee cup and placed it on the majors desk and that is the long and the short of it major joynson had taken off his spectacles and begun to polish them it had become so much his idiosyncrasy that hervey found himself wondering at what point the polishing would begin and the length of time and vigorousness of the polishing for this tended to indicate the process of cogitation and the degree of difficulty presented by the solution this morning the polishing had been slow and methodical suggesting that the case of rose and broad was not to be treated with summary and perhaps condign justice how much of it do you suppose is generally known hervey raised both eyebrows yes youre right said joynson wearily and if its not known about already then it can be but a matter of time broad is a sick man his wife is unfaithful and with a brother officer these things can hardly conduce to tranquillity still joynson polished what would you do were you me what could i do would i have any option but to require rose to leave major joynson had not hoped for a reply in the interrogative nevertheless it gave him an opportunity to exhaust all hope of alternatives would he have to leave the regiment sell out i mean or might he go elsewhere for a time somewhere else in india even the staff hervey paused to consider if broad had been other than riding master or another from the ranks and had rose intended marriage with mrs broad then i suppose it might just have been arranged but very evidently these are not the conditions and so rose must sell out hervey was becoming exasperated at the majors unwillingness to draw the remaining conclusion neither you nor i make the rules sir the major sighed if only we were ordered on campaign there is that i grant you said hervey but very evidently that is not a condition on which we can count either i suppose then that first i must have broad before me and ask what he wishes to be done or perhaps first i should see rose hervey sighed to himself really sir i think it makes no difference whatever you shall have to see both of them and mrs broad shall have to leave the cantonment at once hervey hesitated i think she must but do let us be kind yes yes said the major suddenly increasing the speed of his polishing oh dear poor woman poor woman these things in my experience are never quite as the commandments suggest hervey was not sure of the majors point but he judged it of no matter and as for the tattle about barrow im afraid i can add nothing but that david sledge has told me it is the talk of the wet canteen indeed i had heard so myself major joynson stopped his polishing and replaced his spectacles very well i shall summon nirmal sen we had better lance this sore in the same way hervey got up and took his cap the major took off his glasses and unaccountably began polishing again oh and hervey i am very gratified by your counsel as you say neither you nor i make the rules no sir and in that connection i would urge you most earnestly to look to your own arrangements regarding regarding your arrangements there has been talk i hear in the drawing rooms that night in the mess there were few officers and hervey more tired than he had supposed after his first full day in uniform had not been greatly inclined to join them however he had been absent from the table for so long that he thought it a positive duty to dine he had arrived not many minutes before the khansamah announced dinner and found himself at once the senior it was the sixths custom for the most junior dining officer to sit on the seniors left with any guest of the mess on the other hand it was usually an agreeable position to find oneself in for both senior and junior but this evening hervey found that it promised otherwise for the junior was cornet green and the senior of the two guests was the bishops chaplain there at the invitation of seton canning with whom he had been at school reverend sir said hervey as they stood by their chairs would you say grace benedic domine began the bishops chaplain solemnly and continued at some length per jesum christum dominum nostrum amen answered the table as best they could when at last he was finished strickland made the sign of the cross evidence indeed of sir ivos benevolent dominion poor strickland had almost been forced onto half pay by lord towcesters malignance in matters of religion hervey turned to his right as they sat to begin what he feared must be an unedifying conversation he had formed no very high opinion of the bishop of calcutta and he supposed his chaplain to be of the same stamp but from the other side of the table the senior lieutenant addressed him on behalf of the subalterns we were deliberating sir on the efficacy of the sabres point as against the edge and wondered what was your opinion in the matter hervey was taken aback somewhat indeed he suspected a prank it had never been the sixths custom to speak of matters of this sort and oliver finucane had certainly shown no previous zeal he glanced at the other subalterns each of them showing quite extraordinary attention except vanneck whose eyes were lowered and wondered what transformation there might have been in the months of his absence i am not rightly sure it is a proper subject to discuss in front of a guest such as mr stephenson he replied with a note that implied he would somehow welcome clarification oh do not desist for my part implored the chaplain these are matters of very evident moment to gentlemen of your calling hervey would rather have received a less enthusiastic endorsement of the subject which now commanded the attention of the whole table and which the serving of soup did nothing to abate it is not reducible to an absolute position it depends on the nature of the engagement and opinion would also vary depending whether we spoke of the old or the newpattern sabre but it is so is it not continued finucane that but three or four inches of the point only is generally sufficient to despatch an adversary whereas a cut will wound him only albeit perhaps grievously true but if you close with your adversary at speed which is to what cavalry ought to aim then it is not easy to draw back the blade after the thrust home i have known of swords being struck from the hand or breaking with the hilt striking a mans breast after the blade had run through his body hervey did not see cornet greens face drain rapidly of its colour only that he suddenly sprang up with hand clasped to mouth and rushed from the room there was much laughter hervey now saw what was the game and was in two minds about being used in the subalterns rag but he could not find it in him to show it something i said he asked with an expression of forced solemnity seton canning shook his head in mock despair vanneck continued to look down and the others stifled their sniggers as best they could the rest of dinner was a wearying affair for the chaplains conversation proved as uninteresting as it was wholesome he seemed entirely in innocence of what had passed so that there was little profit in herveys trying to explain it and instead there followed a tedious dialogue on the state of the various missions to hindoostan afterwards when the port had circulated twice hervey led the party back to the anteroom where a game of primero was got up he himself stood aloof from it taking his brandy and soda the married officers nightcap the sweetener of libatory breath seton canning came up i fear youve had not so diverting an evening stephenson can be earnest but hes a good man and he can still thrash me at fives hervey smiled he must have thought me very dull i fear i had little by way of conversation i confess my mind was otherwise engaged agreeably i hope as it happens no harry seton canning had joined the sixth just before waterloo and had been cornet during the battle when hervey found himself in command of a troop canning had indeed brought the troop out of the charge against the french lancers to the acclaim of many an old hand but until late he had been herveys subordinate and the two had never become quite as close as officers might who had shared so much today however they were equals in rank just as they were equals in society disagreeably on account of barrow perhaps hervey looked surprised at the mention though he knew it was unreasonable to be as a matter of fact yes and other things what is your opinion i dont have one for at present there are no facts as i discern but are you inclined to think it the smoke and the fire hervey frowned harry i have said i am not inclined to think anything without facts but whats to be done about barrow there cant be this talk for long its not good for any of us joynsons to have it out with nirmal sen i think there might have to be a board of officers seton canning frowned that would be tricky in the circumstances what circumstances are these exactly harry you know perfectly well barrow has never been popular hes always kept himself to himself and and what well with this other business rose i mean hervey sighed there was no doubting that the rose business would divide opinion in the mess and a divided mess was not a good place from which to assemble a board of officers then it would be better to have a board of officers from another regiment an unhappy day that will be he put his empty glass on the khitmagars tray declining more i beg you will excuse me harry i want to see my mare before retiring shes running a high fever i had thought to see david sledge at mess this evening but yes of course said seton canning taking another glass of port i hope i shall not be long detained myself where do you suppose your new cornet is by the way he added with a wry smile david sledge wore a long smock like a shepherds and he was looking grave im sorry not to have dined but johnson sent word soon after evening stables he feared she was about to have a seizure ive been with her since i thought it best not to trouble you until after mess im afraid i see no alternative to opening up the tumour shes deteriorated so quickly i wouldnt lay odds on her seeing the morning hervey simply nodded there was evidently no alternative to the knife the trouble was that sledge knew little more than hervey in the matter he had his manuals for reference but he had seen nothing the like of these symptoms i must warn you its a desperate remedy the bloods in so bad a state it renders it difficult to bring the wounds to a good digestion and if this is not effected therell be a gangrene and mortification hervey understood where is johnson by the way i sent him for brandy i find it has admirable cleansing properties better than water for digesting dirt and blood and it will preserve the flesh too hervey smiled to himself how alike seemed the methods of a good surgeon and a veterinarian sledge opened his valise and laid out the tools of his trade on the manger lancet probe scalpels forceps clamps a cautery and two needles with gut already threaded and a great quantity of lint and a large bottle of green liquid johnson returned soon afterwards with two flasks of arrack sledge took one of them poured a good measure onto a handful of lint and began swabbing the mares swollen breast a bit more light please johnson and then this if you will he handed him the cautery johnson shifted the oil lamps closer then set about lighting the cautery stove sledge crouched looking at the swelling for some time touching occasionally to feel for a vein then he picked up the lancet very well lets try to expunge the malignance he made five incisions in all using the scalpel to elongate the lancets work after each one he expressed a quantity of fluid and blood wiping the wound gently with arrack before studying it closely with his magnifying glass throughout the mare remained perfectly still her resignation warmed hervey to her the more he leaned forward as far as he could to see at close hand the veterinarians art what do you think david im tempted to make more incisions from each theres come a good deal of corruption but theres a greater risk of mortification each time no i think ill cauterize now and sew up the two longer incisions johnson johnson handed him the cautery i thought thered be more blood sir yes i think i did too it seems that bad blood was likely not the cause of the inflammation it was as well we didnt bleed her this morning johnsons admiration for sledge these days was as great as it had been for his predecessor selden selden had elevated the sixths veterinary method from farriers lore to science and sledge had confirmed the regiment in that practice i wish she would take a little feed though nothing at all you say johnson not a thing since yesterday sir and the purgative not ad a lot of effect sir mm when he had done with cautery and needle and had dressed the wounds with the green digestive ointment sledge turned to hervey colic is the immediate concern i worry about her gut twisting if shes eating nothing a watch on her all night and call me at once at any sign of distress hervey nodded thank you david ay sir thank you added johnson moving the lamps back to safety sledge nodded wiped his instruments clean with lint and arrack put them in his valise and bid them both goodnight ill bed down ere then sir said johnson when he was gone thank you yes i have some matters to attend to first and then ill come in the early hours and relieve you id rather tha didnt sir i wouldnt want it said i couldnt stag for a night hervey smiled very well ill come before muster though and if you have to send for mr sledge then send for me too right sir es good mr sledge he is said hervey gently pulling the mares ear and as good a man too when not wielding a knife there was a light in the bungalow next to his when an hour after midnight hervey walked the cantonment road he paused for a moment then turned down the path to the door the chowkidar squatting on his haunches at the foot of the verandah steps stood and made the exaggerated salute which native servants thought correct in acknowledging the soldiersahibs good evening chowkidar is the sahib returned home said hervey in confident bengali the chowkidar nodded his head vigorously gesturing with his night stick towards the door hervey ascended the three steps to the verandah and pulled at the bell rope the bearer came quickly saluting as high as the chowkidar and admitted him at once captain barrowsahib captain herveysahib is come he called as he closed the mosquito door barrow appeared in his shirtsleeves glass in hand what are you doing up and about at this time hervey youre not captain of the week hervey smiled as best he could ive been with sledge he had to cut up my mare oh whats her problem the voice of birmingham was always that much more pronounced when barrow had had a drink or two the feltoric he thinks lord will you have a peg yes thank you brandy hervey hoped it would wash away the dispirits as effectively as it had the blood brandypani for captain hervey ranga the bearer produced glass decanter and bottle as hervey settled himself into a chair and began to pour no ranga chota brandy hervey protested although his instinct was to take a very large measure indeed a good evening at mess was it yes though we were few only seton canning of the captains im not long back from calcutta one of the shitpoor road wallahs quite a tamasha it was fine wine hock and best burgundy and women hervey nodded noncommittally barrow smiled or boys for that matter i suspect you know these bengalis hervey had been to tamashas at the merchants houses in the early days they were lavish affairs and the generosity of the hosts could indeed be great some of the merchants were undoubtedly men of culture and sensibility and he supposed of honour who merely enjoyed the company of the sahibs but all the sahibs knew that the entertainment was in some expectation of pecuniary benefit barrow made no secret of his enjoying the hospitality however much the proper officers might disdain it he was never entirely at home in the mess and it was hardly surprising that he found his situation as guest of honour in a merchants house so agreeable in any case it gave hervey his pretext whose tamasha was it the man i bought my last lot of remounts from and good they were too nirmal sen is that you know im hervey thought it unworthy of their long acquaintance to dissemble barrow im sorry to put this to you thus but tomorrow joynson will call nirmal sen to orderly room and question him about rumours of you and him dealing improperly barrow looked stunned im sorry it seems the rumours are abroad so much that joynson feels he has no alternative but to act formally i understand he will ask to speak with you first in case in case what in case i imagine that you wish first to say anything barrow drained his glass and what might there be to say hervey saw a face he had never before seen barrow had looked death in the eye and defiantly many a time yet now he had the look of a fearful man the eyes spoke of losing all not simply life and for the first time hervey imagined him guilty what a wreckage he had wrought in but a few seconds i dont know ezra i truly dont do you think me capable of a corrupt thing hervey you know me better than most and longer what was the point in expounding on the doctrine of original sin at such a time loyalty demanded that hervey support him now to me it is inconceivable barrow stared at him as if trying to judge his sincerity and what do you suppose the others would answer rose and seton canning and strickland i cannot say he knew it to be false at least in the one case why should they answer different from me you know why hervey you know very well why barrows bearer returned to refill their glasses hervey wanted no more but it was not possible to refuse at such a moment barrow drained his new glass at once and held it out again burra peg ranga and leave the bottle and be off and tomorrow morning my best dress acha sahib he left looking anxious he knows summats up said barrow scarcely waiting for him to leave the room probably did before you said a word before you came even whole cantonments probably jawing me dead ezra barrow on the picaro what dye expect from one as is no better than us or them if its rose an is like theres no cause to think that way isnt there isnt there indeed hervey you think me a fool i wasnt wanted when lord george brought me in but i never flinched from doing what was right on account of popularity that might go for many a man brought in but there arent that many that get field promotion what does that speak for the regard in which those who mattered held you hold you indeed hervey youve no idea what its like to be despised from above and below for all their years in arms together hervey had no wish to debate with a man in his cups if he had made a mistake in coming here in the first place there was little to be gained by staying and if he had not then barrow needed not brandy and commiseration but sleep and a clear head to hold up high in the morning he stood up forgive me barrow its been a long day ay that it has home then to your bibi captain hervey the colonel wouldnt like it you being a proper officer and all but its nothing like the sin of being a ranker hervey picked up his forage cap good night barrow ill come tomorrow morning an hour later as hervey lay beside his bibi in the moments before sleep there was a shot he knew its cause at once and the stab in his gut was as if the ball had struck him too chapter eight hallowed ground three days later the coroner was disobliging although joynson and hervey had gone to considerable trouble to sow doubt in the minds of the jury that upright officer of the court had summed up in such a manner as to make that doubt seem unreasonable under oath hervey had been unable to give any indication that barrow had wanted to clean his pistols at that time of night and so the suggestion that he might have could be but speculation and why indeed just the one pistol it was the greatest pity that the inquest was not held under military jurisdiction accident or misadventure was not the probable cause the jury decided but death by the officers own hand the verdict presented joynson with several problems the most pressing of which was barrows funeral and interment the chaplain who had turned a blind eye to the rubrics when private sisken had hanged himself aboard ship during the regiments passage east found himself in some difficulty on this occasion for the circumstances were known to the entire city and episcopal supervision was very much closer at hand however when it had become known in the canteens that barrow could not be buried in the consecrated ground that was the regiments corner of the cantonment cemetery a deputation had come to the rsm ncos and sweats mainly but not exclusively from barrows troop to request in no uncertain terms that the captain be laid to rest alongside the other poor souls whove succumbed to this place accordingly and on the recommendation of the rsm joynson had summoned the chaplain adding materially to his troubles by insisting it be done the chaplain was tolerated respected even to an unusual degree in the sixth it was well remembered that he had stood up to lord towcester in the matter of private hopwoods flogging so far as he had been able which was in truth not very far and there had been private siskens committal at sea when all who heard his address had been much moved indeed there had been many occasions since when the chaplains funerary eloquence had been displayed altogether too many occasions for so small a regiment but in barrows case the chaplains solution was the officers all agreed worthy of a jesuit an hour before the funeral he conducted a ceremony of deconsecration limited to the ground that had been prepared to receive the coffin and had then read over barrows mortal remains in the usual way in the sure and certain hope and all the other ringing phrases that somehow gave succour to usually godless men who stood in ranks fearful that the next time might be theirs there was no carouse afterwards though the canteen was a dull place that evening and few officers were at mess hervey himself did not dine an omission that made him feel uncomfortable for he had berated poor green for not having the pluck to return to the mess the night he had parted with the contents of his stomach no one had so much as suggested it was unfortunate that he had called on barrow that evening for there was a supposition that the outcome was preordained and indeed barrows act had spared the major and those about him the shame of an investigation above all it had spared the regiment the dread board of officers from outside barrows guilt was presumed by the very fact of his noble action yet hervey felt his own hand in the business and he did not rest easy joynson had asked him to be president of the board of adjustment which would make an inventory of barrows possessions so that those of a personal nature might be sent to his next of kin when that detail was discovered and all else sold at regimental auction as was customary this hervey had now done by himself and at the expense of dinner in the mess for it had occupied the entire evening after stables but that was no matter it afforded him an alibi it had been a thoroughly melancholy job so much more than he had imagined whatever his pleasures on the chitpore road barrows habits had been sober and moderate his practice soldierly and prudent his possessions were few and utilitarian nothing out of the ordinary and if he had gained pecuniary advantage in his dealings with nirmal sen there was no evidence of its enjoyment here barrows papers were no more elaborate than his other possessions but there was one letter that indicated to where joynson might write his condolences and indeed the trouble he would have composing them the superscription in a spidery hand read the almshouses yardley and the signature your ever proud father when he had finished close to midnight hervey bade the bearer secure the bungalow and left trusting him to the job what opportunity of thieving could there be indeed if he had a list of everything anyway ranga looked sad and it could not have been for his own situation for he had already been offered another it pleased hervey to think there was other than a father who had some attachment to barrow for although he himself had slowly come to respect the mans capability as a soldier he had never been able to count him a boon companion he walked slowly to his own bungalow it was a cold night for all that it was not long since the monsoon the stars were as bright as in the peninsula those long bitterchill nights when he had learned so much about the heavens and the air was sweet perhaps with incense or spices he could not tell a barn owl hooted it seemed strange to think that ezra barrow was no longer on this earth when all else remained the same but things had changed tonight would be the last time he enjoyed the companionship of his bibi here tomorrow he would set her up in a little haveli outside the cantonments like so many others and it really would not be the same next day the sixth busied themselves more than usual things had to be brought back to good order and quickly and nothing helped so much as activity especially when it was compelled by an rsm of mr lincolns mettle there were inspections all morning and drill all afternoon and at colonels rounds of evening stables the major though it was never his bent made a very passable attempt at what the regiment knew as jaldi at any rate he managed to roust about the more timid at midday the adjutant had conducted the auction of barrows effects usually when a widow was known to the officers or else the family it was an occasion for generous overbidding to provide a gratuity that a grateful government could not find itself able to disburse in barrows case there had always been mixed feelings although in the end there was a grim admiration for his ultimate gesture of honour the major it was agreed excelled himself opening the auction by telling the assembled bidders to where the money would be sent declaring that a man is more than his worst error and that captain ezra barrow had served his king for over thirty years and the sixth for more than fifteen at the end of the proceedings the adjutant announced that the sum of ј would be sent to mr joshua barrow of the almshouses yardley near birmingham it was a handsome figure and in the curious way of these things it did something to restore the pride of those assembled for in the last resort they had not let down their erstwhile comrade and loyalty was nothing if it was easy barrow had certainly paid a heavy price himself a pennyworth of powder had blown away three thousand pounds at the very least for on death the value of his commission reverted to the crown that evening hervey dined with the somerviles he was especially glad to do so for as well as having the ugly circumstances of the past days to put behind him he had not seen his friends in more than a week he arrived a little late however having gone by way of the horse lines to reassure himself of the progress of his mare within a day of the veterinarians surgery the little marwari had begun to eat at first warm mashes and now hard feed the wounds had remained clean the inflammation was gone and so was the fever in so short a time hervey thought it a veritable miracle and he was extolling david sledges skill for a full quarter of an hour after arriving at no fort william and what so particularly commends him he concluded now well into his second glass of champagne is his devotion to his own greater understanding his rooms are piled with treatises and papers somervile was happy to indulge him and for practical reasons at the onset of the unhealthy season confidence in any practitioner even veterinary was reassuring calcutta is as full of quacks as anywhere fuller probably i shall ask him to dine with us he said would it be entirely proper to ask him to look at my stable i dont see why not hes not greatly engaged at present im pleased to say somervile nodded indicating that the matter was decided a khitmagar made to top up herveys glass but he declined is emma to join us yes very shortly im sorry to say she has been sick these last few days hervey supposed that few husbands in calcutta could be as direct as somervile i hope nothing no no i shouldnt think so calcuttas just a deuced sight unhealthier place than madras but emma has a native constitution i shouldnt distress yourself he would try not to difficult though that was with notice of even the slightest illness somervile seemed keen to change the subject i have some intelligence that will interest you i dare not hope it is of peto replied hervey sounding a shade despondent his last letter was a disheartening affair said he might as well be commanding a guardship i regret not not even of the war indeed for that generally proceeds ill although there are to be reinforcements and in good measure for rangoon campbell ought soon to take the offensive hervey snorted that was of course his purpose in going to rangoon in the first place somervile merely raised his eyebrows well i am glad to say that my intelligence has at least provided campbell with the means to do his job no the news i was referring to is that combermere is to replace paget hervey sat up a new commanderinchief would at any time be ripe news but now and the name combermere it was the ripest is this the governorgenerals doing it would be ill indeed if paget is to take the blame for things in ava oh no theres no suggestion of pagets being relieved his tenure in command is routinely ended indeed the change if our intelligence is correct will not be until next year but combermere is a friend of yours is he not hervey smiled i could hardly claim that we have met on occasions and he has a good memory somervile smiled broader then you shall have to meet on more occasions and place yourself at the forefront of his memory hervey smiled again but that indeed was how it was done hed seen it time and again perhaps if he had not been so keen to leave the duke of wellingtons staff he would by now be well placed for advancement instead of in truth having marked time a full ten years and he hardly dared admit it with things as they were in the sixth what future was there at regimental duty in calcutta nothing happened other than death by natures hand or ones own for every regiment had its barrow we must see emma somervile came in she looked well enough thought hervey but the rouge did not entirely mask her pallor she sat next to her husband on a highbacked settee and placed her hand on his and how are you in the circumstances matthew hervey returned her smile in the circumstances well i believe i am troubled to learn you are not in the best of sorts however emma frowned oh these things but tell me what else have you been speaking of i was telling him the news of lord combermeres being appointed to commanderinchief my dear emma brightened again yes good news for you matthew is it not tell me of him he was at the best of schools hervey smiled just a little wryly she at once understood and turned to her husband with mock solemnity a very long time in advance of me my dear and i do not recall his name in academic honours he was a great man for campaigning added hervey since the peninsula though he has not been at field duty there again neither indeed has anyone other than here in india i confess i dont know how things are in ireland hes commanderinchief there so i understand too said somervile well he is going to need a very fine head upon those fine military shoulders of his to ravel up the mess in ava and believe me theres trouble brewing in hindoostan too every week that we flounder in rangoon and arakan for that matter since it seems little better there the malcontents among the country powers grow more impudent but amherst wont see it he glanced at emma and shook his head a shade wearily oh yes be in no doubt if combermere takes the reins here hell be pitched into the middle of trouble east and west shall we go and dine said emma looking a little anxious and making to stand ghulam says we may somervile was on his feet at once with a hand to emmas elbow but she rose unaided i really am in fine health eyre she insisted using her fan just a touch i should have returned a little earlier from the assembly that is all the dining room minded hervey of home for whereas the mess and his bungalow were handsome enough they were woodbuilt and the houses at fort william were stone and there was a solidity about the place that spoke more of the permanence of the honourable company than could the military lines whose occupants were after all mere birds of passage the furniture and fittings were mahogany teak and brass rather than the quartermasters pine cane and pewter and the family portraits here and not at some english seat said that the somerviles were india people native almost as eyre somervile himself had once said emma had been to england as she always called it not home but once in the dozen and more years since she had first joined her brother in madras her husband had not been even once how is your groom she asked as a khitmagar began to serve them soup and that corporal of yours the one who brought you to the ship wainwright you mean herveys face at once registered intense pride without whom i should not be enjoying your hospitality now im pleased to say he has been advanced to the head of the seniority roll he may be corporal full before the years out bound to be at this time of year said somervile without looking up from his soup hervey smiled disconcertedly there are other ways somervile somervile continued to give all his ocular attention to his soup men putting bullets in their brains you mean eyre somervile at last looked up emmas scold was not to be ignored what i meant said hervey not in the least perturbed is that serjeants leave or are promoted making vacancies below nothing more im glad to hear it said somervile as if it were well known to be otherwise and when do you suppose it will be the same for officers in essentials it is replied hervey sounding cautious humph you and i know its a case of money and little more how much would a majority cost you hervey looked rueful another thousand at least if we were posted home probably twice as much somervile smiled then your toasts should be to a short war but a bloody one eyre i really think this a most unedifying line emma protested but hervey was now smiling no emma that was the toast in the peninsula grim perhaps but that is the soldiers way with his humour he turned back to somervile we shouldnt forget the brevet theyre a good deal easier to come by here than in england there were a fair number in rangoon as i recall what is a brevet asked emma promotion in the army as a whole but not in the regiment as such its all very well if you want a life on the staff the khitmagars began clearing away the soup breaking the line of conversation for the moment but how are things otherwise matthew asked emma as the khansamah poured a little claret for her husband to taste we have so missed our visits to the regiment the officers are well somervile nodded a good vintage predating even bonaparte hervey inclined his head as if to say the reply would not be straightforward for the most part i suppose things are pretty good oh no more than pretty good that sounds ill to me emma knew him better than he sometimes remembered hervey braced himself to tell the truth i fear we shall have another todo hugh rose yes rose has been dallying with the riding masters wife and i fear joynson must have him quit the place emma raised her eyebrows that is sad for all his company is always much sought after if i were joynson id be looking for some way to keep him her husband declared rose is a good officer from what i see indeed he is said hervey helping himself to a fair portion of beef from the khitmagars salver and ill warrant hed be the hero of any battle but you know very well what is the principle that joynson has to abide by somervile had drained his glass even before the beef came to him and he now heaped double rations onto his plate ay i know well enough but im also of a mind that joynsons going to need good men about him and sooner than he supposes next morning after exercise hervey was called to regimental headquarters there he found the major in even lower spirits than before the barrow affair had been one thing but rose and the riding master and for that matter the succession of rsms was quite another whereas with barrow the course of action was clear and he trusted he had dealt deftly with it his other trials required much thought before action and much thought in these matters lowered the spirits but you declared that rose would have to leave when last we spoke said hervey shaking his head he had no special wish to see rose go he shared somerviles pragmatic view that if the war clouds had actually been gathering something could be done but manifestly this was not the case circumstances have changed hervey im not sure that i wish to have the captains ranks so thinned it will be deuced unsettling joynson took off his spectacles and pulled the silk square from his sleeve yes i can see that but rose has asked for leave and im inclined to grant it broad must go somewhere a bit healthier for a month or so too hervey wondered what was the imperative for joynsons change of mind though the major was ever a cautious man in my view sir it will merely put off the moment for action might make it more difficult indeed but that is a judgement and i of course respect yours thats gratifying at least replied joynson polishing and frowning and ive settled on deedes for rsm though i expect ill live to regret it hervey sighed you would have jumped both and taken hairsine yes that way at least youd be assured of a good rsm the other consequences you would just have to deal with dont imagine i didnt think hard on that solution but with things as they are i am certain it is better to have as few causes for immediate discord as possible incidentally i have asked sledge to conduct an enquiry into the barrow business i dont regard the matter closed with the universal supposition of his guilt hervey was surprised he smiled and nodded im glad youre pleased for ive unwelcome news for you asshetonsmith shall have b troop i should very much like vanneck to replace him herveys face fell not vanneck not now not with that idiot boy as my cornet i have first to think of the regiment and vanneck would make the better adjutant than any other hervey cast about for the obvious alternative but soon realized that joynsons assertion was unchallengeable shall there be a replacement for vanneck i really cant asshetonsmiths lieutenancy will be for the buying i imagine perry will have it hervey sighed again perry had the makings for sure but hed seen nothing more than a couple of seasons drill i havent finished hervey though this should not be unwelcome news i want you to take your troop to dehli for a month or so hervey was indeed brightened dehli why this morning i received word from the brigadier that a troop was to be sent within the week as escort to the resident i have no other details of the assignment as yet it is by no means unwelcome news not at all though it would be a deal more welcome if i had vanneck with me and not green but are you sure you would not want me to be here in the circumstances i should prefer that skinners horse did the dehli duty but the governorgeneral was apparently quite explicit on the matter kings troops on the whole i think it right that it should be you it would seem strange otherwise you are next senior to strickland and his leave is more overdue than anyones it was true not even strickland could be expected to give up home leave for a month in dehli then i suppose i had better make ready at once am i at liberty to speak to the engineer i see no reason why not is that all sir yes hervey that is all unless unless what would you dine with us this evening of course joynson i should be delighted there was even more satisfaction in the majors smile however and had hervey known it relief shall we say seven hervey nodded replaced his cap and took his leave there were any number of things he would rather do especially with only a few nights remaining in calcutta for he knew perfectly well why he was bidden to the majors table but how he might be expected to exert any benign influence in frances joynsons direction he could not think regimental duty was a queer thing at times only later did hervey realize that in going at once to dehli he would miss the rsms wedding and it displeased him it was not just that it was already being spoken of as the best tamasha in bengal undoubtedly to be the most notable event in the living memory of the serjeants mess rather it was an instinct that he should just be there he decided at once that he would leave armstrong behind until after the nuptials for to do otherwise would have been a deprivation to both his serjeantmajor and the rsm and indeed to caithlin armstrong for lincoln had become a regular guest at their table since their return to the regiment armstrong greeted the news exactly like a serjeantmajor who knew where his duty lay an itll do collins the power of good to wear a fourth stripe for a while he added for good measure myles vanneck was not so pleased he had no desire to leave the nominal administrative duties of trooplieutenant for the weighty ones of adjutant and he certainly had no need of the modest increase in pay the adjutant of a cavalry regiment by long custom came from the ranks often he came from another regiment as barrow had done asshetonsmith had been the first gentlemanadjutant as his fellows had soon dubbed him in mock reference to the hyphen in his name the first not counting dauntsey that is which none of the officers did the trouble was he had done so fine a job that it was natural for joynson to wish to replace him with another of his like and indeed joynson also held the novel notion that an officer might be the better troopcaptain and ultimately even colonel for having seen the workings of the orderly room come what may all vannecks protests were to no avail by the end of the morning he had handed the various ledgers to cornet arthur perry and taken his seat in regimental headquarters meanwhile hervey had been at the garrison engineers searching for the requisite maps and dak instructions as the crow flew dehli lay in excess of seven hundred miles and by the dak route nearly eight with the marching norm for cavalry being twelve leagues a day it would be a journey of three weeks and an occasion for sport and other pleasant diversions which could scarcely have come at a better time he was half disappointed therefore when that evening at dinner joynson declared it his opinion that he should stay for the wedding give perry his head a bit said the major with unusual zest they get precious little chance otherwise you and armstrongll be able to catch em up in a few days you should both be there joynsons dispensation gave hervey much cause for pleasure but it was only next day that he began to learn of the import of his mission he rode over to the somerviles in the middle of the afternoon for just that purpose feeling sure that he would learn more useful intelligence there than the commanderinchiefs office was likely to divulge emma was not at home but her husband was and deeply engrossed in his book room having come immediately from the councils luncheon table only the writers and junior officials returned to their offices of an afternoon he looked up absently as the khansamah announced his visitor oh hervey you are come very early today is there another todo not at all im for dehli with my troop for a month or so somervile was transformed in an instant at once all attention indeed i had notice yesterday that ochterlony had asked for an escort but i hadnt supposed a decision would be reached so quickly indeed im surprised ochterlony doesnt enjoy the confidence he used to have sit you down tea sherbet ghulam tea thank you and some limewater if you have it ji sahib bhat nimbu pani ghulam ji sahib that is the reason i came here to discover what i could about the assignment joynson knows nothing yet sit down sit down somervile insisted even more attentive theres trouble brewing in that direction herveys ears pricked up he had not supposed the escort wholly ceremonial but ochterlonys an old man loony ochter theyre calling him and not entirely in affection you must have heard no i have not i know of him of course everybody does there could be no one who needed reminding of his reputation majorgeneral sir david ochterlony victor of the ghoorka war a decade ago ay well hes an old man as i said i think amherst believes him a fool but ill say this too hes one of the few men with any true understanding of the country he knows when to fight and when to parley and how to fight for that matter but thats not my principal concern ghulam returned with a khitmagar bearing limewater another followed with tea a few minutes later somervile waited for them to leave before resuming and in a voice deliberately lowered id wager any amount that what lies behind this is bhurtpore theres an unholy tussle for yonder throne coming the old rajahs not long for this world by all accounts hervey looked unenlightened and this is the companys business it may well become so you have to be especially careful with sleeping dogs in india and ochterlonys backed the rightful heir the son invested him with a khelat or some such doubtless the old fox wants to parade the escort as a promise of troops from calcutta if things go against the claim and you know why bhurtpore would have the doocots aflutter here dont you we are speaking of the same bhurtpore the fortress that lord lake failed to take somervile smiled but pained the same our only defeat in two centuries when first i came out from england there was still the taunt go take bhurtpore and the truth may well be that we could no more do so now than we could then chapter nine a great tamasha two weeks later mr lincoln further added to regimental lore when the major asked if he would like to be wed as a quartermaster rather than as serjeantmajor he had replied with absolute decorum went the story that he would prefer to take the biggest fence first the wedding day had been postponed a fortnight on account of barrows death a fortnights mourning in india was a long time by all but the most fastidious standards for death was so commonplace and sudden that it was neither especially appropriate nor practical to observe the passing of one man or woman many days after the committal of their mortal remains the bereaved or the orphaned went home to england or else the former began life anew and as often as not remarried in a short time with someone in their own circumstances alternatively a widow might accept a proposal from one of the many alltooeager bachelorwriters while a widower might make one to a newarrived angel from england a member of what later wags would know as the fishing fleet the arrangements for the rsms wedding were overseen by mr lincoln himself there were to be upwards of four hundred guests all the officers and noncommissioned officers of the regiment together with a good number of the latter from the other regiments of the garrison and a surprising number of civilians and the commanderinchief for such was lincolns reputation in calcutta the marriage service would take place in the garrison church which with its double galleries had just enough space for all of the guests and the regimental band its decoration was the only arrangement that lincoln left entirely in others hands for the future mrs lincoln was a staunch member of the congregation on the day itself she and other members of her dorcas circle came early before watering parade with great boughs of greenery and bunches of vivid orchids in the regiments colours meanwhile the regimental quartermasterserjeant and his working parties were labouring in the garrison gymnasium to work a similar if secular transformation to prepare for what the future mrs lincoln delicately referred to as the wedding breakfast but which all in the sixth called the tamasha the rsm came at midday to inspect the work said not a word as he walked the assembly room as it had become then astonished the quartermasterserjeant by saying simply thank you harold the first time he had ever addressed him by his christian name indeed the quartermasterserjeant was astonished to discover that lincoln even knew it at four oclock the worst of the heat being past the first arrivals at the church heard the band strike up its programme of music the rsm confessed to having an untutored ear but he had nevertheless scrutinized the programme striking out the overture to the marriage of figaro being uncertain of its propriety and blow blow thou winter wind being certain of its ambiguity and approving more haydn and piccini instead at twenty past the hour exactly mr lincoln marched up the aisle eyes front spurs ringing as if on parade he wore review order shako under his right arm sword scabbard grasped in his left leather and metal shining as no one had quite seen either element shine before beside him in truth half a pace to the rear for the man could not bring himself to draw level even on such an occasion was his supporter deedes the senior troop serjeantmajor and next rsm on his left the same halfpace behind was his longserving orderly who now took from him his shako and gloves and handed him the service sheet lincoln made a sharp bow of the head to sir edward paget the commanderinchief and to joynson sitting in the row behind and took his place at the end of the front pew the band then struck up treue husar herr hamper had not included it in his submission for lincoln would never have approved but it was a favourite of the sixths and the best part of the congregation believed it exactly apt the murmur of approval at the end caused the bandmaster to repeat it at two minutes to halfpast the hour herr hamper and the band embarked on the final overture alceste which seemed to compose the congregation perfectly as indeed the rsm had intended when he chose the piece for its dignity and bearing the bandmaster particularly approved of the choice because it could be repeated without an obvious break in case of the customary delay in the arrival of the bride the future mrs lincoln was however a soldiers daughter and a soldiers widow and she had no intention of being as she put it late on parade at exactly the halfhour herr hamper was startled by the signal to curtail the handel and launch at once into sweet lass of richmond hill to which the bride would process to the chancel it had been an express choice for the future mrs lincoln hailed from putney where her father had been a waterman before enlisting in the artillery train but putney was close enough to richmond to make the choice of music fitting and in any case though few knew it her mother had kept the cows in richmond park together indeed with beau brummells mother as she was proud to relate she walked up the aisle on the arm of the light infantrys commanding officer in a blue dress trimmed with yellow and white which at once won the approval of all in the bridegrooms camp dearly beloved began the chaplain managing somehow to overcome the inappropriateness of the salutation and commanding a respectful silence we are gathered together in the sight of almighty god and so the old familiar words began to come like a warm breeze bringing the scent of happy memories hervey let them drift over him savouring a phrase here and there and with no regrets when it came to the homily seeing the commanderinchief sitting attentively not more than a few feet before him the chaplains nerve almost failed him but in glancing at the rsm he was suddenly more afraid of his opinion than the generals and he managed somehow to fill his lungs with sufficient air in truth he need have had no worry for he had composed what all would agree was a very proper address by no means too long at once respectful yet sound in its teaching combining as it did appropriate adulation for the rsm and all his works the recognition that in mrs lincoln the regiment had gained in his words or rather those borrowed from scripture a pearl of rare price and last but by no means least gods rightful due in this blessed state of affairs none of the parties on earth or in heaven could have been in the least disappointed there followed more singing toplady served the mood of temporary exile extraordinarily well and the signing of the register on only the second page and then as it were came the command stand at ease if not quite stand easy as mr and mrs lincoln began their march down the aisle to the bands lusty rendition of young may moon the regimental quick march here and there a brave serjeant clapped a hand on lincolns shoulder wishing him well and god bless sir the troop serjeantmajors had already slipped out of the church to form the guard of honour sabres in salute at the carry smiles broad and eyes twinkling mr lincoln took it all in not least the shine on the leather and the buttons judging with special satisfaction that armstrong was better turned out even than hairsine lincoln had never shown a moments emotion in living memory and he was not about to do so now but he could never have imagined such a day his last as rsm and he would miss not a detail of it bride and groom left for the gymnasium in a caleche which one of the nabobs had put at their disposal a gesture that said as much for the rsms personal standing in calcutta as the regiments and which those from outside the sixth could not fail to note the carriage was bedecked with ribbons blue yellow and white with two dragoons posted behind and driven by the roughrider serjeant high on the box it was a turnout fit for lord amherst himself yet none was inclined to think it in the merest degree inflated for mr lincoln especially not the private men who unknown to the rsm had lined the road from church to gymnasium in their watering order having come straight from stables the cheering could be heard all about the garrison it broke the rules of course cheering superiors was not approved of the duke of wellington himself had forbidden it for if once you permit them to cheer they may do the opposite when circumstances are not so favourable but it was the rsms last day and no regulation could adequately apply to that in the gymnasium where the sutlers little army of khitmagars were turned out in their best white mr and mrs lincoln took post to welcome their guests on the platform at the other end of the hall which served usually as a boxing booth bandsmen were taking their places the bandserjeant would direct them this time and the music would be altogether merrier with the regimental glee club joining them later with glees written for the occasion the huge punkahs hanging the length of the gymnasiums high ceiling and strung specially now began to swing the punkahwallahs in the gallery heaving for all they were worth like ringers first pulling up the bells of a sunday morning the sight which would command greatest admiration however was that evidence of the sutlers craft and the rsms generosity which lay on trestles the entire length of one wall here was a collation worthy of st jamess sides of beef mutton fowls of all kind fish lying on ice lentils rice pickles and sauces and on tables down the middle of the hall was the means to quench the thirst of the four hundred six whole hogsheads of allsops pale ale decanters of madeira for the officers and their ladies and any others who preferred it and for those whose taste was neither for beer nor strong wine punchbowls of lol shrob when the speeches came they were brisk and brief the rsms especially mr lincoln was ever a man of few words from the band platform he made his thanks to all paying handsome respects to his wife and her maids and called for three cheers for the regiment serjeantmajor deedes spoke next it was considered the form to make some jesting remarks about the bridegroom revealing past indiscretions perhaps or some embarrassing aspect of his life off parade both deedess research and nerve had failed him however and he contented himself and he hoped all who heard with a harmless story of how once in the middle of a battle in spain lincoln had ridden up to a british and a french officer locked in furious combat and ordered them to stop at once for it is very unseemly gentlemen there was great laughter and cheering all about the hall but in truth any words delivered with a smile would have served this day ay its a fact i did declared lincoln permitting himself to be a heckler just for once but i made the french officer give up his sword to me there and then there was even greater cheering and then deedes braced himself for the final jest mrs lincoln maam im sure i am permitted to say that you are most welcome in the regiment and doubly so for tonight you retire with a serjeantmajor and tomorrow you awake with an officer beside you instead there was now rumbustious earthy cheering that will touch a raw nerve or two said david sledge to hervey as they stood together by one of the hogsheads the broadminded you mean sledge grimaced in mock disapproval i reckon rose has had a very close shave a funeral and a wedding to distract attention i call it very lucky indeed well i for one would not welcome being pagets quilldriver maybe not hervey but then you would not have bedded another mans wife in the first place hervey blanched david you take it a little too personally and theres something in scripture is there not about casting the first stone sledge was a son of the manse however and knew his scripture rather better than hervey recalled his that was speaking of punishment not judgement anyway its not the same is it if the ladys not a lady not a real officers wife he took a long draw on his pot of ale oh david thats unfair joynson has the very devil of a job at present ay well thats as maybe but a horse thats once kicked over the traces is best shot from the team hervey was saved by the commanderinchief just when it seemed the speeches and toasts were done the general ascended the platform there were murmurs of surprise and then silence you tell im sir came a voice from the back of the hall followed by more laughter and a certain anxiety on joynsons part that the hogsheads might be emptying too quickly for comfort mr and mrs lincoln it is an honour to be here began sir edward paget in a voice at once commanding and warm mrs lincoln would not know that i first met her husband more than fifteen years ago in spain indeed it was on a very dark night and it was at a place called corunna the proverbial pin could now have been dropped corunna was a distant memory to just a very few of the bluecoats but it was second only to waterloo in the consciousness of the sixth i a general officer was in command of the reserve during that battle and i and my staff had become lost i will say no more but had it not been for the address of a certain serjeantmajor the french would have had me in their bag that night there was much approval about the hall if muted still this was news indeed as it was sir edward broke into a broad smile they had me but two years later im sorry to say else it might have been me and not my brother with you at waterloo yer wouldnt be standing as steady then sir came the voice of another wit from the back of the hall and there was cautious laughter about the room from those who understood the reference to lord uxbridges missing leg while paget had lost an arm it sounds as though youre not standing all that steady either returned sir edward there were hoots of laughter now there was nothing more entertaining than the heckled putting down the heckler but let me not suspend the celebrations any longer except to wish the bride and groom the best of good fortune and to say that i half think i could send the sixth east and be finished with the burmans at once there was now loud and sustained cheering from all quarters sir edward played to the gallery but he did so perfectly eyre somervile shook his head a most curious animal the soldier emma smiled they stood apart from the regimentals and she was enjoying this intimacy in what way my dear he is happier to be thought of as a number in a line just so long as the line is his own and with others who belong to it you saw there cannot be more than a few dozen who were at corunna and yet they all think of it as their honour as though they had all been there indeed emma nodded a very proper pride the sort that comes not before a fall and in men who might otherwise be outside all society oh indeed they sang well in church but i have no illusions her husband took another glass of madeira and i have observed how they are with their officers some of whom are as stupid as half those in parliament yet the little that is good in them is somehow magnified by the connection and these men he nodded to the dozens of chevrons about the place would no doubt be hurling bricks at magistrates were they not in regimentals yet here they all are as if the same family and those we saw on the road here without chevrons just biding their time until theyre allowed a bit further under the blanket i tell you its a system that defies reckoning ive mocked its little absurdities often enough but i half believe the company could go anywhere with men like this emma sighed i hope therefore that the company will remain in ignorance of its treasure somervile touched her arm for him a public gesture of unusual warmth good afternoon mr somervile sir good afternoon maam armstrongs greeting recalled the two of them good afternoon serjeantmajor and mrs armstrong replied somervile with a look of genuine pleasure emma smiled as wide oh please dont on my account she said to caithlin as she curtsied emmas indian maids might bow gracefully but they never curtsied and in any case she could never think of caithlin armstrong as of inferior status especially my dear not in your condition caithlin and her husband glanced with customary pride at the swelling beneath her dress i should say in our condition added emma with the same look of pride oh mrs somervile exclaimed caithlin her melodious cork never stronger how happy i am for you is that why miss joynson is to be your companion then maam no fact remained in the possession of but two people in calcutta for more than a day it is said emma agreeably she could not very well add ostensibly although indeed she might herveys suggestion of taking in frances joynson for a while had come at a propitious time though emma certainly felt in no need of a companion somervile himself was looking rather embarrassed especially since armstrong was smiling in a manly confidential sort of way there were affairs indeed that transcended all barriers that did not trouble him in the slightest somervile was more impatient of the confines of rank than most men but country matters as he was still wont to call them he was not at home with what is the news from the east sir asked armstrong thinking to save further talk of domestic affairs somervile shook his head not good im afraid serjeantmajor the business is taking longer than was imagined he did not say by whom imagined nor that there were some who never imagined it otherwise the commanderinchief for one and i fear that our embarrassment there will encourage others to he noticed both wives listening intently to become rather impudent armstrong nodded well sir i for one shall be making in the opposite direction tomorrow with captain hervey and pleased of it too ive no partiality for fighting with trees everywhere you turn that burma is no place for cavalry the band had struck up a lively jig and the commanderinchief had rejoined the major a capital display joynson capital my compliments to you but i fear i must return to my desk the despatches from rangoon this morning were not at all felicitous but you still do not think the sixth will be needed sir edward no i think not if campbell can break himself out of rangoon then all should be well even if takes some weeks more months even and break out hes bound to do at some stage but the country isnt suitable to develop cavalry operations ive sent him reinforcements and if need be for escorts and the like ill send one of the madras light horse paget began taking his leave shaking hands with mr and mrs lincoln and several others besides his smile in contrast with the earnestness of his manner with joynson as they reached the door he turned again to joynson and his former look returned things are by no means settled among the country powers hereabouts and our difficulties in the east will only encourage them i want a handy force here in bengal if trouble ensues i have to be able to count on kings cavalry youll have the sixth in best condition eustace im sure we understand that general sir edward nodded hervey will soon be at dehli i should imagine the troop left on tuesday hervey goes tomorrow sir edward nodded again a good choice hervey ochterlony will like him joynson raised an eyebrow and whats equally to the point general hervey will like ochterlony sir edward smiled oh yes indeed that is equally important chapter ten the resident dehli three weeks later sir david ochterlony the honourable east india companys political resident at the court of shah mohammed akbar rhize badshah the great mughal was sixtysix years old he had entered the bengal army when he was not yet twenty and had spent his entire service in hindoostan he had fought the french the marathas and the nipalis and each time he had added garlands to his reputation as both a soldier and a diplomatist he had been a majorgeneral since and resident since his name was held in the highest esteem venerated even throughout india although it was the opinion of some members of the bengal council and lord amherst himself that his retirement was overdue indeed if any man gave the lie to the oftheard native lament that a grey hair on the head of a european was never to be seen in india it was ochterlony although ironically he had been born and bred in america hervey reported to the residency towards the end of the afternoon within an hour of entering the great old mughal capital but already he had formed the strongest impression of decay and ruin in dehli of desolation even the city walls half of stone half of brick were in poor repair tombs and mausoleums were everywhere in dilapidation grass grew long all about in places there was a smell of corruption as bad as in calcutta and his guide told him there was not a house from where the jackals cry could not be heard of a night the centuries of depredations the sackings and the looting the sieges and the slaughter had brought the once sumptuous imperial city to little more than a tract of dreary and disconsolate tombs sahib here nothing lasts said herveys guide there is much tribulation and little joy in years past the living thought only of reposing after death in splendid sepulchres and their descendants have thought only of destroying what was intended for eternity and hervey had half shivered in the chill of that judgement but the guide had not been melancholy he had spoken with the indifferent acceptance of fate that was the mark of his religion and indeed there was cheer in his judgement for he told hervey that things would have been immeasurably worse without sir david ochterlony ochterlonysahib is greatest man in all of empire after great mughal himself sahib hervey considered himself well used by now to native blandishments whether from gholam or pandit perhaps though in the living memory of hindoostan and certainly that of his guide sir david ochterlony had a reasonable claim to greatness it had been he who had kept jashwant rao the holkar of indore the most powerful of the maratha chiefs at bay two decades before while the wellesleys made war on the scindia and the bhonsla greatness indeed did not seem too inapt a word as hervey now contemplated the residency a classical palazzo on chandnee chouk near the lahore gate it spoke of a confident power for it had nothing to do with the art of the empire of tamerlane only that of the honourable company as he rode up to its gates the quarterguard turned out and presented arms the havildar saluted and stood his ground so hervey dismounted and obliged him by inspecting his men smart bengali sipahis redbreasted barelegged straps and pouches whitened muskets burnished then a young ensign very fairskinned came he wore a frock coat and forage hat as if on picket duty at st jamess and he saluted as sharply introducing himself and then conducting hervey to sir david ochterlonys quarters it was truly just as if he were arriving at the horse guards again for weeks hervey had wondered what he would find at the residency so many had been the stories but all he knew for certain was that sir david was an elderly majorgeneral and so he composed himself accordingly the usual military formalities the stuff of any general headquarters a brief interview the presentation of compliments and so on and so on but instead of being bidden to wait in an anteroom and then being announced at the door of the residents office as he would have expected the ensign showed him at once into a sitting room furnished in the mughal style with cushions and divans about the floor in the middle of which sat a barefoot majorgeneral in a bamboo armchair wearing a florid silk dressing gown with a hookah to his mouth hervey rallied quickly enough good afternoon sir david i am captain hervey of the sixth light dragoons he had considered the mode of address carefully concluding that as sir david ochterlony was the political resident it was more appropriate to address him by that style rather than as general sir david did not reply at once nodding as if in a dream hervey stood at attention but removed his cap uncertain how the interview would proceed without doubt there was here before him what in calcutta they called a mofussil eccentric one who had been overlong in native india any reference to military rank seemed incongruous and the display of military normality that had attended his arrival only served to make the situation seem more absurd it was not entirely true to say that his heart sank but it was not nearly so light as when he had begun his assignment i have the honour to report for duty three officers and fiftythree dragoons at your service sir sir david took the pipe from his mouth and beckoned a khitmagar to bring a chair and a pipe he called after him in urdu or something very like it for hervey grasped its meaning no thank you sir i am in truth rather parched my dear boy my dear boy sir david took the pipe from his mouth again and bellowed quai hai sherbet for captain herveysahib hervey took his seat and waited to be spoken to doubts crowding in apace the silence continued sir david pipe to his mouth once more was content to sit and contemplate the new arrival at length he seemed satisfied he took the pipe from his mouth and nodded how are things in calcutta it was a not unreasonable question except that hervey had scarcely moved beyond the confines of the garrison save to the somerviles house at fort william since coming from rangoon he trusted that the resident had no more appetite for drawingroom gossip than he in as far as i can say sir david the war with ava goes badly there is news or rumour perhaps would be the better description that lord combermere shall succeed sir edward paget next year beyond that i fear there is little i know sir davids expression of surprise was very pronounced calcutta has become an exceedingly dull place these late years if that is the extent of your intelligence hervey sighed inwardly this was very like keeping company with an ageing parent he would have to try hard not to become by turns impatient or indulgent in truth sir david i have been laid low these past months and confined largely to the military lines sir david looked vexed laid low laid low with what hervey forced himself to remember that he was speaking to the hero of nipal i received a ball in my shoulder at rangoon sir david and thereafter contracted the fever sir davids mien changed at once rangoon tell me of it it was like the stirring of a sleepy old lion at first the mere twitch of an eyelid a flick of the tail until by degrees the huge beast was on all fours and circling with intermittent grunts and snarls hervey spared him nothing at the end of his account the resident shook his head and sighed that wont do it wont do at all i wonder sir if i may have more sherbet sir david scolded the khitmagar for his inattention as a lion might swipe at an errant cub you will stay to dinner hervey and lodge here you will no doubt wish to see your troop properly billeted but your lieutenant may easily exercise command sir david for all his eccentric attire had by now acquired a wholly commanding bearing hervey saw no point in protesting it threw onto perry an undue burden of society with green but that was the way of it he was captain and he had other concerns i am very obliged sir david but i had better send for my small kit i have nothing but oh we shall not dress said sir david airily not in this month ill have the khansamah bring you a robe he looked at him intently and at dinner i shall tell you of where our troubles may lie in the months ahead hervey bathed and then lay down on the narrow divan in his otherwise ample quarters all about was marble like the palace at chintalpore but whereas at the rajah of chintals seat the air was full of intrigue and menace here it was peace although in the residents words there was a promise of action he began looking forward to his commission once more dereliction there might be in so many ways dehli reminded him of rome but he sensed it could fascinate in any case it was good to be away from the calcutta garrison a station full of leftbehinds while hounds were hard at work elsewhere hervey closed his eyes there was not a sound but for a hoopoe and its mate in the garden beyond his shuttered window they brought to mind chintalpore again how long ago it seemed was it seven eight years he remembered telling the rajah how he wished one day to entertain him in england had he really imagined that he might or was it that everything was lived so intensely in india could he go back there it would be easy enough one of the calcutta coasters down to the godavari thence by budgerow as far as he might up that disobliging river and on to chintalpore godaji rao sundur rajah of chintalpore hervey was after all one of his jagirdars and his jagir returned a respectable income each year not all of which was covenanted to the widows of those desperate days fighting the nizams guns and the pindarees would the raj kumari be purged of her crimes would her father have recalled her from deep in the forest of the gonds or did she scheme and plot still so reckless a daughter of so sensible a man did he really want to see her again in one respect at least he had no doubt for even as he lay her allure had its effect at seven the sun on the horizon and the heat of the afternoon given way to a balmy dusk hervey put on the green robe that the bearer had brought him and joined sir david ochterlony in his mughal courtyard with the resident was a tall wellmade native man cleanshaven with sleek hair drawn back and held with a clip he wore a loosefitting kurta white trousers and embroidered slippers and he spoke freely and easily hervey this is jaswant sing my master of horse and this said sir david turning to the man is captain hervey of his majestys sixth light dragoons who as of this afternoon is captain of my escort they both bowed what are your horses captain hervey asked jaswant sing with a warm aspect marwaris for the most part jaswant sing inclined his head in a way that signified approval and you yourself ride the marwari i have a charger brought with me from england but my second is a marwari though she is not with me for the present having been sick and the marwari pleases you captain hervey oh yes yes indeed i have never seen a better doer hervey checked himself that is i have never seen a horse that subsisted on so little and is yet so handy and obliging it was too early to volunteer information about the marwaris endurance in his jungle raid however the marwari is from rajpootana captain hervey which is my home if your duties are allowing i should be very pleased to show you the breeding horses there if my duties were to allow it jaswant singsahib i should like that very much he would leave it at that for he did not imagine sir david would be inclined to spare him too soon if at all sir david was attentive however one of rajpootanas neighbours gives me considerable cause for worry hervey i am frankly fearful of a struggle over the succession in bhurtpore hervey was surprised by such frankness in their present company you will not know of it i dare say i know but a very little sir david nothing much troubles fort william but the war with ava i suppose well the rajah of bhurtpore baldeo sing has long honoured the treaty of friendship with the company he is now becoming frail and his son balwant is but a boy and the rajah is fearful that his nephew durjan sal has designs on the succession the old rajah asked that i invest the boy with a khelat a sort of honorary dress as a sign of our recognition of his rightful claim and this i did in the early part of the year sir david beckoned his khansamah and told him that he wished to eat at once hervey decided he would not wait on sir davids pace and i presume therefore sir that you have intelligence that this action has not entirely dissuaded durjan sal from his designs just so hervey replied the resident in an approving tone and everything that we know of him says he is without scruple jhauts said jaswant sing shaking his head they are stubborn beggars sir david nodded but when theyre not being stubborn hervey theyre the most courageous men in our service they would make fine sipahis i had a mind to visit the rajah now that the cooler season will soon be upon us for i was not able to invest the khelat in person i judged it appropriate to go with an escort of kings cavalry rather than native for durjan sal would no doubt believe it possible to buy off any native troops and it would be well to remind him that not all of the companys forces are engaged with the king of ava you mean as a portent sir david i have but fifty dragoons yes just so now let us eat two weeks passed during which hervey saw little of sir david but much of jaswant sing the resident was sick for several days he ascribed it to the change of season and then when he was recovered enough to attend to his papers was much occupied with the estimates which were overdue for submission to calcutta so hervey found time aplenty to learn the rajpoot way of horsemanship and his neglect of the troop or rather his delegation of daytoday command to his lieutenant he was able to justify by these equestrian studies that orse got ginger up its backside sir called private johnson standing at the edge of the maidan one morning hervey sat astride a marwari stallion which was pirouetting and leaping as if being backed for the first time he managed to collect it after a fashion and walked him over to his groom ill have you know that this animal is trained for war johnson for combat with war elephants indeed oh ay sir yes and very handy he is too for all the fire you saw in him hervey made to stretch his shoulder to relieve the ache that had been growing since he took the reins but he stopped short he would give no sign even to johnson that he could feel the musket balls force still and ows e fight an elephant then sir ed not stand as igh as its ear he doesnt do the fighting the rider does he gets the horse to leap up and takes the mahout in the flank with his lance then he can deal with the howdah johnson looked sceptical ill show you what he can do hervey gathered up the reins again though nothing like as taut as he would normally for proper collection indeed the reins themselves were unusual they were stitched double towards the end and hervey held this doubled length close to its fork in his bridle hand and almost to his chest it showed a long and graceful length such that his childhood riding master would have admired but that old rittmeister would also have been intrigued for hervey was not wearing spurs nor was he carrying a whip johnson could scarcely believe it either the weight of the reins collects him onto the bit explained hervey i dont know how or why for ive never heard of an animal trained so in truth id not have been inclined to believe it after circling two or three times at a canter he put the stallion into a pirouette then into a reversed pirouette then into what he knew as voltes on a small compass stopping on the hocks and turning on them and from that he had the horse jump into the gallop finally and still at the gallop he made the animal move obliquely as peto would have made headway with a weather helm johnson stood silent but impressed these were tricks of selfevident utility in the field it was not difficult to imagine the lance held across the body or out wide the horse passaging left or right to take the enemy in the flank but hervey had not finished there were what his old rittmeister called the airs above ground jaswant sing had shown him how to perform them though in truth as well hervey knew all he had done was show him how to sit a horse that knew its airs first a levade the horse rising on its hind legs hocks almost on the ground then forward from the levade a courbette with three distinct leaps or was it four and finally the capriole the stallion leaping into the air and kicking out long with its hind legs jaswant sing had called it udaang flying you see called hervey panting almost as much as the horse as he walked him over to where johnson stood and rubbing his shoulder now and more confidently for he knew that to work like that meant he was all but whole again you see how useful that could be there was no doubting it that were a vicious kick all right said his groom shaking his head ive never seen owt like it you see now how useful for elephantfighting oh ay sir yon orse looked as if it wouldve scrambled up its ead that was the idea said hervey slipping from the saddle and loosening the girth but all thats over with elephants and the like just a pretty display now think how you might turn heads with it in england though eh chapter eleven towers of silence bhurtpore a month later h ervey sat on the crumbling wall of an old well in a large straw hat and very unmilitary clothes sketching sir david ochterlony makes but one stipulation he had written to emmas husband before leaving dehli he would have me do more than merely gawp at the walls of bhurtpore he would have me bring back a thorough knowledge of all its defences and all this of course i am to accomplish without for a moment giving cause for anyone to know what i do in that city to what end this spying may be directed i can little imagine except that sir david speaks darkly of the need perhaps of such information in years soon to come at first i imagined him to mean that he himself sir david ochterlony might have to do what lord lake had been unable to accomplish but although i believe sir david to be game for the hardiest adventure still i am certain he understands the circumstances would be no more favourable now than they were for lord lake i have read much of his lordships siege and i cannot imagine that success could be accomplished with fewer men and guns and sir david does not have one half of lord lakes force at his own disposal i believe therefore that sir david would put before the council in calcutta a proposal for the stronger reinforcement of his command were it ever to come to a fight and that meanwhile he is taking all prudent steps to acquire intelligence of any nature he does not confirm me in this opinion when i ask him but he does not oppose it either hervey was not by any reckoning an artist but he had been taught to draw and his practice in field sketching in the peninsula had made him proficient in the reproduction of landscape with correct proportion and perspective for several days he had wandered about the city drawing anything he could see which was of no military significance in order to establish his credentials as a travelling antiquarian no one had shown the slightest interest in him but he had wanted an alibi a portfolio of architectural drawings that would serve as evidence of his innocent intent when he began work on the defences one sketch he had been especially minded to hide however its subject appalled him sickened him indeed he had scarcely been able to keep down his gorge as he drew and it took him longer to complete than some of the more elaborate works of decorative detail for he had wanted as faithful an impression as possible one that might have the same effect on a viewer that the archetype had on him it had been a repetitive work a business of drawing skull after skull he had tried to estimate how many there were the column was as tall as trajans in rome and his guide had said it was neither hollow nor filled with sand here was no basrelief of bones but a solid pillar of lord lakes dead no christian burial or cremation according to native rites for these men kings and sepoys alike the gamekeepers at longleat would string up their trophies to discourage predators and to impress by their zeal the futtah bourge the bastion of victory was but the same how loathsome it stood by comparison with that eloquent commemoration of trajans victory an affront to every decent instinct of a christianraised man and a gesture of contempt for the customs of war peaceful hindoostan might be but a sight such as this said that peace was an unnatural thing hervey considered it well that he concealed his sketch and thought it best that he hide it from view of his fellows too this next stage of his work occupied him a full week the fortress of bhurtpore is without doubt the largest i have ever seen he wrote to eyre somervile towards the end of october it stands on a plain broken and rugged towards the west but otherwise bare affording little cover and i calculate the perimeter to be not very much short of five miles any siege force would have to be great indeed to invest the entire fortress i have now been able to make a very faithful comparison of lord lakes dispositions and it is at once apparent that his insufficiency in men was greater than i had supposed when reading the usual texts for with the maratha cavalry harassing him he was obliged to hold ready reserves to deal with them and he had not thereby the means either to starve out the garrison in the old way or breach the walls in enough places and in sufficient strength to bolt the defenders a broad and deep ditch runs the entire length of the perimeter from the inner edge of which rises a thick and lofty wall of sunbaked clay and stone flanked by no fewer than thirtyfive turreted bastions i have been able to draw in plan the location of each though for reasons of economy in time and so as not to appear excessively interested should i have been accosted i was minded to draw elevations of only those i judged would command the likely approaches the citadel itself occupies a natural height rising above all else in the city and is itself enclosed by a ditch feet wide and fifty feet deep and as if vauban himself had directed the fortification there are ravelins and lunettes fleches and demilunes the entire length of the walls and how blessed are the people of bhurtpore too since the moats and ditches are dry so they are not plagued by the mosquitoes that thrive on still water and they may drive their animals wherever they wish i have learned that water when it is needed to fill the moats comes from a jheel to the northwest of the fortress a very practical and happy arrangement this water and these walls would pose the best engineer a test of his science and when the water and the walls are covered by the guns of thirtyfive bastions and countless other outworks the infantry might very well become so many companies of forlorn hopes unless directed by a general of exceptional address in the skill of the siege artillery and the field gunners reposes their fate no fortress is impregnable we must understand but it is my decided opinion that if ever a fortress came close to such a condition it is bhurtpore and then he had confided in his friend the unhappier detail of his detached duty unusually for it touched only on the business of the sixth i am resolved to have green out he daily becomes more awkward in his dealings with everyone in truth i can scarcely bear to speak to him every blemish in both his character and appearance seemed magnified in dehli there being no multitude of other officers to draw away attention i have therefore written to joynson and advised him that he speak severely with him about the advisability of his remaining in the regiment for i have concluded that he could never make an officer and if ever it comes to a fight the outcome would be very ill indeed for himself principally for there could be little enough damage he might do to any of the dragoons such is his subsidiary role yet were he ever to encounter a half decent swordsman the result must be disaster but on the other hand i am pleased to say that perry is a fine lieutenant on whose account i need have had no fears and i shall take leave hence before returning to dehli to see the great white mausoleum at agra about which you always spoke so much these letters he then took with him to agra where there were trusted hircarrahs to carry despatches down the jumna and thence to calcutta and from where he himself could take a boat back to dehli with greater ease he had indeed grown fond of his licence the days were still warm and at night it was good to sit before a fire reading or in contemplation he lacked the company of englishspeakers jaswant sing having now returned to dehli but this gave him opportunity to practise his urdu with a certain confidence and in any case he had never been fretful in his own company except at the very end of his stay in bhurtpore but the fever had not developed its full power and he was abed for no longer than a day five more he gave himself to see what had once been the proud mughal capital agra on the last evening he sat beside the hearth in a comfortable haveli which jaswant sing had arranged for him below the red walls of the great sandstone fort the place was strangely peaceful for so teeming a city and he contemplated its lessons he laid down his glass of arrack he had come to rely on it as a faithful aid to digestion no matter how tempestuous the dinner served him leaned back in his chair and drew long on the mildest of cheroots the tobacco smoke mixed agreeably with that of the sandalwood burning in the grate and he closed his eyes for a moment the better to hear the nightjar stranger as a rule to the haunts of men in a while he opened them again and picked up his journal from the table next to him it had commanded more time than usual of an evening for it was his sole entry at agra th november the work at bhurtpore being done and greatly more of it than i had ever imagined so immense a place is it i travelled thence to the jumna again under the admirable arrangements of jaswant sing and reposed two nights at the ancient capital of the moguls the palace called the taje mahl which means crown palace is spoken of throughout india as one of unsurpassed beauty the place of burial of the wife of a great emperor to whom it was erected in praise i visited it the first day on arriving and was not disappointed while it is visible in whole from the river approached from the south through the main gate only its dome and the four minarets at each corner of white marble are to be seen above the circumadjacent trees of a persian garden in the way that the dome of the popes basilica in rome can be seen above the crowding buildings of the borgo only when like the basilica one comes right upon it can its entire beauty be imagined i have attempted to sketch it but it is wholly beyond my skill to render it any justice and i have instead resolved to find an artist hereabout who will make me a fair likeness last night i visited the gardens opposed to it on the other bank of the jumna which are in very great disrepair yet which are called the moonlight gardens for here is where legend has it the emperor would come at the full moon each month to recall his lost love it was planted with all manner of herbage that gave off sweet scent by night and there is still too a night scent though the place is very jungled herveys journal pretended to nothing more than being wellkept for the most part it was in note form serving as a memorandum of movement acquisition accomplishment or occasionally of intention hindrance or opinion but never of emotion not even anger had it been his practice to include such feelings he would have filled pages since coming to agra for in that moonlight garden he had for a time begun to question the true intensity of his former love it had been emma somerviles suggestion insistence indeed that he visit agra there she said he would see the perfect expression of a grieving mans love it had been no mawkish sentiment for he had spoken with her of raising some memorial to henrietta and had done so with perfect calm henrietta was not yet dismissed habitually from his mind thoughts of her especially of their moments of intimacy came on him still and often but he could now think of her with reason and cool judgement quite unlike before and emmas suggestion had been far from unwelcome for he had read and heard much of the white marble shrine it would surely be instructive to see how a man who had grieved and had the means to memorialize that grieving had done so however the palace had seemed more and more a rebuke to him here stood a memorial as much to the constancy of an emperors love as to the empress herself where was the evidence of his own constancy in truth the evidence was to the contrary his bibi the letters to and from lady katherine greville more sportive with each return only later on leaving agra as he read fitfully on the budgerow plying upstream for dehli did he learn that in time the emperor had abandoned the city and set up his court in the old mughal capital just as he hervey had abandoned england and set up his domain in india but mumtaz mahal had begged her husband not to pine for her and to remarry hervey could not slough off his guilt so easily and in any case his sins were mingled he no longer honoured his wifes memory with his body but neither did he say his prayers with system or regularity let alone conviction and he might as well have forgotten the offspring of their union somervile had been wont to say that many a man had lost his reason in india as well as his soul but such men hervey supposed had sought consolation in drink or some other opiate he relied only on activity no he had no fear of losing his reason but in india colours were brighter and shadows darker it was not always so easy to judge things faithfully a noisy skein of barheaded geese recalled him to the present he turned up his collar against the freshening jumna breeze and picked up his volume on the maratha wars again how had lord lake miscalculated so the walls of bhurtpore had stood then as they did now what had been the cause of so fatal a misjudgement he must have it and he knew he must then pray that in all his forgetting activity he could himself keep a right judgement in things civil or military part three the pride of hindoostan general order fort william july the right hon the governorgeneral has learned with great sorrow the demise of majorgeneral sir david ochterlony resident in malwa and rajpootana this melancholy event took place on the morning of the th inst at meerut whither he had proceeded for the benefit of change of air on the eminent military services of majorgeneral sir david ochterlony it would be superfluous to dilate they have been acknowledged in terms of the highest praise by successive governments they justly earned a special and substantial reward from the hon east india company they have been recognised with expressions of admiration and applause by the british parliament and they have been honoured with signal marks of the approbation of his sovereign the confidence which the government reposed in an individual gifted with such rare endowments was evinced by the high and responsible situations which he successively filled and the duties which he discharged with eminent ability and advantage to the public interests as an especial testimony of the high respect in which the character and services of majorgeneral sir d ochterlony are held and as a public demonstration of sorrow for his demise the governorgeneral in council is pleased to direct that minute guns to the number of sixtyeight corresponding with his age be fired this evening at sunset from the ramparts of fort william chapter twelve minute guns calcutta october his excellency general the right hon stapleton lord combermere gcb gch ampc commanderinchief of all the forces in india as he was styled received hervey warmly but without the same careless ease of their previous acquaintances they had first met eleven years ago in the field at toulouse as hervey lay painfully under the ministration of a surgeon the commander of wellingtons cavalry had been all praise and warm regards then for hervey in that culminating battle of the campaign in his despatches writing that by his bold and independent action he averted what might at the very least have been an embarrassment for the mounted arm they had met on three occasions since then the last being that most diverting evening at apsley house before hervey had come out to india when he had met lady katherine greville i fancy you might care for some coffee hervey its a damnably cold morning the invitation was to help himself from a pot on a table covered with maps and sketches at which stood colonel macleod who was to be brigadier of artillery and colonel anburey who was to be the same of engineers hervey acknowledged them both with a brisk bow of the head before pouring some of the strong black liquid into a big cup and adding a good measure of sugar you set us nicely in apposition captain hervey said colonel anburey nodding with a grim if perhaps wry sort of smile at colonel macleod hervey knew exactly what he meant i fear the sappers will have little chance of doing their work without the support of the guns colonel for the approaches to the walls are coverless and yet the walls are so solid and thick that the guns shall have to come in close and that can only be done by sapping from outside the range of the fort indeed i wonder that it will not be better to mine one or two of the bastions for a breach will otherwise be devilish hard colonel anburey shook his head i read your opinion hervey but it is out of the question if the country lies as you have drawn it too far to tunnel explained lord combermere hervey looked puzzled colonel anburey supplied the detail the greatest distance a gallery may be driven is two hundred yards beyond that there is insufficient air for a man to breathe and indeed for the explosive to operate efficiently hervey was confident he had surveyed the defences accurately that is indeed a pity colonel it will be an affair of heavy pounding therefore and it need not have been he said to himself later six months ago ochterlony might well have carried the day at a stroke with that neverfailing ally surprise had the governorgeneral allowed him to try even with half the number of men with which lord lake had failed at least he might by now be keeper of the gates in those great walls thereby shutting out every freebooting jhaut and brigand who at this very moment was flocking to durjan sals banner but the governorgeneral had dithered fatally eyre somervile had told hervey of how he had gone to lord amhersts office the morning ochterlonys despatch had arrived from dehli amherst had looked alarmed there was ill news enough already from the east without more from the west you read my earlier minute on the situation in bhurtpore excellency somervile had asked careful to observe the punctilio of address for once lord amherst had looked uncertain three months ago the rajah of bhurtpore died and his infant son succeeded him under the guardianship of his uncle lord amhersts face had shown a flicker of recall however for reasons that should not detain us the late rajahs nephew durjan sal has laid claim to the succession why do you say they should not detain us mr somervile lord amherst had demanded his brow furrowed anxiously we are by your tone very evidently to be detained by one claim or the other durjan sal disputes the legitimacy of the rightful heir balwant sing but by all the evidence hitherto before us this is a most villainous claim before us i have not heard anything of it no my lord matters in this regard have fallen entirely to the resident in dehli ochterlony good god what has he been about although somervile shared the general opinion of sir david ochterlony that his best days were long past he had sufficient regard for his judgement in the rights of things if not in their consequences sir david recognized the rightful claim of balwant sing twelve months ago by vesting him in a khelat what in heavens name was he doing such a thing is not done without presumptions of obligation what is bhurtpore to us i consider it very rash somervile had sighed to himself the fact is my lord that sir david has bestowed the companys recognition on balwant sing and well he had better renounce it we have trouble enough in ava campbells still stuck in the mud at rangoon and his ships gathering weed the governorgeneral had waved his hand as if the matter was done with at whose door might blame lie in that regard somervile had been minded to ask im afraid it is too late it seems durjan sal moved against balwant sings guardian some weeks ago and very bloodily and has proclaimed himself regent so somervile had tried hard to hide his irritation at the governorgenerals disregard of the dangers the country powers might pose sir david has already denounced durjan sal as an usurper of supreme authority by which he means of course the company i am perfectly well aware what he means somervile he must be told at once to moderate his demands and conclude the affair by diplomacy i fear it is too late for that he has called on the jhauts to rally to him and announced that he will appear at the head of a british force to restore balwant sing lord amherst had then by somerviles account looked like a man winded by a body blow his brow had furrowed even more signalling his utter incomprehension where is this force to come from somervile somervile had raised his eyebrows by all reckoning he might muster ten thousand men at most scarcely a thousand of them white lord amherst had fallen silent would that be enough sir david was may yet be a fine general somervile had put on a most determined expression opinions vary and differ the commanderinchiefs is as yet unsettled his deputy is of the opinion that it would be very far from sufficient bhurtpore you may recall is the fortress that defied lord lake more than twenty years ago and nothing i understand has rendered it any less formidable since then the remaining colour had disappeared from lord amhersts face then the consequences will be very grave i cannot suffer humiliation in the west at this time especially somervile had been much perturbed by the governorgenerals alarm but lord amherst i understand that the commanderinchiefs opinion tends to reinforcement if we at once send word to bombay and to madras we may assemble full three times sir davids present number and a proper siege train and that shall surely be enough to subdue bhurtpore no no no we want no second campaign while ava is undecided it is quite impossible somervile had been taken aback but lord amherst the ultimatum has been given we cannot withdraw now the company would suffer an irreparable humiliation every native power the length of india would look at once to take his opportunity i impossible i say i cannot be mired in by ochterlonys intemperate declarations the only alternative is to let him try with his ten thousand but herveys view is that victory cannot be guaranteed thereby there must be reinforcements to carry the day if audacity fails hervey hervey who is he somervile had at once regretted his lapse the captain of sir davids escort lord amherst he captain of the escort great heavens man have you lost your senses no no it will not serve sir davids offensive would be a gamble on his reputation for success yes that is the way it shall be done i shall send word at once for ochterlony to withdraw indeed i shall issue immediate orders for the recall of sir david ochterlony to an appointment of greater prominence here somervile had felt obliged to concede defeat very good lord amherst but with respect i must give my opinion that none shall see such a recall as anything but the most peremptory reprimand for the resident including sir david himself colonel anburey the engineer now looked pained at the thought of the heavy pounding that lay ahead though the same thought seemed to please colonel macleod the gunner you give your opinion very decidedly sir said the former i endeavour always to speak as i find colonel replied hervey with absolute certainty well so be it gentlemen said lord combermere briskly i shall of course make my own reconnaissance but for the time being i intend proceeding upon captain herveys admirable appreciation the question then turns on when is launched the as hervey has it coup de main i am prepared to order affairs a great deal in favour of its success however there is no profit in seizing these dams if they are only to be recaptured before i am able to send a reinforcement quite the opposite indeed for the enemy would be at once alerted to our intention and would instantly open the sluicegates and yet if i delay too long we shall anyway have full moats to cross instead of dry ditches the colonels of engineers and artillery looked somehow relieved that their own decisions turned only on what was technically feasible rather than fine judgements of this order it was left to hervey to speak to the commanderinchiefs dilemma i have been considering this general the flooding of all the moats would be a great inconvenience to the population durjan sal would not order the dams open until it were strict necessity we must therefore be circumspect in our concentration i believe that your lordship would wish to assemble his forces at agra and i truly cannot conceive of a better place but any advance west of there would unquestionably signal to the jhauts our intention to invest the city for it is a march of but a few days and if my own intelligence of the time it would take to inundate the defences is correct the enemy would be obliged to cut open the bund at once lord combermere nodded i fancy that two squadrons of light cavalry with galloper guns might dash from agra to bhurtpore in a night before the garrison were properly alerted they could seize the bund before dawn until our engineers came up and would have the advantage of daylight to beat off the immediate sallies lord combermere at once saw the sequence perfectly and the relief to attend on them by dusk it would be hazardous if they were not to be reinforced by then general if the enemy did not overwhelm them in the darkness they would surely mass during the night and do so at first light very well said lord combermere nodding slowly as if turning over the facts one more time hervey judged that his services were now done with he picked up his shako and began making to leave thank you captain hervey said lord combermere looking up your information has been most valuable you shall have the honour of leading those two squadrons and you had better have the rank for the affair too once we take to the field hervey left the commanderinchiefs office with the promise of a local majority it would give him the authority he needed for his limited command but in terms of seniority it meant even less than a brevet he wondered when that recognition might come his way again if ever he wondered even more when the next regimental vacancy might occur though he could not begin to contemplate how he might find the means to buy it advancement in times of peace and retrenchment was a snails gallop they all knew that so he had better make the most of his temporary command he would go at once to the adjutantgenerals office to discover for himself the exact order of battle for this lord combermeres first sovereign campaign there he was at once astonished by the scale of the undertaking the body of cavalry was the largest it was certain since waterloo a division of two brigades each comprising a kings regiment three of the companys and two troops of horse artillery the whole under command of lieutenantcolonel sleigh of the th light dragoons in the rank of brigadiergeneral hervey was content enough with that sleigh he knew from peninsula days and considered him a good man but it was the devils own luck that sir ivo lankester should have prolonged his furlough for his seniority would have given him a brigade and the only reason sir ivo had prolonged his stay in england was to coax his majesty into appointing a royal colonelinchief to the sixth an expensive adornment that would be mused hervey if it cost sir ivo the opportunity of the sabres edge at the head of his regiment and the two divisions of infantry were strong ones too each of three brigades with two kings regiments the th and th foot and the companys st bengal european regiment there were a good many troops of foot artillery as well as the experimental brigade with their rockets and strong detachments of the bengal sappers and miners the strength returns were not yet received in full said the officiating adjutantgeneral but his estimate was that the army would take to the field in excess of twenty thousand combatants hervey scanned the order of battle keenly the last regiment he came to gave him especial satisfaction and did as much to assure him of victory as any other two rissalahs of skinners irregular horse would accompany the army unbrigaded he resolved at once to enlist them in his independent command in the afternoon he sent corporal wainwright with a dozen sicca rupees to buy provisions for the budgerow which would he hoped soon be taking them back up the ganges calcutta will be no place to be these next weeks he said smiling wryly not for sabres thats for sure you havent seen an army assembling for the field corporal wainwright its a grand affair of adjutants and quartermasters and serjeantmajors parades lists inspections no end of a business corporal wainwright hid his partial disappointment the oldest sweat in his barrackroom had told him many things when he had first joined not least that a dragoon should never volunteer for anything yet jobie wainwright would have liked to see the serjeantmajors and the adjutants and the quartermasters about their business for he himself wanted one day to fill their boots and how was he to learn if he did not see but he was his troopleaders coverman major herveys coverman indeed though he did not yet know it and he went only where he might parry the cut or the thrust directed at his officer that next meant to dehli or perhaps straight to agra but his officer had a prior duty one that could not possibly be spoken of between them when wainwright left for the bazaar hervey went to the chitpore road the whole of native calcutta from nabob to bhisti knew now that the army of bengal was mobilizing and every bibi knew likewise they also knew that the armys object was what lord lake had failed to accomplish and what had been the shaming cause of sir david ochterlonys death would john company rise in triumph this time to the old taunt go take bhurtpore it was the talk of the princely palaces and the havelis of the chitpore road debated in the more modest dwellings of the brahmins and around the bazaars and in the bibi khanas especially in the bibi khanas for they knew all about bhurtpore the pride of hindoostan was the fortress not impregnable did not the futtah bourge the tower of skulls stand as reminder to all who would forget it no it was impossible that a man should leave for bhurtpore without visiting his bibi to bid her a proper goodbye and to receive the soldiers farewell in return and to assure her of the arrangements he had made for her wellbeing should he not come back hervey now spoke the words that a bibi needed to hear but they could never be enough she loved him she thought him the world itself she also understood that in the armys hands lay the companys honour and prestige and it made her doubly fearful for she knew what honour meant to her sahib and the price he would be ready to pay if it were necessary she would not say so it would only distress him but if his body were brought back to calcutta she would throw herself into the flames of his funeral pyre in the duty of suttee except that for her it would not be a duty rather an end to interminable grief she pleaded with her sahib to let her go with him to bhurtpore even to walk among the dhooliebearers and syces if she could not be with him but tempted sorely as hervey was his soldiers duty stood all too clear she was not welcome in the cantonment and she could not be welcome on the campaign but leaving her was harder than he had supposed he did not for one moment imagine he would not return she would not tell him that she imagined only this but the necessity of proceeding on that possibility gave their parting a fateful edge that all but overcame him it was not possible for a man a man with a soul to see even native eyes which looked so loving and not be touched deep in truth hervey had come to love her too in a certain way it was not a love which fulfilled all his needs their minds so differently schooled could never wholly meet but there was a tenderness that could make him content for a time he saw that period of contentment however only as time that stood still not the sharing of lifes time it was of no consequence however he had long known that he could only have shared lifes time with henrietta and it mattered not how or with whom he shared time that stood still for it was a wholly different property as the sun began to sink in the direction to which his duty called he rose from beside her to bathe he was certain of one thing he had not the will and certainly not the heart to sever himself from her now it would take the lawful command of a superior to accomplish that a return to england alone or with the regiment yet did he have the desire and the will even to comply with such an order why should she not accompany him home that twisting ache which came in his vitals in such moments of apprehension hauled him back to the truth that here in hindoostan he might live largely as he pleased but that in england above all in wiltshire he must live as he was expected all the christian charity of his family combined could not accept an indian paramour let alone a wife and beyond his immediate family henriettas guardians and the gentry of those parts such a thing could signal only that hervey had announced his intention to withdraw from all society he might even come to know what his late friend shelley had called social hatred would that matter to him as he lay in her arms he had imagined not but now as he sponged the cold water over his shoulders he knew that he would always hark back no matter how infrequently to the earlier sober days and that it would begin eating at the heart of the arrangement and his career he would have to forgo it any arrangement with a native girl except in a native station was insupportable perhaps he might implicate georgiana to appoint his bibi as ayah to her but what passed as a decent and honourable association in india would in england look no better than the slaveowner visiting the cabins of an evening as they embraced at their parting hervey was in more than half a mind to seek a commission in the companys forces to make his home here to see how long he could make time stand still until events resolved his troubles in the armys hands lay the companys honour and prestige if herveys bibi understood this how much more did somervile the kings honour indeed now rested in the balance at bhurtpore and there were some in the great houses of calcutta those connected with the native powers especially who would say that the very presence of the british in india was at stake that in combermeres hands lay the course of history there is much to speak of hervey said somervile welcoming him at the door of no fort william send for all your necessaries and rest the night here a good dinners the very least the council might provide before you go and pay their rent for the next hundred years hervey needed no inducement to stay with the somerviles for besides the unflagging pleasure he took in their company he had no agreeable alternative he could not return to the bibi khana having said his farewell the officers mess was at this moment being readied to lumber in a score of yakhdans and bullock carts in the direction of agra and his own bungalow was once again shuttered and draped with dust sheets emma joined them the ayah with her babe in arms for a moment hervey saw something the timeless vision of mother and child perhaps that reached deep into his own void and his godson a contented baby swaddled with affection a child that would grow to manhood sure of its nurture mother and child seemed somehow to rebuke him i had a mind to stay here when the sixth is recalled he said absently emma read that mind and thought better of questioning it her husband was less nimble be sure to take six months home leave beforehand mark it would be perilous to chance the marriage stakes on the angels who come out here serious advice wellmeant as ever if blunt hervey could not take offence perhaps i shall he said vaguely and then in a tone suggesting his true thoughts and i should want to know how my own offspring fares emma sensed the danger she nodded to her ayah mehrbani vaneeta the ayah bowed and smiled back and took the child to the nursery when do you leave matthew hervey whose eyes had followed the child from the room turned attentively to his hostess i er tomorrow at first light by budgerow as far as agra johnson is there with the horses somervile uncorked a bottle of champagne noisily damned carriers they must have trotted every case for a mile and more i had a bottle blow up in my hand last week hervey smiled a perilous position you occupy these days somervile i wouldnt trade it for a safer one i assure you looking now at the third in council of the bengal presidency with his thinning hair and spreading paunch it was difficult to imagine the defiant defender of the civil lines twenty years ago when the madras army was in one of its periodic foments or a decade later the angered collector going at the gallop pistol in hand for the pindaree despoilers of one of his villages hervey knew of the first by hearsay but he had witnessed the latter himself and he had not the slightest doubt that after all due allowance for the increasing effects of gravity and claret there was no one he would rather serve with on campaign than eyre somervile the erstwhile collector looked an unlikely man of action but man of action he was at least in his counsels as well as being a fine judge of men of horses of the country and above all of its people no eyre somervile did not seek safe billets i am of the opinion that it will not be a safe place inside bhurtpore theres a fair battering train and good many sepoys said hervey airily tell me of it somervile handed him a glass after emma hervey at once retailed the order of battle including the line number of the companys regiments he had fixed them in his mind as if the printed orders were in front of him a happy knack and one he had found could endure indefinitely if he recollected the picture once or twice a day emma by her eyes expressed her admiration herveys exposition lasted the whole of somerviles glass there was a deal of speculation in the drawing rooms as to his capability when first the news of his appointment reached here said the third in council when his friend had finished you know its tattled what passed when wellington proposed it to the duke of york the grand old mans supposed to have protested combermere was a fool to which wellingtons supposed to have replied yes but he can still take bhurtpore hervey frowned youre right no doubt said somervile though by no means contrite we all know the respect combermeres held in from peninsula days but now hes no longer subordinate and it is not for him only to implement the design of the commanderinchief the design must now be his own hervey merely raised an eyebrow so we must trust in wellingtons faith continued somervile blithely and i certainly take it as a mark of combermeres capability that he should seek out the opinion of a junior officer how was he by the way cool thoughtful he listens very attentively and reads too it would seem he had read all there was about the last siege somervile nodded with satisfaction he liked a thoughtful commander he considered it the prime military as well as manly virtue but he had his fears still i would wish that he knew something of india though the bones of a host of englishmen and sepoys are piled in those walls and lake was a general of much practice theyve stood as succour to every malcontent and freebooter who thought he could tweak the tail of the company or chew off a bit of the bone look at how the jhauts have rallied to that murdering usurper just because he dares hoist his colours in the place there must be no possibility of defeat this time hervey if combermere does not take bhurtpore then we may as well recall campbell and his army from ava and hand in the keys to fort william hervey sipped at his champagne judging that no answer was required by my reckoning there are not so many engineers said somervile suddenly and looking puzzled i should have thought the requirement in a siege was for more of these even at the expense of your own gallant arm hervey sat up again i had thought the same but it seems the engineers cant drive tunnels far enough and durjan sal will have a host of cavalry to hold at bay has combermere good interpreters he must have someone who is fluent in persian as well as others for the native languages it was a detail hervey had not missed for the officer was an old friend captain macan from the sixteenth lancers do you know him somervile nodded contentedly yes indeed a most able linguist then i regret the position appears filled somervile saw the tease believe me hervey if i thought it was safe to leave calcutta for one hour without amherst changing his mind about this enterprise then i should take to the field at once but you will see me there as soon as you take the place after your gallant comrades have reduced bhurtpore and put durjan sal in a cage there will be a good deal of political work to do and quickly the new resident will need all the help he can get in the first months and i for one would not stand on ceremony on that account sir charles metcalfes name ochterlonys successor was rarely absent from any conversation in calcutta these days hervey wondered he had never heard of him before so prominent a place he now took in the counsels of state i hope i shall meet him then i think he would hope that too for he knows your work how so somervile took the champagne bottle from its cooler and refilled their glasses i shall tell you it had been in july the evening of the ochterlony minute guns that somervile had declared his opinion to emma who had understood him at once as she always did they would do better to take yonder guns and go finish what he began at bhurtpore he rasped flinging down a sheaf of his home papers this defiance by the jhauts cannot stand no one but emma knew how much somervile had striven those past months to conclude a satisfactory outcome to the usurpation he had come to regard it as a rebellion against the company rather than solely as a source of humiliation and his object had been its crushing what does lord amherst say does he feel ochterlonys death in any measure emma had asked amhersts no fool he knows well enough that in repudiating ochterlonys proclamation he as good as put a bullet in his head he was decidedly ill at ease in council today and he railed against me beforehand as if the affair was somehow of my making hes afeard that this will play ill in london whats to be done eyre emma had enquired in the simple certainty that her husband would know and indeed he had already weighed the options his position in council was sometimes tenuous but he had no desire to hold on to it through mere compliance metcalfes here tomorrow from haidarabad i doubt hell need much persuading and amherstll be too fearful of going against his advice for his stock has always stood high with the directors though somervile would scarce admit it emma knew that none but her husbands stock might stand so high in council if only he would take pains to promote it a little more she knew his manner was not best calculated to win their affection but not a member could be in doubt of his understanding the governorgeneral had readily taken his counsel in the appointment of a successor at dehli as soon as sir david ochterlony had tendered his resignation somervile had pressed on lord amherst the claims of sir charles metcalfe though perhaps that was an easy victory for metcalfe had held the appointment until five years before and his judgement had been amply tested of late as resident in the nizams capital and so next morning he had called on sir charles before there was opportunity for subornation at fort william you have got to make amherst see sense in this matter metcalfe had that place been reduced twenty years ago you forget i was lord lakes political officer at that time sir charles had replied frowning it is a great wonder his army achieved half of what it did bhurtpore was never within his grasp let us not debate it now the whole of india will believe it without our grasp it may be so it may well be without our grasp in which case we ought not to make it an objective to grasp it somervile had relied on cool relentless logic however nothing that is made beyond the companys territories ought to be without the companys grasp it is surely the knowledge that were the company to will it any country power might be subdued that secures our peace and occasionally that will must most regrettably be put to the test but what say the soldiers somervile what was pagets opinion we shall never rightly know for hes been gone these several months all we may now do is wait on lord combermere hes due here ere too long meanwhile i should as soon ask his deputy to play the violin as ask his opinion on the matter the man is an ass that is a very decided opinion somervile is it much shared somervile had looked astonished i have never thought to enquire i come to my own judgement in such matters sir charles metcalfe had shaken his head slowly from side to side then the governorgeneral and by extension you are without sound military counsel again somervile had looked surprised i am not i have had very good counsel and from the seat of the trouble indeed and are we to know whose is this counsel a dragoon captain formerly on ochterlonys staff sir charles metcalfe had looked dismayed a captain are you quite well somervile there are generals and colonels here and you put your trust in a captain of dragoons i do the tone had been less defiant than emphatic as though he would have put his judgement in this against all comers sir charles had laughed then i should very much like to see this man you shall you shall and in the breaches of that place i hope hes studied the bhurtpore defences and drawn plans somervile now had the khitmagar open a second bottle so you see hervey sir charles was apprised of your observations and i might say that they materially informed his judgement hervey raised an eyebrow and what transpired what transpired is that sir charles studied the question for a full week and then gave his opinion in council emma smiled and it was matthew the most eloquent opinion you might ever hear even eyre was much moved her husband nodded i confess i was my dear i can read it aloud too for i have all the proceedings here at hand hervey did not object somervile rummaged among some papers on a side table then returned to his chair with a look of triumph hear this hervey your lordship gentlemen we have by degrees become the paramount state of india although we exercised the powers of this supremacy in many instances before we have used and asserted them more generally since the existence of our influence by the events of that and the following year he glanced first at hervey and then at emma at the mention of they had each been so embroiled in events leading to the pindaree war a war which as sir charles metcalfe here made clear had changed for ever the companys status both north and south of the sutlej it then became an established principle of our policy to maintain tranquillity among all the states of india and to prevent the anarchy and misrule which were likely to disturb the general peace sir john malcolms proceedings in malwa were governed by this principle as well as those of sir david ochterlony in the case of succession to a principality it seems clearly incumbent upon us with reference to that principle to refuse to acknowledge any but the lawful successor as otherwise we should throw the weight of our power into the scale of usurpation and injustice our influence is too pervading to admit of neutrality and sufferance could operate as support we are bound not by any positive engagement to the bhurtpoor state nor by any claim on her part but by our duty as supreme guardians of general tranquillity law and right to maintain the right of rajah balwant sing to the raj of bhurtpore and we cannot acknowledge any other pretender this duty seems to me to be so imperative that i do not attach any peculiar importance to the late investiture of the young rajah in the presence of sir david ochterlony we should have been equally bound without that ceremony which if we had not been under a preexisting obligation to maintain the rightful succession would not have pledged us to anything beyond acknowledgement with regard to the brothers durjan sal and madhoo sing the competing claimants for the office of regent i am not of the opinion that any final decision is yet required but my present conviction is as follows we are not called upon to support either brother and if we must act by force it would seem to be desirable to banish both negotiation might yet prove effectual but if recourse to arms should become necessary there would not be wanting of sources of consolation since i am convinced that a display and rigorous exercise of our power if rendered necessary would be likely to bring back mens minds in that quarter to a proper tone and the capture of bhurtpoor if effected in a glorious manner would do us more honour throughout india by the removal of the hitherto unfaded impressions caused by our former failure than any other event that can be conceived and then sir charles bowed and sat down said somervile and many were the sheepish looks about the place and the oyster eyes at the memory of ochterlonys illtreatment in a glorious manner hervey nodded content eyre my dear you must tell what was lord amhersts reply ah yes indeed he rifled through the papers in his lap here i have it it is but brief and rather a handsome testimony i do think hear this hervey i have hitherto entertained the opinion that our interference with other states should be limited to cases of positive injury to the honourable company or of immediate danger thereof in that opinion i have reason to believe that i am not supported by the servants of the honourable company most competent to judge of its interests and best acquainted with the circumstances of this country i should therefore have hesitated in acting upon my own judgement in opposition to others but i am further free to confess that my own opinion has undergone some change and that i am disposed to think that a system of noninterference which appears to have been tried and to have failed in would be tried with less probability of success and would be exposed to more signal failure after the events which have occurred and the policy which has been pursued during the last nineteen or twenty years a much greater degree of interference than was formerly called for appears to have resulted from the situation in which we were placed by the pacification of it might be a hazardous experiment to relax in the exercise of that paramount authority which our extended influence in malwah and rajpootana specially has imposed upon us applying these general principles to the particular cases before us and believing that without direct interference on our part there is a probability of very extended disturbances in the upper provinces i am prepared in the first place to maintain by force of arms if necessary the succession of balwant sing to the raj of bhurtpoor and so decided did the opinion sound that the chamber was silent for a full minute added somervile putting the papers back in order and then amherst said simply i perceive that no one would gainsay i shall today cause instructions to be drawn up for the commanderinchief to begin preparations to restore balwant sing to the raj of bhurtpore in a glorious manner said hervey again shaking his head and smiling grimly we must hope for more glory than rangoon has seen what a prospect war on two fronts when we can scarce make war on one chapter thirteen in a glorious manner agra december n ot since the first mughal emperor zahir ud din mohamed babur the tiger had agra seen such a host of men under arms three hundred years ago almost to the day having taken punjab with great but economical bloodshed babur had come down the jumna from his new capital at delhi to confront the rajpoot federation his army had been small by comparison with theirs as it had been small compared with that of ibrahim lodi in punjab but babur knew how to manoeuvre them to advantage the martial rajpoots two hundred thousand and more learned defeat at kanwaha near fatehpur sikri where baburs grandson akbar the great would in time build a new mughal capital after the battle babur rejoicing at becoming a ghazi a killer of infidels had made great mounds of the bodies of the slain and pillars of their heads models to be copied at bhurtpore centuries later with lord lakes men lord combermeres army knew its history the sepoys spoke among themselves of the futtah bourge the bastion of victory the great tower of skulls that stood as affront to both their caste and their calling the private men of the kings regiments their information learned more recently but with no less indignation likewise spoke of the insult to be effaced and it must be certain the retribution to be exacted on the defenders of bhurtpore that the jhauts who now stood defiantly on the walls of the city were not the same enemy as lord lakes was of no moment they were of the same country and they dared to oppose john company and the king red was the colour that predominated in the camps but a vivid red scarlet the colour of blood not the mellow red of the great sandstone fort nearby nor the rich deep red of the silks that clothed men and women alike in the chaupars and bazaars of this old imperial city the companys native infantry regiments were as regular in their appearance as lord combermere had known the dukes in spain save that the sepoys legs were bare the cavalry too had all the appearance of his own command at that time except that in the hands of some was a weapon that hitherto he had seen only in the hands of the enemy the lance its pennants now fluttering in the ranks of his majestys sixteenth lancers who aped their models in this part by wearing the schapska of bonapartes polish lancers instead of the shako hervey could not look at their scarlet bibs without a fraction of distaste for blue had been the colour of all who did not fight in lines and he thought it needless show show in both senses for scouting and outpost work was hard enough at the best of times without robinredbreast display hervey had been busy on his own account with matters of uniform for some time now he had become convinced that for field service their own coats should be modified in the same way as had their horses bridles early on in the peninsula the regiment had doubled the leather browband with chain so that a sword could not cut it and make the bridle fall from the animals head he had listened to accounts of maratha and rajpoot swordsmanship and learned that a favoured device was the passing cut at the shoulder and he had concluded that chain on the shoulder as of old would serve them well major joynson had been persuaded and the metalworkers of calcutta had been engaged to fashion six inches of mail three inches wide for each dragoons shoulder lord combermere saw it when he inspected his troops at agra and much approved and when three days later he went by dawk upstream to muttra to inspect the other half of his army and there found hervey and his troop he remarked on it favourably so that hervey was in no doubt that lord combermeres estimation of him was truly of the highest order i intend beginning a general advance on bhurtpore three days hence on the ninth the commanderinchief told him as he turned his horse away i shall make all appearances of wanting to parley so that they do not take steps to inundate the defences but i shall want you to break from the force at last light and move to seize the bund then at dawn next day i shall send with all despatch a force to relieve you it was exactly as hervey had urged at fort william very good general two squadrons you said yes sir one of the elevenths and a rissalah from skinners horse they with their galloper guns the horse artillery would only impede us combermere nodded but slowly as if considering the eleventh yes and your own troop i should suppose hervey nodded his confirmation but the irregular horse are they to be so relied upon hervey smiled assuringly i may say with utter certainty your lordship that one could do no better in trusting them with ones very life three years ago in burma i had proof of it myself combermere nodded again this time more definitely very well then i shall have colonel watson write the orders at once is there any more you would have me do no sir except of course that our orders should not be made general of course hervey knew he had suggested the obvious but he had his reasons combermere rode high in his estimation from all that had gone before in portugal and spain but this was india capn ervey sir if yon farriers sick another day im gooin to ave to ask one o televenths to do gilbert them corns are gettin bad gilberts shoes were a problem that hervey could do without it wasnt just gilbert either for although corporal brennans assistants were capable of admirable coldshoeing by replacing worn iron with the stock shoes carried by each dragoon they were not yet proficient enough to make a therapeutic set and there were half a dozen troopers needing that attention ill speak to their colonel then replied hervey still wondering when he might have the orders which would give him authority to address his mission johnson was content lord combermere looked appy enough this mornin i were tellin all them greeneads that fancies themselves as dragoons about im at tloose hervey looked pained not anything in connection with general slade i hope of course it were about slade that were tstory indeed it was a story lord combermeres timely appearance at toulouse had made general slade drop his prey and hervey had raced back to the regiment a free man again but combermere as far as hervey could tell had never known how providential had been his arrival he had known only the eagerness of the wounded cornet to be back in action there was a time however and certainly at toulouse when hervey would have been truly perturbed believing that the disparaging of a senior officer even one such as slade would have been inimical to discipline now he cared not at all the canteen was entitled to its views as long as it held them in private so to speak and if they could disparage slade they could extol combermere as it seemed they might johnson did the commanderinchief a service therefore hervey ought to commend him indeed there were always difficulties attendant on commending johnson though that reminds me but johnson was not finished word is in tcanteen that them walls is fifty feet thick and made of bones and solid rock hervey raised an eyebrow how do the intelligence agents of the canteen believe solid rock and bones are mixed together johnson did not consider it an impossible notion they didnt say only that the walls is so thick itd take a month o sundays just to scratch em hervey frowned theyre thick johnson i grant you that but not fifty feet and not solid rock theyll withstand some battering but theyre bound to be breached at some point and then it will be the bayonet in the old way lets ope so sir said johnson matteroffactly taking the reins of herveys second charger as hervey himself began picking up each of the little marwaris feet to check for stones ave yer eard thereve been some deserters an all there are always deserters johnson replied hervey just as matteroffact picking out a pebble from the offfore ay but they reckon theseve gone over to t jhauts who reckons how do they know corporal mccarthy eard e always ears everything if theyre irish hervey continued checking his mares feet they looked in good shape and who are they from these men t artillery hervey looked up the artillery ay and supposed to be good gunners an all hervey tutted he was not disposed to think that they could have gone over to the enemy for he could see no inducement except that as experienced gunners their services would be keenly sought and therefore he supposed well rewarded but surely they would not an one of em was at waterloo even that concluded it tattle johnson i should sooner imagine the sarntmajor a preacher but johnson was unmoved well thats what theyre saying capn ervey is there owt else hervey shook his head no i believe we may offsaddle and give them some hay there was only grass but hay was what they called it still and we can take our ease too for an hour or so call me if mr sledge comes in he said he might come up from agra today oh and see if you can find out any more about these deserters will you there was much to do even had he not had the assignment at the bhurtpore jheels the camp was beginning to look like a bestiary come alive with every manner of creature to provide milk or flesh for the army or muscle or a strong back his own troop might occupy him every minute though for the most part they were not without experience it was strange that they had seen action fierce action but had not yet been shot over as the saying went the affair at the river three years before had turned them into veterans overnight and it had been long enough past to give them the taste for more of it now yet there were things he must check for himself the firelocks especially since he expected that what would come first against them at the jheels was better seen off with the carbine than the sabre it was not something he could leave to his subalterns or rather would leave it was out of the question in any case to give the duty to green still as ineffectual as ever indeed he would not even have passed the duty to seton canning had he been with him still for certain things were properly his particular responsibility in the afternoon he received copies of general and field general orders he was keen to see the appointments to both the staff and to commands of brigades and divisions for there had been endless speculation and not a little wagering and he retired to the relative peace of his tent to peruse them with as much leisure as seemed apt general orders headquarters agra rd dec the

three smart active and intelligent noncommissioned officers of dragoons for appointments as assistant baggage master of divisions hervey thought he had better have someone in mind lest the general devolve one of the number on his troop stray would be best of course except that he was not from his troop neither was he by any standard smart and then enclosed with these orders there were others a long exhortation and in a style he knew from many a time in the peninsula and france the dukes own indeed field general orders headquarters camp agra dec the army now assembling for service on the agra and muttra frontier being about to advance his excellency the commanderinchief requests that officers commanding regiments will impress upon their officers ampc the imperious necessity which exists for each individual reducing the number of his servants to the lowest scale and taking the field as little encumbered with baggage as possible and desires that they will use their utmost endeavours to prevent superfluous individuals following the bazaars of their respective corps all superfluous baggage will be left at muttra and agra respectively in the first instance by divisions on advancing the march about to commence being through the territory of an ally of the british government and not that of an enemy his excellency prohibits in the strictest manner all marauding or plundering and desires that officers commanding divisions and brigades will cause it to be three times proclaimed to their respective corps that the provostmarshal has received peremptory orders to seize and inflict summary punishment of death on any individual or individuals caught in the act of plundering in thus publicly promulgating the decided measures to be resorted to in support of discipline his excellency feels assured from the correct habits of the european and native troops under his command that as far as they are concerned the warning above given is unnecessary but as the followers of bazaars of corps might avail themselves of opportunities to plunder the inhabitants of the country and others the commanderinchief deems it necessary to promulgate thus publicly the retribution which will await such conduct it was a handsome confidence thought hervey if illdisguised in its attempt to avoid besmirching the soldiers of the line it could scarcely be otherwise this latter though his own troop he might vouch for the ncos certainly but the arousal of baser instincts was something he had seen all too often to be so sure he would not see the same again for there was nothing saintly about the men of e troop better to tell them straight perhaps with the excuse that one man might lose his wits in the noise of battle and that herveys warning to him now might thereby save him his neck he read through half a dozen more routine orders and calls for returns alternately relishing his independent command and ruing it depending on the requirements of the paper just as he was nearing the end a despatch rider from the cavalry staff corps rode into the lines hervey watched keenly as the redjacketed dragoon reported to the regimental orderly tent whence the corporal of the day emerged at once to bring him to herveys hervey was obliged to sign a receipt for the contents of the staff dragoons sabretache more evidently than just a call for returns he said as he did so sir replied the man giving nothing away though he hoped it was indeed more than a routine despatch he had just risked his neck in a gallop from lord combermeres headquarters and he would prefer to return there with something more than a list the corporal of the day watched and listened keenly for any indication of what the despatch contained his standing in the canteen would be raised immeasurably if he brought news in advance of actual orders hervey took the despatch broke the headquarters seal and read quickly but silently field special order headquarters muttra dec major hervey th lt dragoons is required to form a mounted party for a special task consisting of one squadron hm th lt dragoons and one rissalah st local horse the party is to be ready at once to undertake the task on orders emanating directly from he the commanderinchief along the lines already communicated the object and design may not be communicated to any man however until approval by he by order of his excellency the right hon the commanderinchief signed w n watson adjutant general it was no more or less than he needed thank you staff dragoon please return the following reply the man had his pocketbook and pencil ready sir major hervey acknowledges receipt of the special order and comprehends it sir the corporal of the day looked disappointed he would have to embellish his account to the canteen considerably that is all said hervey when the staff dragoon looked up again the man slipped his pocketbook back inside his jacket up said the corporal of the day the two right hands shot as one to shako peaks and hervey nodded to acknowledge as the two men left he called the troop orderly corporal waiting outside have mr perry come please rudd he then mastered himself fully and mr green and the sarntmajor of course sir hervey was glad it was rudd rudd was an honorary pal more than honorary since the original pals were now but two and there was something that nurture in that corner of the great plain did by way of making comrades across the ranks corporal rudd sir how handy were you about your mothers shop sir corporal rudd was glad there were no witnesses to this exchange he did not like being reminded of the millinery i mean how well are you with needle and thread as good as any sir have you something to be mended no johnson could do that i need a more skilled needle embroidery rudd looked puzzled i can do that sir if its not too knotty what is it you have in mind sir i need something that passes for a majors star on these epaulettes rudd was all pleasure at the prospect but you shall have to unpick it when the siege is done local rank only i fear very good sir but rank is rank isnt it sir thank you rudd you are the first to hear you mean not even johnson sir not even johnson go to it then the officers and sarntmajor oh and say nothing to johnson rudd smiled ay sir hervey lost no time that afternoon he told his officers and serjeantmajor the contents of the several orders and added his own he wanted the troop to ride at light scales with no bathorses he would long remember the dismay on cornet greens face save with the serjeantmajor for extra powder and ball the baggage he wanted dividing into two field stores and other necessaries that which could be carried by packanimal to be put in charge of the quartermasterserjeant and to move with the rest of the brigade the remainder camp stores and general comforts to stand ready under corporal stray with the bullock carts here at muttra awaiting opportunity to rejoin them which he believed there would soon be once the siege was under way but it shall have to be judged right he said i dont want the jhaut cavalry cutting them up which is why i want stray with them serjeantmajor armstrong smiled corporal stray was the fattest man in the regiment the order light scales had at once precluded his riding in the first echelon for stray was generally now to be found on the box rather than in the saddle and yet there was not a man in the sixth who was more at home in the field than corporal stray his economy with stores was celebrated he could fashion any necessary from the most unpromising raw materials and quickly too and he was utterly imperturbable in the face of enemy and superiors alike once in paris after waterloo he had been posted as lone sentry on a bridge that the prussians were intent on blowing up for solely retributive reasons the explosive in place the officer of engineers had asked him to quit the span and seek cover to which the then private stray had replied not until properly relieved by the corporal sir the prussians had lit the fuses but still stray would not budge standing onguard with the bayonet when they tried to remove him bodily so that in the end the engineers had had to rush about frantically pulling the fuses from the barrels of gunpowder corporal stray was not a man to have in the front rank at a review but he was without doubt a man to have at hand on campaign and hervey was pleased for having the promise of him for a time after doing what he needed with his own troop hervey had addressed himself to the matter of the other corps the commanding officer the senior major proved difficult at first demanding to know what was the object of the special task despite the clear injunction in the written order at length he had given way however naming the captain to do duty with his squadron and had acceded at once to herveys request for a farrier the regiments of the yellow circle as the cavalry knew themselves could have their difficulties with each other but these remained within the circle and were fiercely guarded perhaps it was the fellowship of the horse the common essential of their arm for the horse took no side for himself in a fight instead submitting humbly but nobly to the bit in whichever cavalry had impressed him sometimes his rider unseated he ran away terrorstricken but for the most part he remained dutiful despite all privation hervey looked about at the elevenths troopers as he left the lines they were as mixed a bunch as any in hindoostan but bigger than his own in the main by a good halfhand if they bore the field well they would be formidable indeed when it came to closing with the jhaut cavalry more so than his own he had to admit for size told when it came to a clash next he had gone to skinners horse and if he had anticipated vexations with the eleventh he was positively certain that they would be legion with the irregulars since colonel skinner was in personal command he had never met james skinner he had only heard of him indeed there had been times since coming to india when he had heard nothing but of skinner and his silladar horse three regiments there were of these singular cavalrymen of which the second was commanded by jamess brother robert and the third hastily raised for service in east bengal five years before had without doubt saved his own troop in the affair of the chittagong river the sixth light dragoons or herveys troop at least regarded them as special friends they admired their skill as horsemen and with the lance they admired their boldness and proud independence and they admired their determination to see things through skinners was not native horse in the sense the canteen would understand it serviceable but inferior skinners was a corps apart their camp was a vivid lively place noisier by half than any kings regiments with much music and singing it might have been tamerlanes own the canvas and caparisons the silks and the streamers and all of the richest colours as hervey rode towards the guard tent the sowars of the picket began falling in under their daffadar lance pennants picking up the merest breath of wind men and lances otherwise like statuary a syce ran forward to hold gilberts bridle as hervey dismounted the daffadar saluted hervey turned to find a jemadar beaming at him this way please sahib hervey followed to the tent of the woordimajor who explained that both the second in command and the adjutant were at exercise then a bearer came into the tent and after an exchange of words the woordimajor said that colonel skinner himself would see him hervey put his forage cap back on and walked with him across the maidan to a yellowstriped pavilion set to one side nearest the river the sentry came to attention as the two began walking the line of whitened stones as they reached the beaded entrance a voice called from inside you are most welcome major hervey hervey noted with appreciation how nimble must be the regiments hircarrahs he pushed aside the strings of beads and paid his compliments i know very well who you are major hervey i have naturally heard all there is of the affair of the chittagong river i stand in admiration sir said james skinner designated commandant of what was officially the st local horse he held out his hand hervey took it and acknowledged the accolade with a bow of the head but it is i who stand in admiration colonel skinner well well let not either of us stand long take a seat you will have some whisky it was a moment or so before hervey could judge whether he was speaking to a british or a native officer one half of colonel skinner was scotch his fathers half his voice was that of a british officer perhaps a shade fastidious but without all the music of the native voice the hanjibanji as somervile called it but it was the rajpoot half his mother nobleborn that presented itself in appearance most james skinner was fortyseven years old his hair was silvering and his face though benign spoke of many years campaigning and for several masters only in lord lakes day had he thrown in with the company he had raised and trained the corps himself he had given it its creed and thence its uniform and had led it to victory after victory against any that would oppose those sworn to die his wealth from booty was said to be prodigious he had three wives one mahomedan one hindoo one christian yet he was no dissolute nabob he was as much a scholar as babur had been speaking and writing flawless persian and knowledgeable in the history and art of all of hindoostan his men worshipped him but why was he here in the field in person hervey wondered he was three years older than the duke had been at waterloo he might easily have devolved command on an executive officer the share in any booty such that it might be in a campaign made in the territory of an ally would anyway go to him as the colonel of the corps even if london hervey understood would not officially recognize his rank did colonel skinner who could have taken his ease in dehli or on his jagirs nearby crave still the sword and the saddle for their own sake there were such men and hervey saluted them indeed he took more pleasure in skinners chair and his whisky at that moment than if they had been those of the duke himself jaswant sing tells me you have a promising seat he says you were quick to the rajpoot way of riding hervey was gratified and smiled obligingly though puzzled that skinner should know of it but i fear i had the best of attention and horses i could not imitate those airs when later i tried them on my own horses colonel skinner nodded slowly as if he understood woordimajor you may go to your ledgers or you may stay and drink whisky as you please which is it to be the woordimajor answered in english huzoor i have many papers to return for the lord combermere very well my friend there will be time for us to drink whisky when we have taken bhurtpore ji huzoor and he continued in urdu though too quickly for hervey to catch more than the odd word colonel skinner took it up but hervey managed to catch even less they seemed to be turning over an idea about horses he thought but the idiom was beyond him when the woordimajor had gone colonel skinner poured more whisky now major hervey what is it that his excellency has in mind hervey was surprised at the connection colonel skinner made but he judged it of no matter it was just the way of things in india i beg you would read this colonel he said handing him the order colonel skinner took longer to read it than hervey expected at length the commandant looked up and said thoughtfully the jheels hervey saw little point in protesting may i ask how you knew colonel it is evident from the size and composition of the party that the object is detached from the fortress for otherwise it would be futile there can be but one such object if one has read the accounts of lord lakes endeavours do you know the bund colonel of course i am of the opinion that such a force as mine could hold them until relieved within the twentyfour hours following we should rely greatly on your galloper guns of course colonel skinner nodded i am of this opinion too i cannot suppose the jhauts will garrison the jheels until they perceive the army is moving on them there is much industry in the jhauts but little imagination they will work most fiercely to eject you once you have them however who is to lead the relief general sleigh or perhaps even general reynell as i understand good combermere sees its importance then the commandant drained his glass you will stay and dine with us major hervey hervey saw his duty done i thank you yes my corporal he will be the guest of my daffadars when dinner was finished more hours later than hervey had thought possible colonel skinner accompanied him to the picket to see him on his way it was a fresh night not cold with a full moon torches blazed about the camp and beyond in the city and the many other camps about it as they came upon the picket corporal wainwright led up gilbert beside him a naik led another horse smaller but with twice the blood marwari major hervey of very choice breeding and schooled in our classical manner i hope you will accept him hervey was all but dumbstruck in hand was as fine a stallion as he had seen in hindoostan black with a white face and massive neck sir i he is called chetak do you know the legend of chetak major hervey indeed i do colonel i know it was chetaks leap that let the maharana pratap kill man singhs mahout and much more major hervey indeed colonel much more but the maharanas chetak was a grey major hervey and i would not have you ride two greys so we make you a gift of one of our best bloods and one needless to say who is well schooled in the rajpoot airs hervey was a long time in his leavetaking he had met a man among men and he had known the regal hospitality of the rajpoots these things were to be savoured and honoured even at times like this especially at times like this there was no place for a stallion in his troop but what a saddlehorse he would make when they were returned to calcutta and what a sire too that night though very late he wrote to somervile i am very glad of your letter numbered and especially its intelligence of peto how pleased he will be to slip anchor and be up the irawadi at last let us hope as you say the gossip has it that a treaty is near what a camp this is how i wish you could see it each fighting man with us has more than one follower and a large bazaar accompanies the camp besides we carry the mens tents on elephants and each elephant has two men four bhistis to each troop a cook to every men every horse has a man to cut grass for him the men have six camels and two men per troop to carry their beds then come the gram grinders tailors bakers butchers calasseys or men for pitching tents and many others each hospital has six men and of these there are making and there are dhoolies for a regiment i should say that for officers and men we must have followers this counting in the bazaar and officers servants i have in my own service men camels and a hackery five horses and two ponies and this for a mere captain of dragoons although this night i have received the gift of a magnificent marwari stallion of colonel skinner of the native horse it is tempting to ponder on the nature of the battle to come and whether we shall see the single combat again that was the purpose of these great brutes i trust not i think there is a more glorious manner in which to take bhurtpore and it must be with art and powder in very large measure rather than with the breasts of brave men and horses hervey completed another page of observations then laid down his pen he knew full well that many a brave mans breast would be torn open sepoys and kings mans alike and he trusted it would be sepoy and kings man in fair measure since it did not do for the kings men to be preserved like bonapartes garde while the legionary company regiments were expended but he knew also that the butchers bill would be determined in large measure by his own aptness and audacity in executing the special order the affair of the jheels would be decided by a few but the price of failure paid by the many chapter fourteen laudace the early hours of december the order had come by semaphore from agra at first light the day before the divisions were to advance on bhurtpore before dawn on the th the cavalry brigades leading it was not a difficult movement bhurtpore agra and muttra formed an almost equalsided triangle with muttra at the apex and the object of operations at the base left the roads the sides of the triangle although the base itself was not straight were good and wide permitting easy movement of formed bodies of men the rains had gone and there was no rutting to speak of the country either side was more flat than not and not too jungled so that if the divisions found the roads blocked it would be no very great impediment to progress even for wheels not that opposition was expected each day the divisional commanders had sent patrols as far as three or four leagues without sign of a jhaut picket and a cloud of spies in exchange for quite modest amounts of silver had daily brought assurances that the roads beyond all the way to the walls of the city itself were open and empty of troops indeed the only obstacle to movement would be the sacred cows that ambled with perfect liberty along the old mughal highways for krishna himself had been born in muttra and so the sacred cows wandered on sacred ground the distance they had to march was no great trial to either shoe or boot or even to the bare feet of the sepoy from muttra it was but eight leagues at a cavalry trot no more than three hours even at the sepoys steady rate of three miles an hour it was only a matter of eight an easy days business the light companies of kings regiments could do it by forced march in a morning the road from agra was a little longer winding through fatehpur sikri and the battlefield of kanwaha but not by much more than two hours or so and lord combermeres orders were clear in respect of not encumbering the columns with excess baggage so that by herveys estimation there could be no doubting their relief at the jheels by last light his only worry was the reliefs finding him the jheels were not especially difficult to find but they lay to the northwest of the fortress and were therefore masked to the advance there was always the chance that the jhauts would cut the road nearest the fortress once the game was up and so the relief force would have to be strong enough to force the road or else find the long way round via the southwest through waterlogged pasture hervey conferring with brigadiergeneral sleigh had therefore decided to send back guides as soon as he had taken the bund the previous day had been all bustle throughout the camps at muttra and he imagined at agra too his own troop forewarned had had an easier time of it and the unprotesting corporal stray had received a steady flow of camp comforts into his makeshift depot in the afternoon hervey had received orders by hand of one of lord combermeres aidesdecamp that he was to seize the bund as soon as was possible after dawn the following morning with the limitation that he must not leave muttra before midnight he had at once sent word to the eleventh and to skinners horse and their two squadrons had assembled at the krishna ghat a little before midnight their captains or jemadar in the case of the skinners rissalah having spent an hour and more with him beforehand to agree the conduct of the affair what is the parole johnson he asked as he took gilberts reins from him he had not asked him that in ten years it had been their ritual their game almost before any affair began it had started in spain when his groom had drawn the fire of the regiments outlying picket early one morning having searched all night like the good shepherd himself but to bring in a lost horse his habitual reply to any sentrys challenge to state the password was sheffield to which the equally invariable response was not tass friend but tass johnson except that that night in spain he had stumbled on the horseartillery picket and since then johnson had had a healthy respect for the daily parole dehli he replied a trifle gruffly feeling the effects of a long day what a lark this is do we get tfirst pick o tpudding even in india where dragoons fed like princes compared with home johnsons metaphors were still principally of the table nevertheless hervey thought to continue with it for a while there will be no pudding certainly not one with plums lord combermere made it clear we are putting down rebels the country is not the enemy durjan sal will lose his possessions as well as his head but thats not likely to amount to more than a measure of grog for every sepoy johnson muttered his disappointment he would have to rely on his own resources rather than the prize agents so be it he had always had a good nose and he always knew how to draw the line between honest booty and plain loot he had been as condemnatory as the officers when he heard of the fiftyninths men in agra stealing across the river in the night to prise gemstones from the walls of the taje mahale no johnsons speciality was military things that an officer might want for his own service or souvenir or else liquids and perishables which might sell at an inflated price before the sutlers arrived with their stocks hervey sprang into the saddle with almost the same ease as he had at first riding school the thought pleased him though he knew he favoured his left shoulder still as much by instinct as real necessity the twinges had now grown much less painful and greatly fewer he gathered up the reins and shortened his stirrups one hole which vexed johnson greatly for he had ridden at that length since leaving dehli hervey looked about him the moon the torches and the campfires lit up the ghat as if it were almost day his only regret was that in leaving so far in advance of the main body he would not see the division drawn up for this was an affair in the old way and he might not see its like in another ten years he wondered for the moment if the prospect displeased him but he could not dwell on it since he had a mind to be off at the very instant he had given his own orders to advance as the minute hand of his watch reached twelve they would have six more hours of pitch dark then one of twilight until at seven there would be no more dark to conceal them within hearing distance of a sentry the luminescent face of daniel coatess gifthunter told him he had but four minutes to wait there was light enough to see even the plain face of his own bought watch but in a couple more hours when the moon had set he would be glad of mr priors clever work four minutes only perhaps he ought to make a start they all knew bonapartes lament that anything could be bought but time very well he would pay them back their four minutes when the mo tee bund was theirs no trumpets though they were lord combermeres picked men they had no need of fanfares column walkmarch he had thought very carefully about the order of march it was not the first time he had ridden with lancers but their handiness at night was uncertain he would lead with his own men therefore the trouble was he didnt have a cornet for green he considered not worthy of the name and he wished now he had asked eustace joynson to find him some billet in agra he had even thought of leaving him with corporal stray with the other useless baggage except that it might have been an affront that demeaned the whole troop so serjeant collins would command the advance guard and command it well too and corporal mccarthy would take collinss place at the rear of the first division next would come the eleventh and then skinners with their two galloper guns riding with hervey himself would be a galloper from each squadron and a lieutenant of engineers no man who had served in the peninsula could have aught but regard for the sappers and pioneers they had breached and mined and built and bridged for the army from lisbon to toulouse in baking sun and freezing rain shot over as they worked even as the line took cover hervey for sure had that regard in highest measure if only they could ride though then he would have been able to take a whole company of them instead of just their officer relying on the unskilled labour of the dragoons eight leagues they would cover them all mounted no leading as if it were just a long point in leicestershire they could trot for the first hour for the elevenths patrols had had orders in the afternoon to picket that night at the twoleague point thereafter they could proceed at a walk which would give the advance guard time to scout properly hervey did not know how many of his command had ridden an indian road by night it was not so bad at this time of year when days were cooler but the traffic could be greater even than by day mounted men and pedestrians alike escaping from the suns heat hackeries and elephants palanquins and dongas and always the sacred cow of the hindoo couching utterly unmoved by all he heard and saw but the country people of this corner of rajpootana knew that john company was about they sold him all they could in agra and muttra though at night they took care to keep themselves scarce for no one knew what the sahibs would do when the time came or even durjan sal and his jhauts if they dared leave the fastness of bhurtpore and why indeed should the jhauts do that bhurtpore had stood against the gora log before against lord lake even he who had dealt the mighty marathas such a blow was not bhurtpore impregnable let john company try if he dare they said among themselves as he tried in vain at rangoon and here he would meet the same as there only let us not be about the roads when he does try they said let us not run or ride to bhurtpore to warn durjan sal he has his own spies for that let us secure ourselves at night in our villages with fires burning to ward off marauders and trust in the boy krishna our neighbour from muttra become a god and all the other gods that would protect us poor country people from armies of any colour they made the elevenths distant picket at ten minutes to two fires burned bright but the two dozen dragoons were all alert and anxious for their own off they even raised a cheer as hervey led the column past at the walk nothing to report called the officer standing wrapped in his cloak by a lantern your scouts went by not five minutes ago hervey thanked providence it was collins in front of him there were but three men in the regiment he could trust so four properly for there could be no doubting rsm lincoln or rather quartermaster lincoln now even though hervey had never patrolled with him a year or so more and there would be another two or three wainwright had the makings certainly he wanted only experience atop his courage and myles vanneck but for the present it could only be collins or armstrong or seton canning the task was straightforward enough judge clear the route report but it wasnt easy at night the ablest of men lost their capacity to do what they did by day they imagined too much or else too little they lost command of their dragoons they failed to observe and forgot what to report no hervey had formed the opinion over long years that scouting at night tested a man more than did the worst trials of the day he cursed that cornet green was so worthless he wished the man had stayed in the pretty sort of shop that his father must one time have kept even though he had no need of him collins was entitled to have an officer share the danger he ought indeed to have all of greens pay herveys orders to collins had been few because they were unnecessary all that collins needed to know was the route and rate of advance certain of each he now proved the way with the surest touch here and there he had to make a sleeping hackery driver pull his team off the road but otherwise his progress towards the great fortress was unchecked for almost five hours without pause until just before seven oclock at the very first intimation of the dawn he led the companys troops into the territory of bhurtpore and hervey had not a moments hesitation in following then as arranged only a quarter of an hour later than hervey had predicted the advance guard halted at the last village before the road opened onto the plain of the fortress city and sent word back to him he was not many minutes coming up and fewer still at the halt he had his telescope out at once and made a sweep of the plain nothing not even the outline of the distant walls that was good he risked a great deal in cutting things so fine but without the help of a bit of daylight he couldnt find the jheels let alone the bund he was counting on poor camp discipline among the jhauts it was he knew from experience a peculiarly british rule for troops to be stoodto with arms for the dawn watch he counted here on there being but a few sentries tired after a long night alert only to their relief at daybreak he would take over the lead himself now for they must soon leave the obliging road he remembered clearly that it curved in a full right angle north towards the fortress but a curve at night especially a shallow one was not easy to gauge it would all have been so much easier with a guide that however he had judged impossible without somehow giving away the intention or else having a man who happened to live in agra or muttra and professed a knowledge of the jheels either way it was scarcely a requisite they could advertise instead hervey would have to trust his compass god bless daniel coates he said to himself as he thought to check it again finest of men and best of old soldiers who would have imagined there could be so small a thing as this piece of brass and whatever and yet so serviceable to the hour clever dan coates an ancient who sought the innovating as keenly as any lettered man first the percussion lock then the watch to read by night and now the compass to make a man see in the dark what a testimony to him once a trumpeter who had learned and risen by his own exertions alone hervey took the compass from its case on the saddle and noted the direction of the needle very well then he said squeezing his legs the merest touch to put gilbert into a walk five minutes and the needle was backing very definitely hervey waited five minutes more until the needle had moved a full quarter and then turned right off the road to make for the stream which would lead them north of the fortress and on to the jheel bund gilbert his feet now on pasture at once sensed the change of purpose and began to throw his head hopeful of a gallop trumpeter storrss grey the only other in the troop began whickering hervey winced if the others took it up they would soon alert the doziest of sentries there was nothing he could do though and he had worries enough finding the stream it must be there only if he had judged the needle so badly as to be almost doubling back would they not be able to find it navigating by night the officers constant trial and yet he had the advantage on any in hindoostan with coatess contraption as johnson called it hervey could picture coates now omitting to make allowance for the difference of time rising as always before it was light to beat about the bounds of his prosperous farm as he had risen every day before dawn as a dragoon in america and flanders and a dozen other places and then as labourer and shepherd and now as magistrate and man of consequence in west wiltshire daniel coates would now be gilbert squealed and ran to the side hervey pulled him back onto the bit snake he said to stores as matteroffact as he could having almost dropped the compass i fear well have more of em if were near water he would gladly put up with the inconvenience were it the price of finding the stream he could never fathom the horses ability to detect the proximity of a snake was it by smell or by sight it could hardly be the latter at night and yet it was curious what a horse could see in the dark when it had a mind gilbert had once shied at a basking krait thirty yards away and yet the troop had lost two others grazing to kraits in the last year alone jessye had almost died from the same when first he had gone to india although that had been in the black of night the grass was now taller hervey raised his hand for stores to halt and pressed gilbert on gingerly at last he was on it the stream he reined about and then motioned to stores to follow again as he turned right and north more sighing with relief the rest ought to be easy enough even if it meant the point of the sword serjeant collins a dozen yards behind saw hervey turn rather he saw gilbert turn for a few white hairs made all the difference in the forewarning of daylight collins knew that hervey was onto his line he never doubted he would be though he too knew how tricky the simplest of things were when night and the enemy were about and he knew that everything would change in the next halfhour the day came on faster in these parts than ever it managed in spain in half an hour they would be revealed even to a sentry on the walls of the distant fortress intruders murderous like the snakes in the grass the blow would surely be swift as it must be against a snake lest it bite the hand that strikes collins had no illusions as to how desperate would be their position in the hours ahead the column was now in a trot an uneven one as the ground itself was uneven but more than double the pace of the walk nevertheless the noise was greater too bits jingling and scabbards clanking it sounded like a wagonload of tinkers on the move could that be what any who heard it thought it was some hope thought hervey bullocks didnt snort and whinny he pressed gilbert for more speed get it over with get in among whoever was between them and the motee jheel cut and slice through them and get to the bund the commanderinchief was depending on him countless lives were waiting to be spared by his success the ground was with them for a while between the stream and the walls half a league distant was a rise which hid them from all but an observer on their side of it and it was still too dark to see further than earshot he could remember seeing a great many hovels when he had sketched here but they had come across none so far they were on the common pasture after all and he wouldnt expect to see even a grasscutter abroad at this time they were trotting even faster now gilbert stumbled once or twice until hervey took a proper hold and lifted him onto the bit he reckoned there would be light enough to canter in ten more minutes then they could sprint for the jheel bund and be done with it another three hundred yards the sun seemed to be racing them hervey could now see huts all along the rise he would risk it no words of command just press to the canter and let the rest follow gilbert struck off eagerly with his offfore as he always favoured hervey peering intently ahead praying that a cut or a bund would not suddenly check them four hundred horses pounding the till if they could not be heard then the earth must surely be shaking enough to rouse the dead he thought he saw the odd figure on the ridge with luck terrified villagers now there was light enough to make out the walls but still in the dim distance barely more than a silhouette they had the grass and the reeds as a backdrop the advantage yet would the guns on the walls be trained on the approaches to the jheel bund shotted and run out ready hervey knew they ought to be would they have the range a thousand yards he had estimated perhaps a bit more he had heard all manner of stories about the bhurtpore guns massive affairs immovable which could send an eightinch ball of iron with great velocity over the outworks and beyond such a gun wellserved could visit terrible destruction on a battery or a sap this was colonel anbureys fear that his sappers and miners would be too exposed to develop their work but it could be no less a concern for colonel macleod who had to expose his guns to some extent in order that they might fire at all there was bound to be ground less dominated by the bigger guns but the whole art of fortification was the facility to rake any approach and demolish any siege device hervey did not envy the engineers as they dug their saps and tunnels nor the artillerymen who heaved shot and powder and made themselves senseless and deaf nor indeed the infantry who would have to sit patiently waiting for a breach and then storm it and all these men relying on him now the sun broached the jungled horizon to his right a brilliant torch which at last signalled an end to the night watch and to stealthy manoeuvre it was day the time for fighting and fighting they would have directly ahead a quarter of a mile no more a cavalry camp come hastily to life he could see men rushing for their horses and others already mounted forming up how many they were he could have no true notion it might be the entire jhaut host beyond them and these a picket only even so they barred his way as effectively as any earthwork left wheel into line he called checking the pace to a trot to allow them the manoeuvre time trumpeter storrs blew the call perfectly just the four notes and a simple fifth interval easy enough with the bugle even at a bounce herveys own troop wheeled effortlessly an evolution they might do in their sleep so often had they practised it the eleventh behind had a harder time of it with more ground to make up and two ranks to form not one hervey wished he were leading with lances they were not much use to him at the rear and the sight of them lowered might well send the enemy packing as they stood he could only let them pursue once the dragoons had broken the jhauts up he cursed himself he looked rear again to see if the eleventh were close enough yet for support his jaw dropped up on the rise was a line of lances and yellow kurtas he could scarcely believe their celerity and address skinners sowars had taken post as flankers and on the commanding ground and without a word from him draw swords out rasped two hundred blades four hundred yards now and the ground ahead was even he put gilbert back into a canter glancing over his shoulder again there was wainwright covering and perry upright and assured he saw green struggling with both hands to hold his mare this was the best time the troop in hand every man intent on his next word of command in another two hundred yards or so when he shouted charge he would relinquish all control for a frenzied few minutes as each man fought his own battle selfreliant instead of as now knee to knee he glanced left the rissalah was pulling ahead good they would cut off any flight to the fortress pin the enemy against the stream hervey lengthened the stride to a handgallop how would the jhauts meet them they were still standing would it be with the flintlock surely not yet they showed no sign of movement why didnt they countercharge it was their only hope then the jhauts turned theyre breaking shouted hervey waving his sabre their way charge four hundred cavalry at the gallop lances couched but swords held high only infantry and guns saw the sabres point fleeing horsemen felt its edge hervey fixed on a distant tree on the centre line and pressed gilbert for all he was worth in seconds they were among them there was no need of his blade at first the jhauts were overmatched skinners sowars were doing good execution and his own dragoons were drawing blood yet an unseated man sword in hand still received his point cleanly at the throat foolish or determined was he it did not matter he tried to estimate how many they had bolted two three hundred at least gone like chaff in a puff of wind no need to sound recall he could see his objective clearly now the lone thicket of jhow marked it unmistakably the bund another half a mile at most come back to a canter he told himself but press on trust the squadrons to rally and conform now he had to pray the bund was intact the moats not yet inundated was that why the jhauts had run their job done the bund breached nothing more to cover there was a thunderous eruption of smoke and flame from the northeast bastion the same distance away to his left shot whistled overhead miles too high he sneered had their gunners no art had they not ranged in their idle moments could this truly be the fortress that had defeated lord lake he could see no movement at the jhow was this really to be so easy an affair or were they too late more guns fired their way from the smaller bastions and redoubts as they bore on but with no greater effect he felt only contempt for the jhauts perfunctory opposition even if they were safe behind their waterfilled ditches he pressed gilbert to a final effort then they were at the jhow his heart sank as he saw water in the channel he could see the breach not large he needed his engineer mr irvine chapter fifteen siege december to major w s beatson deputy adjutantgeneral before bhurtpore dec sir i have the honor to report for the information of his excellency the commanderinchief that in obedience to his command i proceeded to make a reconnaissance on the fortress of bhurtpore with the object of intercepting the means of inundation of its defences at what is known as the mottee jheel with under my command one troop th light dragoons one squadron th light dragoons under the direct command of captain rotton and a detachment of colonel skinners horse under major fraser on advancing in the vicinity of the bund at first light i encountered an encampment of the enemys cavalry which was at once attacked and the enemy driven off without loss the body of colonel skinners horse acting on the initiative of major fraser made a flank movement by which they intercepted and cut up more than five hundred of the enemys cavalry before they could reach an outwork in which the greater proportion of them took refuge at this time the guns of the fortress opened a moderate fire upon the force but without damage after the affair of the enemys cavalry i proceeded at once for the bund which was found to be cut in two places though the breaches had not been quite completed a moderate amount of water only was judged to have entered the channels and this was later confirmed by reconnaissance the ditches of all the outworks being dry work was begun at once under lt irvine of the engineers to repair the breaches and this was accomplished by late morning the enemy mounted two attacks on the bund during this time but they were heartless affairs and easily beaten off at thirty minutes past midday the relieving party under the command of briggeneral sleigh took possession of the jheel bund and as instructed to do so i relinquished my responsibilities in this regard i beg i may be allowed to express my approbation of the intelligence and zeal of major fraser and lt irvine and that the conduct of the body of colonel skinners horse was exemplary i have the honor to be ampc ampc ampc m p hervey major hervey led his troop into the sixths lines late that afternoon his command now dispersed but their feat of arms already the talk of the army edmonds had turned the regiment out in their honour mounted ranks with swords drawn and the quarterguard with carbines at the present local rank herveys majority might be but it entitled him to arms presented rather than a mere butt salute and edmonds would have the regiment know what a day in its annals this would surely become hervey could scarce believe the material for the siege now assembling the ordnance the tentage camp stores provisions transport the livestock somehow driven from agra and muttra with as much ease it would appear as a wiltshire shepherd might press his flock along a downland drove and the regiments kings and sepoy battling for good order and military discipline as they began their routine of the siege proud colourful cheery possessed of selfconfidence in limitless quantity hervey knew that he and his men had saved them blood and he was glad of it also because the mounted arm would after all be able to look the infantry in the eye in this affair of digging and then the bayonet what a scene it was in agra and muttra he had known its individual elements but only now did it appear to him as a whole it was a scene from many a picture he had thrilled to in his youth the crusades the hundred years war cromwell and the king the peninsula it mattered not where for the principle was the same the paraphernalia of the siege the methodical patient painful marshalling of resources and then their remorseless application until the besieged struck their colours or had them torn down or else the besieger his resources exhausted struck camp and stole away only the detail of the brownskinned servants and camp followers the sutlers dhobimen sweepers bhistis syces lascars and countless others gave the scene its place hervey nodded modestly to the salutes and wellwishers his troop were less restrained in their acknowledgements enjoy it for the moment he thought the monotony of the siege will soon dull the remembrance but oh indeed it had been a very fine affair at the motee jheel and nothing could take from them the rightful sense of victory if only as local as their leaders rank but two days later it seemed that the monotony of the siege would have them all exchange places with any man elsewhere than at bhurtpore major joynson read the days general orders to the captains and staff assembled in his orderlyroom tent a wellmade affair the size of a tennis court twelve feet high and lined with vivid yellow cotton though the smoke of a wood stove and a dozen cigars rendered the lining not as striking as once it had been field general

are directed to prohibit in the strongest terms the owners or attendants when going out with their cattle for forage from advancing too far into the jungle in the direction of the fort or from

received orders to strengthen patrols and escorts dull work but better than labouring for the sappers the troopcaptains nodded i have made a roll of the duties the adjutant is having them copied as we speak that is the long and the short of it are there any questions gentlemen there were none very well that is all but let us see if we can dine together promptly at seven tonight hervey stay a while longer if you please major joynson sounded confident enough if a shade tired when he had said i have made a roll of the duties hervey knew full well the major would have done just that himself and in every detail rather than delegating the task to the adjutant that was what eustace joynson did best better than anyone indeed and such was his conscientiousness that he could not allow a task to be performed any less well than was possible throughout lord towcesters diabolical time in command joynson had tried his best in these regards but all too often he had counted himself a failure including for his part in the events that culminated in henrietta herveys death not that hervey himself would apportion one ounce of blame to the major whom he had grown to respect on account of both his conscientiousness and his doggedness in the face of the most wretched personal circumstances and there was no doubt too that the painstaking attention to detail occupied joynsons mind admirably daily he fretted about frances for despite everyones best efforts his daughter had lately become engaged to an officer of native infantry a penniless and stupid one at that the responsibility of allowing his daughter to embark on an unsuitable marriage weighed heavily with him yet he simply did not have the strength of mind to forbid her lord combermeres express orders are that you keep the rank of major hervey pro tempore i should be much obliged if you would act therefore as second in command hervey was not disposed to agreeing without some qualification for besides aught else he would have no job to do if joynson continued to attend to every detail of course but i must keep command of my troop joynson nodded blankly if hervey thought himself capable of both then who was he to gainsay him i gather combermere asked that you join his staff hervey smiled a nice gesture but a siege is a dull enough thing to be engaged in without having to watch it from headquarters no gesture i heard it was to be general whittinghams deputy yes but an affair of paper all the same sooner or later hervey youll have to submit to such a regime armies arent run from the saddle as well you know hervey smiled again joynsons paternalism was endearing if not always deft he was no edmonds not in his sureness of touch that is i know but i would wish for the time being that it were later rather than sooner this affair will not be at all easy joynson looked troubled you doubt we will prevail hervey considered his words nothing is certain it would be well to remember it the engineers say they cant tunnel they can only sap the guns forward and general edwards says he cant guarantee a breach of walls so thick even with his twentyfourpounders the train begins arriving today by all accounts you are well informed is there word of how long the engineers will need upwards of ten days before they get the first battery into position according to brigadier anbureys major i think we shall be much occupied then with our little escorts and the like ive agreed with the eleventh that we shall patrol alternate nights throughout our allotted sectors without a natural feature as our boundary its too chancy to have patrols from both beating about the place they will take duty tonight five days later field general orders camp before bhurtpore th dec parole gazeepore a working party from each of the infantry divisions of the same strength as yesterday to be sent tomorrow at daybreak to the engineer park the quartermasters establishments and public cattle to be sent there as usual a carpenter is also directed to be furnished from each of the corps in the st and nd divisions of infantry a detachment consisting of five companies from the st infantry division will march tomorrow morning and take charge of hackeries proceeding from the artillery park for ammunition and stores to agra with reference to an act of parliament th and th geo iii on the subject of prize property agents and claims thereto the field general orders of the th instant appointing a prize committee and directing prize agents to be nominated by ballot for each of the divisions of the army and by the general staff is hereby cancelled and it is now ordered in conformity with the provision of the said act that two agents only be appointed for the army his excellency the commanderinchief and the field officers will nominate one agent and the other to be appointed by the captains and subaltern officers with the army the prize agents will be furnished with the required letters of attorney appointing them agents for the army and they will be prepared on their part to give security in the sum of ј sterling each the prize agents on all points of duty connected with their agency will be guided by the spirit and letter of the act of parliament before cited and which is to be found in carrolls code of regulations chap that part of the field general orders of th instant which directs that all property captured from the enemy by any individual of the army be forthwith delivered up to the prize agents and imposes the forfeiture of all claim to share besides other penalties on individuals who may be discovered secreting or detaining property knowing it to be a prize and further requires the agents to demand all prize property wherever it may be discovered remains in full force major joynson took off his spectacles as he concluded well gentlemen from the first part it would seem that the sappers are making good progress if powder is to be brought forward the same assembly his troopcaptains and staff heard the days orders each afternoon before evening stables and this was indeed the first intimation of true progress as to the enemy continued joynson now polishing his spectacles i had expected them to be more active by day and by night yet it appears they will do no more than beat up a few grasscutters now and then and they surely wont venture out at night it seems that being said we cannot afford to lapse in any vigilance he looked at each of the captains as sternly as he could a game effort as to the last on the subject of prize money i cannot imagine that it will amount to much this durjan sals army being scarcely wellequipped but we had better attend to the election of these agents i shall ask the adjutant to canvass all officers but let it be rightly understood whatever prize is taken is first the prize of the regiment if it is a worthy trophy i intend that it is kept by us then let us hope we intercept the treasury as it makes its escape said hugh rose smiling and blowing a great deal of smoke into the air from his cigar hervey contemplated roses raffish mien he thought it a not altogether helpful pose with ridingmaster broad his dupe there was no avoiding the word sitting in the rear rank hugh roses appearance betrayed nothing of the conditions they were living in comfortable enough but undeniably reduced and his thick black hair and fine features which won him the easy admiration of his dragoons as well as their women looked the picture of grooming as if for a drawing room at fort william his remark on the pecuniary spoils of war albeit no doubt intended in some levity required a rebuke a happy thought indeed rose said joynson however inclined more to punctilious attention to regulations than to scruple but on that i fear we should have to follow general orders and in any case any treasure in bhurtpore must belong rightfully to the deposed rajah that is why i said i do not suppose the prize money will amount to much the captains feigned disappointment are there any questions no very well then dinner at eight when the others were gone hervey spoke his mind i think we might propose some more active duty the men are restless yes i know it what activity do you imagine well we could make an effort to root out these cavalry who pick off the working parties instead of merely trying to guard everyone and everything theyre not sallying from the fort that much we know and they cant be coming from the east or north across the jheels if both brigades put up a squadron or better still all of skinners horse to beat all the cover to the west and stoodto every man during daylight for three days say we might bring them to battle i can suggest it to childers tomorrow it has merit enough even were the men not restless it would have to be done soon however theres a danger that once the artillery begins they may bolt durjan sal he may not have the stomach for a siege from what i heard yesterday of sir charles metcalfes treaties with him he never imagined it would come to this joynson nodded very well there is one more thing i would speak of green not this time he has had his warning deedes oh i feared it would come hes the most blusterous serjeantmajor ive seen thereve been all manner of confusions these past ten days joynson was silent for some time sir ivo will be back in but a few weeks he will know what to do sir you know what to do said hervey in a tone meant to be encouraging though the words themselves accused the major of evading his duty joynson shook his head slowly i had hoped not to have this sort of trouble hervey sympathized for trouble it would be the major did however have the advantage of being in the field it was a far easier place in which to dismiss a man than the barracks a word with the brigadier tomorrow joynson sighed o the pleasure of the plains hervey looked at him blankly very well but you know it will look very ill with the other regiments hervey knew that too but he knew it would look even more ill were the regimental serjeantmajor to falter at a time less propitious he said nothing but picked up his cap and made to leave thank you hervey said joynson wearily i knew well enough that deedes was incapable but i kept telling myself it was only by comparison with mr lincoln the tone was a shade too despairing hervey turned full back sir i know i speak for the regiment when i say that all ranks hold your stewardship in high regard this is but trying detail and the corrective is at hand sir ivo ought to be very well pleased with what he finds joynson looked genuinely surprised in the event it was very easily done the major called for the rsm soon after first parade next day and told him that with regret it was his decision to relieve him of his duties he was to report as soon as was practicable to the depot at agra pending a further decision as to his employment thereafter when joynson recounted the interview to hervey later that morning it was with surprise still at deedess reaction you know he seemed almost pleased relieved he said he had always done his best which i fear is true he said he wished to serve on in some other position if it were possible i dont know there may be something in calcutta well i am all astonishment i imagined he would bluster as ever and he left camp with some dignity too i called in hairsine and told him he was to be acting serjeantmajor and deedes treated him very decently by all accounts hervey nodded though he had not a moments doubt that deedess dismissal had been necessary well he must have had some quality otherwise he would never have been advanced in the first instance i imagine he felt some loyalty too even in his exigent position that was to have been my method if it had come to it calling on his better self to accept things for the good of the regiment still it is done now joynson appeared to take no satisfaction in it however even with hairsine making a difference already at orderly room who is to take c troop ive told strickland to make his senior serjeant do duty until theres time for a proper regimental board by then sir ivo should be back im deuced glad strickland postponed his leave hervey saw no reason why a board should not be held at once but he saw no likelihood of convincing joynson c troops man would do well enough strickland would not have it otherwise did the brigadier express an opinion about taking the offensive he said he would speak with sleigh but it seems the guns will be going in soon and combermeres likely to want a strong cavalry presence we shall all say amen to that its well time the forts guns were answered the guns of two bastions in particular had caused annoyance and casualties since the army had first appeared before bhurtpore yet could not be answered with any effect at the extreme range of the field artillery nor even indeed with the long guns of the siege train yet only when the engineers had sapped their way to within a thousand yards or so and built up redoubts could the gunners try to dislodge the enemys cannon and dislodge them they must for the siege guns could not pound away with the bastions commanding the ground so a siege was an occasion when adyes general injunction against counterbattery fire did not hold i await orders on this keenly too said joynson shall we take a ride to look at the ground hervey had never before ridden ground with the major and he was eager to do so he wanted to learn how good was his eye for country compared with that for administration for in spite of the banter of the camp at agra he was certain that the cavalry must be more active in this siege than the textbooks allowed he had studied the accounts of lord lakes failure he was certain that if the cavalry became a mere arm of the commissary then the siege would go the same way as lord lakes they rode with only their covermen hervey marked by corporal wainwright joynson by the senior corporal the major was not one for panoply and in any case he scarcely expected trouble within the ring of scarlet around the fortress everywhere was purposeful activity hervey could not remember scenes the like since san sebastian perhaps badajoz even columns of sepoys tramped to and from great breastworks thrown up in a matter of days like molehills on greensward guns and ammunition wagons lumbered forward continuously and empty wagons passed them on their way back from dumping powder shot and shell at the batteries in anticipation of the great pounding to come and the engineers the sappers and miners who opened the way for the infantry whether by bridge or breach worked oblivious to their surroundings and to the enemys guns which periodically sent hissing spheres of iron arching into the sky then to throw up fountains of earth where they struck before bowling along the ground to knock down men and horses like skittles if they didnt look sharp hervey had observed the same curious detachment in the peninsula the sappers working as calmly as if they were navigators at an english cut it was a cool courage theirs not one fired by dash or steadied by the touch of cloth he wondered if it could endure as the guns began to take their toll sapping to the foot of the walls would be hot work indeed do you think durjan sal doubts the outcome seeing all this hervey asked the major suddenly they had ridden for ten minutes and more in silence hervey was unsure what he had heard you mean will he ask for terms no i mean does he consider those walls impregnable does he believe we shall just go away you could scarce call firing from those walls much of a counteraction i confess to being surprised replied hervey watching warily as another ball arched from a distant bastion towards them joynson watched it too it hit an outcrop of solid rock a hundred yards ahead of them sending a shower of deadly shards in all directions but he must think those walls solid enough and in truth he might be right ive not seen their like before i think do you know why it is the engineers cant tunnel joynson supposed only that the ground was too hard the distance pure and simple is my understanding they cant get close enough to begin a gallery i cant say as i understand if they can sap forward why cant they then tunnel because after two hundred yards there isnt air enough to breathe or to make for a good explosion they rode on a further halfmile in silence or rather without a word for durjan sals guns were now speaking continually three of them fired at once from the longnecked bastion the report so loud that both men looked its way hervey saw the homing shot first low and straight not plunging like the others she comes our way he said warily neither man moved a muscle more than had they been on parade it was as unthinkable as it was pointless eighteen pounds of iron grazed the rocky outcrop fifty yards to their right then ricocheted half a right angle but chippings the size of musket balls shot their way drawing blood from herveys hand and his mares shoulder joynson on his nearside but half a length in front cursed as his shako was all but knocked from his head the silver cross beneath the oilskin having stopped a stone bullet he didnt see his mares wound at first looking about her legs and flanks for marks oh god he cried suddenly jumping from the saddle blood spurted from her breast as if from a stirrup pump joynson took off his silk stock and pressed it to the wound a neat slice like the sabres work an artery hervey for sure he groaned if it were an artery there was nothing that they or even david sledge could do but hervey got down and took the bandages from his valise corporal wainwright did likewise and joynsons coverman the same but joynsons sleeves were soaked through and the pool of blood at the mares feet was spreading rapidly its no good eustace but hervey knew the major had bought the mare for his wife years ago conceding would be a doubly painful business give me a pistol hervey took one of the flintlocks from his saddle holster already loaded tamped he held it out to him shall i do it while you steady her no hervey it wouldnt do said joynson simply taking the pistol and letting go the silk stock nevertheless hervey took out his second pistol and made ready he had no idea if the major had ever shot a horse it was the devils own job even without sentiment offsaddle her will you hervey said joynson resolutely when it was done the major wiped his hands on his overalls rubbed the little mares nose cocked the pistol and put the muzzle gently but firmly into the fossa above her left eye angling it so as to aim at the bottom of her right ear he pulled the trigger the mares forelegs folded and she fell to the ground without so much as a grunt hervey was impressed a businesslike despatch as neat as any hed seen it had not been two minutes since the stone had done its worst she was a fine animal he said with real admiration tears welled in joynsons eyes which he did nothing to hide she was and i should have left her with frances and then with an almost bitter note except that i couldnt have trusted her to see to her rightly hervey thought to say nothing joynson knelt and cut off a lock of the mane the last of anne joynson then save for frances herself hervey still thought it best to stay silent indeed he had begun wondering how they might decently dispose of the carcass joynsons coverman was already resigned to walking back to the lines id swear them guns was trying to do that sir he said making ready to hand the reins to the major so would i sir added wainwright somebody in that fort knows how to shoot thats for sure hervey frowned and shook his head the way that shot ran level the gun must be a giant it couldnt be retrained quickly enough to aim anyway i doubt they can even make us out from that distance no a lucky shot ill warrant that evening however the camp was abuzz with rumour about the accuracy of the jhaut guns it was confidently asserted that the gunners were frenchmen or italians as there had been in native service throughout the maratha wars and there were wilder stories too that the deserters from his majestys artillery were directing the fire the direst retribution was sworn for any who had changed sides nor was it clear where a frenchman would stand in this reckoning hervey did his rounds that evening well pleased with the evidence of the sixths fighting spirit even the grocer a name that hervey found himself thinking of increasingly if not actually uttering seemed more animated at dinner joynson certainly had an edge not usually apparent it had been a dozen years and more since he had been shot over the sudden taste of gunfire that afternoon seemed to have been an exceptional tonic hervey turned in just before midnight after walking the horse lines they had been quiet with nothing but an occasional whicker and grunt from the animals themselves or an evenin sir from a sentry of the inlying picket and although it was the picketofficers job to check that the running lines were taut he had inspected each of the troops in turn he had known enough times in spain where a loose line had ended in runaways and broken legs and he had checked too that the sentries knew the parole and how they were to be relieved the men were alert and it had given him much satisfaction to go to his tent knowing that the sixth were as keen in their field discipline as they were in their fighting intent he was afraid the former would be tested far longer than the latter for what he had seen of the siege that day did not lead him to suppose there would be anything but cannonading and sapping for a month or more save perhaps an obliging sortie by durjan sals cavalry but now he was pleased for his campaign bed and that it was the sixteenth daniel coatess old regiment who stood sentinel he could rest assured private johnson had placed a bowl of hot water on one of the chests but it was now only lukewarm hervey undressed put on his nightshirt washed his hands and set to work with sponge and tooth powder then he unmade his bed in the nightly routine of shaking out anything that might have crawled there during the time his groom had been gone and satisfied at last of his safety lay down between white cotton sheets beneath two thick woollen blankets he took care to double them and fold the edges under for he knew he would need their warmth on so starry a night the pillow was soft and he had no desire to read or to contemplate anything he turned down the lamp to the merest glow and closed his eyes chapter sixteen rumours of war the early hours f rom the depths of sleep hervey was called rudely to arms to awake to the alarm the bugles repeated c and e unmistakable and easy enough for the most frightened trumpeter to blow had been a thrill in his cornet days but now it meant only anxiety in the knowledge that there had been some failure perhaps his own there was firing too distant but near enough to take account of he turned up the lamp and began hauling on his overalls as private johnson breathless pulled back the tent flap major ervey sir hervey had no idea why his groom was already abroad and dressed they ad me up cos thi mares got a bit o colic all ells broke loose over where t sixteenth are very well youd better saddle up gilbert if you will he began wondering who had given the order to sound the alarm bring im ere sir no just where we stand to this was no time to be making things complicated johnson picked up herveys boots and shook them thank you johnson now away it took him but a minute more to finish dressing fastening on the swordbelt last and picking up his pistols from beside the bed he put on his shako as he ducked out of his tent straining his eyes in the darkness which fires and torches made all the darker in the unlit places men were hastening all about him but with order and purpose all they did indeed was the same as for standto before first light every day except that it was at the double and in the expectation of action rather than merely the possibility when he reached e troops line the chargers to the right he found johnson with gilbert under saddle fastening up the bridle he put both pistols into the holsters then made to tighten the girth and surcingle right sir said johnson taking away the head collar rather than spending any more time looping the straps hervey was not yet ready to mount though mr perry mr green he called there was a good deal of calling all around and he was not about to enter into a competition with the corporals but he wanted to know his officers were at their posts serjeantmajor armstrong came up with a lantern mr perrys reporting to the adjutant sir of course he was hervey had forgotten for the moment that perry was next for picketofficer and mr green havent seen him sir both sectionsll be ready in not many minutes more they were quick out of their pits ill say that for em mind you collins was on picket corporal wainwright now came up leading his trooper sir where is mr green i dont know sir ill find is groom no let it be for the moment come with me to the major ay sir hes by the picket tent very well johnson sir get someone to find where mr green is he turned to armstrong carry on then not to mount without the order though right sir hervey strode off with corporal wainwright down the flanks of the horse lines noting the state of each troop as he passed so far as the darkness allowed him only a troop looked unready he found joynson and the adjutant at the picket tent the rsm standing with his notebook poised the picketofficer just taking his leave there was still firing from the sixteenths lines but no sign of a galloper from brigade well hervey said joynson a touch wearily have we sent anyone to make contact no and im not inclined to risk it replied joynson firmly finding whats happening would be the very devil of a job if theres a real reverse we shall hear of it soon enough then i believe we should move up to support the sixteenth without orders why the majors tone did not so much challenge as request elaboration because unlikely as it may seem it might just be the sortie in strength that we were speaking of why have we not had orders to that effect from brigade then ive sent perry there by the way well the brigadier will be no more certain than we are in all likelihood joynson was clearly troubled yes but the general must be given the opportunity to exercise a proper command must he not hervey was becoming exasperated this was the joynson of past years not of late months the joynson cowed by towcester sick headaches and the like eustace since when did cavalry have to await an order to close with the enemy there was no answer to this the major turned to the adjutant very well then have the regiment mount the adjutant turned to the trumpetmajor troops to mount please sir the trumpetmajor put his bugle to his lips and sounded the regimental call followed by the octave leap of prepare to mount then the simpler repeated cs and gs of the executive id like you next to me hervey said joynson perfectly composed itll be a deuced tricky business in this light perry can look after e troop they can ride under second squadron with respect sir it might be better to keep the troop in hand you never know very well very well if you are content with that then i have no objection perrys able enough to have them on his own hervey would say nothing more but he was hardly content for the troop would be under command of the grocer until perry returned from his galloping assuming that was that green would actually find them however there were armstrong and collins and he could always take the lead again before they were committed he turned to corporal wainwright who nodded his understanding and made off at once to e troop hervey had greater concerns however the handling of a regiment of light dragoons in troop ranks was even by day a testing undertaking when the ground was unbroken as on a review it could pass off at the trot tolerably well though anything beyond a couple of hundred yards led to bunching and bulging of the line to such an extent that it was difficult to recover proper dressing without coming back to a walk when it was dark however and the ground broken as here the undertaking verged on the reckless he took out his telescope stepped the other side of the picket tents fire and tried to see what was happening in the sixteenths lines meanwhile the troop orderly serjeants were reporting to the rsm it was only another minute or so before mr hairsine could report to the adjutant that the regiment was ready johnson had brought gilbert up and hervey now pulled down the stirrups and mounted skirmishers out said joynson as hervey closed up to his side i would think it better to advance with a clear front replied hervey very well advance please trumpetmajor that joynson asked for such an opinion did not in the least diminish his standing in herveys eyes that he accepted it only increased it too seeking support for a decision already made was the true sign of the weakspirited if it is a sortie they might just be intent on mischief said hervey having to raise his voice against the jingle and clamour behind him it took a fair few yards always before the ncos got the dressing passable in close order but it sounds a determined affair they might be making for the guns i take my hat off to them if they are said joynson matteroffactly they know the ground better than do we but it would be a desperate affair nevertheless the adjective struck hervey forcefully perhaps a night sortie was indeed the act of a desperate man had durjan sal already concluded that his fortress could not withstand a determined siege he would have known why lord lakes had failed not just for the want of heavy guns but because of the attacks by the maratha cavalry on his siege forces how many cavalry could durjan sal dispose on such a night there was no telling and neither was there telling the damage a resolute force could do if ever panic seized hold in the camps we might have to make a wide front if theyre really intent on breaking through to the guns it will hardly be enough but it might check them for a while i hope theres a general standto by now lieutenant perry rode across the front of a troop to report his horse was blowing hard for he had had him in a gallop and hervey was pleased with this evidence of boldness perry saluted as he came up to the major sir brigadiers compliments and would you be so good as to place the regiment in a position to support the sixteenth they were attacked by a large force of cavalry and their object is not clear the sixteenth have one troop only under saddle and the rest are standing ground with the carbine where will the brigadier be asked joynson he did not say sir but i presumed he intended remaining with the reserve joynson did not reply its no good presuming arthur we have to know where the brigadier is snapped hervey galloping was no use without a clear head perry said nothing well said joynson emolliently it is the brigadiers duty to make his post known thank you mr perry take post with the troop then said hervey theyre not to answer but to the regiment sir replied perry saluting and turning trying hard not to sound castdown joynsons thanks were welcome but herveys reproof was deserved a little sharp hervey said joynson when he was gone he did well to get orders so quickly hervey did not reply at once an increase in firing in the direction of the sixteenths camp though two furlongs away and more commanded their attention i think we had soon better extend sir he said finally the fusillade having gone on a full minute it cant be long now before they break through i think we had said joynson assuredly mr vanneck second squadron to extend to the left please i want them to cover as much ground as they can the adjutant wheeled right and put his horse into a trot there was no trumpet call by which the order could have been conveyed for trumpet calls by and large regulated activity rather than conveyed changes in design joynson put his own horse into a lateral trot so as to be at the junction of the two squadrons strickland brought second squadron quickly into line by the simple expedient of halting them for a time so that first squadron cleared enough ground ahead to allow second to trot up with the merest incline left once his right marker was level with first squadrons flanker he ordered them back to the walk and called dress by the right which brought the left flank wheeling smartly round ready major joynson he shouted joynson replied at once draw swords four hundred sabres came rasping from their scabbards a regiment drawing swords was ever a sound to thrill more so even than a battalion fixing bayonets hervey smiled to himself it was the first he had heard it in earnest in ten years he could even forget the blunting of the edges steel on steel what sight daylight would present him with this instant he could not be certain c and a troops were in good order in front he could only trust that d and b were keeping both space and station in the support line and likewise e to the rear of them it was truly no bad thing to have a third line of sabres a second reserve in circumstances such as these even if no more than a troops worth he would just have to trust perry to have them in hand eyes were getting used to the darkness by now especially since there were no campfires to dazzle them any more they could see well enough to trot thought joynson but if they did they would not see the enemy until they were on top of him did that matter what method in the fight could there be but a strong arm and a sharp blade trumpetmajor trot if you please the next minute was a freeforall of stumbling and cursing hervey was near to using the flat of his sword a dozen times so bad was the barging and then they were into a good rhythm and just in time for the first clash with the jhauts came sooner than expected on the left so that at once there was a bending of the line and a loss of direction in c troop not that joynson or even strickland could see it for the one was too far away and the other was busy with his sabre d troop ran into the rear of the melee with no idea of what was happening but perry sensed the trouble and took e troop at once into the breach opening with first squadron himself closing with the major hold hard sir he shouted the left flanks engaged halt bawled joynson heaving on his reins for all he was worth but the whole line was now run up against the jhaut cavalry with both sides in no more than a trot the collision was gentle enough but the shock was great nevertheless joynsons sabre flew from his hand as a tulwar sliced out of the dark his coverman stirrup to stirrup with him lunged forward with his sabre and fended off the followthrough hervey could make out nothing he lowered his head and thrust his sabre forward in the guard something hit the blade not too hard corporal wainwright beside him reins looped over his left arm thrust forward with a pistol and fired joynson his sabre hanging loose from his wrist by the sword knot pulled a pistol from its holster and fired just as a huge jhaut raised an axe to his chargers head the man somersaulted backwards like a dolly at a fair joynson pulled out the other pistol and fired at a man crossing left to right but missed leaving his coverman to finish the job with an armslength shot firing increased the length of the line as dragoon after dragoon managed to disengage his sabre long enough to draw a pistol it seemed to gain them the initiative for there was no shooting by return joynson began shouting bellowing forward they had saved themselves with steel and turned the tables with shot now they would press home the advantage with the leg it was not long in the doing suddenly there was a great shout and then the drumming of hooves and the sixth knew they were speeding the jhauts from the field follow sir came voices from left and right but joynson would not pursue in the dark even before hervey could urge him not to give chase he was shouting reform he intended closing on the sixteenths lines in good order and standing to until they could take stock at first light im going to my troop sir called hervey certain he was not needed in the van any longer very well hervey my compliments to mr perry his action was sharp hervey smiled it was so very like joynson to be thinking thus the men might consider him an old woman at heart but they would always like him and therefore do his bidding willingly and have your troop look for any wounded if you please sir it went without saying that the reserve troop picked up the wounded it would be a dangerous affair though a moon would be a kindness to both sides he would send for lanterns mr perry he called as he tried to make his way through the confusion of men and horses at the rear eventually he found him all accounted for hervey save green green hervey sounded as worried as he was astonished and his groom how where was he i dont think he was ever with us i dont think he mustered no one has seen him good god wheres his coverman in his place well hed better go back and bring him and he can fetch some lanterns were to search the field very well sir hervey shook his head angrily but swallowed hard that was smart work bringing up the troop as you did the major is well pleased thank you sir but one mans address did not make up for the lack of it in another hervey continued to seethe at greens absence as they set about searching for any who had fallen from the saddle at first light e troop stood to their horses in the rear of the other four troops fifty yards short of the sixteenths firing line the line they had held since their own standtoarms in the middle of the night their search had rendered up one dragoon killed by a ball in the back of the neck which had very probably come from a fellow dragoons pistol in the black confusion of the fight and three others with sword or spear wounds none of them too likely to be fatal they found eight jhauts dead or dying but any who had been less severely injured seemed one way or another to have crawled to further cover there were a good many dragoons ridingwounded patched up where they stood by the surgeons assistants sledge himself having beat about the ground with hervey of one man or rather two there was no sign however cornet green was nowhere to be found hervey was now almost beside himself with anger never had an officer of the sixth absented himself so the word indeed was desertion and in the face of the enemy when the light of day let them see to the range of the telescope joynson stooddown the regiment and issued orders to return to camp hervey told him of green his groom as well that is most strange said the major bruised by the days cannonade and weary from the nights exertions and yet disinclined to see the worst in the report i cant see what else to make of it said hervey sharply the mans unfit to command a picket even but when they returned to camp hervey was obliged to consider making something else of it for into the lines soon afterwards rode green and his groom both of them in field order propriety required that he held his anger in check reproving an officer in front of the ranks did no one credit as a rule but the tone perfectly conveyed his state of mind well mr green sir i am afraid i became lost herveys mouth fell open lost lost mr green i regret so sir dragoons were trying their best to watch without being caught too obviously doing so mr green you had better attend at once on the adjutant sir if i might explain lieutenant perry cut him short cyou may explain first to me mr green he said glancing at hervey and hoping for his leave report at once to my tent green saluted and do not ride your charger through the lines sir green dismounted sheepishly hervey looked at perry and nodded it was the right thing to do there might conceivably be an explanation that rendered his offence a lesser one than a regimental court martial would dispose of though he could not imagine it private needham a word with you said the serjeantmajor to the cornets groom armstrongs tyneside conveyed an unnerving degree of affability which fooled no one within its hearing hervey concluded that his best course was to repair to his own tent to shave half an hour later as he drank one of johnsons fortified brews from regimental china perry and armstrong came to his tent they had first compared accounts of the nights wanderings and found them in essentials to be the same green admits to failing to rise at once to the alarm said perry he went back to sleep until needham rousted him out and then he had to prime his pistols why were they not primed at evening standto said hervey because hes an indolent officer said perry decidedly but he appears at least to tell the truth that or hes very calculating in his confidences perry sighed it wasnt the sort of remark that one officer should make of another but green had exhausted everyones patience an age ago by the time he was ready it seems the regiment had moved off and he spent the whole night trying in vain to find us the incredulity in herveys voice was marked he said he thought we would have ridden in the direction opposite to that from which the fire was coming on account of wanting to fall back on the guns hervey paused to consider the notion astonishing why might he believe that hervey he is as i said an indolent and ineffectual officer while you or i or any other would have ridden towards the sound of the firing he it seems works with a different instinct but it would be difficult to say that that instinct was any more than feeble there is nothing to prove that he was well running away hervey thought for a while again sarntmajor armstrong inclined his head ever so slightly and raised an eyebrow its not for me sir to make comment on an officers capability all i can say is needhams not a bad man he says he kept saying to mr green that it seemed strange they were finding no sign of us and saying they ought to make for the firing but mr green was certain of himself and then he says mr green seemed to lose his notion of where they were so they stopped for an hour or two and it was only at dawn that mr green could see which direction was camp hervey sighed an entirely plausible story and yet he was not inclined to believe it he didnt doubt needham nothing that he knew of him suggested he would run from a fight the opposite perhaps and corporal wainwright messed with him regularly that was surely recommendation as to character ci just cant see how an officer could think in the way green did green was no boon companion of perrys but the lieutenant was scrupulously fair if every officers instinct were the same sir there would be no occasion for surprise that might be so but i cant believe it exculpates green there must be something wrong with the logic but i havent the time to look for it replied hervey his irritation increasing armstrong could see no other conclusion either sir with respect if mr green had been a corporal we couldnt bring any charge as would stick save failing to turn out for alarm hervey shook his head but hes not a corporal sarntmajor no sir of course hes not replied armstrong looking sideways at perry but the same evidence would apply if charges were brought thats all im saying hervey was silent a while then he got up mr green had better pay a good sum to the widows fund then and you had better put him on his guard arthur i do truly believe we have a wrong un here and i say thus saving your presence sarntmajor armstrong said nothing it was a confidence he would rather never have heard but they had been together too long for hervey to withhold even so infamous an opinion hervey looked at him sternly armstrong was worth a hundred greens no more than that for a worthless thing did not gain in worth by mere increase in numbers come what may armstrong and his like would never have their just desserts no more than would green hervey put down the teacup what a powerful thing was this drink it brought the nation to fight in hindoostan and it paid for green to play the gentleman yet armstrongs pension if he were to have one would scarcely keep his family in it but this was no time for philosophy he nodded emphatically very well then gentlemen boot and saddle at ten chapter seventeen sappers and miners two days later field general orders camp before bhurtpore dec parole lucknow the nature of the operations upon which the army is about to be employed requiring that the infantry regiments should have as few calls upon them for guards as possible the right hon the commanderinchief is pleased to direct that the following detail only be furnished all other guards not included in this statement are forthwith to be withdrawn hervey passed the statements to armstrong they do not directly bear on us but its as well to know the comings and goings armstrong sitting in a chair in front of him with lieutenant perry to herveys right took the papers and looked quickly over them private johnson emerged from herveys tent with a coffee pot any more sir hervey gestured to the others first then let his cup be filled with the blackest liquid he had seen in many a year johnson would never throw away the unexpended portion of the days coffee ration and so each morning he boiled up the same liquid and the same beans throwing in more in random measure with the addition of copious quantities of sugar and warm buffalo milk it was a fortifying and nourishing drink even if only very distantly related to any that could be had in the coffee houses of london but the infantry will have a longer wait than they think by all accounts said hervey still stirring his cup the jhaut gunners have found their mark on a good number of saps armstrong looked puzzled they are tunnelling though arent they it seems not they cant get close enough armstrong looked incredulous so did perry but for a different reason i dont understand hervey they have to dig ventilation shafts once the tunnel exceeds a certain distance which would rather give away the game hervey took a sip of his coffee and theyre no fools behind those walls there are countertunnels ready dug i saw some of them myself so i think we may safely say there will be no assault this side of the new year the sixth had been in worse places at christmas here at least it was warm when the sun was up they were dry there was firewood aplenty and the supply of rations and powder was regular armstrongs expression changed to a smile corporal strayll be here today sir and a full load of rum hervey smiled too the officers mess was well stocked with excellent claret but rum was so versatile an additive he was almost of the opinion that he would exchange it bottle for bottle very well then there are no further orders interior economy today make and mend and i am brigade field officer youll recall perry and armstrong rose if its all right with you sir id like to ride over and see them sappers working later on said the serjeantmajor by all means dont be too hard on them though replied hervey smiling still no indeed sir but id like to see how many of them would make colliers hervey reported to the headquarters of the first brigade of cavalry at ten oclock there was no telling what the duty might entail last night had been quiet and the siege proceeded as they were all informed in the usual methodical if painfully slow manner but activity was the nature of staff work and he could therefore expect anything certainly the headquarters looked wellshod the brigade tent had yellow pennants at each end of the ridge pole and a lanceguard at the entrance there was no doubting that this was the post of colonel murray a man fervent in holding to the cavalry opinion that everything mattered from the patent shine on a pair of levee hessians to the edge on a troop mans sabre the major of brigade captain harris of the th lancers like murray himself received him with a smile well hervey we have at least seen how it is done they had indeed thought hervey many a time in the peninsula siege after siege it seemed in that campaign i wonder if the jhauts have i dont know what to make of their sortie the other night thats for sure said the brigademajor i thought perhaps they intended disturbing our sleep every night but it seems not thirty and more dead they could not long afford that price he looked disturbed suddenly ive offered you no refreshment where is that bearer but the bearer was alert to herveys arrival and he now came into the big marquee that was the brigade orderly room with a tray of coffee and limewater shukria said harris and then turned to the staff orderly inform the brigadier that major hervey is come if you will colonel murray wishes to see me asked hervey taking both coffee and limewater harris nodded hes not long back from general sleighs conference the news wasnt good oh but before harris could make much of a beginning the officer commanding the first cavalry brigade came into the marquee looking far from his usual cheery self hervey and harris stood up as one good morning sir said the former good morning hervey he turned to the bearer ill have some of that coffee if you please manesh then he sank heavily into a leather armchair hervey and harris sat down again and waited for the brigadier to begin they were not kept waiting long how does being an infantryman appeal to you hervey could see no sense in the question but his recollection of the late events at rangoon provided a prompt response it does not especially appeal sir he said plainly and looking bemused but we are part dragoons by name so if there were compelling reason combermere is so troubled lest he has not enough infantry for the attack that hes contemplating unhorsing the division leaving just skinners for patrol and escort work hervey would agree that that was a compelling reason albeit a desperate one the trick though would be to judge the moment to dismount we have no true idea how strong is the jhaut cavalry and they wont have lost their appetite for sorties completely just so agreed the brigadier and combermeres worried too about the breaching the sappers are having a deuced hot time of it but they reckon theyll have the first parallel open in a day or so and then they can get some of the siege train in close were expected to demonstrate up and down the place to draw attention from the real activity but itll be a damned tedious business and if this durjan sal knows his siegecraft it will not fool him hervey knew the siege design well enough for all the field officers had been apprised of it the principal object of the engineers work was to dig parallels in front of each of the four most prominent bastions the most troublesome was the one they had called the longnecked bastion its height being such as to give the clearest view of any approach within half a mile sapping was a hazardous enough task at the best of times but commanded by the guns of the longnecked bastion it was nearly suicidal that would be the time for a bold sortie better for durjan sal not to let the guns come into action than to take them on in a duel no matter how commanding a position his own may have nothing is certain in these things as well we know sir quite its on this that i wanted to speak with you he held out his cup for more coffee i have an idea we could tempt his cavalry out in strength and if we lay the trap carefully enough we could despatch the lot of them very surely hervey said nothing for the moment a grand fight of cavalry on the scale of waterloo he had never imagined such a thing again but he was unsure of more than just how they would tempt durjan sal out its a fair prospect indeed sir but im afraid i do not see its purpose except to employ the cavalry actively and i am all in favour of that the brigadier smiled in a satisfied sort of way tm glad you dont immediately see the purpose for that means durjan sal likely as not shant he sipped at his coffee clearly relishing the ingeniousness of his plan cdo you think that durjan sal is a man who would prefer to fight to the death rather than strike his colours hervey furrowed his brow on that i have no true insight i should judge perhaps that since he is a usurper he is at heart a hazarder and therefore unlikely to stick just so and for as long as he has his cavalry he will know or rather believe that if the fortress were to fall he could make good his own escape hervey nodded i would imagine that yes then what would be the purpose in destroying his cavalry a smile crept across herveys face the brigademajor was not yet certain of his own comprehension do you mean sir that durjan sal would be obliged to seek terms rather than risk a fight over the walls i mean exactly that harris we might never need a breach he turned back to hervey now you have ridden the whole of the ground and seen inside the walls guns where might our decoy be best placed to tempt him out herveys brow furrowed again i should need a little time to consider that sir i made some plans and sketches good good i want you to consider it carefully and let me have your opinion but your best estimate today if you please and by all means go and consult your sketches but keep the notion to yourself hervey loose tongues would be the death of it when he returned to the sixths camp that evening hervey found that the officers had already dined private johnson was therefore despatched to bring food to his tent hot food for there was a distinct chill in the air already and the brazier was only just lit serjeantmajor says ed like a word when tha were back johnson remembered as he pulled open the tent flap well you may tell him im at home did corporal stray arrive with rum by the way oh ay sir t quartermaster made an issue after stables good he was also meant to be bringing some bottled fruit for the mess you might see if any has survived ah so tha did know about it then the fruit why shouldnt i no i mean it sounded as though thd eard whatd appened happened ay to corporal stray for heavens sake man corporal stray got attacked on is way ere they killed tbullocks pullin is cart hervey looked almost alarmed and is he all right oh ay ttwo that were wi im said e just stood on t box like e were at sword exercise better than collins they said e were e killed alf a dozen of em an then they ran off t jhauts i mean hervey smiled he was not in the least surprised corporal strays resolute immobility atop the hackery box might have been in part the product of his great bulk but it was in equal part the action of an old soldier the hero of the wet canteen i hope he gets a serjeancy for it ill be gooin then id be obliged a few minutes later serjeantmajor armstrong came to the tent come in geordie sit down theres nothing to eat but i can offer you some good bordoo said hervey smiling again though i gather rum is the celebratory drink tonight you heard then stray id ave given aught to see it the big fat bugger hervey laughed when was he last on parade do you think mounted lord knows hed never have lasted if old soggy hadnt been quartermaster hervey poured two glasses of claret and took his seat again otherwise a quiet day i gather ay sir farriers have been busy and the saddlers too well heres to stray and all the stout hearts like him armstrong raised his glass to stout hearts hervey refilled it at once and his own johnson seemed to think there was something in particular you had armstrong frowned and nodded ay there is i went to see the sappers this morning as i said this business of not being able to dig out a tunnel theyre not doing it right oh hervey looked sceptical even allowing for armstrongs aptness in all field matters i talked to the artificer for a fair while and he said theyd wanted to drive tunnels under the main bastions but they couldnt go more than two hundred yards without ventilating shafts then the captain came a grand man he were not in the least bit bothered talking to me and he said theyd started to drive one under the west bastion but the jhauts had spied the venting shaft and driven it in i fear its the same the whole way round the jhauts will be very wary of mining the trouble is the sappers cant begin close enough anywhere and as soon as its known theyre digging theyll blow the tunnels in by countermines the galleries are already made ive seen them armstrong nodded ay but these engineers arent miners we drove some long galleries in hebburn pit and got the air in longer than two hundred yards a lot longer hervey looked even more sceptical but that would have been with steam pumps surely not when we were digging we got a draught going with a furnace anyway i told the captain all about it and he said hed think on it hervey was still doubtful but how much further do you think they could go then well twice as far as they reckon they can now twice as far herveys disbelief was clear but it did not dismay armstrong ay at least hervey said nothing seeming rapt in thought look sir why not let me lend a hand to them the sappers i mean theres nothing that collins cant do with the troop as things stand its nowt but working parties and escorts itd be good for him to have some practice hervey was not easily persuaded though he agreed collins was more than up to the job especially on what seemed increasingly like garrison duties but in the field i seem to recall you believed colliery a sight more dangerous than life in regimentals armstrong pulled a face aw come on sir i no more ran from being a collier than i have from anything hervey winced at his own crassness it was the loss of father and brothers and indirectly his mother that had sent young armstrong to the recruiting serjeant no i hadnt meant to and in any case theres no firedamp here in indoostan that too was true very well said hervey with a smile that spoke volumes for his admiration of his old friends spirit ill speak to the major and if he agrees ill speak then to the sappers later that morning after watering an orderly arrived at the sixths headquarters with a most imperative request from brigadier anburey the chief engineer joynson at once sent for hervey what is e troop about now hervey the majors tone was just a fraction weary but a request from a senior officer even of engineers was not a thing to be brushed off lightly im sorry sir i had meant to speak with you about it at orders today but it seems armstrongs assistance is more pressing than id thought just so youd better sit down and tell me of it hervey hardly thought it a long enough story to require comfort but he obliged the major nevertheless then he told him all he knew joynson listened with especial attention removing and polishing his spectacles several times in the brief course of the explanation a sure sign of his interest as well perhaps of his anxiety well he said at length firmly placing the spectacles high on the bridge of his nose anburey wants to speak to armstrong in person youd better go with him his tone was as incredulous as had been herveys earlier i think i should joynson nodded several times slowly as if contemplating something of real moment you know if armstrongs little scheme works we should think about making him herveys ears pricked he looked keenly at joynson now polishing his spectacles for the third time there again said the major now shaking his head from side to side and as slowly as before tunnels and powder and the like its not the thing i myself would choose i imagine there to be a great degree of hazard hervey nodded but grimly i fear so but armstrong will have it when they reached brigadier anbureys headquarters a mile or so from the sixths lines hervey and armstrong found a dozen engineer officers in hot debate they saluted as they entered the marquee and anburey shook them both by the hand the faces of some of the officers however indicated a distinct disdain perhaps a collier in their midst was not something easily to be borne but armstrong was sure of his ground even though it had not been his for twenty years he ought indeed to be sure of it his father and his brothers had died in a split second for the want of good method in hebburn pit serjeantmajor captain cowie has told me of the system by which you say that a tunnel may be dug beyond the normal distance without recourse to ventilating shafts to five hundred feet you say ay sir but as i recall there was no saying a tunnel couldnt go even further its just a matter of keeping the draught strong heads were shaking disbelievingly though not anbureys if it were possible to dig such a tunnel here the question would be whether there would be sufficient combustive air for an explosion he said then he paused appearing to think on it the more but that is not a matter to trouble you with serjeantmajor now the officers here are all engineers skilled in surveying bridgebuilding the development of the siege and such like none of us have practical experience of underground working comparable with yours i want you therefore to explain in as great a detail as possible the system which you have witnessed and then we shall decide if there is justification to put that system into effect here armstrong looked not in the slightest degree perturbed as he took the stick of chalk from the brigadier and advanced to the blackboard hervey wondered what recognition his scheme would bring for it was certain that armstrongs name would come to the attention of the commanderinchief he could only pray that it should not come before combermere for posthumous honour the mood at the majors orders two days later was beginning to reflect the coming season the sixth had always looked to stand down on the day itself and for all ranks to share a good dinner even in the late french war although more than once they had found themselves horsed with sabres drawn but here the siege was well settled into its routine the chance of alarms diminished and supply on short lines from agra was for once excellent there was every prospect of a good christmas dinner and sport joynson allowing himself a cheroot most unusually now came to general orders and today theres rather a good story gentlemen headquarters camp before bhurtpore rd dec the commanderinchief has received with much pleasure the report of the excellent conduct of a jemadar of the th light cavalry sheik rangaun ally who was sent out with twenty troopers to protect the foraging party on the th instant and who by his steady soldierlike example and the judicious arrangement of his small force kept off a very large body of the enemys horse saved the foragers he was sent to protect and brought off his detachment in the face of the enemy for a considerable distance with no other loss than two men and three horses wounded his lordship in consideration of the foregoing service as well as of the high character borne by this native officer is pleased to promote jemadar sheik rangaun ally to the rank of subadar his lordship further directs that his approbation may be communicated to the whole of the party for their steady conduct on this occasion officers will perceive from this occurrence the propriety of not detaching any weak parties to a distance from camp the above to be explained to the several regiments in camp on the first grand parade that takes place joynson looked over his spectacles at the assembled officers well gentlemen as i said a good story and i think the latter point is clear enough too it could hardly have been made more heavily thought hervey i wonder if stray will be promoted jemadar said rose blowing a great deal of cigar smoke towards the roof of the marquee there was an equal deal of laughter joynson looked wryly over his spectacles well the eleventh are ruing their distance from camp these past couple of days they were cut about in the outlying picket the day before last no one killed but the jhauts drove them in not good i just wish the beggars would come out and face us instead of all this chopping at foraging parties and pickets and feinting on our part so that we can send them all to hell rose said joynson peering over his spectacles again and why should durjan sal be so obliging when hes got solid walls between him and us by the way sir said hervey wanting to bring the conference back to its muttons armstrong is to begin today joynson looked grateful indeed yes gentlemen for those who do not know sarntmajor armstrong is attached forthwith to the engineers to render assistance in their excavations hervey noted the final noun it was entirely accurate without giving away the precise nature of the work serjeant collins shall stand in his place and e troop shall stand ready to provide assistance as required oh and corporal stray is forthwith posted to e troop nicely done thought hervey no one would be likely to deduce anything indeed the odd smile and coarse comment suggested that the others pitied e troop as having been made a fatigue party joynson pressed on modulating his voice just sufficiently to suggest that what he now relayed was unconnected with what had gone before i am very glad to report that last night it seems there was an operation entirely successful to take the gardens before the longnecked bastion known on our maps as buldeo singhs garden and the nearby village of kuddum kundee the heavy cannonade we heard this morning was directed on the two prizes but i am given to understand to little effect the engineers will now begin the planned parallel and this will materially assist the sapping operations in that direction there followed more routine information lists of escorts and patrols and orders for the nights pickets does anyone have a question asked joynson finally no one admitted to it very well gentlemen i think there will soon be rapid progress you know what is his lordships general design you must act on your own cognizance when it is called for the assembly began to break up oh and i have some further excellent news gentlemen sir ivo is proceeding at this time from calcutta to rejoin us he is expected deo volente within the seven days following this latter news displaced all else hervey was full of admiration for the obvious ploy and not a little disappointed for joynson who would thereby be deprived of the honour of command in the hour of victory but that was the way of things corporal stray was a practical man and as such he was not inclined to nod to something until convinced see thee sarntmajor sir he replied pushing his undersized forage cap back and scratching his head i cant see that owt i can makell do tjob the accent was not nearly as pronounced as johnsons but it was marked nevertheless when i were prenticed at untsmans corporal stray i couldnt give a fart about huntsmans just do as youre told i want a wooden duct sixinchsquare that can be extended as we dig as simple as that stray scratched his head again all right serjeantmajor itd better be and later on ill want a burlap partition the size of the tunnel where do i get twood sir armstrong checked himself it was looked at from one angle a reasonable enough question corporal stray the engineers entire field park is at your disposal just go to the artificer over there and give him your requirements right serjeantmajor but mick ask him nicely armstrong shook his head as corporal stray shuffled off hervey smiled time and place were all the same to corporal stray how long will it take to dig if we dont hit any rock it shouldnt take us more than five days round the clock hervey looked again at the ground three hundred yards they proposed to dig geordie seven or eight feet every hour how are you going to keep that up how are you going to bring out all the spoil armstrong looked assured thats them engineers worry itd be the same if they were sapping rather than mining a good gang of colliersd clear that in a tenhour shift what is it exactly that youll do armstrong shrugged his shoulders theres no need of me at all sir its just that some of the officers dont believe itll work and brigadier anburey wants me to make certain it does he gestured to where covered from view by half a dozen tamarisk trees the sappers were beginning the drift down to the level at which they would drive the tunnel to the bastions foundations see they know what theyre about right enough hervey thought they looked as though they did the majors asked that i keep an eye on things but theres no use my being here not to begin with anyway ill come each morning and evening where will you sleep here ay sir strays going to need a hand too id like harkness an all if i can he were a cooper if i remember right hell be handy with hammer and nails and a couple of others in a day or so it was a growing bill but better thought hervey than the endless fatigues and working parties he told armstrong he could have harkness and any other he thought had a particular skill it seemed the least he could do when the regiment were otherwise so cosily set up and safely in their distant lines then he set off back through the workings to find gilbert and quickly for he had arranged with johnson for his bath to be drawn by seven he had to watch his step though the paraphernalia of the sappers siege park and the activity so different from that of cavalry lines could be hazardous for an outsider he slept little and fitfully that night both sides had kept up a harassing artillery fire well into the early hours and soon after midnight there had been an alarm which saw them stood to their horses until two oclock it was the routine of the siege he had first come to know a dozen years before first standing on the defensive at torres vedras and then the boot on the other foot at ciudad rodrigo long days of boredom occasional danger with little opportunity for action only the tumultuous climax the breaching of the walls and the rushingin of brave men bent on promotion the forlorn hope more often than not aptly named and then the fight through the streets until the heart of the fortress struck and its flag was hauled down it was the business of the artillery the engineers and the infantry the cavalry at best onlookers at worst an appendage of the wagon train it was true that volunteers were called for throughout the army for the forlorn hopes and if combermere did indeed want to dismount the cavalry they might all be in red coats soon but as a rule a dragoon might as well be astride a screw as a blood they had been luckier this time for sure with the dash for the motee jheel and the skirmishes with durjan sals cavalry but it had been momentary and in the greater scheme of the siege would be quickly forgotten only the brigadiers ruse de guerre offered them sport the chance of fighting en masse from the saddle in the old way after standdown hervey shaved in plentiful hot water and then breakfasted on eggs and bacon and very good toast the coffee too was quite excellent hot and without bitterness there were even newspapers they were out of range of cannon fire and it was as if they were at camp for the winter manoeuvres it was the sole advantage of the siege over a campaign of movement he considered the only vexing aspect of these otherwise most congenial arrangements was the presence of cornet green hervey could barely bring himself to speak civilly to him if at all besides his constant maladroitness with the dragoons and present to herveys mind still the abominable affair of the night battle the cornets bearing in the mess was chafing him more and more green seemed unable to enter the marquee with any ease usually bumping into something or stammering to a khitmagar and his table manners once he had picked up his knife and fork he seemed unable to lay them down again until his plate was empty it was perhaps of no great hazard to good order and military discipline green was hardly likely to be seated next to the governorgeneral ever but for some reason this morning it gave hervey increasing distress mr green he said suddenly making the unfortunate cornet cough up a part of his breakfast i shall want you to do duty with the sarntmajor today yes hervey replied green his face the colour of a beetroot though whether by way of the coughing or because of his troopleaders attention was uncertain strickland lowered his copy of the calcutta journal and looked hervey in the eye the transaction of any sort of business in the mess was distasteful most certainly at the breakfast table but that was not entirely the purpose of the gesture hervey cleared his throat is there anything of interest in the journal he asked as matteroffact as he could manage strickland took a sip of his coffee the bishop has given a party to the ladies left behind that is very good of him said hervey in a mildly ironic tone he writes very fine hymns hervey even i would concede that hervey merely frowned by now cornet green had finished his breakfast or rather had finished his attempt at it and had quit the mess leaving just the two of them something must be done about green said strickland folding his paper and laying it down i feel half sorry for him im afraid i find not a single redeeming feature said hervey decidedly can he not be persuaded to exchange hes not short of money and he can hardly be happy i imagine the subalterns have tried i cant think for the life of me why he chose to come here perhaps that is his single redeeming feature then hervey raised his eyebrows strickland im sorry to say but i think hes gunshy he related once more the night affair so you want him shot over in the trenches with armstrong thats the idea then you had better have a care yourself i gather the brigadier has something in mind for us hervey looked at him keenly but he had no intention of quizzing him on where he had got his intelligence it seemed next to impossible to keep secret even an idea when hervey got to the tunnel workings about eleven he found armstrong begrimed and resting with an empty bottle of pale ale by his side the lines that now permanently grooved his forehead seemed to have been conduits for the sweat which even on so cold a day had evidently run freely so that from brow to the faintly receding line of his black hair was like veined marble and the eyes closed like chips in the surface exposing the creamy unpolished stone beneath his jaw looked squarer even if the chin were a little fuller than in years past his shoulders broad yet compact like a bull terriers their strength outlined in the sodden shirt which clung to them as he lay looked more powerful than ever once the morning of waterloo indeed hervey had told armstrong that he believed him to be indestructible and he half believed it still he certainly prayed it was for armstrongs loss would be intolerable and not only to caithlin he has not stopped for more than ten minutes since you left yesterday said the engineer major even my artificer turned in for a couple of hours and he is famous for not sleeping until the job is done the exchange was punctuated by three mighty explosions a hundred yards or so the other side of the clump of tamarisk trees as the siege battery hurled a hundred pounds of iron at the longnecked bastion cornet green flinched but no more than would any man who had not expected it the major shook his head they may as well throw pebbles at a shuttered window theres scarcely a mark on those walls well have to get them closer you dont think mining will breach them then oh yes indeed if we can get to the foundations we can have it down ive no doubt that if theres enough air for a man to dig with theres enough for combustion and once packed in we could always open a ventilator shaft by night when it was too late to do anything about it its just the time it will take and if the jhauts dont find us first armstrong opened his eyes sorry sir i didnt know you were come he said getting to his feet and fastening the neck of his tunic im sorry to disturb you sarntmajor youve been working all night i understand ay sir ill give it to these little brown beggars they can dig how far have you got just behind the battery we opened the venting shaft just an hour ago hervey looked astonished they had dug the drift down ten feet and driven a tunnel four feet high and as many wide for the better part of a hundred yards may i see i wouldnt if i were you sir youd only get in the way leave it till weve driven a bit further and got the burlap in hervey was disappointed but he was not going to ignore the advice ill go and have a look at the battery then how is corporal stray faring by the way hes doing a good job sir him and arkness theyve made fifty yards of ducting and theyll be quicker once they get the extra timber good i take it hes not expected to go into the tunnel with it armstrong returned the smile no hes not the ideas for the air to flow not block it with strays great arse the trench was full of men from the light company of the th buckinghamshire regiment their green plumes bobbing as they shuffled forward at the crouch an ensign explained they were going up to form a skirmishing line in front of the guns it seemed the jhaut sharpshooters had been getting bolder in their sorties hervey turned to the covermen go fetch our carbines even in the few minutes it now took him to get to the battery parallel a dozen roundshot from the bastion flew over with the characteristic buzz of the biggercalibre guns the ensign smiled i am pleased to hear that at last sir all the serjeants ever talk about is the queer noise of the shot at waterloo i never thought i might hear it for myself hervey resisted the temptation to look behind at what cornet greens face revealed ci should very much like to know why its flying so high they surely have the range by now the answer came soon enough just as they debouched into the parallel a ball plunged into the breastworks where stood artillerymen enjoying the spectacle of the overshoots it threw up a great fountain of earth and bodies spreading the ordure of a dozen men about the battery hervey and the ensigns men rushed at once to begin digging out the others bastards he cursed they baited the trap good and proper two more roundshot ploughed ineffectually into the breastworks empty now of spectators though earth rained down in the trench again the ensign burrowed with his bare hands for all he was worth as did his men hervey searched for the batterys captain he found him with half his head blown away the clever woolwichtrained grey matter exposed like brains in a butchers shop but he was breathing with an eerie sucking noise hervey reached for his pistol but before he need use it the man gave up the ghost earth gushed high above them again like a geyser christ cursed hervey realizing what more it might be the jhauts had not yet sortied and it was now that they ought ensign get your men up ready the boy hervey thought him not eighteen knew at once what was wanted in an instant he and his serjeant had a dozen men in a firing line wainwright and needham came up the sap with the carbines followed by johnson wainwright blanched at the carnage and looked about anxiously until he saw hervey wheres mr green sir asked private needham no less anxiously a coverman should never lose sight of his officer the rebuke from the night affair stung his ears still i dont know said hervey trying to take stock of the damage and looking for an artillery officer on his feet he was behind me in the sap johnson pushed his way past the confusion sir is thee ead all right thas covered in blood yes its all right johnson replied hervey gruffly not a drop of its my own why have you come up corporal wainwright said we was doin a bit o shooting hervey wondered why he had asked ensign can you see anything he called no not a thing sir hervey clambered over the debris of the revetments to stand next to him what is your name levesongower sir is it indeed your father is not by any chance dean of wells he is sir do you know him ive heard tell a good deal of him now do you think you can get your men out of this trench and up to that bit of a hillock yonder he indicated a long shallow rise two hundred yards to their front a gun on the longnecked bastion belched yellow flame hervey spied the shot almost at once coming our way i think mr levesongower down men they slid to the bottom of the trench and a second or so later the big iron ball clipped the forward edge grazed the bottom and drove itself hissing into the earth wall behind as i was saying yes sir of course we can at once the ensign turned to look for his serjeant detail half a dozen men to stay here until the wounded are dealt with sarnt docherty remainder in extended line prepared to advance sor there followed a deal of shouting incomprehensible to any but the fourteenth as the men fell in i intend joining you as soon as im able said hervey but first i want to see the gunners recovered who gave you your orders the captain sir hes picketing the rest of the company and then hes coming here good go to it then the ensign saluted climbed out of the trench and drew his sword detachment will advance as quickly as red coats were scrambling out of the trench blue ones were coming in from the sap drivers and ammunition numbers keen to dig a lieutenant looked horrified you are in command now i fear said hervey briskly your captains over there under the blanket theres a skirmish line out two hundred yards in front and the bastions got the range private needham came into the trench with cornet green behind him herveys brow furrowed deeply where in hells name have you been mr green im sorry sir i forgot my telescope mr green you have a servant yes sir i corporal mccarthy now appeared breathless sor the majors compliments sor and please would you return at once theres orders from the general sor hervey bit his lip well speak later mr green when hervey got back to the sixths camp he was expecting to hear orders for the brigadiers ruse but instead he found the entire regiment standing to their horses durjan sals making a sortie it seems said joynson as hervey took his place beside him or going to hervey wondered if the business at the battery was connected what are the orders childers brigades going clockwise about and were going the other way the horse artillery will stage behind us and signal with rockets if theres a sortie when weve passed a straightforward enough drive said hervey disappointed by his conclusion that they were about to embark on a wildgoose chase i wonder if our birds will leave their covert though well someone has the wind up how is armstrong by the way hes doing well lets hope he continues doing well then combermeres in the dumps well and truly if this mornings anything to go by he rode through and said the artillery had made not the slightest impression on the walls to date that much was evident to a telescope in the garden just now and the jhauts have some deuced big guns in that bastion thirtytwopounders says combermere joynson nodded to his front well that looks like the sixteenth off trumpetmajor regiment will advance but the day went as hervey feared round the fortress they rode ten miles without sight or sign of the enemy save the odd impudent ball that flew their way none fell within a hundred yards of them but they signalled nevertheless the defenders constant surveillance of their progress why would anyone oblige combermere with a sortie when his men paraded before bhurtpore in such strength the jhauts had their walls and these were serving them very well indeed why should they leave their shelter when the sixth rode back into camp it was a tired and frustrated hervey who dismounted and handed the reins of an equally weary gilbert to his groom i said i would go see the sarntmajor but its too late well go tomorrow morning he took the pistols from the holsters on the saddle as johnson drew up the stirrups at least they are getting closer by the hour we may as well be at brighton for all the good we do and i think by todays display we have put paid to murrays ruse having the slightest chance of success ay sir johnson had not theleast idea what was this ruse but evidently his ignorance was of no moment now a merry christmas then sir see thee at gunfire hervey smiled gunfire yes indeed chapter eighteen

christmasday the usual gratuity of extra batta to be issued to the europeans in camp joynson took off his spectacles well gentlemen the orders are eminently clear if late in the arriving the adjutant will collect votes for prize agent at evening stables by the by who is field officer of the day i am said rose the outlying picket only under saddle today please rose nodded i conclude then by extending my own good wishes for the day the chaplain will say prayers at eleven that is all joynson had called them together earlier than usual since the officers had taken gunfire to every man at reveille he had thought it best to capitalize on their wakefulness by holding his conference immediately after standdown the sun was now well up and taking the chill off the air which even the braziers in the marquee had not managed to do when they first assembled and the prospects for the festive day looked good hervey stayed seated as the others left i believe i may guess your thoughts said the major it were better not to replied hervey not all of them at any rate i was wondering earlier what we might do to tempt out durjan sals cavalry and what did you conclude that we couldnt joynson looked blank really hervey what profit had you supposed lay in such a line of thought when i was brigade field officer the day before yesterday murray told me he had conceived a stratagem by which all the jhaut cavalry could be lured from the fortress and then destroyed which would mean that durjan sal having no means to escape if the fortress fell could not dare risk a storming and would have to sue for peace at once joynson nodded that is artful i wonder you didnt tell me of it murray said to speak to no one he asked my opinion as to where a demonstration would have greatest effect and i concluded the agra gate but thinking the more i believe now that nothing would tempt him out for he can risk losing his cavalry even less than losing the fortress and it would be folly to suppose he has not made that inference for himself perhaps general sleigh thinks the same and does not approve it therefore mm joynson nodded again but slower youre a very clever fellow hervey you ought by rights to be on combermeres staff hervey smiled acknowledging the tease you know he continued putting his spectacles in their case in such a way as to suggest a conclusion ive seen little enough field service but what ive seen and read leads me to believe that theres rarely a clever way to things better to do well whats to be done it would have been too easy to dismiss joynson as a plodder suited only to organizing supply for the fixed defences of the sussex coast which had been his former extraregimental service hervey would not indeed he had come to respect daddy joynson as a man who knew his limitations to an uncommon degree and acknowledged them that would appear to be what combermere is about is it not doing well whats to be done i hope so i hope hes listening to anburey rather than murray i cant see that this business will be settled other than by powder and the bayonet you know ive a mind to leave things here for a while and go see armstrong and his cohort ive a mind that armstrongs shovel will be a deal more serviceable in this than the whole of murrays brigade youll come with me as they rode into the extensive earthworks that buldeo singhs garden had become the battery at kuddum kundee a furlong away fired in unison eight of the artillerys biggest siege guns laid painstakingly on the same point of the longnecked bastion pounds of iron hurled with a velocity which vastly multiplied that weight on impact hervey pressed gilbert to the top of one of the earth ramparts just in time to observe the effect a column of dust higher than the walls of the fortress itself were there troops ready to assault the breach as the dust cleared he saw there was no need of a breaching party nor even a sign of the gunners work the longnecked bastion stood as before prominent and defiant he frowned and turned gilbert back down the bank muttering about joshua and his trumpets god in heaven cursed joynson climbing from the saddle his mare looked as if she had taken root her legs splayed immovable it was enough to startle a seasoned trooper eustace shes very green still joynsons luck with horses was evidently not great thought hervey give her a lead joynson shook his head crossly no no ill walk in damn it serjeant lightfoot the majors coveringserjeant took the reins hervey dismounted and handed his to private johnson they set off through the tamarisk grove with joynson still tutting about his second charger its as well we approach on foot anyway said hervey leading the place is getting tightpacked with limbers they picked their way through the siege park like sightseers at a fair there were piles of shot powder kegs in dugout bays explosive shell in others all manner of engineer stores neatly piled sacks of corn for the horses tubs of salt beef dripping biscuit heaps of black bread barrels of water firewood and quartermaster stores and the surgeons dressing post empty now though at the same hour yesterday it was a sorry butchers shop it all spoke of the effort and patience a siege required the organization someone at least knew his job thought hervey and it was as well given the impotence of the eighteenpounders that had just been demonstrated steady man bawled joynson suddenly as private harkness all but ran into him sir we need the surgeon sir its the serjeantmajor what hes in the tunnel sir the roofs tumbled in joynson pointed to the surgeons tent then set off after hervey running for the first time in years at the foot of the drift where the tunnel began an artificer stopped them therere too many in there sir its too narrow stay here eustace said hervey unfastening his swordbelt and taking off his shako no use in two of us going my orders sir said the artificer cmy sarntmajor though said hervey pushing him aside the tunnel was well lit by oil lamps but silent hervey moved as fast he could neither quite walking nor running ducking lower still every few yards to avoid a roof support it took him a while to reach the airlock whos that said the crouching figure at the burlap partition armstrongs officer whats to do oh major hervey sir its irvine im officer of the day the roofs fallen about fifty yards in there are two of your men and brigadier anburey digging the sarntmajor out hervey pulled aside the burlap sir its awfully tight in there yes thank you irvine it was not so well lit the other side of the burlap hervey could see the flicker of lamps ahead and hear voices he crouched lower still and pushed on as best he could again whos that surgeon came a voice no sir its hervey armstrongs officer hervey could just make out shepherd stent on his knees beyond anburey shovelling earth to one side whos with you stent corporal stray sir hervey pushed past them both earth was flying back as fast as stent could clear it like a terrier digging out a badger he could now make out corporal strays great bulk seeming to fill the remaining space but it was strays shovel that worked like a machine how long has he been buried a good ten minutes sir said stent not checking in his own shovel work the engineers had just put in another support and the serjeantmajor was taking a turn at digging and suddenly the roof just fell in i had only just arrived myself said brigadier anburey buried ten minutes hervey bit his lip how did they know the rooffall they were clearing would not be replaced at once by more had the tunnel wholly collapsed with a hollow in the ground above them should they not be digging from there too ive got is feet shep called stray major herveys here mick major ervey sir ive got is feet and theyre movin hervey crawled past shepherd stent and laid a hand on armstrongs boot it was moving very definitely moving can we pull im out dye think sir i dont know said hervey clawing away more earth around the foot he must somehow have air under this lot if we start to pull him out we might disturb it how long would it take corporal stray breathing heavily didnt know either even if es got a bit of air sir it might run out soon it cant be owt much what else can we do itll take an hour to shift this lot hervey felt the desperation welling well pull him keep digging while i get ropes right sir said stray relieved not to be the one to make the decision and pleased to have the digging to occupy him ill get them said anburey colonel id be obliged if you would stay here i am not a technical anburey nodded and hervey took off back down the tunnel like a bolting rabbit joynson had not been idle either there were props lamps picks shovels all manner of stores piled at the bottom of the drift and rope hervey quickly explained his intention then set off back into the tunnel with the end of a coil corporal wainwright playing it out and serjeant lightfoot attaching other lengths with deft reef knots relay my orders if you please irvine said hervey as he pushed aside the burlap corporal stray had cleared to armstrongs calves but earth slid his way as fast as he could move it theres a good fifteen feet of tunnel forward said brigadier anburey its that spoil which is falling back i dont think the whole working has collapsed he knows were ere at least sir said stray sounding as though he was taking as much comfort by it as armstrong himself the brigadiers assessment was cheering at least they wouldnt be pulling against the weight of a dozen feet of earth hervey looped the rope around armstrongs feet binding them together tight he thought of removing the boots but judged it better to leave them for protection keep digging corporal stray he said once he had made the final hitch irvine pull away a second or so and the rope tautened then it began to inch back then more obviously in a minute they saw the back of armstrongs knees thank christ sir said stray digging for all he was worth its taking too long said hervey hell soon have no air he started clawing away at the earth with his bare hands pull harder irvine it was working just inch by inch armstrongs body emerged from the rooffall but the minutes ticked by how in gods name could anyone go that long without air in five more they saw his waist and then he was out in one like a cork pulling evenly from a bottle stop bellowed hervey down the tunnel the rope slackened at once he turned over the uncharacteristically motionless frame desperate for some sign of life he saw only the earthcaked shell of a man hed once believed was indestructible limp like a rag doll thrown down in the mud surgeon he cursed himself he ought to have called him up before armstrongs mouth fell open and then his eyes the lids flickering perceptibly hervey gasped and stray knew theyd done it but it was too much like the brush with death in america when armstrong alone had taken on the war party then as now beyond well beyond the call of duty the thought of that devotion and its fruitless and terrible outcome in america was too much for hervey and tears began welling it was left to corporal stray to restore matters yer gave us a right scare there serjeantmajor sir he said in the cheeky understatement which only a corporal of his standing was allowed armstrong spat but weakly and closed his eyes again and it wont be the last corporal stray he croaked barely audible be sure of it chapter nineteen forlorn hopes three days later field general orders headquarters camp before bhurtpore dec parole bombay the commanderinchief is pleased to appoint brevetcaptain hake of hm th lancers to the superintendence of the field telegraph an establishment of one european noncommissioned staff one lascar and three coolies is authorized to be attached to each field telegraph in use the above appointment to have effect from the nd instant the three senior field officers of infantry without brigades viz lieutcol commandant fagan lieutcols nation and price are brought on the roster of generals of the day until further orders the advanced posts to be relieved this afternoon at three oclock a working party of men from a relief working party of a complete regiment of native infantry the infantry piquets to mount till further orders at five pm and to be withdrawn from their position at daybreak and permitted to return to their tents the infantry piquets to remain in readiness to turn out at the shortest notice as directed a foraging party of the usual strength in cavalry and infantry the commanderinchief has received with much pleasure the report of the excellent conduct of a serjeantmajor of the th light dragoons john armstrong who was engaged in work in the field defences at buldeo singhs garden in most hazardous circumstances and who suffered burial for half an hour following the collapse of his trench whereupon he was brought out upon the exertions of his fellow dragoons notably corporal stray of that regiment and after the shortest period for recovery and examination by the surgeon returned to his post to continue with the same hazardous work as before his lordship in consideration of the foregoing service as well as of the high character borne by this noncommissioned officer is pleased to advance serjeantmajor armstrong one year in service and seniority and likewise corporal stray to be advanced six months in service and seniority his lordship further directs that his approbation may be communicated to the whole of the party for their steady conduct on this occasion well gentlemen a handsome testimonial if necessarily somewhat recondite in its description of events major joynson laid down his copy of the orders beside him and rubbed his hands together by god its cold today are there any questions you were going to tell us of progress said strickland helpfully indeed i shall replied joynson where does the telegraph run asked rose agra and the two divisions of infantry there were no further questions very well the siege said joynson cupping his hands together and blowing into them there is nothing i may say about the progress of the saps and mines indeed there is nothing i can say for that intelligence is very properly kept privy to the divisional commanders we do of course know that armstrongs tunnel has now reached almost to the longnecked bastion further so i understand than the engineers have ever known a gallery driven in such circumstances there are others being driven now from the third parallels but they are highly susceptible to countermines one indeed has already been blown in have the guns made a breach anywhere asked strickland not that im aware of im beginning to wonder if powder is going to have any effect if solid shot hasnt well said joynson not entirely unsympathetic with the proposition but mindful of the need not to show it i should imagine that if the foundations are attacked there was a degree of nodding it seemed a sound enough observation none of them was an engineer after all rose who had managed at last to relight his cigar blew his habitual cloud of smoke towards the roof of the marquee pigs are the answer there were smiles all round save from joynson not now hugh i dont think im entirely jesting replied a troops wounded buck our seat is in kent close to rochester hervey had some distant recollection now one or two others looked as though they might but joynson did not i am none the wiser you had better spell it out when king john laid siege to the castle there they tunnelled under the keep and then packed it full of brushwood and fat pigs and it was like the burning fiery furnace it brought down a whole corner of the place he blew another cloud of smoke upwards as if to illustrate the feat joynson smiled and yet hugh i am not minded to ask the chief engineer what is the relative combustive value of pigs and powder they all enjoyed the diversion things had become very tedious but i may tell you this he continued taking off his spectacles and placing them in their case the commanderinchief does not intend that any part of the cavalry dismount save of its own volition smiling faces turned puzzledlooking i mean simply that his lordship is calling for volunteers for the storming parties all were at once energized we shall do it in the old way said joynson holding up his hand and a ballot the hubbub continued useless to ask when we shall be needed said rose yes replied joynson the adjutant cleared his throat in such a way as to bring the conference to order one more thing gentlemen this shall be my last with you in command sir ivo will be here this evening thank you for your forbearance this past year that will be all there was silence and then a buzz that somehow managed to combine the keen anticipation of the lieutenantcolonels return with genuine regret at joynsons supersession there was scarce a man who would not say that the major had grown comfortably into the habit of command when the others had left hervey stood up and put on his forage cap sir i speak for myself but i dont doubt that were i not here any of the other captains would say the same it has been yes yes hervey likely so but we have much to be about there are loose ends i would tie up before sir ivo arrives it wouldnt do for the regiment to appear to any degree careless hervey smiled eustace i hardly think but joynson would have no compliments and you shall be able to return your attention wholly to your troop that of course was a blessing do you want me to do anything preparatory to sir ivos arriving i think not but i should like you to be here when he does arrive he will need to be apprised of things and yours is the greatest knowledge of what went before lieutenantcolonel sir ivo lankester bt had returned to the executive command of his majestys th light dragoons from his postnuptial leave amid several thousand acres of hertfordshire by way of calcutta where his bride the second daughter of sir delaval rumsey a man of greater acres even than lankester himself had been hastily lodged with the governorgeneral to hervey he looked not a day older very content but then he had always appeared so and keen to gather up the reins eustace i heard a great deal of the regiment even in the short time i was in calcutta and all of it the highest praise i really cannot thank you enough especially since my furlough was longer in the event than anticipated you have our congratulations on that account colonel replied joynson and at dinner sir ivo would see those sentiments in tangible form for the officers would present him with a fine silver statuette of a mounted officer of the regiment a wedding present executed by one of the best native silversmiths in hindoostan thank you eustace thank you very much indeed he nodded to his orderly who advanced on him with a small box and i should like you to have this just a little token of my gratitude a silvermounted horn snuff mull joynson looked genuinely abashed it is very handsome colonel thank you well then i will tell you what i know which is only that which the brigadier has told me and you may then tell me how little i know they all smiled and then sir ivo began it was more than an hour by the time joynson had related the signal occurrences incidents and events of the past year here and there hervey added some detail or opinion but it was largely the majors occasion and one which admirably suited his eye for detail sir ivo was well pleased both by what he heard on the whole and by how joynson related it at length he smiled again expressed himself ready to reassume command and called for wine one thing more i would hear about though it is a curious interest only how did armstrong survive his entombment hervey inclined his head and raised an eyebrow as if to acknowledge the singularity of the ordeal there was a duct which conveyed air to the end of the tunnel which was itself of armstrongs doing and it seems that this was somehow close enough to ensure a sufficient quantity of air even amid the debris of the roof but how there remained sufficient air once we began to pull him free is unclear certainly armstrong has no recollection well let us not speculate on the science of it but i am intrigued to know of his design the principle appears very simple colonel the duct extends the length of the working and about eighty yards in just behind one of the siege battery earthworks there is a narrow ventilation shaft masked from the enemy of course and the tunnel is sealed by canvas but which the duct passes through just to the rear of the shaft there is a fire at the foot of the shaft which draws air from the tunnel and this in turn draws fresh air along the duct most ingenious said sir ivo i wonder the engineers didnt think of it themselves oh colonel anburey their brigadier is full of praise for armstrong said joynson and combermeres made special mention in his orders capital now leave us if you will hervey i have one or two matters i would discuss with eustace in private and do be assured that i am most especially obliged for all you have done too in my absence hervey was gratified if like joynson a shade abashed honoured colonel he saluted and left them to the privacy of the orderly room in truth i should have been lost without him on any number of occasions said joynson when he was gone sir ivo nodded i saw combermere on the way up he said he would have him for his staff i think we might contemplate that when we return to calcutta it would be greatly to his advantage i agree very well now the storming parties you spoke of the volunteers joynson smiled a very full manger and youll draw the names in the usual fashion joynson hesitated i have had two representations indeed well three indirectly rose for one for obvious reasons i should be very much inclined to accept that eustace he will feel it keenly that he should restore his honour in the breaches it could only serve the regiments esprit de corps the other is hervey and his cornet green who really is a most execrable tick hervey believes him to have shown cowardice on two occasions which he cannot of course substantiate and wants to determine his mettle sir ivos benign expression changed good god never did i think to hear we should have a coward in the mess again i fear so then i am inclined to accept greens bid the fact that hes made one would indicate there might be some doubt as to his infamy joynson raised an eyebrow we must hope so however i do not know this officially of course but hervey gave him no practicable option how so better you do not know colonel sir ivo sighed why does hervey have to go too to bear witness i suppose joynson nodded very well and there is a fourth representation eustace indeed colonel yes i shall join one of the parties i think it only proper my having been absent so long no colonel i protest that would be most irregular the brigadier would surely not allow it sir ivo smiled ive spoken with him already oh im not going to play the subaltern thrusting for promotion im happy to let green or whoever else lead i think it right though that i go into the trenches and watch at least and you can sit in front of the regiment where you deserve to be he smiled again in any case murray says therell not be a thing for the brigade to do after boot and saddle next day hervey rode to buldeo singhs garden he could only marvel at the difference between the sixths lines with their comfortable order and not a mile away the antlike activity of the siege park battery and earthworks indeed it reminded him of nothing so much as a schoolboys picture again the building of the pyramids so many were the brownskinned labourers and so endless seemed the task he imagined that his purpose in going there was however an utterly vain thing he had tried to persuade armstrong that his method proved there was no purpose to his remaining there to which armstrong had replied that he was remaining for precisely the reason that hervey himself would have stayed had the latter found himself in the same circumstances hervey had even spoken with brigadier anburey but the chief engineer had only reinforced armstrongs request applauding the serjeantmajors sentiment but further stating that armstrong was of the utmost material assistance hervey had reluctantly conceded therefore but hoped this morning to hear when his serjeantmajors work might eventually be at an end collins is standing your duties well hervey now assured armstrong as they sat drinking what johnson called a badmashing of tea a drink which in any circumstances but those they now found themselves in with periodic explosions from the siege guns and the returning cannonade whistling and buzzing overhead would have been undrinkable are they about much no for the last week theres been only one troop at a time under saddle we had to have bending yesterday to keep them keen sir ivo has decided to inspect the entire regiment that at least will be something for them to work to ay not a bad move he intends coming down here hes been missing the smell of powder has he i suspect so hes going with one of the storming parties into the trenches armstrongs face showed surprise and so am i good ive cause to be there too then id like to see what this ere tunnel does thats the reason im here now to say that as soon as its finished i want you back with the troop the only reason i shall be in the trenches is cornet green as you might imagine theres no call for anyone else all it will take is one lucky shell and well both be under the surgeons knife im not having you risk more than you have already aw theres not likely to be a shell any more than anywhere else hervey smiled wryly geordie i am not going to be the one who has to explain to caithlin why youre peppered with shrapnel after being buried alive have some compassion armstrong took another gulp of the tea grimaced and started rummaging in his small pack lord knows ive no ache for rum at this time of a morning but he poured some into herveys mug and then his own just as you say sir hervey did not like the tone for it suggested the matter was not concluded though he knew there was little enough point pressing it how much further have you to dig its gone slower than i thought since the collapse fifty or sixty yards three days four at the most do you know when lord combermeres planning on an assault no i dont but we all know it cant be long theres a full muster any day now i hear brigadier anburey was saying the guns have brought down the major part of yon bastions facing but the heart of its too solid an affair he reckons they must have weakened it though he intends putting ten thousand pounds of powder under it great god thats why id a mind to see it but believe you me sir ive no intention of feeling it the week following passed in a curious mix of tedium and fever for the army of bhurtpore the tunnel or rather armstrongs tunnel for a second was now being driven into the northeast curtain from the sap under the great ditch an unexpected opportunity as yet unchallenged by the enemy made steady but slow progress unknown to all but a few the divisional musters though they signalled to every man that the assault must truly be near were nevertheless thorough affairs of inspection and repair which occupied all ranks for days before and afterwards the names for the storming parties had been forwarded to the respective headquarters but no choice had yet been made or at least communicated by the general officers commanding daily orders were scrutinized and discussed endlessly with a view to what they revealed of the keenly awaited date on the second day of the new year they announced that a lack hospital would form immediately to the charge of which assistantsurgeon murray of his majestys sixteenth lancers was appointed and this was taken by the sweats to be proof positive of assault within the week however there seemed only the same requirements for working and foraging parties for guards pickets and advanced posts of the usual strength in cavalry and infantry so that by the seventh of this first month of the new year there was an edgy listlessness to the camps that night at sir ivo lankesters invitation lord combermere dined with the officers he arrived at seven just as it was dark and the night pickets had been posted ate heartily drank sociably and remained late he appeared wholly content as if events were entirely within his command general george stapleton cotton baron combermere looked not unlike the duke of wellington himself as hervey had once observed in more exigent circumstances except that the hooked nose and spare features never quite took on the dukes hawklike countenance never quite gained the ruthless look that hervey had noted as the hallmark of the best peninsular generals yet combermere had undoubtedly proved himself in spain and portugal and indeed in flanders and mysore before that and even if as he well knew the drawing rooms had it that his intellect did not fit him for the highest commands were combermere to take bhurtpore then his name would go down in history as greater than lakes hervey studied him long this evening he could reach no firm conclusion however unlike his most decided and approving opinion in the peninsula but there of course he had been but a cornet too much had passed since then for him to be wholehearted about a man he could not know more intimately he was past heroworship long past what did his opinion matter anyway local major of kings line cavalry are you able to tell us general how things proceed asked sir ivo as he removed the stopper from a decanter of best port they were twenty at table and though sir ivos question had not been posed any louder than his conversation hitherto his fellow diners fell silent in keen anticipation of a substantive reply lord combermere lit his cigar and leaned back in his chair i am among friends ivo i think i may tell you a little of how things have gone there was now an almost tangible hush five days ago i concluded that the batteries were not sufficiently effectual to breach the walls and so a mine was commenced in the escarp of the ditch on the northern face the engineers however fearing a discovery should they continue their operations during the day sprung it at daylight on the following morning when not sufficiently advanced to have any material effect on the wall this unfortunately alerted the enemy to our designs as i had always feared and so when a second attempt was made our miners were countermined from the interior before they had entered many feet we were of course alert in general terms to the possibility of countermines thanks to the work beforehand of major hervey he nodded in herveys direction across the table im obliged general said hervey bowing in return so this second gallery was at once blown in by us combermere continued i was compelled therefore to delay the assault waiting upon the result of two mines which the admirable brigadier anburey is now driving into the curtain from the sap and under the ditch much as i regret this unexpected delay i feel a consolation in the hope that the place will be eventually stormed with comparative facility to the troops the diners all nodded in agreement i have not spoken of course of all our activities in these respects for to do so would be even among friends as here an unpardonable indiscipline but i may tell you that i have today sent durjan sal a letter laying out the general extent of our preparations the hopelessness therefore of his position and calling on his surrender of the fortress upon generous terms i might add to his own person but if he should refuse the terms and i do not believe gentlemen that he will i have laid upon him other wholly reasonable terms for the laisser aller of the women and children of the fortress who must otherwise i fear suffer grievously soon from our mortars and when the assault itself begins hear hear said sir ivo tapping the table with his palm with the third tap there was a huge distant explosion combermere looked puzzled rather than troubled hervey felt a wrench at his gut which might not have been as great had he been forward as armstrong he made to rise if you would excuse me my lord he did not wait for a reply in any case he was field officer of the day he left the marquee straining for his night vision but it was not necessary flames and more explosions from the direction of buldeo singhs garden confirmed the worst he raced to the charger lines stumbling two or three times and called out for saddle and bridle much fumbling and cursing followed before he was able to mount and leave camp alone and at greater speed than any would have thought prudent in the direst of alarms but it still took him a quarter of an hour to reach the garden as he neared the earthworks behind the engineer park he could see quite clearly for it looked as though everything combustible was alight and blazing with a great noise punctuated by more explosions it was at once obvious what had happened there had been a single explosion occasioned how it did not matter and then the fires had spread like ripples in a pond as successive explosions sent burning residue on a search for something else to ignite charges for the guns torpedoes carcasses rockets and that initial explosion massive as it was could have been only one thing ten thousand pounds of corned powder gilbert stood the explosions well neither did he shy from the flames but hervey would not take him any closer he looked round for a horseholder men were running everywhere white and sepoy equally dazed but he could see no one into whose hands he could place the reins and there was nowhere to tie a horse he wished hed a spancel or even something to fashion one with instead he knotted the reins and slid from the saddle patted gilberts shoulder and said stay there as hopeless an arrangement as it was a command he ran through the park and into the zigzag but he couldnt get through for sepoys carrying out the wounded he climbed out of the trench and over the breastworks but he couldnt see beyond the battery for there was so much flame and all the time the noise like a roaring wind and cannonade he turned back to go to the mouth of the tunnel there was yet another explosion and he felt the air punched out of him as surely as if he had been struck by a pug he hit the ground hard his forage cap was gone and his crossbelt was round his neck he cursed loud and long but he was not hurt he picked himself up gave up the search for his cap and climbed back down into the trench the flow was now against him again as sappers in good order doubled through towards the battery he flattened himself against the trench wall to let them pass then rushed through the zigzag and out through the park to find the other way into the tunnel workings gilbert was standing where he had left him head up ello sir said corporal stray changing hands with the reins in order to salute wheres the sarntmajor es gone lookin for yer sir said stray as if the affair was nothing more than a night in the feringhee bazaar we came across yer orse t serjeantmajor were worried he was worried it sounded as if an arsenal had blown up in camp was it the tunnel i dont think so sir so you werent in it at the time oh ay sir we were in it on us way out but i dont think it were that corporal strays phlegmatic disposition indeed his utter and habitual indifference to all about him was a byword throughout the regiment even so hervey found it difficult to credit with a siege battery and an engineer park blowing themselves to oblivion close by yet so relieved was he at learning that armstrong was alive that he smiled and shook his head would yer like a wet sir said stray holding out a flask hervey had had more than his fill of champagne and claret and port but he felt a powerful need of the medicinal properties of strays flask he took a good draw this fell from the back of your hackery i suppose he smiled again ullage sir we calls it in the trade there were no bloody ullage in my establishment corporal stray came the serjeantmajors voice good evening sir he added throwing up a sharp salute i heard the officers were dining with lord combermere i heard the sound of ten thousand pounds of powder sarntmajor i think we should have a word he handed the flask back to stray hold on to him a little longer if you please corporal he said portentously and then led armstrong into the shadows i know what youre going to say said armstrong once they were out of earshot well then i cant slip the leadrope now not just as theyre coming to the end it seems to me thats a very good reason are you telling me they cant complete the tunnel without you no i wouldnt say that i just think theyll do it better if im there and i want to see it through an all hervey sighed look geordie youre exposing yourself to unnecessary hazard youve already had one very lucky escape and tonight looks like a second aw come on sir what are we supposed to be about then that was not the point hervey knew but it was the point on which armstrong was going to dig in his heels i could say that you were e troops serjeantmajor for one thing and youd know that i knew that collins were doing it fine and good for him to do it too he put a hand on herveys shoulder sir i know what this is all about and im grateful but id rather stay and im sure you wouldnt just resort to ordering me to leave i ought to sarntmajor i really ought to cno you oughtnt sir and you oughtnt to concern yourself another minute jack armstrongs not going to ave is ead blown off by owt in these kegs he insisted gesturing with a thumb to the engineer park behind yon strays kegsll be a sight more trouble to me when were done chapter twenty the storm ten days later camp before bhurtpore th january my dear somervile you will forgive me for having left these several weeks empty of any communication and it is not as if by that you might rightly infer that i have been so engaged as to exclude aught else for the last weeks especially though not without incident have been but a trial of labouring and waiting rather i hesitated in placing on paper anything which were it not to reach you might be of material advantage to the enemies of the company and its officers all the preparations are now made for the storming of the pride of hindoostan and in this i must tell you of the part which our corps has played of late for besides the seizing of the jheels whose possession has kept the ditches dry before us it has fallen to no less a man than sjt major armstrong together with a detachment of dragoons to drive a gallery at great length greater indeed than the engineers had thought feasible under the strongest part of the enemys citadel and this is now lightpacked with not less than ten thousand pounds of powder it shall be sprung at eight oclock in the morning tomorrow and shall be the signal for the storming of the fortress in as many as six places armstrongs exertions and his devotion to duty have been without equal he has been so near killed these past weeks that i begged him to quit so exposed a place when the gallery was dug but he would not and so tomorrow we shall be through and over those infernal walls and be done with durjan sal and his usurping band there shall be two breaches if all is carried off and two storming parties are formed of volunteers in which the cavalry shall play a distinguished part i am glad to say lord combermere had at first thought to dismount a large part of the cavalry but the arrival of the st europeans lately had rendered that exigency unnecessary i shall be with the party that storms the main breach at the cavalier along with our lieutenant colonel sir ivo lankester who rejoined but a fortnight ago and is full of ardour and hugh rose and others then let me tell you now of the particulars of his lordships design for battle hervey penned two pages more on the vellum foolscap which he reserved for correspondence that would travel a good distance inland then put down his pen picked up the last sheet and began to wave it about gently the air was cold with not an atom of moisture it would not take many minutes for the ink to dry he took up the first page meanwhile and began to read when he was done he picked up his pen again and reached for a fourth sheet he did not imagine anything but on the eve of such a battle in which the company must prevail whatever the cost there were certain arrangements he felt obliged to mention arrangements which though the regimental agents in calcutta and london were perfectly able to expedite them needed the supervision of someone of sensibility sensibility of herveys own situation these things now occupied a good threequarters of the page nine or so inches of herveys small neat hand to arrange the future for his daughter sister parents and bibi on this latter he was doubly insistent you who know so much of these things of my own circumstances as well as the travails that might come to a destitute bibi will appreciate my imperative wish that no scruple should stand in the way of my will in this regard and now if you will forgive my overlong trespass into sentiment i must say how it has been my very great pleasure in knowing you both and in the friendship you have unfailingly shown to me i am proud to be godfather to the offspring of your perfect union which duty i most fervently trust i may discharge to its ultimate purpose believe me your ever grateful friend matthew hervey the sap was quiet voices hushed no lights it was a little before eight with the merest hints of daylight in the sky behind them hervey had not slept on finishing the letter he had left his comfortable warm tent and walked the troop lines and then the picket the little touch of hervey in the night before setting off on foot with green and the others to the place from which they would storm the longnecked bastion there was a deal of time to wait still for as they slipped into the trenches in the early hours the word was passed that the mine would be sprung not at eight but at halfpast in order they were told to have just a little more light to carry the breach with hervey thought he would rather have a halfhour of dark than of light for such an enterprise but then he was not an infantryman if that was majorgeneral reynells wish he personally was to direct the storming of the main breach then be it according to his will there were so many senior officers in the sap that hervey wondered if they might yet see lord combermere himself there was general reynell commanding the first division of infantry a fine whiskered foot soldier who had seen more campaigning than most men in his thirty years with the colours and whose appetite for the fight was no less diminished by it there was brigadiergeneral mccombe of the th foot commanding the first brigade and brigadier paton of the th native infantry commanding the fifth there was said to be a wager between them as to who would be out of the trench first and there was sir ivo lankester wearing his pelisse coat still feeling the chill a little but as determined as mccombe and paton to be out of the trench at once when the mine was sprung he exchanged a few words with hervey and hugh rose when they were settled waiting and then said he would see if he could get a few more yards forward to be next to the brigade commanders for a better view of the explosion hes a spanker all right sir said armstrong the consolation in letting armstrong remain with the sappers was that e troop and his serjeantmajor now stood side by side at the point where must come the decision in this battle i wish we might have a better view of it complained hervey id no idea the sap was going to be this deep well be grateful of it when yon mines sprung sir i never saw so much powder in my life they only got the last keg in just before midnight we must hope for a good pile of stones to scramble up said hugh rose itll be the very devil if all it does is rearrange the wall hervey raised his eyebrows it would not be the first time if that happened yes indeed he turned and looked over his shoulder mr green sir the lieutenantcolonel has gone up the trench to be with general reynell you had better go up and be with him in case he has any orders yes sir which way is up hervey was momentarily speechless this way mr green sir said armstrong equably making to lead him past hervey and rose johnson now wholly recovered the situation whether intentionally or not tea mr ervey hervey smiled though it was still too dark for any to see do you think it is why i got a ball in the shoulder at rangoon johnson because id not had your tea at daybreak ay appen tha did sir replied johnson uncorking his patent warming flask and for you sir he added directing the question at rose having a care to use the less familiar second person mindful of its possible properties i should indeed thank you drawled rose do you think we might smoke hervey hervey smiled again i rather think not hugh there were a dozen or so of the sixth in the trench their function along with the fifty other volunteers was straightforward to rush the breach as soon as it was made and to hold on to it until the infantry could come up in proper order it was ever a precarious enterprise by rights if the engineers and artillery did their work it was but a headlong dash into a devastated space and then a few exchanges of fire with those of the garrison not too stunned to raise a musket the work of carrying the fortress was then the business of the assault columns but if the breach was feeble or incomplete it was theirs still to take it and then they might face disciplined volleys or the raking fire of guns not overturned in the blast it was vulgarly called the forlorn hope but no one really knew why one or two were always killed subalterns usually well in the van and hoping for the reward of field promotion but for the rank and file it was not a bad gamble a good breach was worth a years reckoning of service not that hervey or rose would be in the van command of the party was the prerogative of an ensign always and today it fell to one of the fourteenths the senior regiment of foot in the army before bhurtpore it was ensign dalys eighteenth birthday and he had shaken hands with each man of the storming party as was customary before taking his place next to general mccombe at the head of the sap together with lieutenant irvine of the engineers and just behind sir ivo lankester and cornet green there was more method in herveys sending green forward than merely to give sir ivo a galloper if green showed a moments hesitation in leaving the trench then the lieutenantcolonel would see it for himself and all would be up but hervey was not entirely closed to the notion of redemption he thought it possible that green with so many brave men about him and his blood heated by the occasion would find after all that he had the resource to do his duty and that once it was done he would then have appetite for it in the future however he had determined one thing if green did hesitate to leave the trench if he were still not out when he himself came up then he would have him out at the point of the sword a bit confused id say mr green sir whispered armstrong to hervey as he rejoined them hervey sighed well sarntmajor therell be no doubting which way to advance once the mines sprung so thats one thing he neednt concern himself over no thats true but i gave him some wadding to put in his ears and told him to cover them if he got a chance ive known sound enough men become a mite addled in a thunderstorm elsewhere about the fortress were other storming parties braced for the assault but all would take their cue from the springing of the cavalier mine or what was now known in the sixth the secret at last out as the cavalry mine or even armstrongs mine what hervey had written to somervile the evening before was as much as he knew and a good deal at that for lord combermeres staff had been generous in their information in the final waiting days but he supposed that only combermere himself had in his mind a complete picture of the assault the commanderinchief having appointed no deputy the majorgenerals being with the assaulting divisions if he should fall it would likely as not be his quartermastergeneral the veteran cavalryman sir sam whittingham to whom the reins would pass and in due course the laurels be given but hervey hoped that when the fortress was taken armstrongs part would receive its due recognition more so even than it had already and of course that of brigadier anburey for it had been he who had directed the preparations for the assault and had ordered the cavalier mine to be driven under armstrongs supervision and even now anburey courted oblivion by attending the mine like an anxious midwife with her charge he had assembled ten thousand pounds of the coarsestgrained powder corned powder as it was known as opposed to the fine mealed sort which because of the air between the bigger grains burned faster and therefore produced an explosion of greater force but he did not know if this depended on a normal supply of air in the atmosphere in which the powder burned the only way that he could be sure there would be an explosion was to have air at the end of the tunnel and this required armstrongs fire to be lit and strays duct to function he would not of course ask either man to see to the work he would not even ask one of his own he did it himself lighting the fire and then crawling to the end of the tunnel to be sure that air was being drawn through the duct and so he stood now at the mouth of the gallery in the knowledge that all he could do he had done yet still uncertain that it was enough the lives of so many men depended on that powder he had emptied the companys arsenals in hindoostan of the coarsest and he had put bellows into the middle of the pile of kegs and he had doubled the quantity first calculated in order to make up for any slowness in the burn whether through damp or poor air but he remained as fearful in his way as the ensign in command of the storming party he looked at his watch it was time to seek cover he had lit the quick match fifteen minutes ago and it was timed for twenty its accuracy he was in no doubt of for he had made it himself sending to calcutta for isinglass and he had tested two others in the tunnel before they had brought in the powder in the sap hervey looked at his watch too the luminescent hunter that daniel coates had given him it said the time was past eightthirty but no watch or clock agreed with any other to within five minutes except when the noon guns fired and so he could not know if the mine was live or not the sky was rapidly lightening now would be best while they could still cross the hundred yards to the walls without the defenders seeing all he made to draw his sword but the sap was too tightpacked he pulled the pistol from his belt instead sarntmajor do you think the mine went off like the crack of doom the earth shook as if the trench sides would fall in splinters of stone whistled overhead like bullets rocks showered into the sap a dragoon standing only two feet behind johnson was felled dead instantly ahead there was shouting and moans hervey began to push forward but he could not get past the men in front waiting to debouch from the end of the sap the artillery had opened fire on the signal making it difficult to communicate any sense of what was happening but it was clear the mine had somehow gone off ill help me up he barked raising his hands to the side of the trench armstrong and johnson hoisted him high then scrambled out themselves followed by rose and the covermen he ran only a dozen yards before coming on sir ivo the sap was all but blown in and covered with debris from the bastion christ he groaned seeing his lieutenantcolonel a mass of blood johnson one of the surgeons got to him first the assault was nothing if not well provided for i have him on you go rasped the glasgow voice stay with him johnson said hervey firmly he got up only to see cornet green a few yards away and in a worse state christ almighty he spat kneeling by his head but it did not take a practised surgeon to know there was no life whatever there he now saw general mccombe lying almost as bad and brigadier paton and irvine the faithful lieutenant of engineers a few yards further on was ensign daly sitting upright as if in a stupor his right leg was unrecognizable as a limb attached only by the thinnest thread of flesh and bone jesus up came colonel nation commanding the rd native infantry he took in all with one glance drew his sword and shouted forward then came general reynell shouting go to it fourteenth and running on with them hervey cursed worse than he might remember drew his sabre and followed there should have been cheering that was the old way but there wasnt or perhaps he just couldnt hear it for his ears rang like the bells on easter day he glanced behind just a mass of men running at the crouch mainly redjacketed wainwright was with him and rose and he could just make out corporal mccarthy now they were clambering over fallen masonry the bastion no more a great hole in the side of the pride of hindoostan he looked up and saw colonel nation in the breach and then he saw him fall to what he couldnt tell for the artillery fire of both sides was drowning all the storming party was now thoroughly mixed up with the fourteenths assault columns he saw their two majors urging them on everard knew how thought hervey hed led the forlorn hope at monte video and bisshop hed been at badajoz he saw the first bodies of the defenders bits of them rather the primitive butchery of the mine an arm stuck out from the debris a private of the fourteenth huffing and puffing as he struggled up the broken ramparts with a scaling ladder on his shoulder took the hand and shook it before plodding on at the top an ensign was triumphantly planting the fourteenths colours but the regiment was not intent on consolidation without seeming to check a company set off at once along the wall to the left and two more under major bisshop to the right and bisshops were almost at once hurling themselves at a bastion whose guns the jhauts were desperately trying to relay for enfilade instead of sweeping the ramparts hervey glanced left and right as if trying to choose but major everard was even now mustering the rest of the regiment to press into the fortress hervey looked about him to rally any of the sixth who had made it to the top rose looked game armstrong was with him and wainwright mccarthy his instincts still a foot soldiers had picked up a musket they set off after everards men halftumbling down the shattered ramparts bodies and pieces of bodies lay thicker than before scattered like winnowed chaff the harvest of armstrongs method even as they slid and stumbled over rock and flesh brick and bone hervey hoped the army would indeed remember its debt now there was the rattle of musketry and to the smell of powder which had hung in their nostrils since the springing of the mine came that other stench of battle of ordure and evisceration always it nauseated some men and excited others soon they were doubling there seemed no resistance despite the musketry they were soon into the streets of the town mean though it was hervey had his bearings now the citadel lay straight ahead an easy affair this was his pistol and sabre as clean as a whistle they debouched suddenly into the maidan before the citadel hervey at last got a clear view ahead as the fourteenths companies spread left and right he saw the great gates swinging closed and he groaned what an opportunity was gone then he saw what the gates had also shut out hundreds four or five perhaps of durjan sals legionaries who now turned back in desperation everard had his men ready in the space of two words of command extend present one hundred muskets levelled at the host not fifty yards in front fire the citadel and all before it was at once masked by a wall of black smoke on guard charge it was not his fight this but hervey would not hold back not when the citadel itself stood within their grasp he raced forward barging ahead of the bayonets even sabre thrust out like a lance he saw only a mass of limbs and faces in the seconds before they clashed no pick your man recover sabre ride through rally the infantry had their science too but it didnt amount to much when it came to steel on steel only brute strength and will atop a certain skill he felt the sabre jump in his hand as the point found a mark but his grip was tight and in deep went the blade then up came the pistol the flash and the smoke and the ball striking the same chest as the sabre pointblank throwing the man from off it freeing the sabre to begin its proper work the cutting and slicing and blooding of its razor edge in seconds red ran the length of the blade he was gasping for breath there were only bodies now within reach of him wainwright closed to his side armstrong was already reloading a pistol next to him mccarthy stood onguard with the bayonet only rose was still fighting determined to force his way past friend and foe alike to get to the citadel gates hold hard said hervey to the three of them it made no sense to press forward when there were formed ranks of redcoats doing their work so efficiently at first it had been a fight now it was merely slaughter the jhauts who had not fallen to the fourteenths volley had stood their ground until the first clash but without order they had soon collapsed while those in the ranks behind sought in vain to escape there had been no time for quarter either to beg it or to give it the fourteenth and the sixths men had gone at their quarry with brute strength and a will some of the fourteenths bayonets had run two men through at once and some had broken with their wielders ardour not a jhaut was spared in the maidan that hour not one hervey had not stood back but he was ever thankful for the infantrys skill at execution these men were now so heated they could surely escalade the walls of the citadel but that was asking too much for there was increasing musketry from the high walls and they had but a few scaling ladders and those inadequate instead major edwards coolly retired with his company to the cover of the havelis across the maidan and sent word back to general reynell for the engineers to bring up longer ladders and powder to blow in the gates rose now rejoined them he agreed it was an affair of redcoats with little they themselves could do instead they would explore if the other breaches and escalades had been successful there ought now to be attempts on the stronghold from a number of directions south i think towards the agra gate said hervey thats where general adamss brigade should enter armstrong shouted for mccarthy and a couple of the volunteers from b troop to join them and they slipped away down one of the narrow streets running parallel to the citadel not quite at the double but breaking into a jogtrot here and there when it seemed right they saw no one at first either alive or dead the havelis must be empty thought hervey and thank god too knowing what might happen and then round a corner they ran into the pitiful flotsam of any siege half a dozen women children in hand some with babes in arm were evidently trying to flee the place that had sheltered them during the bombardment they were young women girls some of them handsome dressed well their fate in even the bestregulated siege would be uncertain christ spluttered hervey what in gods name do they think theyre doing get inside he shouted gesturing with his sword they were now terrorstruck armstrong and mccarthy ran forward taking off their shakos and making a show of courtesy it seemed to work the party started back indoors armstrong made a sign to them to draw the bolts and hide themselves hervey saw their chowkidar trying to slink away and tried to make the same reassuring gestures as armstrong then he had a suspicion just something in the mans look he took a step towards him and the man turned to run he followed not long and then it was out there was the khombeer gate and before it was durjan sal there could be no doubt he had just paused long enough to collect his zenana and now he would make his escape hervey could have spat with contempt as he thought of the men left to fight and die ignorant of their princes craven course one of the spearmen turned his horse and ran at him hervey raised his pistol and waited for the certainty of hitting but a shot from behind brought his adversary down instead he glanced round to see corporal wainwright already reloading his carbine and there were armstrong mccarthy and the two btroop men the carbines brought down three more before the gates swung open and durjan sal and his coterie it looked like fifty dashed for their freedom hervey rushed for the nearest horse a stallion that defied its gender by standing still he sheathed his sabre and vaulted into the saddle turned quickly to see how many would be with him then kicked hard for he wore no spurs the guards were too slow they tried to close the gates and bring him down but two wellaimed shots from the btroop men set them to ground while armstrong and wainwright began a struggle to unseat two of the rearguard hervey met a ragged fusillade outside which stopped as quickly as it began and then cheering as the sepoy picket realized their mistake he kicked on for all he was worth the stallion flattening into an easy gallop he glanced behind as he began to narrow the lead armstrong was following half a furlong and he guessed the other was wainwright he kicked and kicked the stallion lengthened more and was fair eating the ground herveys only thought now was to finish the business of bhurtpore once and for all to take the usurper himself and put an end to his insolence but durjan sal had fifty horsemen about him more perhaps for some were joining him from the little jungled patches that dotted this side of the plain hervey knew he could not overpower so many even with armstrong and wainwright at his side what could he do now they changed direction to make for the scrubby dhak half a mile in front of the anah gate he would lose them there and all hope of ending the affair decisively the sepoy picket before the gate volleyed as best they could but the target was hopelessly beyond range durjan sals ardour was checked though the party slowed just a little seeming to hesitate over direction before deciding to make for the dhak after all but half a dozen of the escort now detached themselves to form front against their pursuer hervey saw he could not evade them he glanced back again armstrong and wainwright would be up with him in less than a minute but he couldnt wait that long durjan sal would escape into the dhak and three of the jhauts sprang to a gallop and made straight for him he drew his sabre and brought it up to the guard he wanted nothing so much as to get by them and on to the others armstrong and wainwright could deal with them as they turned after him as they closed hervey flattened and screwed up his face waiting for the passing cut the three jhauts lost nerve however opened too far to let him through and the nearest misjudged the timing of the backwards cut missed by a mile thought hervey would his luck hold there were four now barring his way another hundred yards what would they do then he saw their pistols rise as one at a dozen lengths they volleyed he felt the ball strike the stallion squealed but hardly checked before hervey himself reined him in he couldnt afford to stumble at that speed two tulwars met him fearsomelooking blades and wielded skilfully the other two fallen back in echelon behind these were men who could fight as a team hervey knew he had but an instant to judge his manoeuvre he put the stallion in a line for the further two to pass just right of the nearer pair a desperate evasion since they would be on him at once from the rear as the second pair engaged him but a few strides short he pulled the reins up and left but loose across the stallions neck in the rajpoot manner and pressed his right leg as firmly as he could behind the girth the native saddle with neither tree nor flaps gave him more leg than usual in closer contact with the horses flank as if riding bareback and the stallion responded at once passaging left extravagantly to career into the closer jhauts nearside the tulwar came too late into the guard and instead the man took the point of herveys blade in the shoulder the jhauts horse turned on its quarters in response to the unintentional rein and collided with the second horse giving hervey precious seconds to deal with the other pair he loosed the reins and squeezed with his legs and the stallion leapt forward like a cat to meet the first opponent on the nearside again the other man masked on the off the jhaut surprised by the length and direction of the leap failed to get his guard in place quickly enough and cut one all but severed his bridle arm hervey pressed the stallion on but the horse faltered then stumbled throwing him forward he swung his sabre left and rear instinctively to bridle arm protect the jhaut cut too soon and the tulwar struck the sabre with only a few inches of blade but his horse had more impulsion and the tulwar carried down from the sabre onto herveys shoulder he felt the blow but the mail stopped the blade and he was able to slice the back of the jhauts neck with cut two as the man overran then his stallion stumbled a second time the forelegs folding and fell dead throwing him hard to the ground but clear he heard a shot armstrong serving notice with his pistol at a hundred yards and scrambled for the protection of his downed horse he searched the distance for his real quarry and cursed now durjan sal would make good his escape where was the cavalry cordon armstrong and wainwright were at last bearing down one of the jhauts had already made off the two wounded had fallen from the saddle and the fourth now threw down his tulwar corporal wainwright pulling up hard undipped his carbine and began reloading calmly eight seconds no more and he raised it to the aim the jhaut was a hundred yards away but the ball struck him square in the back and he fell dead before his horse could cover another ten hervey smiled grimly but it made no difference durjan sal would give them the slip and why ay sir look at that called armstrong suddenly pointing i thought those black buggers must be in their charpoys still why werent they standing this side of the cover hervey all but gasped he could even see who they were the th light cavalry the blue and the white of their company uniforms could have been the sixths own more and more of them appeared from the dhak extending line so rapidly that it was impossible to evade them durjan sal saw it was thus too in a minute more the usurper of bhurtpore his most favoured wife and jewels and his worst henchmen would be prisoners hervey wished he had his telescope to see the moment durjan sal was as good as bagged though that was what mattered but durjan sal would not be put in a bag by brown faces from calcutta he was a jhaut he did not submit to effete bengalis he turned back and began trotting instead towards the kings men sword held high in both hands as a gesture of submission hervey took the reins of the loose horse which armstrong now led up sheathed his sabre and sprang into the saddle he would receive durjan sals sword with proper ceremony but he could not trust him even now even with two hundred of the companys best cavalry trotting up fast behind wainwright took post left and rear his carbine cradled loaded ready armstrong drew and sloped his sabre taking post on the right durjan sal his tulwar now sheathed and those of his followers brought his horse to the walk and then to a halt in front of them he bowed his head not submissively but in acknowledgement that he was beaten drew his sword again and held it out in both palms wainwright brought his carbine to the port lest the usurper have second thoughts armstrong took the tulwar a fine jewelled piece and handed it to hervey the two dozen followers could wait for the eighth to close hervey looked durjan sal in the eye searching for a clue he saw only a meanfeatured man who could not hold a candle to those who had fought so senselessly for him on the maidan just now and who were dying still no doubt in the citadel he looked at his charger a sleek marwari stallion blood about its mouth and flanks from its riders hard hands and ruthless spurs he would have this horse in the old fashion he would ride it as victorious generals had their adversaries and show the usurper what it was to defy the kings authority he looked at the favourite wife a beauty by more even than jhaut measures there was a time when she would have been his too to submit like the charger to the victors will he had the urge to revive the custom now he had the greatest urge to revive it take the lady durjan sal into protection serjeantmajor he said corporal wainwright have the prisoner ride another and take possession of his mount chapter twentyone regimental mourning three days later d espite the laurels that had daily come the regiments way since the fall of the fortress there was a distinct air of discouragement about the sixth the death of sir ivo lankester had gone hard with all ranks not surprisingly though for despite his absence of a year and more and his return only very lately there had been something about sir ivo that seemed to win the absolute trust of a subordinate it was perhaps the same easy patrician manner with which he went about his command nothing in the least dilatory yet breathing a calm assurance that said all would be well hervey thought him superior even to his brother and sir edward lankester had been a paragon sir ivo though he had come late to the regiment direct to the lieutenantcolonelcy indeed had been an officer in the true sixth mould nevertheless he did not flog he spent his money generously but unostentatiously and he gave his time as unstintingly he did not have to come to india in the first place he was rich enough to have sold out and bought command of another regiment more agreeably posted as many did and he had died because he felt he had not shared enough of his regiments perils and to all this was added a curious and entirely illogical sense of failure the regiment had lost its commanding officer by some dereliction it had brought about his death even joynson who of all men knew the circumstances of sir ivos being in the trenches could not escape the mood with hervey discouragement was made worse by apprehensiveness it was uncertain what the succession of command would be and it seemed only yesterday still that the regiment was made unhappy by the imposition of an unworthy lieutenantcolonel combermere had been quick to give joynson a brevet but that would not do with the horse guards for long but for now there was little business to be about but that of a garrison and little enough of that since the occupation was the business of the infantry i wish that budgerow could have been but half a mile faster in the hour said eyre somervile picking his way carefully over the loose masonry of the citadels walls its a poor business to hear accounts only hervey unfastened his pelisse coat a little the sun was warm and the wind that had shaken the sixths camp so much the day before had gone and amherst had particularly wanted that i accompany sir charles metcalfe when he installed bulwant sing continued somervile himself wrapped in thick woollens well said hervey sympathetically i can see that he might have thought the siege would go longer but you were right to be elsewhere in the hours after the citadel struck im afraid it was the old rules of war for many and the sepoys the worst the officers were not nearly active enough i do believe that many of them were so intent themselves on loot that do you know i once had to put a bullet in a man in spain he was in such a craze of lust and murder they get their blood heated in a storming and it takes a time to cool especially if its full of drink thats when an ensign shows his mettle in my view i heard something about men from the artillery gone over to the jhaut side oh yes two and able gunners they were they are to be executed i imagine is their reason known hervey smiled grimly they were hanged at once for all to see from the walls somervile looked surprised was that lawful hervey shrugged i suppose it was justice they danced a full two minutes they walked on in silence another fifty yards i should so much have liked to see the assault declared somervile now having come to terms with its aftermath you know bhurtpore has been a name to me since first i came to india well it is better that you come now than a month hence the engineers say therell be not a thing to see by february they blew up the futtah bourge two days ago you really should have seen it the most monstrous heathen edifice though im half agreed with those who say we should erect one of our own he gestured to where the column had once stood but what an affair it was you know we took the place in the end with remarkably little loss compared with these things in the peninsula it was all done very scientifically im daily more of a mind that theres so much that could be done to better the business of campaigning we went to this business you know with the same weapons of a hundred years ago somervile nodded gravely but in the end it is the breasts of brave men that win the day is it not in the end yes said hervey reluctantly though the end has too often been close to the beginning and for want of imagination by those whose design the battle is of that we had ample evidence in rangoon but im glad to observe also that it was officers breasts in higher proportion here general edwards is killed and a good many brigadiers and field officers wounded i am truly sorry in lankesters regard said somervile stopping and shaking his head you know i believed him a most admirable fellow the best replied hervey simply and im sorry that events did not prove you wrong about your cornet green yes i confess i feel no remorse at having placed him in the position whence he met his death but i heartily regret the circumstances for his mettle was not truly determined but then perhaps it was the best way if he had dishonoured himself and the regiment what would follow now no its better surely that the regiment believes he died doing his duty having volunteered for the hottest place and theres the letter of course ive no notion of greens father a tea merchant in lincolnshire as i understand it but he has lost a son and it will doubtless go heavily with him and i imagine said somervile helpfully that having invested so much of his provincial fortune in making a gentleman of him he would want to be able to tell his family and friends that he had died like one it is ironic is it not that the profits of tea should send a man to die in the very place the profits originate hervey sighed what of rose by the way i did not see him this morning hervey brightened oh rose i confess i was wrong there hes been the very best of troopleaders he was in the storming party he fought like a wildcat death or honour restored i think his motto was i am pleased to hear it a regiment cannot afford to cast aside a talent for battle at such times even a flawed one as roses might be no indeed and the further question in this regard is what shall be armstrongs reward somervile nodded ah yes just so his doings are by your account wholly exceptional hervey smiled not for armstrong but yes they are singular for a man whose schooling and obligation are so limited then i trust he shall have a prize hervey frowned prizes now there is a matter for attention he reached inside his coat and took out a package of papers general orders listen officers commanding corps and detachments are directed to have it particularly explained to the men under their command and also have it proclaimed in their regimental bazaars by beat of tom tom that the prize property of every description taken within the walls of bhurtpore is immediately to be sent and delivered over to lieutcol the hon j finch prize agent and any person found secreting or detaining prize property will be placed in confinement and punished accordingly somervile looked puzzled it was but the usual way with prize money the point is there has been far too great an expectation of prize money in the army durjan sals property isnt likely to amount to much nor his instruments of war either the real wealth of the place is bulwant sings indeed so said somervile still looking puzzled i am presuming that the agent will determine what is for restitution hervey looked doubtful that is not my sense of it the order makes quite explicit that anything taken is by that fact prize property but perhaps that was not the intention perhaps the order was written with too pressing a haste is there anything else hervey turned to another of the sheets indeed there is the commanderinchiefs thanks to the army he began scanning it for the titbits the arrangements which fell to the share of brigadiergen sleigh c b commanding the cavalry not only during the assault but from the commencement of the investiture of bhurtpore are to be appreciated by the fact that none of the enemy escaped from the fort but on the conditions of surrender and that the capture of the usurper durjan sal with his family and almost every person of rank or authority under him has been effected through the vigilance and gallantry of the several corps employed under his command handsome indeed said somervile then his brow furrowed you know hervey we had a very particular fear for you emma and i i mean oh i should not i mean that your name at the head of any casualty list would have gone hard with us there are too many senior officers on that list for it not to be perfectly apparent how the fight went hervey nodded indeed he said quietly and thank you for those sentiments it is appreciated i do assure you and speaking of senior officers added somervile brightly you say that anburey is perfectly well hervey shrugged and smiled not a mark on him he is much grieved however by how the mine went he blames himself for the excess of powder not for long i hope said somervile his usual cool detachment returned it sounded like science of the most experimental nature from all youve told me indeed it was and i hope anburey is duly feted for it somervile narrowed his eyes a little and what might i ask shall localmajor hervey expect for his address hervey shrugged matteroffactly a brevet i would hope combermeres as good as said so he wants me to join his staff in calcutta you will say yes of course im very much inclined to but theres a deal to resolve in the regiment first therell be promotion without payment if joynson gets sir ivos halfcolonelcy but besides strickland there are two who are senior to me serving on the staff in england so that will not be mine it seems unfair since you were the one in harms way it is the system chapter twentytwo prizes calcutta general orders by the right hon the governorgeneral in council fortwilliam th jan a royal salute and three vollies of musketry to be fired at all the stations of the land forces serving in the east indies in honor of the capture by assault of the fortified city of bhurtpore on the morning of the th instant by the army under the personal command of his excellency the right hon lord combermere commanderinchief and the unconditional surrender of the citadel of bhurtpore on the same day by command of the right hon the governorgeneral in council geo swinton secretary to the government a month after the salute was fired at fort william hervey and the sixth returned to calcutta it was a good homecoming europeans and natives alike welcomed them and lo see the conquering hero come was played so frequently that it began to pall hervey as joynsons second in command once again confined himself to the regimental lines and the voluminous administrative detail that accompanied the end of a protracted period in the field in addition there was the matter of the church parade for sir ivo lankester his remains lay with the others who had died in the assault interred close where they had fallen with the simplest of ceremonies and yet to be memorialized in marble but his memory had still to be hallowed in the regimental fashion to hervey fell the duty of making the arrangements and not least in accordance with the sensibilities of lankesters widow on the third evening he dined with the somerviles eyre somervile had told his wife everything of bhurtpore when he had returned a week earlier and she had read too lord combermeres despatch to the governorgeneral emma was as much apprised of events as any woman in calcutta there were but a few details awaiting herveys personal explanation and she had with great delicacy attended on lady lankester several times in order to supply answers to such questions as the widow could conceive she knowing so little of affairs in india besides the obvious pleasure in their reunion therefore both emma and hervey expected the evening to be of material advantage in the question of regimental mourning i am to call on her tomorrow said hervey nodding his thanks to the khitmagar who held his chair for him as they sat down to dinner with joynson and the troopcaptains i hope then to gain her general approval for the form of service its a pity the bishop is off on one of his peregrinations our chaplain shall just have to rise to the occasion you will find her very composed matthew that i think i can assure you she was very grateful for your and colonel joynsons letters especially joynson is trying to discover what her intentions are with regards to a passage home has she said anything only that she did not intend travelling at once i am surprised she will have her reasons im sure which doubtless will become apparent with time indeed my dear said somervile anxious to begin their dinner emma nodded to the khansamah for the soup to be brought now continued somervile draining his first glass of hock faster than emmas glance suggested approval of laying this matter to one side for the moment what have you decided about the appointment to combermeres staff hervey raised his eyebrows i am offered a brevet a lieutenantcolonels brevet i mean i can hardly decline the promotion excellent emma smiled too and my congratulations matthew lieutenantcolonel it sounds exactly comme il faut and very deserving im sure thank you thank you both said hervey smiling but not as fully you have some reservations asked emma he did not answer indeed he did have reservations though they were not easily put he was thirtyfive years old his birthday had been but a few days ago unobserved except in the bibi khana to where he had escaped for a few hours of forgetfulness and the proprietor of a troop who would salute his prospects if he did not take the brevet and yet matthew oh i the regiment is recalled to england dont you know we learned it only today ah i see emma glanced at her husband the news seemed not to disappoint them both as much as it might i too replied somervile halfemptying his refilled glass not recalled as such eyre has been invited to join the court of directors emma explained hervey did now smile without reserve that is capital news is it not my congratulations to you too somervile nodded capital indeed and yet i am in two minds i have spent so long in the indies i think matthew said emma glancing at her husband again that eyre believes that if you take the position here with lord combermere his own choice will be the easier somervile said nothing a really very agreeable thought replied hervey much heartened though i fail to see how my being lord combermeres military secretary should facilitate your business with the governorgeneral and the council herveys reply presumed which decision it would be but somervile was not minded to observe on it just wait until you have seen the workings of fort william my good friend then you will understand the prospect sounded not altogether inviting so you see matthew said emma laying a hand on his you shall make the choice between you next day at ten oclock brevetlieutenantcolonel joynson brevetmajor hervey and captains strickland and rose stepped down from the regimental caleche at the residence of the governorgeneral they wore levee dress and together presented a picture of the utmost smartness as was their intention in order to display their greatest respects lord amhersts majordomo showed them into a sitting room hung with bright indian silks and sir ivos widow entered soon afterwards with a female companion some years her senior the officers bowed as one and lady lankester curtsied permit me to introduce myself lady lankester said joynson stepping forward i am eustace joynson your late husbands major may i present also major hervey captains strickland and rose each nodded in turn gentlemen she said by reply softly hervey observed a beautiful woman for all her mourning weeds neither did the pain of her loss line her face excessively so that she appeared no older than the twentyfive years which emma somervile had asserted but the reason for her delaying passage home was easily apparent to a skilled observer her complexion told and to one less so the swelling at her skirts hervey had known of it through emma and had told the others nevertheless the appearance of widow with child was more a trial than any of them had expected lady lankester was now if not before on the strength three weeks later on a bright hopeful spring morning emma somervile walked the sixths lines with hervey probing him for some intimation of his decision on the appointment to combermeres staff i think joynson is of a mind to quit india sooner than i thought he said at length as if it had some special bearing i believe i may know why oh trances i spoke with eyre about her only a little time before you all returned i do believe she will very soon make a spectacle of herself more for she has in truth made herself so on several occasions it was a blessing when the army left for bhurtpore i feel very sorry for him theres no word yet from the horse guards about whether the regiment can be his and your own decision will be consequent on learning it im bound to say that it could im being pressed almost daily by lord combermeres military secretary for an answer you surely cannot turn down promotion matthew he smiled do you want me to say yes so that eyre might take his post in london with ease emma squeezed his arm i confess i do not know what would be the right course for eyre i myself have no very great inclination to return to england and eyre is so very suffused by all that there is in this land that i fear he might decline in spirits you know matthew he prizes your society greatly i do believe that whatever your decision now his would be to do likewise she laid a hand to his arm and i should be very happy too if that were so hervey was greatly touched by the continuing evidence of his friends affection but he was as yet unable to give any undertaking well i may tell you that i must give an answer to the military secretary within the week but i tell you emma i have scarcely ever found a decision so troublesome emma simply raised an eyebrow and inclined her head a gesture to say she understood perfectly but could be of no help but how is somervile today asked hervey determined now to be bright in good spirits i trust shall he dine with us in mess as we arranged emma brightened too oh he is in excellent spirits though he is angered by the commanderinchief combermere how so he had a letter this morning from sir charles metcalfe who complains that the prize agents are appropriating property by rights the rajahs he says its little better than outright theft hervey sighed he had imagined it might be so though he supposed it was nothing entirely new and the bulk of it i fear will find its way down the throat though the widows will be glad of their share serjeantmajor armstrong stepped from the forage store as they drew parallel he saluted and hailed them in a model combination of propriety and familiarity mr armstrong i am sorry we have not met since your return said emma beaming wide let me shake your hand i am all admiration for your exploits the whole of calcutta is armstrong glanced at hervey who nodded ah them exploits maam i believe mrs armstrong may have told me of the others serjeantmajor replied emma with just the right note of mystery well maam it felt queer to be on me hands and knees again after all these years but it worked in the end and i hope it is rightly esteemed emma looked at hervey armstrong had no doubt of it however it is indeed maam advanced in seniority and service by three years no less as i was saying to mr hairsine im only a molehill from being rsm emma smiled again and turned to her companion are there moles in india do you know major hervey on the saturday morning following after the customary weekly parade hervey sat down at his desk in regimental headquarters and began at last to compose his letter to lord combermeres military secretary sir i have the honour to the clerk had lit a fire but hervey did not expect the letter would take him many minutes to draft he was scarcely begun when a redfaced joynson marched in and began angrily waving a sheet of paper in front of him look unspeakable infamous hervey could not suppose what on earth might bring so equable a man to such a rage he stood up took the sheet and began to read there were a good many words and figures before he came to the offending ones i cannot believe it hah my thoughts too read on hervey continued to the second page i am astonished wholly dismayed he said shaking his head still half incredulous is this what we were about at bhurtpore then joynson sounded like a man betrayed cis this what armstrong risked making a widow with three orphans for and lankester on the other side of the door to the orderly room private johnsons ear was pressed as close to the keyhole as it could get whats it about smithy he said quietly turning to the clerk behind him the clerk frowned its about the prize money an orders come it says what the company will pay us ow much do we get you and me get forty siccas its better than nowt whats wrong wi major ervey and tcolonel i think its because it says lord combermeres going to take all his share thats not right everybody knows thats not right e ought to give alf of it to us private johnson pressed his ear to the door again straining hard to make out what else was to come brevetlieutenantcolonel joynson took up the order and began looking at the figures again its plunder hervey plunder pure and simple as i recall cornwallis gave away half his share after seringapatam thats the way all of it hervey corrected he gave away every last rupee joynson threw down the orders contemptuously i have a mind to make protest do you suppose there is anyone with honour left in calcutta to take note hervey shook his head slowly without a word then he picked up his sheet of writing paper and tore it in half eustace my mind is now made up i stay with the regiment the end historical afternote the burmese war dragged on until the end of february with campbells force getting within fifty miles of ava before king bagyidaw conceded defeat of the british troops who originally landed at rangoon only a couple of hundred survived the campaign all but or so died from disease and sickness rather than by the enemys hand the sepoys fared little better twelve thousand of the twentyseven thousand who eventually landed at rangoon failing to return it was simply the worstmanaged campaign in the long history of the british army maha bundula deserves further mention he was even allowing for the generally atrocious quality of his peers a very fine commander his feats of forced marching through jungle and swamp in the midst of the monsoon were remarkable he had a shrewd mind too he early came to the conclusion that the british could not be beaten they could deploy more troops in both arakan and burma itself then he could possibly counter and he was quick to recognize their technical superiority as well on first encountering the explosive shell he is said to have gone into deep meditation for a whole day when he realized that bagyidaw would not sue for peace he put himself in the front line and openly courted death he was killed by a rocket in april and from then on both bagyidaws and the armys spirit seem to have ebbed the controversy over the bhurtpore prize money was very real lord combermere was held in high regard for his peninsular record and for his determined conduct of the siege he had to be physically restrained from taking part in the final assault but there was first a widespread belief that the army had looted bhurtpore rather than merely taking the legitimate spoils of war and then the news that combermere would retain all his share close on ј provoked almost universal disgust when a private soldier received ј and a sepoy half of that the haul of ordnance at bhurtpore was great too guns and a further wall pieces firing a onepound ball one of the biggest guns can be seen today at the eastern end of the parade ground at the royal artillery barracks woolwich the battle was the first time the lance was used in action by british cavalry and the first time that gurkhas fought on the british side of the great fortress itself the pride of hindoostan nothing remains but a small and derelict part of the citadel the walls were blown up or pulled down almost at once and the jheels are now a spectacular bird sanctuary bhurtpore fell to mines and the bayonet as my narrative recounts but serjeantmajor armstrongs innovation was in truth that of a slightly later military generation and in america the credit must go to the splendid men of the th pennsylvania infantry recruited from the coalmining districts of schuykill county who achieved devastating surprise over the confederate defenders in the siege of petersburg prelude to the famed battle of the crater the medal inscribed to the army of india perhaps the most romantic of all bears last among its twentyfour clasps that for bhurtpur the cavalry received especial praise from lord combermere in marked contrast to the at best grudging recognition that the duke of wellington had usually bestowed since none of the enemy escaped from the fort but on the conditions of surrender of skinners irregular horse combermere said that nothing could exceed the devotion and bravery of this valuable class of soldiery and james skinner was granted an honorary kings commission as a lieutenantcolonel and appointed companion of the order of the bath
