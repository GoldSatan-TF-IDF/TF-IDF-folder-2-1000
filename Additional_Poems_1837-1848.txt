the bloudy salvages that lurked all round about of wituwamets pictured knife and pecksuots whooping shout for the babys limbs were feeble though his fathers arms were stout his home was a freezing cabin too bare for the hungry rat its roof was thatched with ragged grass and bald enough of that the hole that served for casement was glazed with an ancient hat and the ice was gently thawing from the log whereon he sat along the dreary landscape his eyes went to and fro the trees all clad in icicles the streams that did not flow a sudden thought flashed oer him a dream of long ago he smote his leathern jerkin and murmured even so come hither godbeglorified and sit upon my knee behold the dream unfolding whereof i spake to thee by the winters hearth in leyden and on the stormy sea true is the dreams beginning so may its ending be i saw in the naked forest our scattered remnant cast a screen of shivering branches between them and the blast the snow was falling round them the dying fell as fast i looked to see them perish when lo the vision passed again mine eyes were opened the feeble had waxed strong the babes had grown to sturdy men the remnant was a throng by shadowed lake and winding stream and all the shores along the howling demons quaked to hear the christians godly song they slept the village fathers by river lake and shore when far adown the steep of time the vision rose once more i saw along the winter snow a spectral column pour and high above their broken ranks a tattered flag they bore their leader rode before them of bearing calm and high the light of heavens own kindling throned in his awful eye these were a nations champions her dread appeal to try god for the right i faltered and lo the train passed by once more the strife is ended the solemn issue tried the lord of hosts his mighty arm has helped our israels side gray stone and grassy hillock tell where our martyrs died but peaceful smiles the harvest and stainless flows the tide a crash as when some swollen cloud cracks oer the tangled trees with side to side and spar to spar whose smoking decks are these i know saint georges bloodred cross thou mistress of the seas but what is she whose streaming bars roll out before the breeze ah well her iron ribs are knit whose thunders strive to quell the bellowing throats the blazing lips that pealed the armadas knell the mist was cleared a wreath of stars rose oer the crimsoned swell and wavering from its haughty peak the cross of england fell o trembling faith though dark the morn a heavenly torch is thine while feebler races melt away and paler orbs decline still shall the fiery pillars ray along thy pathway shine to light the chosen tribe that sought this western palestine i see the living tide roll on it crowns with flaming towers the icy capes of labrador the spaniards land of flowers it streams beyond the splintered ridge that parts the northern showers from eastern rock to sunset wave the continent is ours he ceased the grim old soldiersaint then softly bent to cheer the pilgrimchild whose wasting face was meekly turned to hear and drew his toilworn sleeve across to brush the manly tear from cheeks that never changed in woe and never blanched in fear the weary pilgrim slumbers his restingplace unknown his hands were crossed his lips were closed the dust was oer him strown the drifting soil the mouldering leaf along the sod were blown his mound has melted into earth his memory lives alone so let it live unfading the memory of the dead long as the pale anemone springs where their tears were shed or raining in the summers wind in flakes of burning red the wild rose sprinkles with its leaves the turf where once they bled yea when the frowning bulwarks that guard this holy strand have sunk beneath the trampling surge in beds of sparkling sand while in the waste of ocean one hoary rock shall stand be this its latest legend here was the pilgrims land the steamboat see how yon flaming herald treads the ridged and rolling waves as crashing oer their crested heads she bows her surly slaves with foam before and fire behind she rends the clinging sea that flies before the roaring wind beneath her hissing lee the morning spray like seaborn flowers with heaped and glistening bells falls round her fast in ringing showers with every wave that swells and burning oer the midnight deep in lurid fringes thrown the living gems of ocean sweep along her flashing zone with clashing wheel and lifting keel and smoking torch on high when winds are loud and billows reel she thunders foaming by when seas are silent and serene with even beam she glides the sunshine glimmering through the green that skirts her gleaming sides now like a wild nymph far apart she veils her shadowy form the beating of her restless heart still sounding through the storm now answers like a courtly dame the reddening surges oer with flying scarf of spangled flame the pharos of the shore tonight yon pilot shall not sleep who trims his narrowed sail tonight yon frigate scarce shall keep her broad breast to the gale and many a foresail scooped and strained shall break from yard and stay before this smoky wreath has stained the rising mist of day hark hark i hear yon whistling shroud i see yon quivering mast the black throat of the hunted cloud is panting forth the blast an hour and whirled like winnowing chaff the giant surge shall fling his tresses oer yon pennon staff white as the seabirds wing yet rest ye wanderers of the deep nor wind nor wave shall tire those fleshless arms whose pulses leap with floods of living fire sleep on and when the morning light streams oer the shining bay oh think of those for whom the night shall never wake in day lexington slowly the mist oer the meadow was creeping bright on the dewy buds glistened the sun when from his couch while his children were sleeping rose the bold rebel and shouldered his gun waving her golden veil over the silent dale blithe looked the morning on cottage and spire hushed was his parting sigh while from his noble eye flashed the last sparkle of libertys fire on the smooth green where the fresh leaf is springing calmly the firstborn of glory have met hark the deathvolley around them is ringing look with their lifeblood the young grass is wet faint is the feeble breath murmuring low in death tell to our sons how their fathers have died nerveless the iron hand raised for its native land lies by the weapon that gleams at its side over the hillsides the wild knell is tolling from their far hamlets the yeomanry come as through the stormclouds the thunderburst rolling circles the beat of the mustering drum fast on the soldiers path darken the waves of wrath long have they gathered and loud shall they fall red glares the muskets flash sharp rings the rifles crash blazing and clanging from thicket and wall gayly the plume of the horseman was dancing never to shadow his cold brow again proudly at morning the warsteed was prancing reeking and panting he droops on the rein pale is the lip of scorn voiceless the trumpet horn torn is the silkenfringed red cross on high many a belted breast low on the turf shall rest ere the dark hunters the herd have passed by snowgirdled crags where the hoarse wind is raving rocks where the weary floods murmur and wail wilds where the fern by the furrow is waving reeled with the echoes that rode on the gale far as the tempest thrills over the darkened hills far as the sunshine streams over the plain roused by the tyrant band woke all the mighty land girded for battle from mountain to main green be the graves where her martyrs are lying shroudless and tombless they sunk to their rest while oer their ashes the starry fold flying wraps the proud eagle they roused from his nest borne on her northern pine long oer the foaming brine spread her broad banner to storm and to sun heaven keep her ever free wide as oer land and sea floats the fair emblem her heroes have won on lending a punchbowl this punchbowl was according to old family tradition a caudlecup it is a massive piece of silver its cherubs and other ornaments of coarse repousse work and has two handles like a lovingcup by which it was held or passed from guest to guest this ancient silver bowl of mine it tells of good old times of joyous days and jolly nights and merry christmas times they were a free and jovial race but honest brave and true who dipped their ladle in the punch when this old bowl was new a spanish galleon brought the bar so runs the ancient tale t was hammered by an antwerp smith whose arm was like a flail and now and then between the strokes for fear his strength should fail he wiped his brow and quaffed a cup of good old flemish ale t was purchased by an english squire to please his loving dame who saw the cherubs and conceived a longing for the same and oft as on the ancient stock another twig was found t was filled with candle spiced and hot and handed smoking round but changing hands it reached at length a puritan divine who used to follow timothy and take a little wine but hated punch and prelacy and so it was perhaps he went to leyden where he found conventicles and schnapps and then of course you know whats next it left the dutchmans shore with those that in the mayflower came a hundred souls and more along with all the furniture to fill their new abodes to judge by what is still on hand at least a hundred loads t was on a dreary winters eve the night was closing dim when brave miles standish took the bowl and filled it to the brim the little captain stood and stirred the posset with his sword and all his sturdy menatarms were ranged about the board he poured the fiery hollands in the man that never feared he took a long and solemn draught and wiped his yellow beard and one by one the musketeers the men that fought and prayed all drank as t were their mothers milk and not a man afraid that night affrighted from his nest the screaming eagle flew he heard the pequots ringing whoop the soldiers wild halloo and there the sachem learned the rule he taught to kith and kin run from the white man when you find he smells of hollands gin a hundred years and fifty more had spread their leaves and snows a thousand rubs had flattened down each little cherubs nose when once again the bowl was filled but not in mirth or joy t was mingled by a mothers hand to cheer her parting boy drink john she said t will do you good poor child youll never bear this working in the dismal trench out in the midnight air and if god bless me you were hurt t would keep away the chill so john did drink and well he wrought that night at bunkers hill i tell you there was generous warmth in good old english cheer i tell you t was a pleasant thought to bring its symbol here t is but the fool that loves excess hast thou a drunken soul thy bane is in thy shallow skull not in my silver bowl i love the memory of the past its pressed yet fragrant flowers the moss that clothes its broken walls the ivy on its towers nay this poor bauble it bequeathed my eyes grow moist and dim to think of all the vanished joys that danced around its brim then fill a fair and honest cup and bear it straight to me the goblet hallows all it holds whateer the liquid be and may the cherubs on its face protect me from the sin that dooms one to those dreadful words my dear where have you been a song for the centennial celebration of harvard college this song which i had the temerity to sing myself felix audacia mr franklin dexter had the goodness to call it was sent in a little too late to be printed with the official account of the celebration it was written at the suggestion of dr jacob bigelow who thought the popular tune the poachers song would be a good model for a lively ballad or ditty he himself wrote the admirable latin song to be found in the record of the meeting when the puritans came over our hills and swamps to clear the woods were full of catamounts and indians red as deer with tomahawks and scalpingknives that make folks heads look queer oh the ship from england used to bring a hundred wigs a year the crows came cawing through the air to pluck the pilgrims corn the bears came snuffing round the door wheneer a babe was born the rattlesnakes were bigger round than the but of the old rams horn the deacon blew at meeting time on every sabbath morn but soon they knocked the wigwams down and pinetree trunk and limb began to sprout among the leaves in shape of steeples slim and out the little wharves were stretched along the oceans rim and up the little schoolhouse shot to keep the boys in trim and when at length the college rose the sachem cocked his eye at every tutors meagre ribs whose coattails whistled by but when the greek and hebrew words came tumbling from his jaws the coppercolored children all ran screaming to the squaws and who was on the catalogue when college was begun two nephews of the president and the professors son they turned a little indian by as brown as any bun lord how the seniors knocked about the freshman class of one they had not then the dainty things that commons now afford but succotash and hominy were smoking on the board they did not rattle round in gigs or dash in longtailed blues but always on commencement days the tutors blacked their shoes god bless the ancient puritans their lot was hard enough but honest hearts make iron arms and tender maids are tough so love and faith have formed and fed our trueborn yankee stuff and keep the kernel in the shell the british found so rough the island huntingsong the island referred to is a domain of princely proportions which has long been the seat of a generous hospitality naushon is its old indian name william swain esq commonly known as the governor was the proprietor of it at the time when this song was written mr john m forbes is his worthy successor in territorial rights and as a hospitable entertainer the island book has been the recipient of many poems from visitors and friends of the owners of the old mansion no more the summer floweret charms the leaves will soon be sere and autumn folds his jewelled arms around the dying year so ere the waning seasons claim our leafless groves awhile with golden wine and glowing flame we ll crown our lonely isle once more the merry voices sound within the antlered hall and long and loud the baying hounds return the hunters call and through the woods and oer the hill and far along the bay the drivers horn is sounding shrill up sportsmen and away no bars of steel or walls of stone our little empire bound but circling with his azure zone the sea runs foaming round the whitening wave the purpled skies the blue and lifted shore braid with their dim and blending dyes our wide horizon oer and who will leave the grave debate that shakes the smoky town to rule amid our islandstate and wear our oakleaf crown and who will be awhile content to hunt our woodland game and leave the vulgar pack that scent the reeking track of fame ah who that shares in toils like these will sigh not to prolong our days beneath the broadleaved trees our nights of mirth and song then leave the dust of noisy streets ye outlaws of the wood and follow through his green retreats your noble robin hood departed days yes dear departed cherished days could memorys hand restore your morning light your evening rays from times gray urn once more then might this restless heart be still this straining eye might close and hope her fainting pinions fold while the fair phantoms rose but like a child in oceans arms we strive against the stream each moment farther from the shore where lifes young fountains gleam each moment fainter wave the fields and wider rolls the sea the mist grows dark the sun goes down day breaks and where are we the only daughter illustration of a picture they bid me strike the idle strings as if my summer days had shaken sunbeams from their wings to warm my autumn lays they bring to me their painted urn as if it were not time to lift my gauntlet and to spurn the lists of boyish rhyme and were it not that i have still some weakness in my heart that clings around my stronger will and pleads for gentler art perchance i had not turned away the thoughts grown tame with toil to cheat this lone and pallid ray that wastes the midnight oil alas with every year i feel some roses leave my brow too young for wisdoms tardy seal too old for garlands now yet while the dewy breath of spring steals oer the tingling air and spreads and fans each emerald wing the forest soon shall wear how bright the opening year would seem had i one look like thine to meet me when the morning beam unseals these lids of mine too long i bear this lonely lot that bids my heart run wild to press the lips that love me not to clasp the strangers child how oft beyond the dashing seas amidst those royal bowers where danced the lilacs in the breeze and swung the chestnutflowers i wandered like a wearied slave whose morning task is done to watch the little hands that gave their whiteness to the sun to revel in the bright young eyes whose lustre sparkled through the sable fringe of southern skies or gleamed in saxon blue how oft i heard anothers name called in some truants tone sweet accents which i longed to claim to learn and lisp my own too soon the gentle hands that pressed the ringlets of the child are folded on the faithful breast where first he breathed and smiled too oft the clinging arms untwine the melting lips forget and darkness veils the bridal shrine where wreaths and torches met if heaven but leaves a single thread of hopes dissolving chain even when her parting plumes are spread it bids them fold again the cradle rocks beside the tomb the cheek now changed and chill smiles on us in the morning bloom of one that loves us still sweet image i have done thee wrong to claim this destined lay the leaf that asked an idle song must bear my tears away yet in thy memory shouldst thou keep this else forgotten strain till years have taught thine eyes to weep and flatterys voice is vain oh then thou fledgling of the nest like the longwandering dove thy weary heart may faint for rest as mine on changeless love and while these sculptured lines retrace the hours now dancing by this vision of thy girlish grace may cost thee too a sigh song written for the dinner given to charles dickens by the young men of boston february the stars their early vigils keep the silent hours are near when drooping eyes forget to weep yet still we linger here and what the passing churl may ask can claim such wondrous power that toil forgets his wonted task and love his promised hour the irish harp no longer thrills or breathes a fainter tone the clarion blast from scotlands hills alas no more is blown and passions burning lip bewails her harolds wasted fire still lingering oer the dust that veils the lord of englands lyre but grieve not oer its broken strings nor think its soul hath died while yet the lark at heavens gate sings as once oer avons side while gentle summer sheds her bloom and dewy blossoms wave alike oer juliets storied tomb and nellys nameless grave thou glorious island of the sea though wide the wasting flood that parts our distant land from thee we claim thy generous blood nor oer thy far horizon springs one hallowed star of fame but kindles like an angels wings our western skies in flame lines recited at the berkshire jubilee pittsfield mass august come back to your mother ye children for shame who have wandered like truants for riches or fame with a smile on her face and a sprig in her cap she calls you to feast from her bountiful lap come out from your alleys your courts and your lanes and breathe like young eagles the air of our plains take a whiff from our fields and your excellent wives will declare it s all nonsense insuring your lives come you of the law who can talk if you please till the man in the moon will allow its a cheese and leave the old lady that never tells lies to sleep with her handkerchief over her eyes ye healers of men for a moment decline your feats in the rhubarb and ipecac line while you shut up your turnpike your neighbors can go the old roundabout road to the regions below you clerk on whose ears are a couple of pens and whose head is an anthill of units and tens though plato denies you we welcome you still as a featherless biped in spite of your quill poor drudge of the city how happy he feels with the burs on his legs and the grass at his heels no dodger behind his bandannas to share no constable grumbling you must nt walk there in yonder green meadow to memory dear he slaps a mosquito and brushes a tear the dewdrops hang round him on blossoms and shoots he breathes but one sigh for his youth and his boots there stands the old schoolhouse hard by the old church that tree at its side had the flavor of birch oh sweet were the days of his juvenile tricks though the prairie of youth had so many big licks by the side of yon river he weeps and he slumps the boots fill with water as if they were pumps till sated with rapture he steals to his bed with a glow in his heart and a cold in his head t is past he is dreaming i see him again the ledger returns as by legerdemain his neckcloth is damp with an easterly flaw and he holds in his fingers an omnibus straw he dreams the chill gust is a blossomy gale that the straw is a rose from his dear native vale and murmurs unconscious of space and of time a extra super ah is nt it prime oh what are the prizes we perish to win to the first little shiner we caught with a pin no soil upon earth is so dear to our eyes as the soil we first stirred in terrestrial pies then come from all parties and parts to our feast though not at the astor well give you at least a bite at an apple a seat on the grass and the best of old water at nothing a glass nux postcoenatica i was sitting with my microscope upon my parlor rug with a very heavy quarto and a very lively bug the true bug had been organized with only two antennae but the humbug in the copperplate would have them twice as many and i thought like dr faustus of the emptiness of art how we take a fragment for the whole and call the whole a part when i heard a heavy footstep that was loud enough for two and a man of forty entered exclaiming how d ye do he was not a ghost my visitor but solid flesh and bone he wore a palo alto hat his weight was twenty stone its odd how hats expand their brims as riper years invade as if when life had reached its noon it wanted them for shade i lost my focus dropped my book the bug who was a flea at once exploded and commenced experiments on me they have a certain heartiness that frequently appalls those mediaeval gentlemen in semilunar smalls my boy he said colloquial ways the vast broadhatted man come dine with us on thursday next you must you know you can were going to have a roaring time with lots of fun and noise distinguished guests et cetera the judge and all the boys not so i said my temporal bones are showing pretty clear it s time to stop just look and see that hair above this ear my golden days are more than spent and what is very strange if these are real silver hairs im getting lots of change besides my prospects dont you know that people wont employ a man that wrongs his manliness by laughing like a boy and suspect the azure blossom that unfolds upon a shoot as if wisdoms old potato could not flourish at its root its a very fine reflection when you re etching out a smile on a copperplate of faces that would stretch at least a mile that what with sneers from enemies and cheapening shrugs of friends it will cost you all the earnings that a month of labor lends its a vastly pleasing prospect when youre screwing out a laugh that your very next years income is diminished by a half and a little boy trips barefoot that pegasus may go and the babys milk is watered that your helicon may flow no the joke has been a good one but im getting fond of quiet and i dont like deviations from my customary diet so i think i will not go with you to hear the toasts and speeches but stick to old montgomery place and have some pig and peaches the fat man answered shut your mouth and hear the genuine creed the true essentials of a feast are only fun and feed the force that wheels the planets round delights in spinning tops and that young earthquake t other day was great at shaking props i tell you what philosopher if all the longest heads that ever knocked their sinciputs in stretching on their beds were round one great mahogany id beat those fine old folks with twenty dishes twenty fools and twenty clever jokes why if columbus should be there the company would beg hed show that little trick of his of balancing the egg milton to stilton would give in and solomon to salmon and roger bacon be a bore and francis bacon gammon and as for all the patronage of all the clowns and boors that squint their little narrow eyes at any freak of yours do leave them to your prosier friends such fellows ought to die when rhubarb is so very scarce and ipecac so high and so i come like lochinvar to tread a single measure to purchase with a loaf of bread a sugarplum of pleasure to enter for the cup of glass thats run for after dinner which yields a single sparkling draught then breaks and cuts the winner ah thats the way delusion comes a glass of old madeira a pair of visual diaphragms revolved by jane or sarah and down go vows and promises without the slightest question if eating words wont compromise the organs of digestion and yet among my native shades beside my nursing mother where every stranger seems a friend and every friend a brother i feel the old convivial glow unaided oer me stealing the warm champagny the oldparticular brandypunchy feeling were all alike vesuvius flings the scoriae from his fountain but down they come in volleying rain back to the burning mountain we leave like those volcanic stones our precious alma mater but will keep dropping in again to see the dear old crater verses for afterdinner phi beta kappa society i was thinking last night as i sat in the cars with the charmingest prospect of cinders and stars next thursday is bless me how hard it will be if that cannibal president calls upon me there is nothing on earth that he will not devour from a tutor in seed to a freshman in flower no sage is too gray and no youth is too green and you cant be too plump though youre never too lean while others enlarge on the boiled and the roast he serves a raw clergyman up with a toast or catches some doctor quite tender and young and basely insists on a bit of his tongue poor victim prepared for his classical spit with a stuffing of praise and a basting of wit you may twitch at your collar and wrinkle your brow but youre up on your legs and youre in for it now oh think of your friends they are waiting to hear those jokes that are thought so remarkably queer and all the jack horners of metrical buns are prying and fingering to pick out the puns those thoughts which like chickens will always thrive best when reared by the heat of the natural nest will perish if hatched from their embryo dream in the mist and the glow of convivial steam oh pardon me then if i meekly retire with a very small flash of ethereal fire no rubbing will kindle your lucifer match if the fiz does not follow the primitive scratch dear friends who are listening so sweetly the while with your lips double reefed in a snug little smile i leave you two fables both drawn from the deep the shells you can drop but the pearls you may keep the fish called the flounder perhaps you may know has one side for use

and wriggling why what does he wish how painfully small to respectable fish then said an old sculpin my freedom excuse youre playing the cobbler with holes in your shoes your brown side is up but just wait till youre tried and youll find that all flounders are white on one side theres a slice near the pickerels pectoral fins where the thorax leaves off and the venter begins which his brother survivor of fishhooks and lines though fond of his family never declines he loves his relations he feels theyll be missed but that one little tidbit he cannot resist so your bait may be swallowed no matter how fast for you catch your next fish with a piece of the last and thus o survivor whose merciless fate is to take the next hook with the presidents bait you are lost while you snatch from the end of his line the morsel he rent from this bosom of mine a modest request complied with after the dinner at president everetts inauguration scene a back parlor in a certain square or court or lane in short no matter where time early morning dear to simple souls who love its sunshine and its freshbaked rolls persons take pity on this telltale blush that like the aethiop whispers hush oh hush delightful scene where smiling comfort broods nor business frets nor anxious care intrudes o si sic omnia i were it ever so but what is stable in this world below medio e fonte virtue has her faults the clearest fountains taste of epsom salts we snatch the cup and lift to drain it dry its central dimple holds a drowning fly strong is the pine by maines ambrosial streams but stronger augers pierce

bubbling wine and since success your various gifts attends we that is i and all your numerous friends expect from you your single self a host a speech a song excuse me and a toast nay not to haggle on

reared the assyrian piles while hams were scattered through the sandwich isles fired at the thought of all the present shows my kindling fancy down the future flows i see the glory of the coming days oer times horizon shoot its streaming rays near and more near the radiant morning draws in living lustre rapturous applause from east to west the blazing heralds run loosed from the chariot of the ascending sun through the long vista of uncounted years in cloudless splendor three tremendous cheers my eye prophetic as the depths unfold sees a new advent of the age of gold while oer the scene new generations press new heroes rise the coming time to bless not such as homers who we read in pope dined without forks and never heard of soap not such as may to marlborough chapel brings lean hungry savage antieverythings copies of luther in the pasteboard style but genuine articles the true carlyle while far on high the blazing orb shall shed its central light on harvards holy head and learnings ensigns ever float unfurled here in the focus of the newborn world the speaker stops and trampling down the pause roars through the hall the thunder of applause one stormy gust of longsuspended ahs one whirlwind chaos of insane hurrahs the song but this demands a briefer line a shorter muse and not the old long nine long metre answers for a common song though common metre does not answer long she came beneath the forest dome to seek its peaceful shade an exile from her ancient home a poor forsaken maid no banner flaunting high above no blazoned cross she bore one holy book of light and love was all her worldly store the dark brown shadows passed away and wider spread the green and where the savage used to stray the rising mart was seen so when the laden winds had brought their showers of golden rain her lap some precious gleanings caught like ruths amid the grain but wrath soon gathered uncontrolled among the baser churls to see her ankles red with gold her forehead white with pearls who gave to thee the glittering bands that lace thine azure veins who bade thee lift those snowwhite hands we bound in gilded chains these are the gems my children gave the stately dame replied the wise the gentle and the brave i nurtured at my side if envy still your bosom stings take back their rims of gold my sons will melt their weddingrings and give a hundredfold the toast oh tell me ye who thoughtless ask exhausted nature for a threefold task in wit or pathos if one share remains a safe investment for an ounce of brains hard is the job to launch the desperate pun a punjob dangerous as the indian one turned by the current of some stronger wit back from the object that you mean to hit like the strange missile which the australian throws your verbal boomerang slaps you on the nose one vague inflection spoils the whole with doubt one trivial letter ruins all left out a knot can choke a felon into clay a not will save him spelt without the k the smallest word has some unguarded spot and danger lurks in i without a dot thus great achilles who had shown his zeal in healing wounds died of a wounded heel unhappy chief who when in childhood doused had saved his bacon had his feet been soused accursed heel that killed a hero stout oh had your mother known that you were out death had not entered at the trifling part that still defies the small chirurgeons art with corns and bunions not the glorious john who wrote the book we all have pondered on but other bunions bound in fleecy hose to pilgrims progress unrelenting foes a health unmingled with the revellers wine to him whose title is indeed divine truths sleepless watchman on her midnight tower whose lamp burns brightest when the tempests lower oh who can tell with what a leaden flight drag the long watches of his weary night while at his feet the hoarse and blinding gale strews the torn wreck and bursts the fragile sail when stars have faded when the wave is dark when rocks and sands embrace the foundering bark but still he pleads with unavailing cry behold the light o wanderer look or die a health fair themis would the enchanted vine wreathed its green tendrils round this cup of thine if learnings radiance fill thy modern court its glorious sunshine streams through blackstones port lawyers are thirsty and their clients too witness at least if memory serve me true those old tribunals famed for dusty suits where men sought justice ere they brushed their boots and what can match to solve a learned doubt the warmth within that comes from cold without health to the art whose glory is to give the crowning boon that makes it life to live ask not her home the rock where nature flings her arctic lichen last of living things the gardens fragrant with the orients balm from the low jasmine to the starlike palm hail her as mistress oer the distant waves and yield their tribute to her wandering slaves wherever moistening the ungrateful soil the tear of suffering tracks the path of toil there in the anguish of his fevered hours her gracious finger points to healing flowers where the lost felon steals away to die her soft hand waves before his closing eye where hunted misery finds his darkest lair the midnight taper shows her kneeling there virtue the guide that men and nations own and law the bulwark that protects her throne and health to all its happiest charm that lends these and their servants mans untiring friends pour the bright lymph that heaven itself lets fall in one fair bumper let us toast them all the parting word i must leave thee lady sweet months shall waste before we meet winds are fair and sails are spread anchors leave their ocean bed ere this shining day grow dark skies shall gird my shoreless bark through thy tears o lady mine read thy lovers parting line when the first sad sun shall set thou shalt tear thy locks of jet when the morning star shall rise thou shalt wake with weeping eyes when the second sun goes down thou more tranquil shalt be grown taught too well that wild despair dims thine eyes and spoils thy hair all the first unquiet week thou shalt wear a smileless cheek in the first months second half thou shalt once attempt to laugh then in pickwick thou shalt dip slightly puckering round the lip till at last in sorrows spite samuel makes thee laugh outright while the first seven mornings last round thy chamber bolted fast many a youth shall fume and pout hang the girl shes always out while the second week goes round vainly shall they ring and pound when the third week shall begin martha let the creature in now once more the flattering throng round thee flock with smile and song but thy lips unweaned as yet lisp oh how can i forget men and devils both contrive traps for catching girls alive eve was duped and helen kissed how oh how can you resist first be careful of your fan trust it not to youth or man love has filled a pirates sail often with its perfumed gale mind your kerchief most of all fingers touch when kerchiefs fall shorter ell than mercers clip is the space from hand to lip trust not such as talk in tropes full of pistols daggers ropes all the hemp that russia bears scarce would answer lovers prayers never thread was spun so fine never spider stretched the line would not hold the lovers true that would really swing for you fiercely some shall storm and swear beating breasts in black despair others murmur with a sigh you must melt or they will die painted words on empty lies grubs with wings like butterflies let them die and welcome too pray what better could they do fare thee well if years efface from thy heart loves burning trace keep oh keep that hallowed seat from the tread of vulgar feet if the blue lips of the sea wait with icy kiss for me let not thine forget the vow sealed how often love as now a song of other days as oer the glaciers frozen sheet breathes soft the alpine rose so through lifes desert springing sweet the flower of friendship grows and as whereer the roses grow some rain or dew descends t is natures law that wine should flow to wet the lips of friends then once again before we part my empty glass shall ring and he that has the warmest heart shall loudest laugh and sing they say we were not born to eat but grayhaired sages think it means be moderate in your meat and partly live to drink for baser tribes the rivers flow that know not wine or song man wants but little drink below but wants that little strong then once again etc if one bright drop is like the gem that decks a monarchs crown one goblet holds a diadem of rubies melted down a fig for caesars blazing brow but like the egyptian queen bid each dissolving jewel glow my thirsty lips between then once again etc the grecians mound the romans urn are silent when we call yet still the purple grapes return to cluster on the wall it was a bright immortals head they circled with the vine and oer their best and bravest dead they poured the darkred wine then once again etc methinks oer every sparkling glass young eros waves his wings and echoes oer its dimples pass from dead anacreons strings and tossing round its beaded brim their locks of floating gold with bacchant dance and choral hymn return the nymphs of old then once again etc a welcome then to joy and mirth from hearts as fresh as ours to scatter oer the dust of earth their sweetly mingled flowers t is wisdoms self the cup that fills in spite of follys frown and nature from her vineclad hills that rains her lifeblood down then once again before we part my empty glass shall ring and he that has the warmest heart shall loudest laugh and sing song for a temperance dinner to which ladies were invited new york mercantile library association november a health to dear woman she bids us untwine from the cup it encircles the fastclinging vine but her cheek in its crystal with pleasure will glow and mirror its bloom in the bright wave below a health to sweet woman the days are no more when she watched for her lord till the revel was oer and smoothed the white pillow and blushed when he came as she pressed her cold lips on his forehead of flame alas for the loved one too spotless and fair the joys of his banquet to chasten and share her eye lost its light that his goblet might shine and the rose of her cheek was dissolved in his wine joy smiles in the fountain health flows in the rills as their ribbons of silver unwind from the hills they breathe not the mist of the bacchanals dream but the lilies of innocence float on their stream then a health and a welcome to woman once more she brings us a passport that laughs at our door it is written on crimson its letters are pearls it is countersigned nature so room for the girls a sentiment the pledge of friendship it is still divine though watery floods have quenched its burning wine whatever vase the sacred drops may hold the gourd the shell the cup of beaten gold around its brim the hand of nature throws a garland sweeter than the banquets rose bright are the blushes of the vinewreathed bowl warm with the sunshine of anacreons soul but dearer memories gild the tasteless wave that fainting sidney perished as he gave t is the hearts current lends the cup its glow whateer the fountain whence the draught may flow the diamond dewdrops sparkling through the sand scooped by the arab in his sunburnt hand or the dark streamlet oozing from the snow where creep and crouch the shuddering esquimaux ay in the stream that ere again we meet shall burst the pavement glistening at our feet and stealing silent from its leafy hills thread all our alleys with its thousand rills in each pale draught if generous feeling blend and oer the goblet friend shall smile on friend even cold cochituate every heart shall warm and genial nature still defy reform a rhymed lessonurania this poem was delivered before the boston mercantile library association october yes dear enchantress wandering far and long in realms unperfumed by the breath of song where flowers illflavored shed their sweets around and bitterest roots invade the ungenial ground whose gems are crystals from the epsom mine whose vineyards flow with antimonial wine whose gates admit no mirthful feature in save one gaunt mocker the sardonic grin whose pangs are real not the woes of rhyme that blueeyed misses warble out of time truant not recreant to thy sacred claim older by reckoning but in heart the same freed for a moment from the chains of toil i tread once more thy consecrated soil here at thy feet my old allegiance own thy subject still and loyal to thy throne my dazzled glance explores the crowded hall alas how vain to hope the smiles of all i know my audience all the gay and young love the light antics of a playful tongue and these remembering some expansive line my lips let loose among the nuts and wine are all impatience till the opening pun proclaims the witty shamfight is begun two fifths at least if not the total half have come infuriate for an earthquake laugh i know full well what alderman has tied his red bandanna tight about his side i see the mother who aware that boys perform their laughter with superfluous noise beside her kerchief brought an extra one to stop the explosions of her bursting son i know a tailor once a friend of mine expects great doings in the button line for mirths concussions rip the outward case and plant the stitches in a tenderer place i know my audience these shall have their due a smile awaits them ere my song is through i know myself not servile for applause my muse permits no deprecating clause modest or vain she will not be denied one bold confession due to honest pride and well she knows the drooping veil of song shall save her boldness from the cavillers wrong her sweeter voice the heavenly maid imparts to tell the secrets of our aching hearts for this a suppliant captive prostrate bound she kneels imploring at the feet of sound for this convulsed in thoughts maternal pains she loads her arms with rhymes resounding chains faint though the music of her fetters be it lends one charm her lips are ever free think not i come in manhoods fiery noon to steal his laurels from the stage buffoon his sword of lath the harlequin may wield behold the star upon my lifted shield though the just critic pass my humble name and sweeter lips have drained the cup of fame while my gay stanza pleased the banquets lords the soul within was tuned to deeper chords say shall my arms in other conflicts taught to swing aloft the ponderous mace of thought lift in obedience to a schoolgirls law mirths tinsel wand or laughters tickling straw say shall i wound with satires rankling spear the pure warm hearts that bid me welcome here no while i wander through the land of dreams to strive with great and play with trifling themes let some kind meaning fill the varied line you have your judgment will you trust to mine between two breaths what crowded mysteries lie the first short gasp the last and longdrawn sigh like phantoms painted on the magic slide forth from the darkness of the past we glide as living shadows for a moment seen in airy pageant on the eternal screen traced by a ray from one unchanging flame then seek the dust and stillness whence we came but whence and why our trembling souls inquire caught these dim visions their awakening fire oh who forgets when first the piercing thought through childhoods musings found its way unsought i am i live the mystery and the fear when the dread question what has brought me here burst through lifes twilight as before the sun roll the deep thunders of the morning gun are angel faces silent and serene bent on the conflicts of this little scene whose dreamlike efforts whose unreal strife are but the preludes to a larger life or does lifes summer see the end of all these leaves of being mouldering as they fall as the old poet vaguely used to deem as wesley questioned in his youthful dream oh could such mockery reach our souls indeed give back the pharaohs or the athenians creed better than this a heaven of mans device the indians sports the moslems paradise or is our beings only end and aim to add new glories to our makers name as the poor insect shrivelling in the blaze lends a faint sparkle to its streaming rays does earth send upward to the eternals ear the mingled discords of her jarring sphere to swell his anthem while creation rings with notes of anguish from its shattered strings is it for this the immortal artist means these conscious throbbing agonized machines dark is the soul whose sullen creed can bind in chains like these the allembracing mind no twofaced bigot thou dost ill reprove the sensual selfish yet benignant jove and praise a tyrant throned in lonely pride who loves himself and cares for naught beside who gave thee summoned from primeval night a thousand laws and not a single right a heart to feel and quivering nerves to thrill the sense of wrong the deathdefying will who girt thy senses with this goodly frame its earthly glories and its orbs of flame not for thyself unworthy of a thought poor helpless victim of a life unsought but all for him unchanging and supreme the heartless centre of thy frozen scheme trust not the teacher with his lying scroll who tears the charter of thy shuddering soul the god of love who gave the breath that warms all living dust in all its varied forms asks not the tribute of a world like this to fill the measure of his perfect bliss though winged with life through all its radiant shores creation flowed with unexhausted stores cherub and seraph had not yet enjoyed for this he called thee from the quickening void nor this alone a larger gift was thine a mightier purpose swelled his vast design thought conscience will to make them all thine own he rent a pillar from the eternal throne made in his image thou must nobly dare the thorny crown of sovereignty to share with eye uplifted it is thine to view from thine own centre heavens oerarching blue so round thy heart a beaming circle lies no fiend can blot no hypocrite disguise from all its orbs one cheering voice is heard full to thine ear it bears the fathers word now as in eden where his firstborn trod seek thine own welfare true to man and god think not too meanly of thy low estate thou hast a choice to choose is to create remember whose the sacred lips that tell angels approve thee when thy choice is well remember one a judge of righteous men swore to spare sodom if she held but ten use well the freedom which thy master gave thinkst thou that heaven can tolerate a slave and he who made thee to be just and true will bless thee love thee ay respect thee too nature has placed thee on a changeful tide to breast its waves but not without a guide yet as the needle will forget its aim jarred by the fury of the electric flame as the true current it will falsely feel warped from its axis by a freight of steel so will thy conscience lose its balanced truth if passions lightning fall upon thy youth so the pure effluence quit its sacred hold girt round too deeply with magnetic gold go to yon tower where busy science plies her vast antennae feeling through the skies that little vernier on whose slender lines the midnight taper trembles as it shines a silent index tracks the planets march in all their wanderings through the ethereal arch tells through the mist where dazzled mercury burns and marks the spot where uranus returns so till by wrong or negligence effaced the living index which thy maker traced repeats the line each starry virtue draws through the wide circuit of creations laws still tracks unchanged the everlasting ray where the dark shadows of temptation stray but once defaced forgets the orbs of light and leaves thee wandering oer the expanse of night what is thy creed a hundred lips inquire thou seekest god beneath what christian spire nor ask they idly for uncounted lies float upward on the smoke of sacrifice when mans first incense rose above the plain of earths two altars one was built by cain uncursed by doubt our earliest creed we take we love the precepts for the teachers sake the simple lessons which the nursery taught fell soft and stainless on the buds of thought and the full blossom owes its fairest hue to those sweet teardrops of affections dew too oft the light that led our earlier hours fades with the perfume of our cradle flowers the clear cold question chills to frozen doubt tired of beliefs we dread to live without oh then if reason waver at thy side let humbler memory be thy gentle guide go to thy birthplace and if faith was there repeat thy fathers creed thy mothers prayer faith loves to lean on times destroying arm and age like distance lends a double charm in dim cathedrals dark with vaulted gloom what holy awe invests the saintly tomb there pride will bow and anxious care expand and creeping avarice come with open hand the gay can weep the impious can adore from morns first glimmerings on the chancel floor till dying sunset sheds his crimson stains through the faint halos of the irised panes yet there are graves whose rudelyshapen sod bears the fresh footprints where the sexton trod graves where the verdure has not dared to shoot where the chance wildflower has not fixed its root whose slumbering tenants dead without a name the eternal record shall at length proclaim pure as the holiest in the long array of hooded mitred or tiaraed clay come seek the air some pictures we may gain whose passing shadows shall not be in vain not from the scenes that crowd the strangers soil not from our own amidst the stir of toil but when the sabbath brings its kind release and care lies slumbering on the lap of peace the air is hushed the street is holy ground hark the sweet bells renew their welcome sound as one by one awakes each silent tongue it tells the turret whence its voice is flung the chapel last of sublunary things that stirs our echoes with the name of kings whose bell just glistening from the font and forge rolled its proud requiem for the second george solemn and swelling as of old it rang flings to the wind its deep sonorous clang the simpler pile that mindful of the hour when howes artillery shook its halfbuilt tower wears on its bosom as a bride might do the iron breastpin which the rebels threw wakes the sharp echoes with the quivering thrill of keen vibrations tremulous and shrill aloft suspended in the mornings fire crash the vast cymbals from the southern spire the giant standing by the elmclad green his white lance lifted oer the silent scene whirling in air his brazen goblet round swings from its brim the swollen floods of sound while sad with memories of the olden time throbs from his tower the northern minstrels chime faint single tones that spell their ancient song but tears still follow as they breathe along child of the soil whom fortune sends to range where man and nature faith and customs change borne in thy memory each familiar tone mourns on the winds that sigh in every zone when ceylon sweeps thee with her perfumed breeze through the warm billows of the indian seas when ship and shadow blended both in one flames oer thy mast the equatorial sun from sparkling midnight to refulgent noon thy canvas swelling with the still monsoon when through thy shrouds the wild tornado sings and thy poor seabird folds her tattered wings oft will delusion oer thy senses steal and airy echoes ring the sabbath peal then dim with grateful tears in long array rise the fair town the islandstudded bay home with its smiling board its cheering fire the halfchoked welcome of the expecting sire the mothers kiss and still if aught remain our whispering hearts shall aid the silent strain ah let the dreamer oer the taffrail lean to muse unheeded and to weep unseen fear not the tropics dews the evenings chills his heart lies warm among his triple hills turned from her path by this deceitful gleam my wayward fancy half forgets her theme see through the streets that slumbered in repose the living current of devotion flows its varied forms in one harmonious band age leading childhood by its dimpled hand want in the robe whose faded edges fall to tell of rags beneath the tartan shawl and wealth in silks that fluttering to appear lift the deep borders of the proud cashmere see but glance briefly sorrowworn and pale those sunken cheeks beneath the widows veil alone she wanders where with him she trod no arm to stay her but she leans on god while other doublets deviate here and there what secret handcuff binds that pretty pair compactest couple pressing side to side ah the white bonnet that reveals the bride by the white neckcloth with its straitened tie the sober hat the sabbathspeaking eye severe and smileless he that runs may read the stern disciple of genevas creed decent and slow behold his solemn march silent he enters through yon crowded arch a livelier bearing of the outward man the lighthued gloves the undevout rattan now smartly raised or half profanely twirled a bright fresh twinkle from the weekday world tell their plain story yes thine eyes behold a cheerful christian from the liberal fold down the chill street that curves in gloomiest shade what marks betray yon solitary maid the cheeks red rose that speaks of balmier air the celtic hue that shades her braided hair the gilded missal in her kerchief tied poor nora exile from killarneys side sister in toil though blanched by colder skies that left their azure in her downcast eyes see pallid margaret labors patient child scarce weaned from home the nursling of the wild where white katahdin oer the horizon shines and broad penobscot dashes through the pines still as she hastes her careful fingers hold the unfailing hymnbook in its cambric fold six days at drudgerys heavy wheel she stands the seventh sweet morning folds her weary hands yes child of suffering thou mayst well be sure he who ordained the sabbath loves the poor this weekly picture faithful memory draws nor claims the noisy tribute of applause faint is the glow such barren hopes can lend and frail the line that asks no loftier end trust me kind listener i will yet beguile thy saddened features of the promised smile this magic mantle thou must well divide it has its sable and its ermine side yet ere the lining of the robe appears take thou in silence what i give in tears dear listening soul this transitory scene of murmuring stillness busily serene this solemn pause the breathingspace of man the halt of toils exhausted caravan comes sweet with music to thy wearied ear rise with its anthems to a holier sphere deal meekly gently with the hopes that guide the lowliest brother straying from thy side if right they bid thee tremble for thine own if wrong the verdict is for god alone what though the champions of thy faith esteem the sprinkled fountain or baptismal stream shall jealous passions in unseemly strife cross their dark weapons oer the waves of life let my free soul expanding as it can leave to his scheme the thoughtful puritan but calvins dogma shall my lips deride in that stern faith my angel mary died or ask if mercys milder creed can save sweet sister risen from thy newmade grave true the harsh founders of thy church reviled that ancient faith the trust of erins child must thou be raking in the crumbled past for racks and fagots in her teeth to cast see from the ashes of helvetias pile the whitened skull of old servetus smile round her young heart thy romish upas threw its firm deep fibres strengthening as she grew thy sneering voice may call them popish tricks her latin prayers her dangling crucifix but de profundis blessed her fathers grave that idol cross her dying mother gave what if some angel looks with equal eyes on her and thee the simple and the wise writes each dark fault against thy brighter creed and drops a tear with every foolish bead grieve as thou must oer historys reeking page blush for the wrongs that stain thy happier age strive with the wanderer from the better path bearing thy message meekly not in wrath weep for the frail that err the weak that fall have thine own faith but hope and pray for all faith conscience love a meaner task remains and humbler thoughts must creep in lowlier strains shalt thou be honest ask the worldly schools and all will tell thee knaves are busier fools prudent industrious let not modern pens instruct poor richards fellowcitizens be firm one constant element in luck

dangers night shall be a nations guide one swelling crest the citadel shall crown its slanted bastions black with battles frown and bid the sons that tread its scowling heights bare their strong arms

morey scarce her tale begun ere listening infants weep the story done oh had we room to rip the mighty bags that time the harlequin has stuffed with rags grant us one moment to unloose the strings while the old graybeard shuts his leather wings but what a heap of motley trash appears crammed in the bundles of successive years as the lost rustic on some festal day stares through the concourse in its vast array where in one cake a throng of faces runs all stuck together like a sheet of buns and throws the bait of some unheeded name or shoots a wink with most uncertain aim so roams my vision wandering over all and strives to choose but knows not where to fall skins of flayed authors husks of dead reviews the turncoats clothes the officeseekers shoes scraps from cold feasts where conversation runs through mouldy toasts to oxidated puns and grating songs a listening crowd endures rasped from the throats of bellowing amateurs sermons whose writers played such dangerous tricks their own heresiarchs called them heretics strange that one term such distant poles should link the priestleyans copper and the puseyans zinc poems that shuffle with superfluous legs a blindfold minuet over addled eggs where all the syllables that end in ed like old dragoons have cuts across the head essays so dark champollion might despair to guess what mummy of a thought was there where our poor english striped with foreign phrase looks like a zebra in a parsons chaise lectures that cut our dinners down to roots or prove by monkeys men should stick to fruits delusive error as at trifling charge professor gripes will certify at large mesmeric pamphlets which to facts appeal each fact as slippery as a freshcaught eel and figured heads whose hieroglyphs invite to wandering knaves that discount fools at sight such things as these with heaps of unpaid bills and candy puffs and homoeopathic pills and ancient bellcrowns with contracted rim and bonnets hideous with expanded brim and coats whose memory turns the sartor pale their sequels tapering like a lizards tale how might we spread them to the smiling day and toss them fluttering like the newmown hay to laughters light or sorrows pitying shower were these brief minutes lengthened to an hour the narrow moments fit like sunday shoes how vast the heap how quickly must we choose a few small scraps from out his mountain mass we snatch in haste and let the vagrant pass this shrunken crust that cerberus could not bite stamped in one corner pickwick copyright kneaded by youngsters raised by flatterys yeast was once a loaf and helped to make a feast he for whose sake the glittering show appears has sown the world with laughter and with tears and they whose welcome wets the bumpers brim have wit and wisdom for they all quote him so many a tongue the evening hour prolongs with spangled speeches let alone the songs statesmen grow merry lean attorneys laugh and weak teetotals warm to half and half and beardless tullys new to festive scenes cut their first crop of youths precocious greens and wits stand ready for impromptu claps with loaded barrels and percussion caps and pathos cantering through the minor keys waves all her onions to the trembling breeze while the great feasted views with silent glee his scattered limbs in yankee fricassee sweet is the scene where genial friendship plays the pleasing game of interchanging praise selflove grimalkin of the human heart is ever pliant to the masters art soothed with a word she peacefully withdraws and sheathes in velvet her obnoxious claws and thrills the hand that smooths her glossy fur with the light tremor of her grateful purr but what sad music fills the quiet hall if on her back a feline rival fall and oh what noises shake the tranquil house if old selfinterest cheats her of a mouse thou o my country hast thy foolish ways too apt to purr at every strangers praise but if the stranger touch thy modes or laws off goes the velvet and out come the claws and thou illustrious but too poorly paid in toasts from pickwick for thy great crusade though while the echoes labored with thy name the public trap denied thy little game let other lips our jealous laws revile the marble talfourd or the rude carlyle but on thy lids which heaven forbids to close whereer the light of kindly nature glows let not the dollars that a churl denies weigh like the shillings on a dead mans eyes or if thou wilt be more discreetly blind nor ask to see all wide extremes combined not in our wastes the dainty blossoms smile that crowd the gardens of thy scanty isle there whitecheeked luxury weaves a thousand charms here sunbrowned labor swings his naked arms long are the furrows he must trace between the oceans azure and the prairies green full many a blank his destined realm displays yet sees the promise of his riper days far through yon depths the panting engine moves his chariots ringing in their steelshod grooves and eries naiad flings her diamond wave oer the wild seanymph in her distant cave while tasks like these employ his anxious hours what if his cornfields are not edged with flowers though bright as silver the meridian beams shine through the crystal of thine english streams turbid and dark the mighty wave is whirled that drains our andes and divides a world but lo a parchment surely it would seem the sculptured impress speaks of power supreme some grave design the solemn page must claim that shows so broadly an emblazoned name a sovereigns promise look the lines afford all honor gives when caution asks his word there sacred faith has laid her snowwhite hands and awful justice knit her iron bands yet every leaf is stained with treacherys dye and every letter crusted with a lie alas no treason has degraded yet the arabs salt the indians calumet a simple rite that bears the wanderers pledge blunts the keen shaft and turns the daggers edge while jockeying senates stop to sign and seal and freeborn statesmen legislate to steal rise europe tottering with thine atlas load turn thy proud eye to freedoms blest abode and round her forehead wreathed with heavenly flame bind the dark garland of her daughters shame ye ocean clouds that wrap the angry blast coil her stained ensign round its haughty mast or tear the fold that wears so foul a scar and drive a bolt through every blackened star once more once only we must stop so soon what have we here a germansilver spoon a cheap utensil which we often see used by the dabblers in aesthetic tea of slender fabric somewhat light and thin made of mixed metal chiefly lead and tin the bowl is shallow and the handle small marked in large letters with the name jean paul small as it is its powers are passing strange for all who use it show a wondrous change and first a fact to make the barbers stare it beats macassar for the growth of hair see those small youngsters whose expansive ears maternal kindness grazed with frequent shears each bristling crop a dangling mass becomes and all the spoonies turn to absaloms nor this alone its magic power displays it alters strangely all their works and ways with uncouth words they tire their tender lungs the same bald phrases on their hundred tongues ever the ages in their page appear alway the bedlamite is called a seer on every leaf the earnest sage may scan portentous bore their manysided man a weak eclectic groping vague and dim whose every angle is a halfstarved whim blind as a mole and curious as a lynx who rides a beetle which he calls a sphinx and oh what questions asked in clubfoot rhyme of earth the tongueless and the deafmute time here babbling insight shouts in natures ears his last conundrum on the orbs and spheres there selfinspection sucks its little thumb with whence am i and wherefore did i come deluded infants will they ever know some doubts must darken oer the world below though all the platos of the nursery trail their clouds of glory at the gocarts tail oh might these couplets their attention claim that gain their author the philistines name a stubborn race that spurning foreign law was much belabored with an asss jaw melodious laura from the sad retreats that hold thee smothered with excess of sweets shade of a shadow spectre of a dream glance thy wan eye across the stygian stream the slipshod dreamer treads thy fragrant halls the sophists cobwebs hang thy roseate walls and oer the crotchets of thy jingling tunes the bard of mystery scrawls his crooked runes yes thou art gone with all the tuneful hordes that candied thoughts in ambercolored words and in the precincts of thy late abodes the clattering versewright hammers orphic odes thou soft as zephyr wast content to fly on the gilt pinions of a balmy sigh he vast as phoebus on his burning wheels would stride through ether at orions heels thy emblem laura was a perfumejar and thine young orpheus is a pewter star the balance trembles be its verdict told when the new jargon slumbers with the old cease playful goddess from thine airy bound drop like a feather softly to the ground this light bolero grows a ticklish dance and there is mischief in thy kindling glance tomorrow bids thee with rebuking frown change thy gauze tunic for a homemade gown too blest by fortune if the passing day adorn thy bosom with its frail bouquet but oh still happier if the next forgets thy daring steps and dangerous pirouettes
