the scrolls of the ancients robert newcomb prologue relinquishment and there shall come unto eutracia one who shall willingly forsake her firstborn and the child cast away shall haunt her dreams for her entire life yet it shall be this same child temporarily lost and alone in the maze that is the craft who shall also become known as one of its greatest wielders page chapter two of the prophecies of the tome d o not tell me your name my dear but by what name shall we call the child and remember first name only please the matrons voice was neither condescending nor harsh she waited patiently her squat bulky frame blocking the doorway to the building behind her but the young mother standing before her in the rain had no ready answer she had not given her child a name for doing so would only further cement the bond she already felt with him and make the act she was about to perform even more impossible tightening her arms around his little body she lowered her eyes in sadness and shame she had come here to give up her baby as she tried unsuccessfully to protect the squirming infant from the driving rain she craned her neck to peer over the matrons shoulder an inviting glow emanated from the rooms beyond and she could hear the sounds of laughing children the smells of warm food drifted to her nostrils reminding her of how long it had been since she had eaten perhaps if she could just go inside for a moment she might feel better about it all may i come in before deciding she asked no my dear it is forbidden the matron responded her older wiser heart was breaking just as it always did for the sad desperate ones who journeyed here but the wizards had made their conditions very plain and as headmistress of this place she had to respect them if you are here to give us your child surely you must know that you cannot enter she added gently not now not ever she extended her arms according to eutracian law once the baby was handed over there could be no going back still the young woman hesitated she pulled the infant closer to her breast attempting to cover him further with the worn blanket she had wrapped around him and which of the three categories of blood does this child possess the matron asked hoping to move things along fully endowed unendowed or partial the weather was worsening and if this was to be done she wanted the baby protected from the elements as quickly as possible fully endowed the young mother responded quietly the matron raised an eyebrow it had been some time since she had been offered a child of fully endowed blood giving one up was a rare thing usually indicating that the mothers situation was dire indeed and do you have the childs verified blood signature to prove this claim she asked the mother nodded from beneath her hooded cloak she produced a parchment which she handed to the woman before her backing away from the rain the matron unrolled it she glanced at the blood signature noted the childs date of birth then verified that two of the consuls of the redoubt had witnessed the formation of the signature as required the black ink stamp in the shape of the paragonthe stone that powered the craft of magicwas in place proof that the child was illegitimate at last she checked the blood quality rating also stamped at the bottom of the document its numerical value indicated the highest blood quality she had ever seen stunned she simply stood there for a moment finally she found her voice and the required parental blood signatures she asked trying to mask her surprise the younger woman produced two more parchments the matron looked intently at them after noting their signed confirmations by the consuls she carefully compared them to the first document very well she said finally i accept the fact that the child is of fully endowed blood he will be treated accordingly except for the actual handing over of the infant their business was concluded all of the permissible questions had been asked and answered and the necessary documents provided the young mother trembled clearly torn the drops from the sky combined with those from her eyes to run down her reddened cheeks the baby had fallen asleep the only sound was the cold rain splattering down on the street and the unassuming house that hid so many secrets turning the young mother looked hesitantly to the rainsoaked carriageoffour that had brought her here she saw the kind elderly faces of her parents as they sat inside waiting for her to decide she thought back to when she had first met eric he had swept her off her feet and she had fallen madly in love at first her parentssimple commonershad approved of him handsome charming and of fully endowed blood just as she was but then he had shown his true colors upon learning of her pregnancy he had abandoned her never to be heard from again despite his cruel treatment she still missed him and feared she always would that had been the first time her young heart had been truly broken standing here on this anonymous stoop in the rain trying to make her fateful decision was the second the voices had come just after she had discovered she was pregnant you must abort the child they had said but she had defied them carrying the baby to term and then giving birth despite the terrifying warnings searing through her mind the voices had grown stronger and more insistent continuing to demand the death of the infant they had finally become so resonant and powerful that she thought she would go irretrievably mad if the child stayed with her she was terrified that such madness would cause her to harm the baby despite her love for him and so she had come hereto this place many knew about but few talked ofto give her firstborn away i ask you a final time the matron said what name shall be given to this child tears streaming down her face the young mother looked down into her babys face for what she knew in her heart would be the final time she saw his wispy sandy hair and the small mole at the lefthand corner of his mouth with trembling hands she handed the infant over to the matron she thought for a moment wulfgar she whispered at last she covered her face in grief then wulfgar it shall be the matron answered compassionately her face hardened slightly you are never to visit here again nor try to discover the whereabouts of the child do you understand the wizards penalties for disobeying can be quite severe the young woman standing before her could only nod go now the matron said quietly her voice kind once more and may the afterlife look over you turning she carried the infant into the house closing the door behind her sobbing the young mother collapsed she felt her fathers strong arms lift her to her feet felt herself being carried back to the carriage and placed upon the seat she continued to cry as her mother stroked her hair as their driver snapping his whip charged the horses noisily down the slick cobblestoned street morganna of the house of desinoor wept in her mothers arms then she felt her mother press something into her hand it was a lock of sandycolored hair tied with a red ribbon it had been cut from the head of her son only this morning and was now all she had to remember him by it would be another three years before she would meet and marry nicholas of the house of galland the true love of her life and become queen of eutracia she would then go on to have twins whose birth would be heralded by a strange azure glow and watched over anxiously by ancient wizards the carriage plunged on through the night part i recollection thirtyfour years later chapter one and a great calamity shall befall the nation after the second earthly death of the chosen males seed for the endowed and the unendowed alike of the already beleaguered land shall find themselves in chains with little hope of return page chapter one of the prophecies of the tome w hump whump whump the two massive sledges came down on the large simple block of wood in perfect unison one after the other monotonously marking out the beat its cadence rarely varied a sledge in each hand the awful barely human creature continued to bang out the mindnumbing rhythm as the filthy slaves seated in rows before him toiled endlessly whump whump whump built for war maneuverability and speed the ship was unusually large christened the defiant she carried four full masts and a hundred oars the cramped oaring stations lay one deck down and smelled of sweat urine and slow death fifty such rows stretched down the dark interior of the hull a single wide walkway separating them into two equal halves six male slaves toiled in each of the divided rows making six hundred of them on this deck alone they had few breaks they were forced to row whenever the wind was directly behind them or the ship was in the doldrums or simply it seemed when impatience overcame their new taskmasters and even when they were allowed a few moments of rest they remained chained in place unable to stretch their muscles to rest their weary backs the slaves wore nothing but soiled loincloths their callused bleeding hands were chained together and their feet were in shackles communally chained to the deck escape was impossible even if one or more of them somehow freed themselves of their bonds there would be nowhere to go except overboard to drown in the icy waters of the sea of whispers they had been at sea for fifteen days legend had it that no ship had ever sailed farther than thatships that tried never returned home one of the slaves looked down at the number carved into his oar handle number twentynine that was his name nowa number assigned by his captors it was meant to be dehumanizing he was sure but he had seized on it as a symbol a reminder that his life was not his own that the slave manning this oar was not his true self twentynine he would use that as his name as long as he remained captive but someday somehow he would be freed and then he would take up his family name once again with pride he glanced out the small oar slot near his station more ships like this one were out there occasionally he could see them their sails full and their oars slicing through the restless frothtipped wavesan inexplicable armada of shame his muscles on fire twentynine pulled relentlessly on the accursed oar his hands cramped sharply once they had been those of an accomplished artisan but he knew they would no longer be capable of such specialized work he could barely straighten his fingers anymore on those rare occasions when they happened to be removed from the handle seething with hatred twentynine looked up at his taskmasters the monsters who had captured him chained him and forced him to labor on their ship they were horrific once they may have been humanbut no more they were tall and muscular and their skin was pure white alabaster almost translucent even when there was a deficit of light their pale flawless flesh seemed to shine as if their bodies carried no blood whatsoever twentynine had often wondered if they would bleed if cut the four fingers and thumb of their hands ended in long pointed talons rather than fingernails their powerful chests bare each of them wore an odd black leather skirt floor length and divided down the front for walking the toes of their black leather boots protruded from beneath the hems a spiked black leather collar encircled each ones neck each creature carried a short sword in a scabbard hung low behind his back in an ingenious arrangement that allowed the hand to reach naturally down along the outer leg to draw the blade twentynine had already seen several of them do so and their speed had been staggering somehow they managed never to catch the swords in the bright red capes that were attached to their spiked leather collars their faces were grotesque the heads were long angular oversized a shiny metal skullcap covered the top of their white hairless craniums ran down between the eyes then split down either side over the bridge of the nose each half extended down the sides of the cheeks to the jawbones running back to encircle each ear before joining again with the top leaving the creatures eyes mouths and ears exposed the ears that protruded from the gaps in the masks were exceptionally high pointed and seemed to hear everything a variety of earrings dangled from them the wide wrinkled mouths held black tongues and dark pointed teeth for eyes they had long narrow slits hiding orbs that were solid white without irises or pupils and quite vacant still they missed nothing setting the cadence the beatmaster among them continued to pummel his twin sledges down on the solitary block of wood as the slaves pulled relentlessly on their oars pacing between the rows others of the blanched monsters moved up and down the shifting pitching deck carrying knotted ninetails or longhandled tridents they would without hesitation lash or stab any slave they felt to be shirking his labors the slaves called these guards bleeders the deck of the ship was stained with the blood of those who did not keep up the pace water number twentyeight suddenly begged falling over onto the deck twentynine tried despite his short wrist chains to help him back onto the bench before any of the bleeders saw what had happened but he knew he had to continue rowing or be beaten himself he looked up to see one of the creatures approaching it was then that he felt the warmth smelled the stench closing his eyes briefly he tried to blot out what was happening but could not twentyeight was vomiting bile on his feet twentyeight retched again curling his trembling body around one of twentynines vomitsoaked feet help us he sobbed why wont anyone help us the bleeder was standing over them without hesitation he shoved the three prongs of the trident into twentyeights left calf the blood gushed forth flowing down the slaves leg in bright rivulets for a long moment twentynine thought he might be sick giving the trident a vicious twist the bleeder yanked it from twentyeights leg back onto the benchnow the bleeder shouted his voice was low guttural and commanding he was standing so close that twentynine could smell his putrid breath somehow twentyeight did as he was told seated on the bench once more he bent over and retched again his empty stomach had nothing left to expel if this happens again the prongs will go directly into your worthless eyes the bleeder hissed do you understand he pointed his trident at the strange brand on twentyeights shoulder you are not of endowed blood talis therefore you are quite expendable you live only to serve this ship with a sneer the creature continued down the bloodstained aisle to abuse another man who had fallen behind functioning on fear alone twentyeight somehow resumed rowing twentynine looked over to the left shoulder of his friend at the word that had been branded into his skin talis he had no idea what it meant but he believed it to be from a longlost language his father had told him of something he had called old eutracian his father and his fathers father had all handed down tales of a mysterious beautiful language now long since abandoned the same word had been branded into the left shoulder of almost every oarsman just before they were forced to board the vessel at the coastal city of farpoint the rest were marked with a slightly different word rtalis he had no idea what either word meant pulling on his oar he glanced down at the aisle dividing the rows of slaves latticed gates lay flush in the floor held fast with huge iron padlocks they led to the lower decks where still more slavesmen as well as womenwere held at the docks the women and the men had been herded together twentynine had been puzzled to see that they were all about the same age somewhere between thirty and thirtyfive seasons of new life then after a small quantity of their blood had been taken they had been branded those given the designation rtalis had been carefully boarded first and were treated marginally better for example he had never seen an rtalis forced to toil at the oars lost in thought he let his mind drift just a bit too long before he realized that his pull on the oar had slackened slightly the knotted ninetails came whistling out of nowhere snapping loudly its leather straps seared their way into the naked skin of twentynines back making him scream trying to regain his focus he screamed again perhaps more loudly than was truly warranted it was good enough for the bleeder with the whip apparently satisfied the creature turned his white opaque eyes to someone else weapon arm raised suddenly a latticed doorway in the deck above opened and a stairway descended with a crash sunlight and sea air streamed in as a figure slowly climbed down twentynine narrowed his eyes he had seen this being only one other time since boarding the slave ship and knew him only by the private name he had silently bestowed on him the harlequin even though the slaves continued rowing to the mindnumbing beat every pair of eyes was now focused squarely on the harlequin as had been the case the other time twentynine had seen him he was absurdly dressed his longsleeved blackandwhitechecked doublet was fastened down the center with shining gold buttons highly padded epaulets broadened the shoulders and short white ruffles on the raised circular collar and cuffs of the doublet lengthened neck and arms the almost obscenely tight bright red breeches ended in black squaretoed shoes with raised heels and highly polished silver buckles rings adorned almost every finger and a matching gold necklace hung to his breastbone the long fingernails were also red strangest of all his face was painted the effect was chilling his face was stark white his lips were deep scarlet a bright red painted mask surrounded dark piercing eyes angular and foreboding its edges swept back sharply from the eyebrows and lower lids into the stark white field surrounding it the haughty prominent nose was severely aquiline the jaw surprisingly strong an inverted red triangle was painted beneath the lower lip his hair was dyed a bright red and was pulled back tightly from the widowpeaked hairline to the rear of his skull fastened to his belt was a device that looked like two small iron spheres one black and the other white attached to either end of an alternating blackandwhite knotted line the line was coiled up and hung neatly from a hook on his belt at the right hip sometimes usually when he was deep in thought or watching something he found to be particularly stimulating the harlequin would reach down and grasp the twin spheres then gently rub them together producing a soft clinking sound there was something unnerving and perverse about the action and twentynine cringed whenever he saw it taken as a whole the harlequin looked like a freak on view at a province fair rather than the leader of the fearsome taskmasters controlling the oarsmen but whomever he turned his eyes on quickly learned the truth this was no fair and his intentions were sincerely deadly the harlequin whispered something to the bleeder keeping time and the monster stopped pounding on the block of wood as they had been trained the oarsmen immediately ceased their labors the silence was deafening raise oars the bleeder shouted immediately all of the slaves pushed down on the handles of their oars raising them up out of the restless sea of whispers ship oars the slaves dutifully began to pull their oars into the ship and lay them down in the aisle separating the rows gasping exhausted they tried their best to remain quiet we have arrived at the first of our destinations harlequin said to the bleeder i shall need forty of them he placed his hands upon his hips you may have the honor of selecting them for me his eyes hardened make sure you take talis only he added as you wish the master bleeder answered rising from his seat he began walking down the length of the bloody aisle pointing to slaves seemingly at random a cold sense of dread shot through twentynine as the blanched creature stopped directly before his row his broken bloody hands were trembling he held his breath and kept his head down and eyes lowered you came the simple command twentynine looked up the bleeder was pointing to twentyeight feeling guilty twentynine let out a long breath other bleeders began unchaining the chosen forty they were forced to stand many at first went crashing back down to the bloody deck their legs too weak and cramped to hold their weight eventually all of them including number twentyeight began shuffling stiffly toward the stairway where the bizarre harlequin stood waiting twentynine tried to give his seatmate a look of encouragement as he walked away but twentyeight wasnt looking at him as the slaves began climbing the stairs the harlequin examined each of them closely another of the chosen men was weeping openly he was pulled out of the line the harlequin drew him closer do not fear he said almost compassionately you go to a far better place with that he released the man to the bleeders and they forced him up the stairway choose two more the bleeder did so and the harlequin followed the last of them up the stairs it was at that moment twentynine realized things had changed he could sense no movement the ship was no longer rocking back and forth in the sea as one would normally expect there was no creaking of the ships sides there was in fact no sound whatsoever and then the temperature began to change it started to become coldimpossibly so the slaves in their meager loincloths began to shiver their breath turned to clouds of vapor twentynine bent over trying to conserve body heat then he had an idea sliding as far into twentyeights vacant seat as his chains would allow he peered across the shivering bodies of the other four slaves in his row trying to get a better look out the small oar slit what he saw did not encourage him the ship seemed to be in the grip of an impenetrable gray fog the likes of which he had never seen growing up in the coastal city of farpoint he had seen fog banks roll in to be sure but this was decidedly different as if it had a life of its own the fog began to slither into the boat tendrils reaching in through the oar slits and falling down the stairway from which the harlequin had descended it quickly filled the deck as it increased in density the fog replaced the smell of the salt sea with a cleaner odor such as one might inhale on land after a brisk cold rain then came the voices many voices whispering as one pay us our bounty or we shall first take your ships and then your bodies almost immediately twentynine could hear desperate tormented cries from above then everything became eerily silent again the ship continued to sit motionless but at last the fog still surrounding them began to thin and he could see the terrified faces of his fellow oarsmen craning his neck twentynine saw that the sun shone brightly once more then the splashing noises began instinctively he started counting them as he watched through the narrow slit he could see the occasional bloodied body plunging into the sea there were forty splashes in all then he heard snuffling snarling grunting sounds they reminded him of one time he and his father had been ocean fishing twentynine had been young and had made the mistake of accidentally tipping an entire bucket of bloody fish offal overboard sharks had swarmed as had happened then eventually all went quiet straining to get the best possible view twentynine could see the red spreading stain of blood as it stretched across the surface of the impossibly placid sea then the topside deck hatch opened noisily again and the harlequin reappeared blood dripped from the hem of his doublet gently wiping it off with an embroidered handkerchief he descended the stairs and walked to the master bleeder fill the vacant seats with replacements from below he said casually talis only and be quick about it several bleeders moved aside the oars and unlocked the grates in the aisle floor then descended into the darkness soon the replacements came up and out furiously blinking their eyes in the brighter light of the oar deck they were assigned to their stations and roughly chained into place twentynine tried to smile hopefully into the face of the frightened confused slave now seated next to him then he felt the great ship rock and heard the accompanying creaking of her sides he heard the scurrying noises of the topside bleeders as they went about their labors above slowly the defiant began to make way the harlequin looked to the pacemaster battle speed he ordered we have time to make up for very good the pacemaster replied but an unusually worried look had crowded in upon the corners of his face but before we commenceare we safe he asked are we through it oh indeed the harlequin answered casually and the human offerings the pacemaster inquired taking up his twin sledges their numbers sufficed oh yes the harlequin answered walking to a comfortablelooking chair placed before the slaves he smiled i think it safe to say they all disagreed with something that ate them the bleeders broke into raucous laughter reclining into the softness of his upholstered chair the harlequin threw a leg up over one of its arms as the slaves slid their oars into the restless sea the pacemaster resumed the beat and the defiant truly began to make way reaching down the harlequin took the twin iron spheres into his hand and began clinking them together exactly matching the pacemasters beat o n the same ship another slave lay shackled to the floor one of hundreds packed cheek by jowl in the lower deck his eyes were hazel his straight sandy hair was pulled back from his face into a tail that was secured with a bit of worn leather string and ran down almost to the center of his back before being chained down he had been branded with the word rtalis as had many of the others imprisoned with him he was strong and in the prime of his life but in the darkness of this hold it didnt matter nothing did with no way to raise himself up there was precious little escape from the constantly nauseating stench of human waste not to mention the everpresent vomit from those who continually succumbed to seasickness all the slaves marked rtalis were fed and hydrated enough to keep them alive still his lips parched and his clothing soaked his hollow stomach felt long past the point of hunger he had no idea that his ship was part of a large flotilla of slavers nor did it matter all he wanted was his freedom a few hours earlier the ship had inexplicably stopped then suddenly resumed course he did not know why he could do nothing but listen to the moaning and sobbing of his fellow captives as the ship pitched sickeningly through the violent sea of whispers trying to keep from vomiting he closed his eyes his parched tongue reached out to touch the dark mole at the lefthand corner of his mouth chapter two d ried tulip of rokhana the old woman said in her raspy voice pointing to the smokecolored bottle never in her life had she seen so many rare wonderful herbs collected in a single place the sheer quantity and selection astounded her she watched anxiously as a greedy child might while the man in the twocolored robe took the fragile bottle down from the shelf he carefully placed it into the saddlebag alongside the others the woman smiled revealing the absence of several teeth and sneezeweed she added gleefully clapping her hands together she pointed to another container we must have sneezeweed again the man complied the small thatched cottage they were plundering was in the hartwick woods just east of the town of florians glade in the south of eutracia an ancient herbmistress lived there at the moment she cowered within the glowing wizards warp the man in the robe had conjured after breaking into her home what about this one he asked casually he held a small fluted bottle of shredded blue leaves before the light of the fireplace bah the old woman grunted with a disparaging wave of her ancient hand what you now hold is a bottle of the ground flowers from a shammatrass tree they bloom only once every twentythree years and must be picked within hours of their appearance or they are no good it is used for medicinal purposes onlynot at all something that we need she smiled wickedly it is however exceedingly difficult to come by she continued it probably took the herbmistress there her entire life to collect the meager amount you now hold in the palm of your hand turning she cast a jealous eye to the woman trapped behind the azure bars of the cage really the man asked nastily how interesting with that he removed the cork and cast the bottles contents into the fire the flames roared colorfully for a moment before finally settling down again the herbmistress cried aloud and slumped to the floor smiling the man in the twocolored robe looked over at her after i have finished here i will visit the lead wizard he said softly i will gladly give him your regards he began to laugh but his laugh quickly decayed into an allconsuming cough hacking relentlessly he placed a cloth before his mouth when he took it away it was covered with blood that was moving across the cloth tracing his endowed blood signature his lips twisting angrily he stuffed the rag back into his robes he stood there quietly for a moment trying to reclaim his breathing are you sure there is nothing in this place that would help me he whispered to the crone as she went about selecting more of the precious bottles at last she stopped her search and turned her green eyes to him as i have told you before krassus there is nothing of this world that can help you now as you yourself have said your illness is of the craft what you have swirling inside was given to you by your previous master the dead son of the chosen one what shall be shall be she turned her attention back to the shelves the items we take today should however help me locate the scroll you seek and hopefully before it is too late she added softly hours after they had gone the wizards warp finally dissolved leaving the crying herbmistress free to face the task of cleaning up her smashed looted home chapter three d reng the wizard faegan shouted happily from his chair on wheels thats another two hundred points using a feathered quill he made an exaggerated show of noting the tally down on a small pad smiling coyly he sat back and stroked nicodemus his blue cat as he waited for the inevitable outburst from the lead wizard it didnt take long once again i say youre cheating you must be wigg shouted back his jaw stuck out like the prow of a ship youre using the craft i dont know how youre managing it but ill find out no one gets a full dreng on only two hands not even you wigg onetime lead wizard of the directorate was becoming more furious by the minute his craggy face was red and he glared at faegan with the mighty allconsuming surety of his convictions grabbing up the cards to shuffle them and deal out another hand faegan only smiled tristan of the house of galland prince of eutracia sat at the rectangular upholstered gaming table listening to the two ancient wizards bicker it had been this way for the better part of an hour he normally found it comic when they were at each others throats usually over something trivial today it was starting to annoy him six of them were playing the card game dreng and the score was tied wigg captained the team consisting of himself his daughter celeste and tristan the team sitting across from them was made up of faegan geldon the hunchbacked dwarf and princess shailiha tristans twin sister morganna shailihas baby sat on the carpet batting at some scattered toys at first wigg had not wanted to play arguing as usual that there were far more important matters to attend to in truth he had probably been right but after some stiff cajoling by shailiha and what tristan thought to be comic but shameless outright begging by celeste the lead wizard had finally given in these two strongwilled women had become wiggs and faegans soft spots and everyone in the palace knew it there was in fact very little in this world that the two women could not get either of the wizards to do especially if they both asked at oncea strategy the women had been quick to learn and to capitalize upon tristan cast an eye across the table toward his sister and gave her a slight smile shailiha smiled back her long blond hair and hazel eyes as lovely as ever she then looked at wigg the lead wizards face was red and a vein had begun throbbing in his right temple suddenly unsure about the relative wisdom of purposely engaging the two irascible wizards in a competition she looked back over at her twin brother tristan ran a hand impatiently through his dark hair he stretched back in his chair uncoiling his long legs and glanced at the floor where he had placed his dregganthe nasty curved sword he had taken from one of his deadliest enemiesand the quiver of throwing knives that he usually wore across the back of his right shoulder despite the fact that the palace was relatively secure he always made it a point to never be far from his weapons life had been far too dangerous of late the room in which they were playing was sumptuousone of those that had been recently refurbished by the minions of day and night the winged army tristan commanded the marble of the floor and walls was of the palest gray shot through with streaks of indigo a huge oil chandelier hung in the center of the ceiling giving off a soft comforting glow it was nearly dinnertime and tristan was hungry despite the distance from this game room to the palace kitchens he had almost convinced himself he could smell the aroma of the warm inviting food that would soon be served by the gnome wives he sighed a glass of wine would be especially welcome gazing over at the open balcony window he saw the sun setting down into the western horizon it had been four months since he had witnessed the death of his son nicholas and the destruction of the gates of dawn nicholas had planned to use the gates to rend open the heavens allowing the return of the heretics of the guild masters of the vagaries who would then use the dark side of the craft to rule forever an anomaly in nicholas blood had killed him just before he had been able to accomplish this feat at that point the gates had collapsed and the heretics had once again been confined to the heavens as tristan had predicted the recent season of crystal had been unusually harsh with heavy snowfall and icecold winds but now the season of new lifehis personal favoritewas coming into full bloom flower buds and green grass were springing up and the air was full of the many wonderful scents that only natures rebirth could provide the last few days had been wonderfully warm so warm in fact that today they had been able to leave the balcony doors open for the first time a shout from faegan brought the princes attention back to the gaming table faegan the impish threehundredyearold rogue wizard protector of the area of eutracia known as shadowood was the keeper of many secrets he possessed the very rare power of consummate recollection which allowed him to recall instantly anything he had ever seen read or heard he was also the only living person to have completely read the first two volumes of the tome the great book of the craft his grayblack hair carelessly parted down the center fell almost to his shoulders over his loosefitting black robe he wore the paragon the bloodred jewel that helped sustain the craft of magic amazing graygreen eyes set in an intense commanding face only hinted at the awesome power lying behind them he was flanked by geldon and celeste loyal intelligent and kind geldon had contributed mightily to their survival over the recent past a slave of the sorceresses for nearly three centuries he had been instrumental in defeating the coven and helping to destroy nicholas gates of dawn for the thousandth time tristan turned his dark eyes toward celeste over three hundred years old protected by time enchantments that kept her forever youthful she was the longlost daughter of wigg and the first mistress of the recently defeated coven of sorceresses failee celeste had finally discovered her true identity by bravely escaping ragnar the mutated blood stalker who had endowed her with time enchantments and kept her as his slave in the caves of the paragon for more than three centuries she was originally to have been failees fifth sorceress her blood quality was supposedly second only to that of tristan and shailiha the chosen ones of prophecy dark red hair parted on one side fell down to celestes shoulders her sapphire eyes showed both intelligence and compassion the hint of a cleft in her chin gave her the appearance of personal strength even though her talents and confidence in her new world above ground were still developing whenever tristan was near her he could smell a hint of myrrh and it had been her scented embroidered handkerchief that he had carried into battle to defeat his son nicholas i still say youre cheating wigg said to faegan distracting tristan no im not faegan sniffed i dont need to especially considering the amateurish way youre laying down your cards with a smile he winked at tristan then levitated his cards in a straight line just above the surface of the table wigg shook his head angrily laying down another card must you show off that way he huffed the knight card he had just played would trump faegans page and the lead wizard knew it thinking he finally had faegans team on the run he smiled wickedly played with twosided cards dreng was a notoriously difficult game to learn and an even more difficult game to play with any degree of expertise played in teams it could easily develop many unexpected twists and turnssomething that wigg was being increasingly reminded of im sorry lead wizard but that simply will not do shailiha said with mock compassion placing a card down on top of wiggs dreng she said happily easing herself back into her chair faegans team had easily taken the hand wiggs first reaction was to turn angrily around and search for caprice shailihas giant butterfly the violetandyellow flier of the fields was never far from her mistress sure enough she was perched quietly on a bookcase behind shailiha calmly opening and closing her wings it was obvious that the flier could not have been reading wiggs cards silently informing the princess via the mental bond they possessed still unable to find evidence of faegans cheating the frustrated lead wizard scowled menacingly tristan was an excellent dreng player but his interest was quickly waning hopefully shawna the short would arrive soon announcing in that nononsense way of hers that dinner was served admit it wigg insisted one corner of his mouth coming up tristan looked over at the lead wizards craggy profile at the back of wiggs neck the gray hair was pulled into a short braid his wizards tail had been sadistically cut away by the first mistress of the coven during her vicious torture of him the first time he and tristan had visited parthalon tristan had long suspected that wigg would grow it back out of respect for the members of the directorate all of whom had perished at the sorceresses hands and he had been right how do you know faegan is cheating father celeste asked interrupting the princes thoughts he caught her giving a secret wink across the table to shailiha just what is it you think he is doing he is no doubt employing the craft to deal invisibly from the bottom of the deck wigg sniffed narrowing his eyes as faegan again took up the cards faegan dealt the cards out once more he then looked briefly at both sides of his cards arranged them to his liking and cast his sharp eyes over at wiggs hand then he smiled impishly if i wanted to change the nature of your cards i wouldnt choose such a banal pedestrian method of doing it he said instead i would probably do something more inventive something like this he closed his eyes and a soft azure glow began to surround wiggs cards in a matter of mere moments all of the courtly characters displayed upon them dressed in their customary finery had been drastically altered they were now quite naked leaving very little to the imagination everyone around the table broke into raucous laughterexcept for wigg this is the last straw the lead wizard shouted tossing his useless cards to the table i think its high time i then quite suddenly wigg stopped talking at first tristan thought it was out of pure frustration but then the lead wizard stiffened and rose up a bit in his chair raising one hand to silence the table he tilted his head the prince glanced over at faegan to see a concerned look darkening his face as well faegan looked at wigg and nodded tristan had seen this signal pass between the two wizards before and it usually meant only one thing they had sensed the presence of endowed bloodunfamiliar endowed blood reaching down to the floor for his dreggan tristan slid the blade from its scabbard a glow was forming in one of the far corners of the room where the ceiling formed a joint with two connecting walls the familiar azure glow of the craft was coalescing when it took up the entire corner its outline started to sharpen standing slowly tristan raised his sword faegan his back to the glow turned his chair to see whatever it was finally everyone in the room was gazing on the anomaly the image continued to form hauntingly finally the azure glow faded away and the shape became clear a man hung there like a spider face to the card players the fingertips and balls of his feet touching the ceiling and walls behind him suddenly he spread his arms wide and launched himself from the wall landing upright in the exact center of the table playing cards went flying high into the air shailiha and celeste recoiled back into their chairs tristan didnt hesitate he swung the dreggan for all he was worth sending its razorsharp edge whistling through the air in an attempt to cut the intruders legs off at the knees the figure before them only laughed and jumped into the air easily avoiding tristans blade both wigg and faegan had raised their arms to employ the craft but the man standing before them was too fast another glow had already begun to form engulfing the entire table and everyone around it tristan tried to lunge at the intruderonly to discover that he was frozen in place all he could move was his head he could hear and he somehow felt sure that he still commanded the power of speech but he could not move a muscle from his neck down a glance at the others told him that they too were caught in the paralyzing warp tristan wondered frantically he could not fathom how the man had so silently invisibly breached the security of the palace evading the hundreds of minion warriors who were camped outside the intruder was tall and gaunt with a face to match straight stringy locks of pure white hair fell down from the crown of the mans skull it was somewhat longer than shoulder length except for the ragged bangs that covered most of his forehead but despite the white hair his age did not seem advanced studying the face tristan guessed the man to be no more than fortyfive seasons of new life his skin was pale almost gray dark brows arched over piercing eyes the cheekbones were high and elegant the nose was large and aquiline thin lips formed the straight slash that was his mouth the cheeks were deeply creased and hollow the jaw was strong taken as a whole the face conveyed tightly controlled intelligence and power the man was dressed in a fulllength robe of two colors divided down the center the lefthand side was gray the color once worn by the directorate of wizards and still worn by wigg the righthand side was the dark blue worn by the brotherhood of consuls unexpectedly the man began to cough his hacking began softly but quickly built in intensity he finally produced a rag from his robes and covered his mouth briefly it came away bloody the sudden sign of illness in the same man who had just executed such clever acrobatics and the lightningswift construction of a powerful wizards warp seemed contradictory indeed forgive me wigg the man said sarcastically once his coughing had subsided looking down at the lead wizard he placed his hands into the opposite sleeves of his robe my entrance was unexpected i know but given the numbers of minion warriors camped outside it seemed the only sensible way i may be ill but i have no desire to die sooner than necessary and what i have come to say will not take long his voice was controlled and deep wigg gazed at him in amazement working his jaw he found he was being allowed to speak krassus he whispered so you live he narrowed his eyes taking in the mans strange twocolored robe and you still wear the robe of first alternate can we therefore assume it is you we now have to thank for so many of our problems tristan could move his eyes just enough to look over at faegan it was clear that the ancient crippled wizard did not know this man that is correct krassus said but our relationship does not have to be adversarial i have in fact come to offer you a truce that part of it will depend entirely on you lead wizard i have come for information and i intend to have it who are you faegan broke in what do you want krassus looked toward the voice and a brief smile of recognition crawled across his face faegan he said softly almost reverently as if he could not believe his eyes it must be the recently departed nicholas told me you had returned to tammerland until then i had thought you had passed from flesh and blood into myth your power and knowledge are legendary but forgive me for you and i have never been properly introduced i am the consul krassus i was at one time both first alternate to the dearly departed directorate of wizards and the servant of nicholas son of the chosen one it is indeed an honor to finally meet you krassus looked down at tristan and smiled and the chosen one himself is also in attendance he then admired the sword tristan still held he truly is as impulsive as they say isnt he looking to shailiha he added we are honored by the presence of the princess as well how nice his gaze flicked briefly over geldon then settled on celeste and who is it we have here he asked had i ever met a woman as beautiful as this i would surely have remembered celeste did not respond but her expression hardened almost imperceptibly what do you want wigg demanded again purposely interrupting krassus disturbing examination of his daughter from what you say i take it you are the new leader of the supposedly rebellious brotherhood indeed i am krassus answered but as i said earlier i am willing to put the recent hostilities behind us and start over i will allow everyone in this room to live and i have already ordered the consuls to remove the bounty on tristan i will even bring the remaining consuls back into the fold so to speak all i ask in return is unencumbered leadership of the consulsand some information if you refuse you will make me your enemy for life the chosen ones son may be dead but certain aspects of his cause are not true the number of consuls had been radically reduced but it should be enough enough for what faegan asked krassus smiled you see he went on im afraid the death of nicholas and the destruction of the gates are only the beginning of your problems unknown to you the son of the chosen one had already placed other plans into motionplans designed to pave the way for the heretics to ensure that the vagaries will rule as the sole arm of the craft with nicholas gone this sacred duty falls to me i do not intend to release the heretics from the heavens as nicholas tried to do as you have no doubt discerned i am fatally ill thus i do not have the time for such endeavors much less the training or quality of blood required nothe forestallments imbued into my blood by my late master are not allpowerful as his were but they provide me with ample skills to finish the more earthly aspects of his plan all i need is the proper information if you resist me before you perish you shall learn there remain other methods of making sure the vagaries solely rule the craft krassus lowered his eyes and focused them menacingly on the lead wizard you can either be a willing partner in what i do or you and your little group here will die it is no more complicated than that surely you must realize that if your goal is to promulgate the vagaries i will never help you wigg answered adamantly nor will faegan every person in this room would gladly give his or her life to make sure the vagaries never rule the land i have no need to ask faegan the first of my questions krassus responded calmly only the second faegan may be the greatest keeper of knowledge but you lead wizard are the greatest keeper of secrets and always have been i know you have the information i seek because i now travel with a partial adept who is a blazegazer as well as an herbmistress and she is never wrong wigg suddenly appeared as if his entire world had just collapsed but his look of defeat quickly turned to one of anger if you have harmed her i will kill you he snarled slowly tristan had no idea who they were talking about but wigg was clearly incensed oh no my friend krassus responded almost kindly it is not she with whom i travel but another i did however visit the home of the one you refer to to collect a few things my partial adept shall eventually need you might want to go and see your old friend after i depart i left her in a rather bad way krassus bent over slightly placing his face closer to the lead wizards now then he said softly for the first of my two questions where is wulfgar wiggs face went completely white his eyes widened briefly with amazement then narrowed again in a poor attempt to disguise his shock he then glanced at the questioning faces of tristan and shailiha and his heart was heavy with the realization that he might be forced now to break yet another of his promises to their parents i dont know who youre talking about he answered adamantly thats not good enough krassus whispered his fist came around like lightning smashing into the side of wiggs face tristan had never seen such superhuman speed the lead wizard reeled drunkenly for a moment a trail of blood snaking its way down his chin curlicuing into his blood signature as it went celeste cried out for her father and tears welled in her eyes slowly collecting himself wigg looked through halfclosed eyes at the consul somehow he smiled is that the best you can do he asked drunkenly even the first mistress of the coven struck me harder as i told you im ill krassus answered sarcastically his fist came around again smashing into the point of wiggs chin and driving the wizards head into the back of his chair stop it you bastard tristan screamed he tried again to move his sword arm but it was no good looking for a glimmer of hope he turned his eyes to faegan but all the great wizard could do was shake his head back and forth angrily and the two scrolls of the ancients krassus went on blithely i suppose you know nothing of them either actually i need only find one the other the scroll of the vagaries is already in my possession a nasty grin spead slowly across his face i have no idea what youre babbling about wigg answered thickly perhaps all of your time with nicholas has addled your brain so you now apparently detest the vigors exhausted from his beating he ran out of breath and his chin slumped forward to his chest krassus bent over faegan and you cripple he said insultingly i suppose you also know nothing of either wulfgar or the scrolls summoning up all of the saliva he could muster faegan spat it at the hem of krassus robe that is the only answer i shall ever have for you he whispered venomously go find whatever it is youre looking for by yourself assuming of course youre intelligent enough to do so straightening krassus smiled the famous wizards recalcitrant to the end his laugh turned into a single short diseased cough very well then it seems i shall have to find out for myself whether the two of you are lying he closed his eyes and a soft glow began to surround the wizards chairs slowly increasing in intensity suddenly wiggs and faegans heads simultaneously snapped back their eyes were wide open but seemed to observe nothing watching tristan realized that krassus had succeeded in entering at least a portion of their mindstesting them just as they had once tested geldon before allowing tristan to go to parthalon to rescue shailiha from the coven they desperately fought the intrusion by the consul sweat broke out on each of the three struggling faces as wigg and faegan fought to keep from having their minds violated and krassus tried desperately to enter after several long agonizing moments the glow faded away and the consul opened his eyes wigg and faegan were breathing heavily in total exhaustion so krassus said softly half to himself it seems wigg still does not know the location of wulfgar after all such a pity now i must find him the hard way but thats why i travel with a partial adept isnt it he turned to faegan such a strong mind he said in a conversational tone i have never experienced its like you were partially successful in blocking my intrusion werent you no matter although you are aware of scant references to the scrolls i can tell you have no real knowledge of either where they may be or of their vast importance and you unlike the lead wizard have absolutely no idea who wulfgar is krassus made a sarcastic clucking sound with his tongue dont the two of you know that it isnt polite to keep secrets from each other even the chosen ones do not know of wulfgar how deliciously ironic wigg summoned the strength to look up at krassus his face was already swelling but why he asked still sounding drunk why do you turn your back on your teachings follow the darkness of the vagaries and how is it that you have defeated the death enchantments put on all the consuls they should have killed you the first time you attempted to practice the vagaries the battered lead wizard paused to catch his breath a prospect that i must say would no longer disappoint me he added softly ah so you wish to make a guessing game of it do you krassus asked nastily very well then lets play he leaned over again and placed his mouth close to wiggs ear tell me lead wizard each time a creature of the vagaries or one of the coven died do you really know why there were such strange atmospheric disturbances the wind howling until you thought your ears might burst and lightning across the sky so bright that night seems as day you always taught us that it was simply to mark their passing into the afterlife not true and do you know why i seek wulfgar the lost one again the answer is no it seems that even the lead wizard of the notdearlydeparted directorate still has a great deal to learn about the true workings of your nation and your craft because you refused to help me we are now enemies he continued brazenly i know i do not possess the strength to destroy both of you here today at the same time therefore i am forced to wait but your individual times will come i promise you and one last thing should any of you doubt the seriousness of my words i suggest you take a little journey to farpoint three days from now what you shall witness there is of nicholas planning and my execution and should be of great interest to you krassus paused for a moment obviously relishing his temporary dominion over them all still so much for you to learn wigg and so little time for either of us to accomplish our ends you because part of the plans nicholas imagined still remains in motion and i because i will soon perish my duties done i will then gladly go to the hereticsthe reward promised to me by the son of the chosen one smiling he stretched out his arms and now i am forced to bid you all farewell he said quietly until next time the azure glow of the craft began to form again amazed tristan watched as the consul melted away into nothingness the glow disappearing with him he could hear the sound of the intruders boot heels as they defiantly marched across the gaming table and jumped to the floor then as if completely of their own accord the balcony doors swung wide open closing again after a brief pause no one had to tell the prince that krassus had just escaped the palace as easily as he had entered the warps surrounding them disappeared wigg fell unconscious from his chair landing hard on the cold marble floor chapter four s he had lain there on the stone floor of her cottage for some time sobbing softly the cruel man in the twocolored robe and his equally cruel companion had departed and slowly the wizards cage surrounding her had dissolved her home was a wreck of smashed and battered vials jars bottleseven furniture was brokenand she knew it would take many days to repair the damage but the most difficult task would be replacing the herbs roots blossoms and seeds they had stolen some represented the work of more than three centuries now vanished in a single day the intruders had known exactly what to take and her loss was unimaginable but because she was the recipient of time enchantments time was the one thing on her side abbey of the house of lindstrom slowly came to her feet after brushing off her burgundy peasants dress she stoked the hearth and decided first to prepare herself a cup of nerveweed tea looking to her shelves she hoped it would still be there then she saw it and let out a sigh of relief the herb had long been known for its calming effects and she could use a good dose of it just now after placing the water into the pot and hanging it over the gathering fire she righted the table and chairs and sat despondently before the hearth soon the bonesoaking warmth and sooty smell of the flames started to give her some small measure of comfort she looked down at her hands and saw that they were still shaking closing her eyes for a moment she tried to fathom the meaning of what had happened here today why would anyone do such a thing she wondered we who possessed these esoteric arts were so few even before the sorceresses war and now three centuries later our numbers have surely dwindled even farther due to the ban by the directorate i should have recognized the woman but i didnt the whistling teakettle suddenly interrupted her thoughts removing it from the flames she set it on the table then she filled a tea basket with dried nerveweed leaves and lowered them into the kettle to steep something glinted on the floor and bending down she identified it as a rather large shard of broken mirror she picked it up and gazed into it the face reflected back to her was awash with great sadness and even greater confusion although her dark hair was streaked with gray she remained a very handsome woman gray eyes looked back at her with intelligence and the dark eyebrows arched highly almost seductively over them her jaw was strong yet feminine her cheeks were still blessed with the rosy bloom of her longfaded youth sighing she carefully put down the mirror interesting she thought for the thousandth time the one man on earth she still cared for was also the one who had tried to force her into abandoning her art she had thought of him so many times over the centuries even employing her art to regard him from time to time despite his recent travails she knew he was well many were the times she had been tempted to go to him to offer her forgiveness but that would have caused him nothing but more trouble it was better she supposed to simply live with the memories of those longago days than to go chasing after what could never be she poured herself a cup of the dark harsh tea and drank relishing its warmth as it went down the nerveweed would soon take hold and she would then begin the business of straightening up her house looking around the thatched cottage her mind went back to the time she had first come here she had been alone ashamed and angry that had been more than three centuries ago but after the exile of the coven to the sea of whispers the newly formed directorate of wizards had banned all partial adeptsboth male and femalefrom practicing their arts hurt and confused they had been ordered to scatter no two being allowed to go in the same direction and so she had finally chosen this place to be alone and to carry on in secret but not before one of the wizardsthe one who still had a place in her hearthad secretly granted her the time enchantments tearfully wishing her well abbeys heart skipped a beat my gazing flame she thought anxiously is it still burning or did they destroy that too she put her teacup down and bolted from the cottage outside she hiked up her skirt and began running as fast as she could through the woods even though the sun had set the path before her shone clearly by the light of the three red eutracian moons with huge relief she saw that the smooth flat rock was still in place chest heaving she stood before it she breathed deeply to calm herself and closed her eyes silently slowly the rock began to slide to one side across the dewy grass opening her eyes she held her breath almost immediately a high golden plume of flame erupted casting a magnificent light into the dark of the night letting out a great sigh she stood there silently for a moment blessing her good fortune the single golden flame coming from the earth was approximately one meter wide and three meters tall it was flat and broad the glade surrounding it had long ago been cleared of all trees and shrubs and abbey lovingly saw to it that it remained that way abbey of the house of lindstrom was many things but first and foremost she was a blazegazer reaching into one of the pockets of her dress she produced a very small bottle its contents were so rare and precious that she always carried it on her person no matter the circumstances thankfully that very habit had kept it safe from the intruders but they had known exactly what to take and her remaining supply of herbs needed to sustain the flame had gone with them what was contained in her locket would provide just enough for one more viewing and no more when she finished her flame would slowly die because she would have no more herbs to replenish it even so she could think of no better time than now to use them up after what the man in the twocolored robe had told her about the lead wizard she simply had to know opening the top she emptied the bottle into the palm of her hand carefully she walked closer to the roaring fire raising one arm she commanded the flame to split into two branches one far larger than the other as she curled the index finger of her outstretched hand the smaller of the branches obediently approached her as always the searing heat of the gazers flame threatened to scorch her face and dress quickly she pointed her hand to the right the flame flattened out and began to flow horizontally its edges licked dangerously close to her outstretched hand with great discipline she dropped the herbs into the waiting flame the effect was immediate the two branches suddenly rejoined and shot back up toward the sky abbey backed away from the searing heat as she did she reached for the pendant she wore around her neck opening it she withdrew a short braid of brown hair and held it high then she looked back at the flame midway up the body of the flame a rectangular azure window began to form closing her eyes she concentrated intently opening them again she gazed deeply into the chasm surrounded by the roaring flame her eyes widened she was not at all pleased with what she saw chapter five f aegan sat in his chair by wiggs bed eyes closed a concerned frown on his face his ancient hand gently covered the lead wizards forehead tristan shailiha and celeste stood behind him equally concerned caprice perched on shailihas arm slowly opening and closing her wings morganna shailihas baby daughter had been given over to the care of one of the gnome wives will he be all right celeste asked nervously when the wizard didnt answer tristan touched celeste on the arm when she looked at him he placed an index finger to his lips telling her to remain quiet from prior experience the prince knew that whatever faegan was doing he would be far more effective if silence reigned understanding celeste nodded faegan remained that way for some time his only movement the occasional touch of his palm on a different area of wiggs skull after what seemed an eternity he removed his hand and opened his eyes he has been through a great deal the old wizard said sadly the endowed physical blows were bad enough when the spell attacking his mind was enacted he fought it with everything he had the mental and physical beating together proved more than wigg could bear and he went unconscious his mind shutting down as a protective mechanism in many respects it was probably for the best tristan looked down at his friend and mentor of so many years his hands balled into fists and his knuckles went white with anger at the one called krassus so many questions had been purposely cruelly left unanswered by the consul but one thing was clearly certain the lead wizard alone held the answers to many of them how bad is it tristan asked anxiously he will recover faegan said with certainty but it may take several days for him to regain his strength completely at that he replaced his hand on wiggs forehead and the room went silent faegan closed his eyes after a time wiggs lids began to flutter then his eyes slowly opened opening his own eyes faegan peered down at wigg he then turned to tristan and smiled i still say you cheat at cards wigg said weakly frowning up into faegans face faegan smiled i never actually denied it he answered softly someday ill show you how it is done bending over celeste hugged her father and gave him a kiss i was so worried she whispered i dont know what id do without you do you think you are strong enough to answer a few questions faegan asked his usual curiosity returning there is much for us to discuss wigg nodded then quite unexpectedly he began to cry taken aback tristan realized that there was much more to krassus visit than he had imagined i can see that this is difficult for you old friend faegan began with uncharacteristic tact but the question simply must be asked he paused for a moment then inquired abruptly who is wulfgar gathering his resolve wigg looked at tristan and shailiha he lowered his eyes for a moment then slowly raised them again wulfgar is your lost half brother he whispered to them tristans eyes went wide his jaw slack shailiha gasped even the usually unflappable faegan was taken by surprise it was a moment before anyone spoke then faegan broke the silence you said half brother he murmured do you mean to say thats right the lead wizard interrupted wanting to approach it in a gentler way than the more analytical faegan might wulfgar is illegitimate he continued he is morgannas first child four years older than the chosen ones and also of very highly endowed blood wulfgars father was named eric upon discovering morganna was with child eric refused to marry her he disappeared leaving her heartbroken morganna gave the baby up for adoption at one of the wizards orphanages scattered throughout the realm despite the deep secret morganna always carried nicholas loved his queen unconditionally he finally added they were two of the most amazing people it has ever been my pleasure to know tristan looked at shailiha as if touching his sister could somehow ease their mutual shock he took her hand but why would mother give her baby up he finally asked his voice cracking the lead wizard sighed because she heard voices he said quietly voices telling her to destroy the child before it came to term do you mean to tell us that our mother was mad tristan whispered no wigg answered adamantly and i wish to make that point abundantly clear but at the time you can understand how she might have believed herself to be the voices grew even stronger after the birth this time telling morganna that she must kill her child but apparently she could not bring herself to do it faegan said no wigg said her heart wouldnt let her she could neither destroy her unborn child nor murder her baby but morganna was afraid that the voices in her head might eventually make her even more deranged even though such was never actually the case it was her fear of this unexplained madness that finally drove her to give up her child rather than risk harming him because of what she perceived to be her decaying mental state he paused then looked at the prince and princess all of this occurred before morganna met nicholas the common smith who eventually became king of eutracia and tristan and shailihas father the directorate had no idea of any of this when nicholas after we selected him to be king took morganna for his bride but later that year morganna and nicholas came to me telling me her secret a simple check of wulfgars signature in the hall of blood records confirmed their tale aside from the head matron of the orphanage only morganna nicholas the queens parents and i were aware of this i was never to reveal this secret at least until wulfgar could be found we have been searching for him ever since this was yet another of the tasks of the consuls of the redoubt and another of the reasons they were taught how to examine blood signatures as for wulfgar presumably he has no inkling of who he really is wigg paused for a moment letting his words sink in and despite our best efforts i still have no idea where he may be he looked down at his gnarled hands and what would have become of wulfgar if he had been found shailiha asked anxiously we would have been forced to train him in the craft even before tristan wigg whispered if his training went poorly it was agreed that other arrangements would be made the blood rushed from tristans face he moved his chair closer to the lead wizard but that contradicts everything you have always told me he said thoroughly confused it was always my understanding that i was to be trained first followed by shailiha should i die or fail in my eventual attempt to join the two sides of the craft the tome says so the tome says a great many things faegan interrupted and at first glance much of it can seem highly contradictory sighing he shook his head i suggest we allow the lead wizard to continue we came to believe that the voices speaking to morganna were those of the ones who came before wigg went on we knew that the ones were the original practitioners of the vigorsthe benevolent side of the craft therefore their demand that she destroy this child we reasoned could only be of the greatest importance they had no direct way to force her but their constant beseeching was literally starting to drive your mother insane once we ordered the consuls to find wulfgar the voices blessedly stopped never to return but what about the tome tristan pressed it says i am to be trained first does it not correct faegan answered but unless i miss my guess the lead wizard was about to remind us of the fact that the tome was written long before the birth of wulfgar for reasons we still do not understand the ones knew of the eventual coming of you and your sister and which parents would give birth to you but wulfgars birth was apparently an unexpected surprise even for the ones he rubbed his brow thinking and your mother told us that no azure glow appeared at wulfgars birth as it did when you and your sister were born wigg added wulfgar was born of a different father we know from that tome that nicholas and morganna were destined to find each other and only from that union would the chosen ones be brought forth and there is another reason why wulfgar could never be one of the chosen ones he paused then took a deep breath and let it out slowly before resuming you see wulfgars blood signature is leftleaning even more confused tristan shailiha and celeste looked to faegan for the answer but the crippled wizards mouth hung open with astonishmenta rare sight indeed do you mean to say yes wigg said speechless faegan leaned back his chair both tristan and shailihas signatures are rightleaning of course he muttered half to himself as were those of the king and queen therefore wulfgars leftleaning signature is a result of eric his endowed father what are you talking about tristan demanded what is a leftleaning signature simply put wigg answered if one draws a perfectly vertical axis through the exact center of a blood signature a trained eye can determine that each and every one leans slightly either to the left or to the right of center signatures leaning to the right indicate the possessor shall be more naturally attracted to the practice of the vigors conversely a leftleaning signature indicates that the possessor shall be far more inclined to want to follow the vagaries additionally the degree of deviation from the vertical axis tells us just how much influence one way or the other there shall be wulfgars signature was the most severe leftleaning example ever recorded a deafening silence fell over the room do forestallments change the lean of a signature tristan asked at last as far as we know they do not wigg answered forestallments are merely spells that remain dormant until being activated at a later time the signature lean is hereditary a child inherits the lean of his parents blood signatures if their leans are oppositional then the stronger blood prevails for example my blood was stronger than failees and thus celestes signature leans to the right during the sorceresses war it was rumored that a spell existed that could actually change the lean of a blood signature but none was ever found shailiha finally found her voice then failees signature was leftleaning was it not she asked yes wigg answered are you telling us that wulfgar should he be trained in the craft would be even more enamored of the vagaries than the first mistress of the coven shailiha leaned forward her hazel eyes intent yes wigg replied even more so than failee the firstborn child of the woman destined to bear the chosen ones remains loose upon the world with a leftleaning blood signature that knows no equal something the lead wizard had mentioned struck tristan as odd the more he thought about it the greater became his sense of dread his nerves coiled up almost as if he were about to go into battle what were the other arrangements regarding wulfgar to have been he asked bluntly again looking down at his hands wigg sighed if we were fortunate enough to find him it was decided we would first try to train him in the craft he answered slowly the entire directorate would be informed of wulfgars identity and sworn to secrecy together we would then do all we could to help him ignore the temptations of the vagaries but if the pull toward the dark side of the craft had proven too strong for him to resist even with our help the king queen and i had agreed upon other measures tristans heart went cold and they were he asked softly wiggs aquamarine eyes looked straight into tristans with an unusual mixture of sadness and determination it would then fall to me to take his life the lead wizard whispered tristan stared at wigg in disbelief how could you do such a thing he breathed from what you tell us he is an innocent not only does he not know who he really is but he remains untrained as well i cannot believe my parents sanctioned your ghastly idea it wasnt my idea tristan wigg answered it was your mothers speechless the prince half sat half fell back down into his chair it seemed to him as if the world he had once inhabited with his parents had just been turned completely upside downas if nicholas and morganna had somehow suddenly become people he had never really known at all but why shailiha whispered it was all she could do to get the question out have you not been listening wigg responded wulfgar is very close to possessing the highest blood quality ever known second only to that of the chosen onesthe two of you in addition his leftleaning blood signature is without question the most severe ever witnessed this combination is unprecedented trained by an unscrupulous master wulfgar could eventually wield power that only tristans son nicholas has to this date demonstrated to allow him to roam loose in the world would be disastrous but to kill him tristan said softly how could mother have even dreamt of such a thing morganna realized that eutracia and the vigors must come first even at the expense of her losing her firstborn child all over again wigg told them it was not out of selfishness or shame that the queen made this decision it was out of sacrifice but why bother to train him at all celeste asked left untrained but in your care he would have been harmless would he not wigg smiled one might first come to that conclusion he replied but he still might have been irresistibly called eventually to abandon us untrained he might not be completely aware of what it was he was searching for but the pull might be irresistible better to train him ourselves and then do what we must rather than leave him as raw clay for someone else to mold then why not train him and also imbue him with death enchantments as the consuls were tristan suggested that way if he ever practiced the vagaries his death would be a certainty at least he would be allowed to live for as long as he could hold out against their temptations that would seem far more fair not to mention more compassionate well done wigg answered and that possibility was considered but in truth it would have been far too cruel what do you mean tristan asked first wigg explained suppose for some unknown reason the death enchantments were to become unraveled as seems now to be the case with the consuls wulfgar would then be not only trained but completely unbridled as well and second when the death enchantments are activated the transgressors demise is particularly ugly and painful yet another deterrent to the practice of the vagaries morganna would have none of that no far better for me to have ended wulfgars existence painlessly under our control than to leave him to the inevitable torment of the death enchantments thinking of all he and his family had been through tristan lowered his head does it never end he asked softly recognizing the princes pain wigg gave a rueful half smile no he answered not so long as the vagaries exist as an art unto themselves and there are those of endowed blood unable or unwilling to resist its temptations the tome says that only the chosen ones can end the struggle by combining the two sides of the craft for the good of the world even though we still do not know how this is to be accomplished we believe that is why you and your sister were put upon the earth your parents believed it too and were willing to sacrifice everything toward that goal even themselves and wulfgar was never found the prince said sadly after a long silence faegan changed the subject who is krassus he asked as krassus said he is a consul wigg answered a bit of guilt beginning to crowd in upon the edges of his craggy face or i should say was and without doubt he was the most powerful of them perhaps even more powerful now if nicholas imbued his blood signature with certain forestallments before he died as with those that you and shailiha carry they can bequeath on the bearer many exotic abilities krassus was first alternate to the directorate of wizards that meant that should one of us have died krassus would be the one to take his place his unique twocolored robe signified his position in the hierarchy but until such time as he would have been called upon to join the directorate krassus had no vote or involvement his duties were strictly those of a wandering consul you would not have known him but if this krassus truly wants you and faegan dead why didnt he take the opportunity to kill you today while you were both in his warp tristan asked because maintaining a wizards warp takes a great deal of energy faegan answered to attempt to kill one of us would be to risk losing control of the warp thus allowing us the chance to fight back and he wants wulfgar celeste said but why no doubt to use his enormous potential to fulfill whatever portion of nicholas dream he vowed to complete faegan answered we must find wulfgar first tristan said adamantly he knew he was stating the obvious but for him it had been as much a statement about his family as it was one regarding the welfare of his nation or the craft wigg thought for a moment then looked over at faegan tell us old friend he asked what are these scrolls of the ancients that krassus kept referring to faegan closed his eyes his brow furrowing with concentration tristan could tell that the master wizard was about to employ the gift of consummate recollection to find the answer and the survivors shall discover two parchments each replete with the workings of the acts delayed he began quoting from the tome they shall be of indescribable valuethe keys enabling the descendants to partially unravel the mystery that is the craft but in the hands of those practicing the vagaries the scrolls of the ancients shall become as potent a weapon as ever witnessed in the history of the world faegan opened his eyes it was clear that after the draining experience of having krassus invade his mind the effort of using the gift of consummate recollection had fatigued him that was the first such quote from the tome regarding the scrolls he said tiredly when i am more refreshed i will attempt to recall the others what are the acts delayed wigg asked him does this refer to the art of forestallments that is my initial impression the master wizard answered and if that is true the scrolls would teach us much i have an almost infinite number of questions about the forestallments for example how does one place them into the blood and how can we tell whether they are event or time activated once placed there can they be removed can one discern whether they are open ended and lasting forever or are closed ended and therefore limited in duration is there any way to tell from ones blood signature what the gifts shall eventually become for that matter do the scrolls hold these answers or are we altogether wrong in assuming that they refer to the forestallments the study of forestallments is without doubt the most frustrating and at the same time most fascinating aspects of the craft i have ever encountered but why does krassus want these scrolls so badly and what do they have to do with wulfgar krassus said that we should go to farpoint three days from now tristan interjected that something would happen theresomething that would convince us of his desire to carry on nicholas work do either of you know what he might be talking about both wigg and faegan shook their heads i have no inkling either but i will go the prince announced closing his eyes wigg rubbed his forehead his heart wanted to warn the prince about the wisdomor lack thereofof traveling to farpoint the very place krassus had dared them to visit but he also did not possess the strength to argue the issue especially now with the everheadstrong tristan wigg i know you are tired but i have one more question faegan pressured gently krassus said he was traveling with a partial adept do you mean to say that their kind is still roaming eutracia tristan looked curiously at shailiha and celeste they seemed to be as baffled as he was in truth i do not know wigg said with finality closing his eyes his tone and facial expression hinted either that he was trying to keep something secretwhich would be just like himor that he simply did not wish to discuss the matter just now what is a partial adept shailiha asked sighing wigg opened his eyes again a partial adept is a specially trained man or woman of the craft whose blood signature shows up as a partial like baby morgannas does they had only one endowed parent and so are not fully endowed i thought people were either endowed or they werent tristan pressed thats true and it isnt wigg said its a long story and one i am too tired to discuss as if there were nothing left to say about the matter the lead wizard closed his eyes again raising an eyebrow tristan looked skeptically at faegan the wizard in the wheeled chair sighed it was clear to them that they would be hearing little more from the lead wizard this night suddenly the door to wiggs quarters blew open revealing a rather putout shawna the short as usual the hardworking gnome wore her gray hair tied back in a tight unforgiving bun her dress was simple and clean her nononsense shoes were flat and sturdy in one hand she wielded a large mixing spoon the same way a warrior might wield his sword tristan suddenly realized how hungry he was i can explain he began giving her a hopeful smile you see the lead wizard is rather indisposed i dont care what the lead wizard is she snapped back in the kindly but stern manner it seemed only she could master dinner is served and dont blame me if it has gone cold with that she haughtily turned and stomped away despite all that had happened tristan snorted a laugh down his nose i suppose we had all best obey he said taking shailiha and celeste by the arms he started for the door faegan began wheeling his chair along behind them then celeste stopped turning back to wigg i will return later with a tray of food for you father she said sleep well thank you my dear wigg murmured without opening his eyes entering the hallway the group closed the door behind them leaving the lead wizard alone it was only then that his aquamarine eyes opened he was lost in thought had krassus harmed abbey wigg could count on one hand the number of days she had not entered his mind over the last three centuries if abbey lived and was somehow a part of all this how could he ever hope to explain her to the others what in the name of the afterlife was going on out of sheer fatigue wigg closed his eyes again blessedly sleep began to separate him from his thoughts chapter six r aise oars the grotesque pacemaster finally stopped beating out the incessant rhythm and placed his twin mallets on the floor number twentynine thanked the afterlife that he had survived the horrific pace and along with the other slaves in his row pushed down on the heavy oars lifting the paddles from the sea of whispers blood was dripping from his palms every muscle in his body felt as if it might literally crack in two ship oars the pacemaster shouted using whatever remaining energy they could muster the slaves who could still move drew their long oars into the frigate and laid them in neat rows down the length of the aisle many of the oarsmen had collapsed during the final brutal day some had simply died of heat and exhaustion where they sat those had been unchained and thrown overboard to be replaced by another talis from the decks below the deck was bathed in vomit urine and blood as usual the harlequin and the pacemaster seemed to take it all in stride for much of the day the harlequin had sat in his upholstered chair watching the slaves labor as he sipped what seemed to be a bottomless glass of red wine oars finally secured in the gangway twentynine collapsed on the filthy bloody deck after what seemed only moments the bleeders came around again using their tridents to prod the helpless slaves upright coughing twentynine managed to regain his seat and used the opportunity to peer out the oar slit in the side of the hull his gaze fell upon a sheer face of gray slick rock and he realized they had struck land smiling the harlequin stood up arms akimbo unchain them he ordered the whiteskinned bleeders in the strange skullcaps immediately began to unchain the slaves from one another but left wrist manacles and foot shackles in place drastically limiting movement where are they taking us the slave next to twentynine whispered trembling with fear twentynine glared at him angrily do not talk you fool he muttered furiously this is no time to invite attention and as you go by the harlequin lower your face the bleeders then began prodding them to their feet it took many painful attempts to get cramped and atrophied legs to stand but eventually after a smiling almost kindly gesture from the harlequin they all began shuffling toward the bow their manacles clanking as they went twentynine reached the stairway and followed his comrades up onto the deck above the first thing he saw were hundreds of slaves of both sexes standing before him waiting to disembark they had been divided by gender the women dressed in simple onepiece frocks had apparently fared little better than the men most looked ill many were coughing trying to adjust his vision to the relative darkness twentynine rubbed his stinging bloodshot eyes blinking he finally saw where he was their ship seemed to be docked in some kind of subterranean stone harbor the flat roughhewn wharf had apparently been carved directly from the walls a great deal of activity was taking place the noise of the clanking manacles and the shouting of frightened slaves echoed hauntingly back and forth between the cavern walls and ceiling wide enough to easily anchor several ships like the defiant the saltwater bay was open to the ocean at only one end the tunnelshaped portal was easily wide enough and high enough to allow the passage of the great ships in and out looking more closely twentynine saw the sunlight beyond the caverns outer edges come streaming down from the sky dappling the surface of the sea beyond it tantalizingly reminded him of the freedom from which he had been so unbelievably inexplicably taken in the distance his eyes could just make out the white graceful sails of two more ships the stone pier before them was huge easily large enough to allow several hundred persons to stand upon it numerous gangplanks had been lowered from the defiant to the pier and slaves were already filing down them dozens of bleeders stood there waiting as he looked closer he could see beyond the crowd of disembarked slaves several dozen men sitting at long tables they wore dark blue robes as the slaves approached them the men wrote with quills and ink in large leatherbound journals turning around twentynine could see that the seawater here looked murky and cold as it gently lapped up against the rock walls and the sides of the ships numerous stalactites snaked down from the ceiling covered with and surrounded by moss and mildew the chamber smelled of a strange combination of mustiness and sea salt the only light aside from the sunshine streaming in at the curved entrance to the harbor came from various wall sconces and larger standing lanterns dotting the edge of the stone pier their combined glow cast spectral shadows across the slickness of the walls the air was full of the sounds of snapping bullwhips crying and still greater confusion twentynine looked down the pier and saw that two other ships were also docked quietly along its length they floated there gently their graceful lines and somehow comfortingly creaking hulls belying their horrific inhuman purpose their waterlines rode high in the sea revealing that their human cargoes had already been ordered ashore twentynine lowered his head in shame averting his eyes from his soiled loincloth he regarded his tortured shackled hands once beautiful they had easily commanded the highest of compensation for his chosen trade of weapon making now they were bloodied and broken and he doubted they could ever demand such sums again even if somehow given the chance painfully he tried to straighten out his fingers but they stubbornly refused to obey as if they had become appendages belonging to someone else as they defiantly clung to the shape of the oar handle he suddenly realized that even though he no longer held the oar its mastery of him might remain a part of his being forever raising his face back up to the strange subterranean harbor and the wailing of his fellow innocents he felt tears come to his eyes it was while standing there waiting his turn to walk down the gangplank that twentynine first noticed the slave directly to his right the man was very tall and unlike most of the other slaves he somehow stood defiantly erect broadshouldered and stocky the man was heavily muscled making it clear that he was quite used to manual labor the level intelligentlooking eyes were hazel smooth sandycolored hair was tied behind his neck with a short strip of leather and fell long down his back a dark mole lay at the lefthand corner of the mans mouth although not what many would call classically handsome the slave carried with him a great sense of strength and personal fortitude he looked to be approximately thirtyfive seasons of new life on the mans shoulder twentynine could easily see the still angry partially healed brand rtalis all the captives grouped with this man had been branded with the same word twentynine noticed he also quickly realized that this particular group of men and women was noticeably smaller than the others almost as if they had been singled out for some reason just then the catoninetails came whistling out of nowhere the knotted strands of leather lashed into twentynines naked back he screamed falling to the pier for the briefest of moments he looked up fire in his eyes his anger tempting him to lash out at his attacker taking a breath he wisely relented the bleeder responsible grabbed him by his dark hair and wrestled him to his feet twentynine suddenly realized why he had been whipped in his examination of the slave standing next to him he hadnt kept up with the moving line the bleeder struck him in the back forcing him to close ranks as if understanding the slave he had been regarding turned his face to him and gave him a nod through his pain twentynine tried to manage a little smile back reaching the defiants gunwales they began marching down the gangplanks and onto the stone pier after what seemed an eternity he finally took his turn at the tables where the men in the hooded blue robes sat waiting he could now see that the robed ones were seated in dozens of pairs one pair before each line of disembarking slaves twentynine faced the pair in front of him and they looked up at him disinterestedly turn to the right one of them said twentynine did so talis the other one said looking at the brand on his shoulder your number twentynine refilling his quill with ink the man scribbled something in his ledger and your given name and house the man asked as twentynine told him he again wrote in the book hold out your right hand the other one said flatly looking around twentynine tentatively did so one of the seated men narrowed his eyes and a strange blue glow began to surround twentynines tortured hand startled he tried to pull it away but then the bleeder assigned to these two robed men grabbed his wrist forcing it back into position over the tabletop a small almost painless incision somehow formed in his fingertip then a single controlled drop of his red blood obediently plopped down onto a sheet of parchment lying on the table as the glow around his hand dissipated the bleeder let twentynines wrist go then one of the men picked up a small vial and poured a single drop of what looked to be red water from it the drop of water also landed upon the parchment a short distance away from twentynines blood leaning over the two men at the table watched closely as twentynines blood drop on the parchment began to dry up he looked back up at them lack of blood activity confirmed one of them said perfunctorily again writing in his ledger talis no blood assay or forestallment map required the man next to him reached over to a large pile of books selecting one he rifled through its pages talis section he said looking up at the bleeder a notation was made in this book as well ready to escort him away the bleeder took twentynine by the arms but before the bleeder could push him into motion a loud hubbub started to come from the line to twentynines right the man he had been studying earlier was standing before another pair of robed men they seemed very excited and their voices were rising in volume even the bleeder holding twentynine and the robed ones seated at the desk before him stopped their duties to listen say your name again one of the agitated bluerobes shouted at the slave and your house it was clear he was extremely eager to have his answer the man looked at them with defiance i already told you he said i am wulfgar of the house of merrick son of jason and selene what do you want of me one of the robed men before him looked up to the bleeder stationed by his side take his wrist he ordered the bleeder obeyed the robed one seated on the right looked back up into the mans eyes this will not hurt he said softly twentynine was surprised by his sudden change in tone almost immediately an azure glow formed around the slaves hand an incision similar to the one created in twentynines finger opened a single drop of his blood fell softly onto the blank parchment lying on the table then the two robed men did something curious from a leather case one of them produced a strangelooking objectactually two objects housed side by side in some kind of open frame twentynine soon realized one of them appeared to be a clear beaker the other an hourglass both were small in size the beaker contained a small quantity of thick red fluid that seemed to move about inside it in little waves as if it had a life of its own at the bottom of the beaker was a small spigot the hourglass was the smallest twentynine had ever seen its lower teardropshaped globe contained what looked to be no more than a dozen small black spheres looking closer he couldnt possibly imagine why one would need to measure the extremely limited period of time such a small amount of sand would allow the beaker and the hourglass were fastened upright side by side in a simple frame of wood without front or back panels one of the bluerobes very carefully moved the device into place on the blank sheet of parchment by now everyone in the immediate vicinityslaves bleeders and hooded ones alikehad become very still wondering what would happen next slowly carefully the man slid the odd device across the parchment bringing it to rest near the blood drop the beaker was nearest the blood the hourglass positioned on the opposite side from his bag he then produced a piece of string marked in bright red near either end stretching the length of string out on the parchment he very carefully adjusted the position of the device until one of the strings red marks lay exactly across from the blood drop the other directly beneath the beaker spigot finally satisfied he replaced the string in his bag are you ready he asked turning to the robed one beside him i am the other replied seriously grasping the hourglass you realize they must be exactly timed the first man said holding the release handle of the beaker spigot of course the other said eagerly begin the count on my mark the first man said five four three two one now simultaneously the two men moved one turning over the hourglass one hand hovering above it the other releasing a single drop of the strange red fluid from the beaker down onto the parchment almost immediately the two drops of fluid flowed toward each other across the parchment and joined in a single larger drop of red the man holding the hourglass waved his hand a blue glow formed around the device and the black spheres stopped fallingone of them in midair twentynine gasped then wideeyed he turned his eyes back to the red drop to see that it had begun to trace a design onto the surface of the parchment after it finished forming its design the fluid began to retrace its path over and over again atop its original lines amazed twentynine looked over at the man whose blood had accomplished this marvel the man looked stunned the robed one on the right then produced a single piece of parchment from his case he spent what seemed to be a great deal of time nervously looking from one sheet to the other and back again finally he raised his eyes to his associate they match he shouted it is he we have found him his partner turned to him how many spheres he asked eagerly the other narrowed his eyes and stared intently at the glass his mouth fell open only one and one half he whispered in awe barely able to croak out the words the second sphere didnt even reach the bottom i have never seen such blood assay quality barely able to contain his joy his colleague again reached into his case this time he produced a thick magnifying lens mounted on a tripod unfolding the tripods three legs he carefully placed it over the strange red design standing he closed one eye using the other to peer down through the lens he remained that way for some time a leftleaning signature he announced and the angle is the most severe i have ever encountered and there are no forestallments to map the other said his blood is unadulterated just as krassus predicted we could not have asked for more stunned the two men sat back in their chairs the one on the right looked up in awe at the confused slave then he nodded to a nearby bleeder take him he ordered the bleeder immediately stepped behind the man and grasped him by both arms should any harm befall him you forfeit your life i understand my lord the bleeder answered obediently the man behind the table then turned to another bleeder go and fetch janus he said tell him we have good news and for the moment none of the other slaves are to go anywhere yes my lord the monster answered in a flash he was gone easily wending his bulky form through the crowd twentynine looked back down at the tabletop and to the design on the parchment and the weird devices the two men had used in their examination of the slaves blood he shook his head understanding none of what had just transpired the man named wulfgar was faring no better confusion and hate filled his eyes as he stood there gripped from behind waiting for the one called janus finally the crowds of slaves began to part turning twentynine looked to see who it was it was the harlequin ignoring everyone but the men seated at the table he strode forward to face them what is it he asked we have finally found him janus one of them said proudly as if having just obediently returned with a bone thrown by his master the blood signature is conclusive janus picked up the two parchments he gazed back and forth between them for some time finally he returned his redmasked eyes to the ones behind the table you are sure he asked sternly turning he looked briefly at wulfgar trust me when i say that krassus will not be amused should he again return to this forsaken place only to find this to be yet another false alarm he turned back to the robed ones what did the blood assay reveal he asked a blood quality of one and a half one of them replied promptly we have never seen its like that is of course with the exception of the chosen ones and the craft tendency janus asked leftleaning the man seated on the right answered to a degree never before seen you dont say janus mused removing his fancy handkerchief from a pocket he dusted off the lens atop the tripod placing his eye to it he examined the design on the parchment for some time finally he raised his head back up very well he said finally i stand convinced the painted freak turned toward wulfgar all of that magnificently endowed blood just waiting to be trained he mused grasping wulfgars chin he examined the slaves face as he turned it this way and that in the dim light of the torches and you are so beautiful as well he added then letting out an exasperated breath he backed away all the while staring with revulsion at the slaves soiled torn loincloth and filthy bare feet reaching into a pocket he produced a small golden tin of snuff with careful movements he held a pinch up to his nose and sniffed hard a sudden forceful sneeze followed then he smiled no matter he said sniffing twice again your disgusting aroma can be remedied and beautiful you are my dear wulfgar despite your current state you are living proof that the licentious tart that was your mother somehow always managed to vomit forth impressive children no matter the quality of the fool she laid with how nice the slaves answer was immediate he summoned all the saliva he could and spat it directly into janus face slowly janus wiped the spittle from his face with his embroidered handkerchief so much defiance he said softly and how like your half brother and sister you seem to be confusion flashed across wulfgars face ah but you dont know about them yet do you janus asked nastily all in good time well see to it that the demonslavers watch over you well twentynine looked over to the whiteskinned monster on his right demonslavers so that was what they were called janus turned back to wulfgar and looked into the slaves hazel eyes assign this one to krassus personal quarters he ordered the ones at the table and keep the door securing our new charge locked at all times see to it that he is bathed and properly fed nothing but the finest for our friend wouldnt you agree also see to it that our guest has some finery to wear his forthcoming station shall require it otherwise he is not to be disturbed unless i order it he smiled again i want him to be sleek and happy when he first meets his new teacher the robed men nodded wulfgar struggled in vain to free himself from the demonslavers iron grip what do you want of me he growled what is it that i am supposed to do for you janus smiled be at peace he cooed softly for the time being all that matters is what we shall be doing for you it was at that point that a single defiant voice rang out from the crowd of slaves leave him alone he has done nothing to you turning quickly janus narrowed his eyes and searched among the slaves it seems we have a wolf among the sheep he said loudly how wonderful come and show yourself a man stepped out of line and began shuffling toward the table the nearest demonslaver moved to strike him down but backed down at a quick gesture from janus with a cavalier wave of one hand janus beckoned the loinclothed slave forward the man had served on the oaring deck twentynine had never been afforded the opportunity to speak to him for their stations had been too far removed from each other but he did know that this slave had been one of the most quarrelsome he had purposely given the demonslavers a great deal of trouble sometimes even mocking them many of the others manning the oars had looked up to him the grisly evidence of the demonslavers love for both the ninetails and trident showed over much of his lean hard body and yet this man like the slave named wulfgar had somehow managed to keep not only part of his strength intact but also most of his dignity as he walked slowly forward to face janus the demonslavers grudgingly made way you are in no position to give orders janus said looking the man up and down he grinned as he fingered the blackandwhite spheres at his hip rubbing them together in a circle around his palm twentynine cringed at the perverse metallic sound of their clinking together turn your left shoulder to me janus ordered the man obeyed janus narrowed his eyes talis he said approvingly good your death shall be no particular loss ill tell you what ill do ill give you a head startsay twenty meters run as fast as you can toward the edge of the pier where the ships lay docked if you make it ill let you live and if you dont well lets just say that you will be saved the unpleasant experience of this place after an indication from janus one of the demonslavers unlocked the slaves manacles the slave rubbed his tortured wrists in disbelief smiling janus took the blackandwhite rope from the hook on his belt and slowly began uncoiling it then he grasped the line at its center letting the small iron spheres at either end hang down almost to the stone floor casually he looked up into the eyes of the slave who had dared defy him i suggest you start now he said softly the slave turned and began running toward the ships docked at the end of the pier calmly almost slowly janus raised the checkered line high over his head and began to swing the spheres around in a circlethe line and spheres sang hauntingly as they tore though the airfaster faster until they were a glimmering pinwheel of black and white and then janus let go the weapon wheeled unerringly toward the running slave he never had a chance the midpoint of the checkered line caught him in the back of the neck instantaneously the lines on either side wound around and around his throat the twin spheres closed ranks smashing with a great cracking noise into his headone into his face the other into the back of his skull blood and brain matter exploded from his crushed cranium and he crashed to the ground just before reaching the end of the pier a hush came over the crowd the victim groaned dont tell me he still lives janus sneered how remarkable the harlequin strode to his victim and uncoiled his bizarre weapon from the slaves mangled neck the slave groaned one last time as the heartless butcher stood over him watching him expire with a smile janus bent over to dip the spheres into the sea to clean them then replaced them on his belt he looked over to several demonslavers who had crowded around the body suddenly his smile widened i think it safe to say he no longer has the head for this business and he gave a sarcastic laugh the slavers standing near him broke into raucous laughter twentynine lowered his head in shame then his shame quickly turned to anger filling every corner of his heart he looked down at his broken hands clenching his jaw he turned to glare at the freak standing so proudly over his bloody victory what shall we do with the body one of the demonslavers asked thinking for a moment the harlequin turned back to the crowd of slaves and beckoned immediately the air became filled with the sounds of snapping ninetails as the slavers forced the crowd toward the edge of the pier where the slain slave lay hear me janus shouted for those others of you who might defy us know that what happened to this slave is perhaps the most lenient of consequences there exist far more ingenious methods of obtaining your cooperation i assure you your loved ones back in eutracia know you are gone but have absolutely no idea of where you have been taken nor shall they ever rescue is quite impossible and should any of you be thinking of plotting an escape also know that you are on an island should you try to leave us only death awaits you in these waters allow me to demonstrate janus calmly turned to several of the slavers standing beside him he pointed to the mutilated corpse hack the body into pieces and throw them in he ordered simply two of the demonslavers came forward sliding their short broad swords from the scabbards hanging low on their backs with amazingly fast strokes the body was quickly dismembered blood ran slowly toward the edge of the pier and dripped into the sea two of the demonslavers grasped the bloody parts and tossed them into the ocean just aft of the defiant then janus turned to look down into the murky depths and held up a painted hand the entire crowd went silent wait for it he said quietly then slowly something began to happen there was a disturbance in the water an area of the sea surface started to glow with the color azure it began to writhe and churn deepening whirlpools each several meters across could be seen forming in various spots on the gloomy sea of the subterranean harbor everyone stood transfixed waiting to see what would happen next and then almost as if with a single mind the crowd recoiled from the midst of the azure whirlpools squat menacing heads silently began rising up out of the sea the long flat skulls were covered with dark red scales slanted yellow eyes with vertical black irises darted from side to side as the heads turned menacingly this way and that searching for whatever had disturbed the surface of the sea several of them began slithering hungrily toward the pieces of severed corpse portions of their long smooth bodies intermittently rising and submerging as they went their strangely forked tails rose silently from the water only to submerge again in the center of their backs a spiny fin occasionally swept up in a gentle curve only to fall again to lie against the sinuous spine dozens of them were rising silently to the surface now slithering over and under one another writhing and twisting in the dark sea the only sound was their eager hissing some of them had reached their meal and they opened their jaws wide astoundingly long pink forked tongues flashed out to entwine the bloody body parts then the tongues retracted pulling the meat into waiting maws in each mouth four long white fangstwo at the top and another pair at the bottomflashed as they bit down with snorting snuffling grunts of pleasure the monsters swallowed the sea became a whirling riot of activity as the grisly feeding frenzy continued unabated when the dismembered corpse was finally consumed the beasts silent now slithered back into the depths the surface of the sea stilled the azure glow faded away the bloodied soiled loincloth of the dead slave floated to the surface of the murky waterall that was left of the man who had dared defy janus smiling the harlequin turned back to the gaping crowd they are called sea slitherers he said created by my esteemed master they number in the thousands and completely surround the waters of these isles as i said escape is impossible twentynine stood numbly unable to believe what he had just witnessed he turned to look at the man called wulfgar it was clear he had given up struggling with the slaver holding him gloating janus sauntered back from the end of the pier enough fun for one afternoon he said casually our little object lesson is now concluded he looked commandingly at the two robed ones still seated at the table then pointed to wulfgar have him taken to his quarters he ordered and see to it that my other commands are carried out to the letter his wellbeing is paramount should any harm befall him you will have to answer to krassus himself the men behind the table nodded obediently also see to it that the two parchments carrying his endowed signature and blood assay are securely locked away in the vault of the scriptorium he added he looked back at the hundreds of filthy slaves standing in the dim light of the torches in the meantime keep processing these vermin he added and be quick about it two more ships are approaching and will be in need of docking berths he turned on his heel and walked away as janus left several demonslavers gathered around wulfgar presumably forming a security squad to escort him to his quarters strong hands suddenly gripped twentynine from behind a knee was slammed into his back and he was muscled around the end of the table his foot shackles rattling he was herded roughly toward the far wall where two dark stone doorways waited over one was carved the word talis over the other rtalis a steep stairway led upward from each curving around and out of sight just before being shoved through the door marked talis he forced his head around one final time to look at wulfgar perhaps he could give him a look of hope as wulfgar had done for him but wulfgar was already gone a trident at his naked back twentynine began climbing the steep roughhewn stairway chapter seven o x sorry the huge minion said wringing his hands ox should been inside palace with chosen one not outside with troops not happen again ox promise tristan smiled over at the slowwitted but loyal minion knowing full well how ashamed the warrior felt the prince had repeatedly tried to reassure him that what had happened had not been his fault and that krassus would have slipped by the minion troops anyway but as tristans supposed bodyguard ox hadnt agreed and had continued to castigate himself deciding there was little more he could do to change the warriors opinion tristan uncoiled his long legs and looked out the window admiring the eutracian landscape as it flew by below the prince ox shailiha and the wizard faegan were sitting inside one of the minion litters being carried through the sky by six of the winged troops another six warriors flew alongside as guards they had been traveling this way for several hours and it would take at least two more to reach the coastal city of farpoint sitting directly across from tristan shailiha was obviously nervous she did not like traveling by flying litter even if it was with her brother she would occasionally stick her head out trying to adjust to the fact that she was soaring along so quickly several thousand feet above the earth tristan gave her a wide smile reassuring her it would be all right she smiled back tentatively faegan had immediately fallen asleepor so it seemed but tristan doubted that the wily wizard was actually dozing suspecting that faegan was instead absorbed in his wizardly contemplations the paragon hung around faegans neck its vibrant red light shimmering from within as always three days had passed since krassus had breached the security of the palace to the wizards dismay tristan and shailiha had insisted on traveling to farpoint to witness firsthand whatever it was that krassus had taunted them about wigg although improving daily was still too weak to make the trip with them and so faegan had come both to protect them if necessary and to lend his experienced wizards eyes to their observations celeste had stayed at the palace to tend wigg the plan was to have the minions drop them in the woods just outside the city they would walk into town and once there would hire a carriage and tour the streets anonymously trying to find out what they could ox and his minions would stay in the woods with the litters waiting for their return tristan rubbed his face not liking the thick dark beard faegan had conjured for him he had never really had a full beard and he would be glad to be rid of it faegan had given shailiha a change of hair color from blond to black a simple plaid peasants dress replaced her gown these changes in appearance were the results of new craft calculations the old wizard had been trying to achieve but the calculations were still limited in scope as were their applications thinking back to the day of krassus attack tristan scowled not only had the traitorous wizard invaded the palace with ease but his doing so had resulted in several amazing revelations over the past three days wigg and faegan had adamantly refused to elaborate on these mysteries that would be like them to hold back information at least until they had figured out more of the pieces to the puzzle but tristan sensed there were other reasons for the crusty wizards silence and if wigg wouldnt talk perhaps faegan now wouldespecially since the lead wizard wasnt here to listen tristan stretched out one leg to nudge faegans foot faegan he said gently are you awake of course the master wizard answered rather sourly his eyes still closed bouncing along in one of these contraptions thousands of feet in the air who could possibly be asleep looking at shailiha tristan grinned i have a question for you he said to the wizard faegan sighed what is it he asked grumpily the ancient graygreen eyes remained closed are partials endowed tristan asked i always thought that people were either endowed or they werent faegans left eye suddenly opened to stare directly at the prince with another sigh he opened the other eye and sat up shaking off his previous thoughts taking a deep breath he raised his arms and stretched his back its not that simple he said with a smile and i suppose that without wigg here to castigate me you expect to hear all about it dont you tristan grinned realizing that faegan was about to give him at least some of his answersif for no other reason than to eventually annoy the lead wizard partials are not endowed in the classic sense faegan answered but given the proper training some of the more powerful of them can perform certain acts that unendowed persons cannot such as shailiha asked skills such as blazegazing or being able to force someone to reveal the truth even against his or her will healing or causing illness also it is rumored that some could perform several arcane forms of beastmastery all of these talents require the use of some form of organic life such as that which comes from the ground or the water the most gifted of them often became what we called herbmasters or herbmistresses using specific combinations of plants herbs and oils to refine and strengthen their craft even further most wizards had little to fear from them as partial adeptsas we called those partials who practiced the craftwere not particularly powerful but why would a partials gifts be limited to only certain aspects of the craft shailiha asked that doesnt make sense to me i can understand your confusion faegan replied as is true with so many things of magic the answer has to do with the paragon he held the squarecut bloodred stone up for inspection if you were to count the facets of the surface of the paragon you would find there to be twentyfive in all he told her just as there are twentyfive major facets of the craft such as the kinetic the sympathetic and the formative the facet for example allows the practitioner certain dynamic uses of the craft such as the throwing of azure bolts the sympathetic facet allows the user certain gifts associated with sound touch and vibration and as you might well guess the formative facet has to do with the conjuring and altering of thingsor their disappearance these are but three of the twentyfive neither tristan nor shailiha had ever heard this and it put the paragon in an entirely new light how do you know all of this shailiha asked this information came to us from the preface to the tome faegan answered the ones who came before constructed the jewel as the living passageway between endowed blood and the orbs of the vigors and the vagariesthe two fountainheads of all that is the craft the twentyfive facets that the ones cut into the stone represent what they considered to be the most important disciplines of the craft but that still doesnt explain why a partial adepts gifts are limited and vice versa tristan pressed that is because the ones granted those of fully endowed blood sole access to all of the facets save for one faegan told them the arts of that one facet are divided between those of fully endowed blood and the partials what is that facet called tristan asked the organic faegan answered and what aspects of the craft does the organic facet control shailiha asked those arts that are made possible only through the use of such organics as herbs oils plants water and so on faegan explained these arts have the greatest effect of all on the plant life water and air of the world the ones who came before channeled some of the arts of the organic into the weaker blood signatures of the partials and the rest into the blood of the fully endowed a wizard has access to a far greater number of skills and has much greater power but partial adepts have access to some organic skills that we do not but why would the ones do that tristan asked wouldnt they want the fully endowed to have all the gifts so that they could be used to their greatest advantage enabling one group to employ all of the arts of the organic discipline to their utmost was precisely what the ones were trying to avoid the wizard said but you still havent answered why shailiha pressed it seems that what the ones wanted most second only to the preservation of the craft was to prevent any future recurrence of their war with the heretics of the guild the preface to the tome tells us that during their war of attrition as they called it vast areas of the world became scorched and lifeless if they couldnt preserve the land air and sea for future generations humankind ran the risk of becoming extinct he paused for a moment in thought people are replaceable i suppose should one care to characterize things in such a manner he went on as their litter continued to bounce along through the air but the earth we walk upon the water we drink and the air we breathe is not and without them we would soon perish taking the craft with us for in the final analysis our endowed blood is the ultimate resting place of the craft and our lives the instruments by which it is passed down through the generations thereby making it timeless that is why the ones devised the organic facet of the paragon the way they did gifting some of the most dangerous of these arts only to those of partial blood that way they hoped no one would ever be able to use them again in a manner that was so destructive but if these organic gifts are so potentially destructive why allow them to be used at all shailiha asked because their potential to be used for good is just as strong faegan answered if all these aspects of the craft had not been preserved knowledge of them would have died with the ones even now we have no way of knowing how many of their arts may have vanished with the ones passing from the world suddenly something faegan had said earlier began gnawing at the back of the princes mind what is a blazegazer he asked faegan pursed his lips a blazegazer is a partial adept who is able to use herbs to see events that are occurring some distance away or so goes the myth that art is said to be very rare and almost always the province of women rather than men can you blazegaze shailiha asked no faegan answered testily true to form he was becoming irritable at the questioning of his abilities nor can any other wizard i have ever knownincluding wigg i would love to learn to blazegaze but it is doubtful that a partial adept would ever share such knowledge with an outsider or even that the paragon would allow me that skill and krassus now travels with a partial adept tristan mused or at least he claims to yes faegan agreed if what he said is true that does not bode well for any of us krassus said that wigg knows one shailiha commented and the lead wizard became very defensive when we asked him about it could it be true faegan raised an eyebrow first of all it is wiggs nature to be defensive he said you know how secretive he can be when he does not wish to speak about a subject even wild mules cant pull the words out of him a bit more somber now faegan looked out the window again you know part of what krassus said is quite valid he mused what part tristan asked he said that although i am the greatest keeper of the craft wigg is the greatest keeper of secrets faegan said softly that is so true when thinking of wigg always remember that he has survived over three centuries in the maze of politics and magic that is eutracia the things he has seen and the secrets he still keeps may well be uncountable tristan sat back in the seat thinking something wigg had told them that day still haunted him is it true he asked the ancient wizard would wigg have really done it would he do it still do what faegan asked would he truly kill wulfgar should our brother be found and his leftleaning blood signature induce him to the vagaries faegans expression darkened removing his hands from the opposite sleeves of his robes he leaned forward would wigg obey the orders of a dead queen and kill your half sibling in order to protect the craft or for that matter would i and even more importantly would the two of you let us or could you stop us should you choose to try his graygreen eyes narrowed those very thoughts have consumed my mind ever since krassus revealed himself to us the wizard said all i know right now is that we must find wulfgar before he does or none of it will matter not to mention these scrolls he searches for suddenly there came a harsh insistent pounding upon the side of the litter ox stuck his head out the window speak he ordered the minion officer flying close by farpoint approaches sir the minion shouted you ordered us to let you know when we neared ox looked back questioningly at tristan tell him they should land us about one quarter league from the outskirts of the city the prince ordered place us down in the woods if possible we must not be seen i live to serve ox replied and shouted tristans orders to his warriors the litter began to tilt downward faegans manner suddenly became even more serious it was only after much discussion that wigg and i agreed to let you come here he said in truth i doubt we could have stopped you anyway short of using a wizards warp on you both but that doesnt mean that we think this is a good idea if it is to be done it will be done our way i have not visited farpoint for many years but i remember it as an exceedingly rough place eutracian fishing towns always are tristan i want you to push my chair for me if questioned you are to say that you are my bodyguard and my ward shailiha you are to pretend to be my nurse remember we are here only to observe not to participate he pursed his lips one other thing he said sounding solemn tristan should anything untoward happen i want you to employ your skills to protect us rather than my resorting to the use of the craft i dont want anyone here to know i am a wizard unless it becomes absolutely necessary for all we know krassus may even be here he has already sworn to kill wigg and me at the very least he is probably expecting us to take the bait by simply coming here therefore i will be cloaking our endowed blooda job that because of the combined exceedingly high quality of our blood shall take a great deal of effort only in the direst of circumstances will i drop the cloak and employ the craft otherwise it is your duty to protect us and let me do the talking the first thing i want to do is to find a carriage for hire it will be faster and safer than walking the streets do you understand both the chosen ones nodded faegan sighed and shook his head then may the afterlife watch over us the six minion warriors gently landed the litter in a small glade surrounded by fir trees then the other six landed dreggans drawn and formed a protective ring the four occupants descended from the litter and onto the soft grass of the forest the minions handling the wizards chair for him stay here out of sight tristan ordered ox it was plain to see by the look on the warriors face that he was severely disappointed not to be coming along sorry my friend the prince said with a smile but your presence in farpoint would cause a commotion to say the least light no fires and send no sentries into the sky as you normally would do however post guards in the woods if you are found and must defend your lives do so but if your attackers are simple townsfolk try to subdue them rather than kill them i do not know how long we may be gone but wait for us there is food and water stored in the litter ox clicked the heels of his boots together i live to serve tristan nodded back with that he and shailiha grasped faegans chair and began wheeling him out of the forest pushing the wooden chair through the thick undergrowth was very difficult faegan could have levitated it of course but they could not risk being spotted using the craft at last they came upon a hardscrabble road which was smooth enough that tristan could manage the chair without shailihas help tristan longed to have pilgrim his dappled grayandwhite stallion beneath him but it was also good to stretch his legs especially after the hours aboard the flying litter the prince had made several official visits to farpoint when his father and mother were alive and he had to agree with faegan that the fishing town was a roughandtumble place the seafaring folk were a stern tough and uncompromising lot they worked hard and when they returned to town with their clothes full of the stink of fish and their pockets full of gold coins they drank too much gambled too much and fought too much it was not much longer until they entered the outskirts of the city and tristan with shailiha at his side wheeled faegans chair down one of the streets he felt would most likely provide adequate livery service his magically acquired beard itched several empty hansom cabs stood waiting on one side of the wide cobblestoned boulevard tristan wheeled faegan toward the first of them and the old wizard turned his graygreen eyes up to the man sitting atop it good day he said politely are you for hire i dont be sittin up here for my health cripple the driver snarled back he spat narrowly missing the wizards feet faegan remained unperturbed how much he asked how far the driver countered his careful eyes examining the old man in the wheeled chair faegan took a slow breath we heard there is to be some special activity here today he said then he winked conspiratorially up at the driver when the driver remained silent faegan pressed you know the kind of activity i mean and we have money to spend but we are new here and we do not know the way now will you take us there or do we have to go to one of your competitors blatantly craning his neck to look over at the next carriage faegan conjured some kisathe gold coin of the realminto one of his robe pockets reaching in he jangled them together loudly scowling the driver rubbed the saltandpepper grizzle on his chin then looking down from his seat he gestured toward tristan except for that nastylooking bastard with the sword and the knives you dont look like the usual lot who goes there he said cautiously not only that but if the two younger ones know whats good for em they wont go there at all the white ones will be there ya know this piqued faegans interest how much he demanded all right all right the driver said dont get your robe in a twist twelve kisa should do it six faegan countered eight the driver hollered down done the wizard said get aboard the driver sighed reaching for his whip it was abundantly clear from his posture that helping faegan in was not going to be part of the bargain tristan opened the hansom door and helped shailiha in then walked around to the back of the coach he was dismayed to see that there was no storage compartment large enough for faegans chair and no way to secure it on top of the carriage go ahead faegan said giving tristan a wink youre strong enough i know you can do it smiling the prince suddenly understood reaching down he grabbed the chair wizard and all just as the driver finally decided to come down from atop his seat to berate them for taking so long the man approached just in time to see tristan smoothly effortlessly lift both the wizard and chair and place them through the open door of the coach as though they weighed no more than a feather the drivers eyes went wide his grizzled jaw dropping with disbelief how in the name of the afterlife did you do that as tristan climbed into the carriage faegan poked his head out the window as i said hes very strong he winked mischievously scratching his head the bewildered driver clambered back atop the carriage with a whistle to his horses and a snap of his whip the coach started rumbling down the streets of farpoint despite the danger of their situation both tristan and shailiha began to laugh hes very strong tristan asked the wizard i thought you werent going to use the craft i couldnt resist faegan chuckled the driver deserved it after all he put me through i sensed no endowed blood nearby so i dropped our cloak momentarily we had to get me into the carriage somehow didnt we besides what is the good of being a wizard if you cant have some fun once in a while he cackled gleefully shaking his head and turning to look at his sister tristan had to laugh again traveling with faegan was certainly different from traveling with the lead wizard looking out the carriage window faegan grew more serious pay close attention as we go down the streets he ordered if you notice anything unusualanything at alltell me right away remember we still do not know where we are going or what we will find when we get there faegan who are the white ones the driver spoke of shailiha asked he seemed to fear them faegan shook his head i have been wondering the same thing he replied tristan looked out the window of the carriage there were few people on the streets for this time of the day he mused perhaps that was due to the fact that they were still on the outskirts of the city at first that seemed to be the answer as they continued farther into town he began to see the usual smattering of elderly and middleaged people going about their business there were children too and the usual groupings of teenagers but then he began to notice something else and his blood ran cold the city seemed to be completely devoid of people his own age the longer he looked the surer he became he saw no one who looked to be between the years of twenty to forty seasons of new life he told himself he was imagining things that as they continued on hed certainly start to see more people of all ages but he didnt then he noticed something else most of the people he saw seemed weary and downtrodden some were even sobbing it was as if some great pall had descended over the town he looked over at faegan do you see it he asked quietly or am i dreaming faegan looked somber this is no dream he replied something dark has come over this place and we must find out what it is he thought for a moment then he spoke again tristan i want you to go up and sit with the driver he probably wont be happy about it but be cordial try to get as much information out of him as you can without raising his suspicions if you see anything untoward return at once and inform me tristan nodded after giving shailiha a reassuring pat on the hand he swung open the door and quickly hoisted himself up onto the drivers bench surprised the grizzled driver glared at him what do you think youre doing he snapped you shouldnt be up hereespecially not now for the life of me i cant understand why you and the girl would want to do this hasnt the old cripple told you whats going on here is he insane or just stupid he spat down loudly into the passing gutter tristan grinned the old one doesnt tell us a lot he answered the sick old fool only hired me for my sword the woman is his nurse truth be told i dont know why were here either he let several precious seconds go by then he put on his most innocent expression and asked why dont you tell me whats going on here as if finally willing to answer tristans question the driver turned to him but just then something seemed to catch his eye drawing a quick breath he pulled the team of horses up short the carriage came to an abrupt stop raising a finger the driver pointed to a corner down the street do you see them he whispered his hands shook his face was blanched with fear snapping his head around to look tristan caught sight of several strangelooking figures walking hurriedly away they were tall with white almost translucent skinbut that was all he could make of them before they rounded the corner and vanished from sight demonslavers the driver whispered so quietly that tristan barely heard him what tristan asked the mans obvious terror was unnerving this is as far as i go the driver shouted jumping down from his seat everybody out running around to the side of the carriage he violently jerked the door open grabbed shailihas arm and literally pulled her out by the time tristan got there the man was screaming at faegan ordering him to get out very well very well faegan shouted back he looked at tristan if you would he said understanding tristan reached in retrieving the old one and his chair the same way he had placed them inside but this time the driver didnt care about tristans supposedly amazing feat of strength all he wanted was to leave and quickly if you value your lives go back to wherever you came from and forget this place he shouted frantically no power in the world can help this accursed town if you remain foolish enough to carry on with this madness the place you are searching for is the docks but you would be insane to go there he climbed back into the carriage seat as fast as he could with a crack of his whip he wheeled his team around and if you know whats good for them youll get those two off the street before its too late he hollered at faegan while pointing to tristan and his sister with another lash from his whip he charged his team back down the way they had come the horses hooves colliding noisily with the cobblestones in mere moments he was gone what do we do now tristan asked the wizard a crowd had started to form some of the onlookers were staring oddly at the prince and shailiha as if they werent human some started pointing many of them seemed to be angry the last thing we need is attention faegan whispered urgently for the time being well get off the street any of these shops will do i suggest we hurry tristan saw a storefront with a sign in the shape of a mortar and pestle the sign said apothecarydrugs and compounds swiftly he wheeled faegans chair around and with shailiha made for the door the double doors closed behind them with finality a little bell at their top happily announcing the fact that the shops proprietor had customers tristan looked around they seemed to be the only people in here the shop was quite large lined with shelves and littered with tables all filled with multicolored bottles and jars everything was covered with a layer of dust as if the merchandise hadnt been touched for years a long counter stretched from wall to wall at the far end with yet more wall cabinets behind it a massive circular oak chandelier hung by a rope over the center of the floor the rope ran through a pulley in the ceiling and on to a hook attached to the far wall a system that allowed for the raising and lowering of the fixture for the filling of its oil sconces the chandelier was not lit there was no sign of the proprietor the place smelled of dust lack of use and countless exotic compounds wheeling himself up to one of the tables faegan picked up a bottle and examined it removing the cork he smelled the contents his eyes lit up ground blossom of rapturegrass he cackled triumphantly smacking one hand flat upon the arm of his chair id stake my life on it he appeared to be quite delighted i havent seen this for decades he held the bottle up for tristan and shailiha to see good for the libido he added with a wink with a sigh and a slight shake of his head tristan looked over at his sister she was watching faegan with an expression of disbelief as one corner of his mouth came up tristan reminded himself that she was not as familiar with the wizards eccentricities as he was faegan tristan asked have you ever heard of something called a demonslaver a what faegan asked his full attention firmly locked upon the prince then tristan heard someone clear his throat may i be of assistance a different voice suddenly said turning tristan shailiha and faegan looked behind the counter to see a thin ruddyfaced man wearing wire spectacles that seemed far too large for him watching him push the spectacles back up the sweaty bridge of his nose only to see them slide back down again tristan guessed that the automatic gesture had become a lifelong habit the shopkeeper wore an apron covered with multicolored dust and he appeared unusually nervous but when he saw the faces of the prince and princess he turned absolutely white get out he shouted immediately you shouldnt be here i dont want any trouble nor do we tristan said courteously taking a single step toward the counter all we want are the answers to a few simple the twin doors to the shop suddenly blew open with such force that they banged into the walls beside them their etchedglass windows shattered cascading to the floor in thousands of shards of prismed light moving instinctively tristan whirled around reaching behind his back and drawing his dreggan the ring of its razorsharp blade resounded through the musty air of the shop there were five of them and they were something out of a nightmare the only way they seemed to differ from one another was in the various weapons they carried in addition to swords one of them carried a whip another a trident black leather skirts slit down the front for walking fell from their waists to the floor their chests and shoulders were bare their fingers ended in talons rather than fingernails bright red capes cascaded down their backs short swords hung low behind their backs almost to their knees tristans experienced eye took quick note of the unique way the baldrics were hung immediately sensing the ease and speed with which the things would be able to draw their swords but it was their faces that were most unsettling their skin was pure whitealmost translucentand seemed to shine polished metal caps covered their skulls and swept around their eyes and ears the ears were long pointed things with earrings dangling from some of them their white opaque eyes held no irises but somehow seemed never to miss a thing tristans heart pounded in his chest and his right hand tightened around the hilt of his dreggan he heard the shopkeeper scream followed by the sound of running and the slamming of a door the prince knew better than to turn and watch the man run away he sized up the situation and his heart fell he had never before faced five at once he thought nervously faegan wheeled his chair slowly toward the counter shailiha walked behind tristan and over toward the far wall what do you want tristan barked go away and leave us in peace two of the monsters walked closer we want you one of them said as he approached you and the woman we do not require the old man in the chair the monster smiled showing dark pointed teeth i dont think so tristan growled he raised the tip of his sword a fraction in a blindingly fast motion the other creature drew his sword it was the quickest use of a blade tristan had ever seen had his dreggan not already been drawn he would surely have died on the spot the two gleaming blades clanged together with a force so powerful they sent sparks flying as was his habit tristan quickly backed off trying to gain some maneuvering room but suddenly he stopped realizing that he did not want to bring his attacker any closer to shailiha than he must he began hacking viciously at his foe but the monster was as skilled as he was and he could find no opening then at last he saw the chance he had hoped for teeth bared his opponent suddenly screamed and rushed forward his short sword raised high over his head his intention was clear to strike straight downward cleaving tristans skull just as the thing reached the zenith of his swing tristan rushed dangerously in and reached up grabbing his attackers sword wrist and during the split second in which he held the monsters blade in place he shoved the point of the dreggan to the things throat angling it up he pressed the hidden button in the dreggans hilt and the blade shot forward the extra foot entering just beneath the point of the things jaw and exiting the top of the head the monster died immediately pressing the button again tristan retracted the blade and pushed the body off him enraged the second of them drew his sword as surely as had the first and with a scream he rushed at the prince but this time tristan had the distance he needed without hesitation he tossed the heavy dreggan from his right hand over into his left reaching back he gripped the handle of his first throwing knife with a whirl of his arm the blade twirled unerringly toward its target and buried itself in the center of the things forehead with a sickening thud stopping him in midstride stunned the attacker simply stood as a trail of bright red blood snaked its sure silent way down over his damaged skullcap and onto his white face as if trapped in some impossible dream the creature ran his fingers through it then blankly examined it before staring back up at the prince his sword slipped from his fingers and clanged noisily to the floor the white eyes closed and he fell over onto his back dead chest heaving tristan glared at the remaining three he tossed the dreggan back into his right hand and his fingers tightened around the hilt he didnt have to wait very long suddenly the huge oak chandelier came crashing down in a cacophony of noise glass and lamp oil it smashed directly onto the heads of the three wouldbe attackers all three collapsed as glass shattered and oil spilled as the long rope pooled atop the mess blood mixed strangely with the oil and ran across the floor and into the cracks between the floorboards tristan hesitated in shock for an instant then rushed in and ran each body through two were already dead and the third could not have been far from ithis neck lay at an odd angle clearly broken and he was unable to breathe tristans blade was a blessing once done tristan turned and his eyes went wide shailiha had untied the rope holding up the chandelier letting out a great sigh of relief tristan uncoiled shailiha arms akimbo stared intently at the beings she had just killed this was the first time she had ever taken a life tristan realized as he went to her the moment he put his arms around her she dropped her defiant stance are you all right he asked gently as he looked into her eyes yes her voice was strong and calm she looked past tristans shoulder at the bodies lying beneath the chandelier faegan had wheeled his chair over to the tangled mess to examine the creatures and just what were you prepared to do while all of this was going on tristan growled at the wizard raising a skeptical eyebrow after you killed the first two even i doubted you could have handled the next three all at once faegan said with a smile i was of course prepared to use the craft to help you but then i saw the princess had other plans what in the name of the afterlife are these things tristan asked walking over he reached down and wiped the blade of his dreggan clean with one of the victims black leather skirts satisfied he slid the sword back into its scabbard then he retrieved his throwing knife and repeated the process with it shailiha walked up behind him and took his hand i have never seen anything like them she said quietly do you remember your question to me about the demonslavers faegan asked his eyes alight with curiosity well i think you have just found your answer but where do they come from and why did they want us asked shailiha they are without question some product of the vagaries faegan answered seriously but as to how they were produced or who they may have originally been i cannot say they may be mutated wizards as are the blood stalkers or perhaps they are something else entirely only time will tell these beings may have been hunting under krassus orders he did after all literally dare us to come here to see what was taking place he paused rubbing his chin i fear though that we may have only scratched the surface of our troubles what do we do now shailiha asked first faegan answered tristan needs to drag the bodies out back and hide them behind the shop we have been fortunate but i believe we have yet to see whatever it is krassus taunted us about we must still make our way to the docksthe roughest part of all farpoint were within walking distance tristan we leave as soon as you have finished chapter eight a re you quite certain you should be doing this father celeste asked nervously wigg stepped over another fallen log as he made his way carefully through the forest yes my dear he answered patiently i am quite all right truth be known he loved the way she looked after him he smiled as he realized just how long it had been since anyone had taken care of him more than three centuries he stopped for a moment to get his bearings an equal number of years had passed since he had visited this section of the hartwick woods and he wanted to be sure of his way walking up beside him celeste took her fathers hand just the same lets rest for a moment she suggested softly looking around wigg saw a small clearing and headed for it they sat in the shade of a hibernium tree as was the old wizards custom he picked a blade of grass and began shredding it with his long elegant fingers the day was still young the sun just rising above the tops of the trees as they swayed gently back and forth in the wind the dark green grass was soft and fresh as were so many of the living things now bursting forth from the season of new life the songs of the birds made a comforting familiar background refrain wigg turned to look at his daughterthe daughter he had only so recently found he loved her more than his life and would do anything to protect her although she seemed outwardly normal celeste was just beginning to come to grips with all that she had been forced to endure he had spent hours discussing the matter with faegan who had sadly agreed that no matter how intelligent or how high the quality of her endowed blood celeste would need a great deal of care and guidance to set things right if indeed they ever could be both wigg and faegan had a great deal of collective knowledge regarding such psychosexual trauma for they had witnessed firsthand the various abuses of the coven during the sorceresses war of three centuries earlier but this was different this time the victim had been the lead wizards only child and his stake in her healing was acutely personal lying down in the soft grass celeste closed her eyes shawna the short had wisely seen to it that her gown and slippers were replaced with attire more suitable for walking through the forest a brown leather jerkin over a closefitting blouse of black silk with sleeves that gathered at the wrists trunk hose rose to just above her knees and she wore soft brown knee boots her dark red hair spread out upon the ground like a luxurious fan looking at her wigg could easily pick out the fine features she had inherited from her mother failee no matter what she wore or how distressed she became her beauty always shone through the old one thought in that way she was much like shailiha yet in so many ways she was also very different suddenly forced to wipe away a tear he continued to contemplate the various psychological stages of healing the young woman would be forced to endure she was in denial he knew and this very uncertain mental stage would presumably be followed by others eventually would come her anger then her eventual acceptance of what had been done to her and finally if she was lucky a form of personal resolution would befall her truly allowing her to lead a relatively normal life out in the world his thoughts floated back to three days earlier when krassus had so suddenly appeared the rogue wizard had said many things that stunned wigg that day but none so much as his reference to the partial adept living here in these woods and his mention of having visited her wigg had no doubt that krassus motives for doing so could certainly not have been harmless the lead wizard had spent the last three days in bed thinking and trying to regain his strength before finally deciding to venture into hartwick the minion litter and armed guard of winged warriors that had transported him and celeste waited patiently just to the north wigg sighed he had come because he knew in his heart he needed to see this person from his pastif indeed she still lived celeste stirred coming up on one elbow you still havent told me why were here she said smiling at him we have come to see someone he told her who he pursed his lips someone i knew a long time agosomeone krassus referred to that day when he appeared to us in the game room a woman i was friendly with just after the sorceresses war for several moments he explained to her the world of the partial adepts just as faegan had done for tristan and shailiha he also went on to discuss how their kind had for better or worse been banished by the directorate both the women and the men when he finished celestes sapphire eyes were alight with curiosity but why did you bring me with you father she asked sitting upright she wrapped her hands around her raised knees and placed her chin upon them you know how much i love to be with you but wouldnt you have preferred to see her alone especially after all these years if she still lives i want her to meet you he answered and truth be known you and i have had precious little chance to be alone besides if there is anyone in the world i would wish to share this encounter with it is you deciding to change the subject wigg selected another blade of grass to worry you care for tristan very much dont you he asked at her fathers blunt unexpected question celeste blushed then the rose of her cheeks faded and her expression became more somber perhaps even bordering on mild confusion i care for all of you she answered simply you know that gently grasping her chin wigg turned her face to his but you care for the prince in a different way than you do for the rest of us do you not he asked softly celeste lowered her eyes i would like to she said hesitantly she tilted her head slightly as if in pain not knowing how much her next words would sear her fathers heart she was trembling and tears came to her eyes yes i would like to care for him but you see i really dont know how she whispered so softly he could barely hear her grasping her shoulders wigg pulled her close i know he answered for a long time they sat that way in the grass simply holding each other the father who had never known he had a daughter and the daughter who had never learned how to love finally celeste lifted her face she looked across the glade alert head cocked narrowing her eyes she asked tell me father do you hear that of course he smiled i first heard it when we sat down i have wizards ears remember what is it across the clearing a swarm of bees anxiously tended a massive comb nested in the crook of a tree branch each of the bees was at least the size of a mans fist as they swirled and danced in the air the familiar greenandpurple striping upon their backs was highlighted by the climbing sun theyre eutracian honeybees he said smiling again theyre protecting their hive they are usually not dangerous so long as they are left alone whats honey she asked realizing anew just how many things celeste had not experienced that the rest of the world took for granted he leaned in conspiratorially watch he whispered his right hand came up as she watched an azure glow began to form around the comb trapping the bees inside they started buzzing even more furiously then a nearby dried branch on the grassy floor of the glade rose to penetrate one of the openings in the comb it withdrew then one end covered with a sticky ambercolored substance that dripped lazily to the ground then the branch slowly coasted across the clearing coming to rest patiently in the air before them the glow surrounding the comb slowly began to dissipate finally vanishing altogether the honeybees went about the business of repairing the rent in the comb wigg grasped the clean end of the branch and held the sticky end out to her taste it he said with a smile really she asked her eyes alight with curiosity is it good still holding the branch wigg made a mocking little bow and chuckled on my honor as lead wizard of the directorate celeste took the branch and tentatively touched her tongue to the honey her face lit up i have never tasted anything so wonderful she exclaimed brightly enjoying the moment the lead wizard smiled but it was that single innocent action that would cause celestes world and the world of her father to be changed forever celeste dropped the branch and gripped her throat shaking violently she convulsed into wiggs arms her hands reaching up to his face in a pitiful beseeching gesture of helplessness the lead wizard was stunned unsure of what to do or of what could be causing such a violent reaction he narrowed his eyes about to use the craft in an attempt to relieve her suffering but he never got the chance the sound of snapping branches startled him and he looked up from the face of his struggling daughter to see the tall grasses across the glade gently slowly part then a large bulky form emerged from the woods wigg froze and a shiver went down his spine he heard a soft menacing growl a large sandy creature walking on all fours gracefully stepped from the edge of the clearing not far from the swarming honeybees it glared at wigg with yellow eyes as he tried to quiet his stricken daughter lifting its head the beast flared its nostrils testing the air then it leveled its deadly gaze once more at wigg and celeste and snarled again this time more loudly it was a sabertoothed bear the vicious creatures had roamed eutracia for centuries they resembled an odd cross between a bear and a lion two long upper fangs ran well down below the lower jaw a bearlike face snout ears and intense yellow eyes made up the head the leonine body had padded feet with long pointed claws the long slim tail ended in a small ball of fur the mottled tanandblack hide had long been prized by eutracian huntersprovided they lived to tell the tale few did unlike many other creatures of these woods many of the sabertooths were maneatersan acquired not natural taste once one had devoured the meat of a human beingusually out of desperationit rarely if ever returned to its previous feeding habits its heightened sense of smell and unusually keen eyesight were legendary this one was clearly a male by far the heavier but not necessarily the deadlier of the two sexes it seemed clear that this sabertooth had already feasted upon humans at least once and wished to do so again and then quite unexpectedly the sabertooths mate quietly smoothly appeared at the opposite side of the glade she padded silently to a spot just inside the circle and crouched in the grass her long muscles clenched her hungry yellow eyes missed nothing wigg held his breath trying to remain as still as possible with the struggling celeste in his lap he had heard tales of unarmed woodsmen who had come upon these beasts only to remain stockstill and have them blessedly saunter away but now with the female squarely at the opposite end of the clearing wigg knew that his luck had run out he had heard enough about them to know that first the male would attack grasping his victim in his jaws then the female would rush in from the opposite direction to deliver the deathbloweither with a powerful swipe of her claws or by impaling the prey on her curved white fangs after that their prize secure the leisurely feasting would go on for a long time then the sudden realization hit him it was the honey that had brought them what an idiot he had been to break open the comb if they were to have any chance of surviving this he must act immediately it was highly unlikely he could kill both animals even using the craft he wouldnt have the time standing and sliding celeste down to the grass behind him he cautiously raised his right hand toward the male the sabertooth charged bounding across the field its teeth exposed in a vicious snarl the monster leapt into the air wigg loosed an azure bolt from his hand it struck the creature squarely in the forehead with a loud crack the sabertooths skull parted dead he crashed to the earth just feet from where the wizard stood wigg whirled around robes flying and raised his arm again but the female was already on the move he was too late suddenly several azure bolts came soaring out of nowhere crashing into the female sabertooth they were the most brilliant powerful beams wigg had ever seen striking the beast almost simultaneously they literally ripped her apart her head exploded her legs were severed from her body and then her torso blew apart blood and innards flying across the field what was left of the creature skidded sloppily to a stop less than a meter from his boots whirling around again wigg looked to see who had commanded such awesome power his jaw dropped it was celeste she stood before him swaying with a strange determined look on her face her sapphire eyes had rolled up into their sockets her skin was pale her body shaking the fingertips of her right hand were scorched and black smoke was rising from them drifting away on the morning breeze she took a single weak step forward father and then she collapsed wigg scooped her up in his arms and began running back into the forest as fast as he could in search of the one person he hoped might be able to help chapter nine b y the time tristan had hidden the dead demonslavers in the alley behind the apothecary shop and the three travelers were ready to go on the streets seemed even more deserted the few people who did venture out glared and pointed at the prince and his sister as if the two of them had no right to be any part of the citys population faegan searched out a clothing shop and leaving tristan and shailiha waiting in the shadows of a nearby alley went in alone to purchase two hooded robes to cover the bodies and heads of the chosen ones not perfect disguises but the best he could do without the aid of the craft tristan worried that the robe covered his weapons making it nearly impossible for him to grasp them quickly but he kept his concerns to himself there seemed little other choice they then proceeded to a stable where faegan was forced to pay the suspicious stablemaster handsomely for three rundown horses a dilapidated cart and extra tack tristan harnessed one of the mounts to the cart and hoisted faegan atop its seat and at last the three of them made their way to the harbor area of farpoint although the sun was beginning to set the docks were alive with people a large crowd had gathered here and it was clear they were eagerly waiting for something to happen the air was full of the smells of salty sea air and freshly caught fish tristan slid off the swaybacked roan mare and as shailiha dismounted her aged gelding he went around to the back of the cart and got out faegans chair shailiha held the chair while tristan lifted faegan from the buckboard seat and got him settled then he turned to study the inn where faegan had directed them to stop many of its shutters were broken and peeling from the constant exposure to the strong salty winds some of the windows were cracked and the steps to the lobby were in disrepair the place had clearly seen better days why are we stopping here shailiha asked she was eager to get to the oceanfront the carriage driver said we needed to get to the docks cant we just quietly wend our way through the crowd no faegan answered adamantly as he looked around this inn is perfect for what i have in mindthe kind of place where few questions will be asked besides krassus may be near not to mention more of the demonslavers tristan i want you to go around back and tell me what you find in particular i want to know whether there is any way up to the roof and a secure place where we might tie the horses tristan nodded after a smile to his sister he was gone the alley behind the inn was inconspicuous enough with the usual iron rings embedded in the buildings rear wall to secure bridle reins several mounts were already tied there telling the prince that the shopworn inn had at least a few customers an iron fire ladder reached from the ground all the way to the roof with platforms at each of the inns four levels backing farther into the shadows tristan observed the inn quietly branding the scene into his memory finally satisfied he returned to the street bridle rings and a ladder he said quietly to the wizard does the ladder go all the way to the roof faegan asked yes and does the roof appear to be flat from what i could see yes good faegan answered tristan and shailiha could see mischief coming to the ancient wizards eyes as his plan continued to form i want you and shailiha to walk the three horses around back he said leave your two saddled unharness the cart and put it to one side take the extra saddle and bridle from the cart and put them on my horse tie all the horses to the wall then return do it quickly tristan and shailiha carried out the wizards orders as swiftly as they could then returned to the front of the inn is it done faegan asked tristan nodded very well the wizard said follow me into the inn whatever you do do not lower your hoods stay quiet and follow my lead try to act as though you do not exist he pointed to one of the loose boards of the inn steps tristan if you would he asked understanding the prince reached down to tear the wide loose board away from its few remaining nails then inclined it against the steps of the inn it made a serviceable ramp after briefly testing its strength he wheeled faegans chair up and through the door into the lobby shailiha right behind inside the inn was dingy dark and unappealing the large front room held several chairs tables and a long bar with a mirror behind it sullenlooking men some obviously fishermen sat hunched over the tables and bar drinking quietly several scantily dressed women walked among the tables flirting with the men for hire no doubt tristan thought with a slight shake of his head the thin greasylooking man tristan took to be the innkeeper sat at a small desk in one corner making notes in a bound ledger a tankard sat before him he did not look up indeed no one took any great notice of the newcomers at all save for a few furtive curious glances at faegans chair with a smile the wizard calmly wheeled himself toward the proprietor three rooms please faegan said politely the man looked up from his arithmetic his eyes were dark and distrustful the only rooms i have left are on the top floor he said rudely but taking you up and down the stairs isnt included in the rent some of the customers laughed aloud faegan graciously ignored the insult thank you for your worry but my bodyguard will take care of that hes quite used to it in fact now then how much how many nights the innkeeper asked he took a sloppy gulp of stalesmelling ale then set the tankard back down on the desk letting go a wet belch he wiped his mouth with a stained gartered shirtsleeve three rooms one night each faegan answered twelve kisa the man replied fourth floor the washing facilities are at the end of the hall take it or leave it twelve kisa was a steep price for such a place tristan thought but clearly faegan thought it better not to bargain reaching into his robes the wizard took out the necessary kisa and dropped them on the desk after counting them the innkeeper produced three keys which he handed over to the wizard saying nothing more faegan turned his chair to the stairs tristan and shailiha following behind at the foot of the steps tristan leaned in putting his lips to the wizards ear are you joking he growled quietly four flights of stairs no faegan smiled actually im hoping there will be five looking over to shailiha he gave her a wink she smiled back quizzically what do you mean five tristan argued we have no friends here and this is no time for a debate faegan answered urgently lets go sighing tristan began pulling the wizards chair backward up the steps after what seemed an eternity they finally reached the fourth floor tristan looked around cautiously nothing seemed amiss what are our room numbers shailiha asked faegan as tristan leaned over breathing heavily from exhaustion we wont be using the rooms faegan smiled and looked up at the ceiling that was just for show before either of the chosen ones could ask the obvious question the wizard found what he was looking for in the middle of the ceiling was a wooden framework from which hung a rope ending in a pull handle faegan wheeled himself to the rope and gave it a tug stairs to the roof slowly descended on a pivot revealing the first stars of the evening twinkling through the opening faegan grinned at the prince as i told you there are five he said impishly but again you must pull me up without my using the craft there might still be people about tristan nodded with a determined grip he pushed the chair to the stairs and with some help from shailiha below managed to pull it up and onto the roof shailiha scrambled up behind them then pulled the duplicate rope on the other side wisely lifting the pivoting stairway back into place the gray slate roof was large and flat the wind had risen and the smell of the sea came to them again from here the prince could see much of the city the flickering streetlamps casting macabre dancing shadows along the sides of the buildings and down the cobblestoned thoroughfares quickly tristan faegan whispered lift me from my chair and put me down by the east edge of the roof then both of you come and lie next to me one on either side tristan did as the wizard ordered and faegan lay on his stomach peering over the edge toward the docks tristan and shailiha lay down beside him down on the stone piers that formed the breakwater to the sea hundreds of people were milling anxiously aboutthree large ships their sails furled lay tied up in docking berths their white salty waterlines riding well above the waves even tristans inexperienced eyes could guess that meant the ships were empty of cargo a raised wooden platform had been placed in a cleared area between the crowd and the waters edge a short series of steps ran down from one of its sides to the ground alongside the platform a long crude rectangular table sat upon the pier seated behind it were at least a dozen men in dark robes consuls robes the prince thought on the table before each man lay several objects but tristan could not identify them from this distance the men behind the table sat patiently as if waiting for something before the table stood two large black kettles with strange curved iron handles an orangered glow emanated from each of their circular tops tristan assumed that the strange auras were being produced by glowing redhot coals deep within them black smoke rose lazily from the kettles glowing embers vanishing into the growing darkness of the evening sky near the kettles two pillories had been constructed the orange glow from the black kettles mixed with the light from the dozens of oil lamps to cast strangely flickering shadows across the hulls of the silently waiting ships and the stark empty pillories then tristan saw the whiteskinned demonslavers lining the inner edges of the clearing keeping the burgeoning crowd from approaching the raised platform by the constant threat of their ninetails and tridents then krassus came into view the people in the crowd began to shout invectives and wave their arms in anger krassus didnt seem to care slowly he walked to the platform in his blueandgray robe an elderly woman with frizzled gray hair and dressed in a shopworn black robe followed along behind him as they approached the demonslavers kept the crowd back without fanfare krassus and his unknown companion walked to the side of the platform and up the steps they remained silent tristan looked over at faegan is that woman the partial adept krassus talked about that day in the palace he asked urgently do you know her from here i cant tell who she might be faegan whispered back not shifting his eyes from the scene but it is obvious she has importance for him tristan expected krassus to speak but he didnt he simply stood there the woman by his side as if he too waited for something suddenly tristan heard the sound of shod hooves rattling harshly against the same cobblestoned street he faegan and shailiha had just come down turning he crawled on his stomach across the slate roof to its northern side and looked carefully over at least a dozen carriagesoffour were approaching their teams trotting down the street and toward the docks but as they neared tristan could see that the vehicles were really not carriages at all they were more like bizarre woodenslatted cages on wheels and they were being driven by yet more of the demonslavers finally he could see them better and his heart skipped a beat they were full of people each of the roughhewn cages contained perhaps twenty or more people men and women alike they sat crammed upon what looked like piles of soiled straw and he could make out black iron manacles here and there the cages continued rattling up the street toward the docks tristan crawled back across the roof to lie beside faegan below the demonslavers on the pier barked out orders and the crowd reluctantly parted to allow the vehicles to pass the cages came to a stop before the long table a group of demonslavers promptly went to one corner of the clearing and from a pile lying there each of them took up a device that seemed to be a long iron rod with a ring at one end another group of demonslavers began unlocking and opening the cage doors one by one the rodwielding demonslavers approached the open cages with a quick twist of the rod handles the rings at their ends clanged open the open rings were shoved into the cages and forced up against the throats of the captives with another twist the rings closed viciously around the prisoners necks one by one the men and women were dragged out kicking and screaming with the captives finally free of their cages tristan could see them much better it was then that he began to get an inkling of why he and his sister had been regarded so strangely all day all the slaves were about the same age as he and shailiha tristan looked back to krassus the wizard had yet to speak but his dark eyes missed nothing as the prisoners were hauled from their cages and forced to move toward the table where the robed men sat waiting can you tell whats happening he asked faegan quietly all he could make out was that the robed men were busy doing something that involved the occasional azure glow of the craft and were making notations in some kind of large books i can see part of it the wizard responded softly and yes i believe i have a good idea of what is going on but let us not speak of it now there was a distinct sadness in the old mans tone shailiha looked to her brother and placed an index finger across her lips tristan nodded back one by one the prisoners were hauled away from the table by their necks and locked into one of the two pillories two demonslavers pulled the rods from the black kettles the ends of the rods came out glowing bright red branding irons before each of the slavers pressed his hot iron to skin he looked up to krassus waiting for a sign and each time before giving his blessing the wizard in the twocolored robe would look down for an indication from the men at the tables then he would indicate with either his right hand or his left as the demonslavers pressed the heated irons into the left shoulders of the prisoners screams resounded through the night many if not most of them fainted away in the stocks and were dragged by their necks to separate areas on the pier when one prisoner was finished another immediately took his or her place as the excruciating process continued tristan saw that one group of slaves was becoming noticeably larger than the other faegan lowered his head shailiha closed her eyes brushing tears from her face only tristans eyes remained locked on the gruesome scene his hands balled up into fists and his jaw clenched with the frustration of not being able to take action finally he too could take no more and he slowly closed his eyes against the spectacle those prisoners were his people the prince realized in shame and horror and there was absolutely nothing he could do to help them was that what krassus taunts had meant what in the name of the afterlife was it all about at last blessedly the branding stopped all of the prisoners having been marked with a rod from one kettle or the other the moaning and crying of the victims was softer now those who had fainted were revived by having cold seawater splashed in their faces then the two groups were marched down the piers to the waiting frigates and forced up the gangways full of despair tristan lowered his head suddenly a long silent moonlit shadow flowed darkly across the roof between him and his sister then came another and yet another tristan tugged silently on the sleeve of the wizards robe slid the dreggan from its scabbard and smoothly rolled over onto his back he was on his feet in a flash his dreggan in a strong twohanded grip three demonslavers stood near the ladder at the other side of the roof the rosecolored moonlight glinting off their alabaster skin each of them held a short sword two of them smiled just then shailiha turned to see why tristan had risen and the air left her lungs in a rush turning over faegan also looked but before anything could be done all three slavers charged at once tristan ran across the roof his dreggan slashing as he went the first of the slavers he met died quickly its head cleanly severed from its body but the next two would not be so easy they hacked savagely at tristan who fended them off as best he could his sword almost a blur but inexorably they came on forcing him to keep backing up toward the wizard and the princess as the three blades clanged coldly harshly against one another shailiha looked aghast at faegan silently beseeching him to intervene with the craft no matter the consequences the demonslavers were closing on tristan and it was plain to see that the prince was tiring faegan relaxed his mind and stopped cloaking their endowed blood just then tristan lost his footing on the slick roof and fell hard on his back sensing victory the two monsters rushed in swords held high faegan raised both his arms twin azure bolts tore across the roof directly over tristan he could feel the searing heat see the blinding azure light and sense the rush of the wind as the force of them ripped at his hair and clothing and almost tore the dreggan from his hands turning his head and gritting his teeth he held on to the sword with all his might shailiha glanced down at krassus and saw him suddenly stiffen with a smile he motioned to a group of about twenty demonslavers then pointed to the roof of the inn faegans bolts struck each of the slavers squarely in the chest tristan his eyes still closed heard their bodies being ripped apart he felt and smelled the sickening offal blood and sinew splattering down on him in a matter of seconds it was over he opened his eyes and saw one of the monsters short shiny swords lying quietly beside him in the moonlight but where was the other wildly turning his head to the sky he saw the shiny silver point of the second sword launched skyward by the explosions of the wizards bolts it was freefalling straight down at him he started to roll to one side realizing even as he moved that he was too late suddenly an azure hand grasped the sword only inches from his throat wasting no time tristan rolled away coming to his hands and knees in the slick bloody mess as the glow of the craft disappeared he watched the sword fall harmlessly to the roof with a clang he picked it up with his free hand and ran to shailiha and faegan the wizard was already seated in his chair but the look on his face was far from reassuring tristan shoved the demonslavers sword into shailihas hands do you remember your fencing lessons he shouted urgently smiling she nodded there is no time for talk faegan growled pointing toward the opposite side of the roof by now krassus will surely know we are here make for the horses tristan sword still in hand looked briefly into his sisters eyes then they both sprinted across the slippery bloodsoaked roof faegan levitated his chair and soared ahead of them the wizard reached the edge first and looked down other than the tied horses and the abandoned cart he saw nothing but he knew that the relative peace of the alleyway wouldnt last much longer he swung the chair back near the prince and his sister both of youonto my chair now he ordered somewhat bewildered the two of them did as they were told shailiha sat on the wizards lap tristan clung to one of the chair arms then faegan steered his chair over the side of the roof on the way down tristan saw about twenty demonslavers working their way through the crowd and up the side street viciously using their whips swords and tridents to clear a path faegan hurried his chair downward as fast as he could safely manage about one meter above the backs of the horses he stopped and looked frantically at the prince and his sister jump tristan immediately let go falling the remaining distance to the ground as he ran to untie their horses out of the corner of his eye he saw shailiha drop directly into her saddle the demonslavers sword still in one hand she masterfully whirled her horse around faegan levitated himself from his chair and with a wave of one hand let it go the centuriesold chair fell to the ground smashing into pieces ignoring it he lowered himself into the saddle atop the third horse tristan leapt into his saddle and wheeled his mount around his back to the wall of the inn to look down their escape route toward the end of the alley the rear door of the inn opened a crack a gleam of soft yellow light cut through the darkness of the alleyway spilling out onto the ground it was the greasy innkeeper raising a demonslaver sword high in both hands the point forward he charged at the princes back shailiha noticed the sudden light and raised her sword spurring her horse forward she used the momentum to shove her blade directly into the mans throat it went through his neck and came out the back she pulled her weapon out hard and swung it tristan wheeled his horse around just in time to see his sister swing her stolen blade in a perfect arc taking the innkeepers head cleanly off at the neck the headless body remained standing for a moment as if it were still somehow in control of itself then what was left of the innkeeper fell forward into the alleyway in front of shailihas horse blood poured from the ravaged neck into the thirsty dirt without pause the three of them turned their horses and charged side by side for the end of the alleyway tristan held his breath wondering if they could make it to the street before the passageway filled with demonslavers but even before their horses could break into a full gallop the prince had his answer the monsters flowed down the street like a river blocking the way to freedom there had to be at least one hundred of them waving swords and tridents they shouted and hissed as they formed what seemed to be an impenetrable wall at the entrance to the street tristan turned frantically around in his saddle he looked behind him only to be reminded that the way back was a dead end charging through the slavers was the only way to freedom but he knew in his heart that it couldnt be done holding up his hand faegan brought his mount to a skidding stop tristan and shailiha followed suit the alleyway became strangely quiet as the slavers stopped shouting and began walking purposefully menacingly toward them tristan turned frantically to the wizard can you kill them he asked some faegan answered quickly his eyes trained upon the monsters as they came but there are too many and no doubt even more are following behind them then a knowing look crossed his face and he turned to the prince and princess killing them is not the answer then what is shailiha asked urgently avoiding them follow me single file and dont look back he ordered whatever happens dont be surprised at what you see and just keep on going when we finally reach the street whip your horses for all theyre worth and stay with me do you understand his last sentence wasnt a question it was an order they both nodded whipping his horse with the reins faegan charged down the alley shailiha behind him tristan bringing up the rear at first the prince thought he must be seeing things glowing a brilliant azure something took solid form it was a bridge barely wide enough to allow a single rider at a time it arched from the dirt of the alleyway and climbed over the heads of the slavers touching down again on the other side caught off guard the demonslavers stood in confused wonder at the sight of the glowing bridge all three horses skidded to a stop and reared in fright several precious seconds passed as faegan fought to bring his mare under control only when he got her moving again did tristans and shailihas mounts settle down and obey their commands to approach the bridge faegans horse reached it first his mares hooves banging down loudly upon the embodiment of the craft as she carried him to its apex and then started down the other side next came shailiha following close behind tristans horse approached the glowing ramp but upon placing her first poorly shod hoof onto the glowing bridge tristans mare stumbled and went down hard on both front knees tristan was launched forward her front legs broken the mare fell over onto her back screaming wildly somehow tristan managed to keep hold of his dreggan but the slavers charged him immediately he staggered drunkenly to one knee then finally to his feet forced to use both hands he raised his sword weakly but could only get it as high as his waist from where he stood he could see nothing but slavers coming toward him their awful faces and the whiteness of their skin strangely highlighted by the glow from the azure bridge on the other side faegan and shailiha wheeled their horses around to look shailiha screamed and would have spurred her gelding back over the bridge but faegan grabbed her reins forcing her horse around some of the slavers near the bridge were already coming their way and there was no time to lose no he shouted we have to go there is nothing we can do for him now we will return for him i promise shailiha cried out as she lost sight of her brother the glowing bridge dissolved leaving only the mob of angry slavers as they crowded in around the prince shailiha turned her terrified eyes back to the wizard finally she lowered her head and nodded it was without question the hardest single decision she had ever been forced to make following faegans horse shailiha thundered down the cobblestoned street just as another wave of the swordwielding demonslavers rushed in stunned and bewildered his hands and body covered with blood from the battles on the roof tristan tried his best to swing his dreggan at the first of them but the heavy blade was too much for him and its momentum took him to his knees then a blinding white light seared through his consciousness and he collapsed to the dirt chapter ten a bbey walked down through the gently sloping field of flowers the light of day was gone and the stars had come out moonlit shadows created by the yellowandturquoiseleaved chirithium trees slowly lengthened out over the waving grasses blossoms and herbs she walked through on her way home carried by the wind light fluffy clouds danced to and fro in the night sky as if struggling to escape their banishment into the darkness the blooming fragrances of the season of new life swirled everywhere about her she stopped for a moment to tie up her graystreaked dark hair and smiled taking in the smells the colors and the breeze then gripping her straw basket a bit tighter she continued up the hill she had been out foraging today just as she had done for the last three days trying to replace at least some of what the mysterious robbers had taken from her it had been a good day and her large hingetopped basket was full when she returned home she would meticulously dry store and catalogue what she had reaped but first shed enjoy a cup of sallow blossom tea she decided abbey had no idea who the intruders had been or how they had found her but she was concerned that she had not recognized the cruel woman who had so obviously been an herbmistress so few of their kind remained and they had always tried to stay in contact with one another even more astonishing was the fact that the unknown woman had been traveling with a wizard after all the wizards had banished those of her kindboth males and females alikefrom their presence long ago as she crested the hill her cottage came into view she took a quick breath smoke was curling up from the chimney and light shone from the cottage windows she stood in the field for some time trying to figure out what to do she could run but there was no safe place nearby that she could easily reach finally she decided to approach the cottage from the rear where there were no windows then creep around to one side and try to peek in without being seen walking over to the edge of the field she entered the dense cover of the drooping chirithium trees and started down the glade surrounding the cottage seemed deserted she saw no horses tied nearby she carefully set down her basket by a tree then made her way as silently as possible to the rear wall keeping low she crept around the corner and squatted beneath the first of the leaded windows slowly she raised her head up as far as she dared and looked in a young beautiful woman with brilliant red hair was lying on abbeys bed her eyes were closed her face was very pale the staggered rising and falling of the thin blanket that covered the woman told the experienced herbmistress that the stranger was having great difficulty breathing a mans hand with long elegant fingers rested flat on the womans forehead abbey could not see the rest of him slipping quietly around the back of the cottage she retrieved her precious basket and then made her way to the front she gathered her courage took a deep breath and walked in allowing the rusty door hinges to announce her entrance the man sitting by the bed turned to face her abbey dropped her basket and its contents spilled to the floor her hands flew to cover her open mouth hello abbey the man said gently its been a long time please pardon my intrusion but i very much need your help abbey her eyes locked on his face staggered toward a chair and sat down clumsily it was difficult for her to speak to think or even to breathe as a flood of conflicting emotions coursed through her wigg waited maintaining an outward calm but inside he too was bubbling with unexpected emotions but as he watched her expression changed from one of astonishment to anger finally abbey pointed to the woman in the bed who is she she asked she was chagrined to hear her voice crack after all these years why are you here at first wigg did not answer he pointed to the basket and the plants lying on the stone floor the scattered clippings rose into the air and floated over to the basket where they fell into a neat contained pile the refilled basket floated up to the table beside the stunned herbmistress and came to rest wigg took another long breath letting it go slowly before placing his hands into the opposite sleeves of his robe her name is celeste he answered softly she is of endowed blood and has been adversely affected by the craft in all my years i have seen this phenomenon occur only one other timequite recently in factto another woman who means just as much to me the other woman however managed its effects much more handily i cannot be sure but i think it was because of the greater strength of her blood in any event this woman needs our help i have been unable to awaken her by myself and i fear that if she does not return to consciousness soon i may lose her for all time will you help me the wizards eyes were shiny with unshed tears abbey stood and walked to the bed first she looked into each of celestes eyes then she cautiously examined her strangely scorched fingertips her mind has gone deep for the moment she is stable the herbmistress told wigg cautiously but she is in a bad way although i am not sure how much help i can be i will do what i can but hear this first lead wizard her gray eyes bored directly into wiggs what i do i do for her and her alone not for you thank you wigg said gratefully and i cannot blame you for the way you feel silence reigned for a moment first i want to know who she is abbey said she wanted to prepare a tea but the fire had gone down she walked to the hearth and bent over to stoke the flames but before she could wigg pointed and the logs blazed again then two more from the nearby pile rose into the air and floated over to fall upon the ones already burning abbey sighed i had almost forgotten how much easier life can be for certain trained males she commented as she began to prepare some tea one corner of wiggs mouth came up he could hardly disagree i asked you a question she added without turning around who is she she is my daughter the lead wizard answered softly knowing the effect his words would have for several long moments abbey stopped what she was doing so you finally remarried she said softly once more busying herself with the teakettle wigg thought he heard her voice crack again no he answered gently failee was apparently pregnant when she left me celeste was protected by time enchantments and is nearly as old as you and i he paused a great many things have transpired in our land since we were last together much of which im sure you remain unaware of it would be a very long story abbey her face emotionless placed two cups of tea on the table and took a seat she beckoned wigg to join her you and i are each blessed with the enchantments granting eternal life she said flatly i think we can spare the time wiggs mouth came up into a short smile as succinctly as he could the lead wizard told her of the workings of the paragon he also described the tome and its several volumes after explaining the importance of tristan and shailiha he then told her of the unexpected return of the sorceresses of the coven and how he and tristan had ventured across the sea of whispers to defeat them in the previously unknown land of parthalon he told her everything the story of nicholas ragnar and celeste and the destruction of the gates of dawn abbey listened intently searching for any scrap of information that might help her unravel the secret to helping wiggs stricken daughter he explained the recent discovery of the forestallments in the blood signatures of shailiha baby morganna tristan and celeste these spells took the form of crooked branches leading away from the main pattern of the blood signature and had apparently been placed into their blood by the covenfor what purposes wigg and faegan could only guess and would likely never know it had been such a forestallment that had resulted in shailihas highly unusual ability to commune with the fliers of the field and the forestallment he had unwittingly helped activate in celeste had enabled her to save their lives by killing the sabertoothed bear at the mention of celestes forestallment abbeys eyes lit up she stood and walked quickly back to the bed lifting celestes hands she again examined her blackened fingertips and broken nails you say the bolt she sent against the bearthis forestallment as you call itwas unusually strong she asked and that it happened just after she began to convulse yes wigg answered her bolts were the most powerful i have ever seen they literally ripped the creature apart then she collapsed and now he paused one eyebrow rising i think i know why explain abbey said returning to the table you just said it yourself he replied her first use of a forestallment came quickly immediately after its activation so her blood had no time to adjust to its new state no doubt it was failees intention to activate celestes gifts one by one and train her in their use gradually in a controlled environment but given the desperate situation celeste acted instinctively this proved to be too much for her untrained blood and plunged her into this deep twilight state he turned sadly looking back over at the bed there is another wizard with me at the palace his name is faegan he would have been able to help for he is also an herbalist but your cottage was much closer and so you brought her here abbey answered skeptically but what were the two of you doing in these woods to begin with we were coming to see you about a different matter wigg said rather apologetically i was hoping after all of these years to gain your help eutracia needs you abbey shook her head slowly it seems you suddenly require a great deal of help lead wizard she replied stiffly the herbmistress thought for a moment then she leaned closer her face dark tell me she said sternly after more than three hundred years of surviving without my services how is it that the lofty nation of eutracia suddenly needs one of those who was so summarily banished trying to think of a way to broach the subject wigg looked around the unkempt cottage bottles lay overturned and shelves had been torn down much of the glassware that should have contained abbeys hardwon treasures was conspicuously empty his eyes went back to the herbmistress i dont remember you being such a poor housekeeper he said simply what does that have to do with anything she shot back this mess is not like you and we both know it wigg said gently and then he took a breath and asked he was here wasnt he the man in the twocolored robe and he had a woman with hima partial adept possibly trained both as an herbmistress and a blazegazer they took much from you didnt they not the least of which was a sizable portion of your rather infamous pride the herbmistress hard shell seemed to crack a bit and a tear came to one eye taking a chance wigg placed one of his hands over hers surprisingly she did not pull away did they hurt you he asked softly no she said looking down but the woman knew exactly which herbs and compounds she wanted many of them were among my most prized i cannot say for sure whether she was a gazer since she practiced no such art in my presence but given her knowledge of my stores she was certainly an herbmistress the man was ill with some disease of the lungs he put me in some kind of bizarre glowing cage and i couldnt stop him all i could do was watch as they destroyed a lifetime of work she raised her face back up but how did you know his name is krassus and he was once first alternate to the directorate of wizards wigg answered ironically i appointed him to that position myself he is now apparently a full wizard of some power his gifts perhaps imbued by nicholas through forestallments but we do not know who the woman is krassus claimed she is a blazegazer but we have no proof of that he came to the palace demanding information he searches for a man named wulfgar his other quest is for something called the scrolls of the ancients tell me are you familiar with either no when i could not answer his questions he beat me and violated my mind wigg said angrily he also gloated about having been here and leaving you in a bad way then after promising to kill faegan and me he left i simply had to come to see if you were all right but i must admit that i had other reasons for visiting you i knew you lay ill she said unexpectedly wiggs eyes sharpened at abbeys unexpected statement what he asked after they left i went to my gazing flame and searched for you she answered i admit that it was not the first time i have done so you were lying in a bed with people standing around you whom i did not know so you have a gazing flame here wigg asked abbey nodded but what is there of mine that you could possibly have kept all of these years he asked clearly puzzled dont you need something personal of your subject in order to properly view the image abbey reached for the locket around her neck and opened it curled up inside was a short braid of dark brown hair she placed it on the table wiggs eyes went wide mine he asked but how could that be i took it from you in bed one night more than three hundred years go she answered placing the braid back into the pendant and locking it again you always slept so deeply a slight smile finally appeared on her face the coming of some memory perhaps but then it was quickly overtaken by another look of anger and then you voted with your brotherhood to banish all the partial adepts she whispered angrily yet another of the directorates kneejerk reactions to anyone or anything of the craft not directly controlled by them she turned her face away you hurt me deeply wigg you hurt all of us with partial blood to this day i am not sure i will ever be able to forgive you it was so unfair wigg sighed if he could have taken back parts of those days he would i voted for my nation he said sadly in hindsight ive come to see that many of our decisions were wrong but both eutracia and her monarchy were new and still in great distress the survival of our land and the foretold coming of the chosen ones were far more important than the two of us or what we may have wanted for ourselves surely you can see that and like you i have suffered much im not naive abbey so i wont ask you to forgive me but the best most personal gift i could bestow upon you before you left was the time enchantments had the directorate discovered what i had done there would surely have been a great scandal perhaps even my own banishment from the directorate given the harsh reactionary attitudes of those days but now all of my friends of that august body are dead he paused wondering how his next words would be received then laced his long fingers together and placed his hands on the table as i said abbey we need you he continued softly when i leave here i want you to come back to tammerland with me stunned she looked at him with wide eyes no she said flatly i wont do it why should i my life is good here and the people here have come to rely on me for healing here at least i am allowed to practice my arts in peace until four days ago that is wigg reminded her gently i can make you come back with me and we both know it i wont do that but hear me out if krassus truly has a partial adept with him and if we are ever to even the odds of defeating him then we must have one too i have a feeling these scrolls he referred to are extremely important and that if we dont find them and wulfgar before krassus does our world may irrevocably changefor the worse and what if krassus comes back with us you would be far safer the twinkle returned to his eyes and he smiled knowingly besides he added wouldnt you like a chance to get even abbey thought for a time her jaw clenching i will consider your words she said finally but how could i be of help while all of my stores and books remain here my friend faegan has a great many herbs growing in an atrium in his mansion in a place called shadowood wigg told her and we can have all of your books and charts brought to tammerland he smiled thinking of the archives of the redoubt and youll have more scrolls and books than you can imagine at your disposal wigg smiled to himself if he could convince abbey to come it would be very interesting to see someone teach faegan something for a change abbey turned to look at celeste though and her face darkened we have talked too long she said urgently we must attend to your daughter celestes breathing had become more labored and beads of sweat stood on her pale forehead the herbmistress thought for a moment its the honey she said at last half to herself of course wigg answered her ingestion of the honey was the trigger that activated her first forestallment so simple an act no noyou dont understand abbey said there is more to it than that what do you mean honey is the key to our problem she told him but first i must find my charts of opposites perplexed wigg watched her walk to the far wall of the cottage she pushed on one side of it and the entire wall rotated on a hidden pivot to reveal a bookcase lined with ledgers texts and scrolls a much smaller room could be seen beyond containing a desk and many piles of reference materials as well as a store of additional herbs and oils luckily this room seemed to have been untouched by krassus abbey selected a text from one of the shelves blew the dust from it and returned to the table the binding read charts of opposites letters hi wigg waited patiently as she leafed through the book finally she stopped running one finger down a dogeared page on it was a drawing of a wheel divided into equalsized pieshaped sections what are charts of opposites wigg asked just as the craft has its dark and light aspects every other thing existing in the universe also has its direct opposite she answered and in some cases more than one look at this she passed the book over to wigg this page is only one of dozens whose words begin with the letter h she said run your finger around the circle until you find the word honey then go directly to the opposite side and read aloud what it says wigg did as she asked finally finding and speaking the words powdered tetturess and oil of hibernium leaf only he looked up at abbey are you saying these two substances are natures direct opposites to honey he asked skeptically how can you be so sure by way of hundreds of years of careful experimentation she answered simply she raised an eyebrow i wrote this book myself walking to her shelves she began her search after some time she returned to the table with a green bottle when abbey uncorked it wigg saw that it contained a violet oil i still dont understand he said furrowing his brow he watched as she began measuring out a portion into a thick porcelain cup this problem is of the craft how are these substances going to help the honey she ingested is no doubt still in her bloodstream abbey answered as she concentrated intently on her work and from what you told me it was the catalyst that set everything else in motion the direct opposites of honey are hiberniumjust the oil squeezed from the leaf mind you not from the woodand powder of tetturess blossom they are even more potent when combined if she ingests them in both the proper ratios and amounts they should neutralize the honey in her system as she spoke she finished measuring out the oil then she looked around her smashed cottage and her face darkened this oil remained safe in the other room she said but my bottle of tetturess blossom was taken by krassus turn to the back of the book until you find the pages labeled diagrams of substitutions and tell me what the substitution is for tetturess blossom i could probably guess but id rather be sure wigg thumbed to the back of the book and found the diagram dried stalk of widows wart he answered without looking up it also says that if widows wart is not available then flakes of dried newts skin will also suffice abbey nodded my widows wart was also taken she said angrily but i think i still have the newts skin the widows wart would have been better but well just have to make do with what we have rising from her chair she walked to one of the shelves that was broken at one end and had half fallen to the floor after a good bit of rummaging around she finally produced a small tin which she brought back to the table she opened the lid and removed what appeared to be a small square patch of dried leather it was gray with pink spots she scraped some of the skin off with a knife and dropped the resultant flakes into the cup with the oil satisfied for the moment she looked back at wigg we are fortunate that the necessary ingredients for this potion survived the destruction here she commented still that is only half the battle wigg understood as the mixture counteracts the honey i must also use my powers trying to bring her consciousness back to the surface he mused correct abbey went to a sideboard to retrieve a copper pitcher and filled it with water she transferred the ingredients from the mortar into an iron pot poured in a measure of water and stirred it slowly with a wooden spoon then she placed the iron pot on the hearth hook and swiveled it over the flames she went back to the bookshelves and picked out another volume as she brought it to the table wigg glanced at the title combinations and potions times and instruments for the application of heat and cold and the subsequent reactions thereof she began to read now what are you doing he asked his interest in the process had gradually become more genuine but abbey her thoughts obviously lost in the volume didnt answer she finally put down the book white feather of male highland goose she said softly to herself it seems nothing else will do now where did i put those busily wiping her hands on her apron she returned to the shelves after some looking she reached up to grasp a pewter canister she opened the top peered inside and pulled out a long white feather she then went to her writing desk and retrieved a quill pen and a small bottle finally she returned to the table she opened the bottle taking up the quill she filled it with red ink she then laid the white feather flat on the table about twothirds of the way to the top she slowly began drawing a straight red line across it what in the name of the afterlife are you doing wigg asked completely at sea he was beginning to grow anxious he turned back to look at celeste still the same old wigg abbey said her eyes remaining locked on her artwork he almost thought he saw a hint of another smile with an attitude like that you must drive this faegan you speak of to absolute distraction saying nothing wigg pursed his lips finally she finished and blew on the feather drying the ink then she walked back to the hearth swung the pot toward her and carefully lowered the feather down into it so that the ink line showed just above the rim almost immediately the portion of the feather just above the mixture began to brown from the heat of the potion she turned back to wigg bring two chairs over here she said what good does the feather do wigg asked curiously tell me something lead wizard she said her eyes still locked on the feather despite all of your knowledge of the craft without the goose quill how would you know how long to let the mixture cook smiling wigg nodded when the brown color reaches the ink line the temperature is right he mused very clever theres more to it than that she answered not only does the right temperature activate the potion but it also assures that we will not burn her throat saying nothing more the two of them watched quietly as the brown stain gradually climbed higher and higher when it finally met the ink line abbey swung the pot around and took it off the hook she very quickly poured the entire potion into a cup now she ordered before it cools you understand what you must do she asked as soon as the potion starts down her throat begin your work and be warned she may become difficult to control he nodded quickly and went to his daughter he tilted up her head and carefully parted her lips as abbey poured the mixture into celestes waiting mouth he employed the craft attempting to reach into the depths of his daughters consciousness at first things seemed to go well after a few moments celeste began to stir and moan then unbelievably she opened her eyes looked beseechingly up at her father and started to cry it was just then that wigg suddenly realized what both he and abbey should have done but had not coming partly out of her stupor celeste suddenly bolted upright her eyes wide she screamed and her body began shaking uncontrollably as if possessed she began to raise both trembling hands at once understanding wigg tried to force her hands back down but she was too strong for him hold her abbey shouted wigg briefly thought of using the craft to hold celeste but that would mean stopping the flow of his power into her to help her with a final purely physical effort wigg was able to force celestes arms back down onto the bed but suddenly her wrists turned up just as the azure bolts shot forth wigg let go of her grabbed abbey and threw the herbmistress to the floor covering her body with his own he closed his eyes knowing that all he could do was continue to aid celestes mind and hope that it soon would be over a deafening cacophony of destruction came from every corner of the house the sounds of breaking glass and falling stone then blessedly it was over wigg carefully stood and gave abbey a hand up he found himself choked by dust as his eyes cleared he looked around the devastation was amazing only two of the walls were still standing but one of them suddenly gave up the effort and collapsed inward crashing to the cottage floor most of the roof was gone revealing the stars twinkling innocently in the early evening sky in the dim light he could see that the vast majority of abbeys bottles and other containers had been blown out of the house and lay broken or open scattered haphazardly across the nearby woods and fields wigg realized that they were probably quite unrecoverable almost every stick of furniture was demolished and even the hearth had been rent in two its bricks scattered across the floor like abandoned childrens toys most of the chimney somehow still rose toward the sky like a crooked broken finger trying to point to the stars miraculously the wall still standing was the one holding the shelves full of abbeys books scrolls and ledgers for the most part they and the others scattered about behind them seemed unharmed the wind began whistling coldly through the remains of the cottage swirling the dust and debris into little maelstroms as it went celeste had collapsed on the bed her eyes fluttered once then twice before finally staying open rising weakly up on her elbows she looked aghast at the remains of the cottage she looked down at her fingertips and began to cry wigg instinctively knew that she was crying not because of her physical pain but at the sudden inescapable realization of what she had done abbeywalking stiffly mechanically through the rubble of what had once been her homewas also crying standing shakily celeste embraced her father he held her tightly knowing how close he had come to losing her i did this didnt i she asked looking around again in horror somehow i just know it but the last thing i remember is having tasted some honey did that really happen she looked quizzically around the smashed cottage once more where are we father she asked softly then her eyes closed again and she collapsed into his arms laying her back down on the bed wigg placed a palm on her forehead for a time he closed his eyes then smiled he and abbey had done it this time celestes sleep was genuine natural when she finally awakened she would be herself again with the exception of her first activated forestallment he mused he would have to train her in its proper use as soon as possible he went to abbey in her trembling hands she was clutching a dusty book she had retrieved from the floor he put a hand on her shoulder i dont know what to say he said softly im so sorry abbey turned to him her eyes wet then she did something unexpected stepping nearer she put her arms around him and lay her head upon his shoulder his gray robe soon became soaked with tears they stood that way for some time as the wind rustled through the remains of the cottage and the sounds of the night creatures came softly to their ears finally she took her head from his shoulder and looked into his eyes it seems i will be coming with you after all she said her voice so small he could barely hear her i never expected to see you again wigg pulled her closer nor i you he said softly nor i you part ii revelation chapter eleven it is within one of the scrolls of the ancients that those of the vagaries shall procure a great weapon the reading and employment thereof shall bring a shift in all things including the lives of the chosen ones just as those who find and control the scroll of the vigors come yet another step closer to combining the two sides of magic those controlling the scroll of the vagaries shall also be nearer their goal of complete neverending rule over the craft page volume ii of the vigors of the tome w ulfgar turned over luxuriously in the great bed even though he remained a prisoner he could escape into his dreams of better times and how are you this evening traveler his dreamself asked pushing aside the stallions forelock the boy briskly rubbed the horses whitestarred forehead the black stallion snorted softly eagerly stretching his neck for yet more of his keepers attention from behind his back wulfgar produced a bright red apple traveler snorted again and his ears pricked up wulfgar was about to play a game with him and the horse knew it wulfgar backed away slightly and held the apple higher just out of travelers reach the stallion pushed forward against the unforgiving oak door to his stall and let go a loud impatient whinny wulfgar smiled not so fast he said gently you know what you have to do first the horse impatiently shook his head forelock and mane flying haphazardly finally there came the sound of a single shod hoof banging loudly one time only on the floor of the stall smiling wulfgar produced a folding knife and began slicing the apple into pieces as he held the first of the apple slices out traveler took it between his long uniform teeth and munched contentedly turning away from the stall for a moment wulfgar took a piece of apple for himself and looked down the length of the barn for as long as he could remember he had loved the sights smells and sounds of this place more than any other his father jason of the house of merrick owned these barns and presided over the combination of stables and blacksmith shop thanks to the directorate of wizards peace and prosperity had reigned for more than three centuries and jasons business was good even so the merrick family was by no means wealthy but father mother and son were happy in the ways that money could not buy the young man of thirteen looked down the length of the barn it was full to capacity yellow straw lay everywhere and the smell of green hay amber grain horses and saddle soap combined with the sooty smoke and char of the blacksmiths hearth in the next room to create a familiar scent he breathed in gladly a soft low light came from the many lanterns lining the aisle between the rows of stalls to his ears came the occasional snorts and whinnies of the horses and the comforting double clangs of his fathers hammer on the anvil these sounds and smells had become an integral part of his life wulfgar gave traveler another piece of apple then he noticed that the clanging of his fathers hammer had ceased turning wulfgar saw his father approaching jason looked tired but he grinned affectionately at wulfgar as he approached his weathered face and hands were covered with dark soot as was the worn leather blacksmiths apron tied around his middle enough for one day he said his voice gravelly and strong he smelled like hot charcoal as usual his massive strength was both comforting and familiar to wulfgar like standing next to a favorite old oak tree dinner must be ready by now jason added as he folded his apron and looked out from the barn warm inviting lights came from the small house lying just beyond you know how your mother gets when we let her creations go cold he winked im not hungry wulfgar countered gamely besides i still have tack to polish the customers will expect it done by morning when they arrive for their mounts jason smiled theres another reason why you dont want to leave the stables isnt there he asked wulfgar looked down at some straw near the toes of his boots and didnt answer the tack can wait until morning his father said you still have schoolwork to do and that must come first given the fact that were full up if some of the tack doesnt get polished im sure the customers will understand wulfgars face fell he liked his lessons well enoughindeed he was one of his schools best studentsbut he had always been something of a loner with a fiercely held sense of independence that set him apart from the other boys having schoolmates was fine but it was the horses that continually came and went from these barns that truly possessed his heart suppose i told you that dinner tonight is veal pieyour favorite jason said as he draped a muscular arm over his sons shoulders and turned the boy toward the far doors of the barn sighing wulfgar nodded with a final look back at traveler he tossed the remains of the apple into the stall then side by side father and son left the barn and headed for wulfgar suddenly started awake all of his senses coming alive at once he shot upright sweaty and breathing heavily he glanced wildly around the room trying to remember where he was he had been dreaming again he realized rubbing the back of his neck he wished he had not woken up the dream was infinitely preferable to his current reality he had been locked within these roomssupposedly the personal quarters of the one called krassusfor the last four days during that time he had seen no one save for the demonslavers who supplied him with food toilet articles and clean clothing not one of them had spoken to him swinging his legs over the side of the bed he retied his long sandy hair behind him with the worn leather strip and then turned to look out the open balcony doors morning was dawning the sky sunny and clear reluctantly he took the frantically patterned silk robe from the settee at the end of the bed and put it on he felt like a fool he acutely missed his simple leather breeches boots and matching sleeveless shirt the one that had been so forgiving when he used to swing the heavy hammer down on the anvil he walked sleepily to the spacious balcony and sat down in one of the overstuffed chairs his velvet cageas he had come to think of his prisonwas indeed sumptuous but there was absolutely no way to escape it the only exit was through double doors of solid marble locked from the other side two armed whiteskinned slavers stood perpetual guard in the hall the chambers consisted of a bedroom with a gigantic fourposter bed an adjoining drawing room with shelves full of books and a large fireplace and a huge ornate bath the rooms were of highly polished marble as was the open lowwalled balcony where he now sat below the sea crashed against the nearby shore and he could smell the crisp salty sea air looking toward the west and out over the seemingly endless sea of whispers he was again reminded that his quarters were hundreds of feet in the air and surely comprised but a small part of the massive building in which he was being held one corner of his mouth came up knowingly no one guarded him on this side of his quarters for there was no need to the exterior walls were slick and smooth any attempt to escape that way would mean a fall and certain death on the jagged rocks that lined the shore tall whitesailed ships arrived dailyno doubt transporting yet more slavesand each time the swaying masts and graceful sails appeared on the horizon the view steeled his resolve to escapesomeday somehow but not before killing janus he promised himself and as many of the grotesque slavers as he could during the last four days there had been little to do except sit and watch the restless ocean he had tried to read the books in the drawing room but they were all written in a beautifullooking but utterly foreign language the only words he recognized were talis and rtalis and they seemed to be repeated over and over he was alone with unanswered questions why was he was being treated like a king while his fellow slaves were supposedly confined somewhere else somewhere far less comfortable why had such excitement accompanied his arrival at the docks things had been said and done to him there that he couldnt even begin to understand shame washed over him and he closed his eyes the darkness momentarily brought back his dream and his thoughts turned to his home in the coastal city of farpoint and the parents he loved with all his heart as far as he knew jason and selene were still alive and well though surely they missed him jason still worked in the stables but no longer performed the difficult manual labor required by his trade wulfgar now thirtyfive seasons of new life had stayed on taking over the blacksmith shop his strong hard body showed the years of hard work his muscles sculpted by so many strikes of the hammer to the anvil although there had been several women in his life he had yet to marry he had been abducted in farpoint while making a trip to order grain for the stables rumors of the abduction of men and women his age had been circulating for days but always the independent skeptic he had ignored them and ventured into the city anyway it was at the mill that several of the awful whiteskinned things had come at him at once sadly he had been unarmed nonetheless wulfgar had fought back like a lion badly injuring several of them with his fists and feet before being rendered unconscious he had awakened to the fire of a branding iron on his shoulder and was then bound in the darkness belowdecks on a ship that tossed its way through the sea of whispers for sixteen excruciating days he craned his neck to look at the brand on his left shoulder and was heartened to see that it had almost completely healed he shook his head again at the insanity of it all it had taken him three days of twicedaily bathing before he had felt truly free of the filth and stink of the ships hold but he would never be free of the bizarre brand as he continued to stare out over the ocean his thoughts turned to eutracia and to the royal family most people believed the king and queen to be dead along with the directorate of wizards it was widely rumored that they had perished in the royal palace on prince tristans coronation day some even said that the king had died at the princes own hand questions about the survival of the royal twins had stubbornly remained but if they lived as so many people thought why werent they coming to the aid of their citizens no one seemed to know but if the other rumors were indeed true about the winged ones that had come and murdered both the royal family and the entire royal guard then perhaps even tristan and shailiha could do little to stem the tide of the slaversespecially without the powers of the directorate to help them his thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the bolt sliding and the double doors of his bedroom swung open breakfast time two demonslavers entered swords drawn a third slaver pushed the nowfamiliar silver cart loaded with food and drink into the room then unexpectedly two other persons came through the door wulfgar stood quickly and came in from the balcony janus stood there proudly dressed in his usual flagrant clothes the twin iron spheres dangling as always from his right hip clanked together menacingly as he walked the dark eyes surrounded by the red painted mask surveyed the room cautiously beside him stood a woman janus roughly shoved her forward as though displaying her for wulfgars approval she was beautiful tall and shapely she wore her long brunette hair in ringlets that twirled down to her shoulders her eyes were wide and bright blue a magnificent yellow taffeta gown trimmed with white lace draped gracefully from her bare shoulders to the floor the hem just reaching the tops of her matching silk slippers on her left shoulder was an angry healing brand rtalis as janus took a few steps closer wulfgar cringed janus looked wulfgar up and down and then nodded his approval you clean up nicely he cooed a vast improvement over that day at the docks i must say without looking around he raised one hand and snapped his fingers the two demonslavers immediately grabbed the woman and tossed her onto the fourposter bed as though she were a toy surprisingly unafraid she glared back at them with hate in her eyes as you might have already guessed shes for you janus said calmly as if he were giving wulfgar a birthday gift rtalis of course nothing but the best for our honored guest she pleases the eye does she not after four days of boredom i thought you could use some companionship in any event do with her as you will wulfgar turned to look at the beauty on the bed then looked back at janus i dont know how to thank you he said sarcastically think nothing of it janus answered there are many more where she came from should she displease you he removed his gold snuffbox from a pocket of his doublet and snorted a pinch up one nostril an explosive sneeze followed he looked wulfgar up and down another time then cast his masked eyes back to the woman on the bed why am i here wulfgar demanded what is this place and why have i been granted such special treatment janus sighed i often forget how truly uneducated you are he said softly no matter as soon as krassus arrives he will help you overcome your handicap he is due to arrive in a matter of days then we will see just how strong you really are what is this place wulfgar asked again as i told everyone that day on the pier you are on an island it is a very special place it has existed secretly for eons under one master of the vagaries or another even the wizards of the directorate did not know of it it is called the citadel and for good reason wulfgar had no idea what janus was talking about he seized on the one idea that made sense no one can sail farther than fifteen days into the sea of whispers he countered how do you manage it yet another secret you shall eventually learn janus answered but as i already said krassus is the one best suited to answer your inquiries he will be most delighted to learn that you are finally here we have been looking for you for some time others have searched even longer why wulfgar demanded i dont even know this krassus hes nothing to me why should he care about my welfare he cares because of an oath he swore to one of your distant relatives just before the mans unfortunate demise janus answered it was clear that he was enjoying his riddle ironically he was murdered by yet another of your relatives but you wouldnt know about that yet would you thats impossible wulfgar snarled my relatives are not murderers janus shook his head knowingly oh but they are he answered yet another fact you will soon be forced to deal with he snapped his fingers again from a shelf beneath the food cart one of the slavers produced an hourglass and handed it to his master janus looked first to the woman on the bed and then back to wulfgar he turned the hourglass over and placed it on a nearby table you have one hour to do all you would like to this woman he said nastily then we shall come back for her should she not please you tell me when i return and i will see to it that she is appropriately punished as i said nothing is too good for our very special guest the painted monster smiled again and now i must bid you goodbye he said enjoy her wulfgar he added i must say i envy you he gave them both a short sarcastic bow with that he turned and walked purposefully out of the room the twin spheres at his side clinking together ominously the demonslavers behind him as the massive marble doors closed with a decisive thud wulfgar heard the bolt slide into place on the other side turning he looked at the beautiful woman on the bed chapter twelve y ou had best be successful this time grizelda krassus said sternly i am growing tired of your failures swaying on her knees the haggard herbmistress looked up at krassus as she did her stomach lurched again she had been seasick for the last four days and even a dose of nerveweed had not helped but she was not too ill to understand that the next few moments could mean either the continuance of her life or a torturous death at the hands of the wizard should she displease him after vomiting into the nearby bucket for what seemed the thousandth time she slowly wiped her mouth on the sleeve of her tattered robe regaining her composure she surveyed the shifting deck of the sojourner her lords flagship as she made her way east across the sea of whispers alabasterskinned demonslavers hurried about their duties crewing the ship and keeping the hundreds of slaves chained belowdecks under tight control sojourners bright white sails were full and seawater occasionally splashed up over her decks as she pitched up and down in the restless sea two other frigates the wayfarer and the stalwart followed in her wake after the herbs and potions krassus and grizelda had stolen from abbeys cottage had been loaded aboard the three ships had departed farpoint they were making good time running before the steady westerly winds krassus turned to the demonslaver standing next to him the monster immediately came to attention make sure all the crows nests remain manned upon each of our vessels krassus ordered signal them to continue keeping an especially sharp lookout not only on the sea but also in the sky with the capture of the prince i have no doubt that the wizards have sent their minions after us i believe we are already well beyond their flying range but wigg and faegan are nothing if not resourceful the demonslaver nodded curtly my lord he answered with a bow he then left to fulfill his orders krassus returned his attention to the woman on her knees he and grizelda were on the aft deck the mizzen sail having just been furled this would reduce their speed somewhat but it couldnt be helped what grizelda was about to attempt was hazardous especially with a full sail directly overhead an uncontrolled fire on board ship in the middle of the sea of whispers was something to be avoided at all costs besides performing these rituals in the confines of the chambers belowdecks was unthinkable when tristan had been rendered unconscious in the alley by the slavers he had been immediately taken to krassus then placed aboard the sojourner there krassus had induced a deep sleep over him and the prince was being forcefed liquid nourishment the beard faegan had conjured for him had since disappeared and in its place there was now a shorter twoday growth of dark natural stubble still dressed in his usual clothes but his weapons gone he lay peacefully belowdecks in a windowless stateroom guarded by demonslavers krassus smiled capturing the prince had been an unexpected treata gamble risked and won satisfied he took a deep breath of the nighttime sea air but the cold clear saltiness was too much for his lungs and he let go a small cough several droplets of his blood spewed forth to hit the deck where they immediately began twisting their way into familiar signatures sighing angrily he wiped them away with the sole of his boot thinking he turned again to look out over the whitecapped ocean where waves danced continually in the moonlight although tristan was still untrained in the ways of the craft nicholas had warned krassus that the princes bloodthe strongest in the worldpossessed forestallments that had been placed there by failee the failed first mistress of the coven krassus had been well trained by nicholas in the art of imbuing forestallments the powers imparted thusly into the blood were delayed or forestalled to be brought to life later either activated at a predetermined time or catalyzed into being by the performance of certain specified acts by their possessor if the forestallment was time activated there was no way to know when it might show itself unless one knew the nature of the spell to begin with if it was event activated it could manifest at any time provided that the correct action or sequence of actions had been taken by the person in whose blood the forestallment had been placed krassus had no way of knowing the nature of the forestallments that failee had placed in tristans blood her did not want to accidentally activate one of those asyetuntapped gifts he would have to be exceedingly careful in his handling of the prince his plans were proceeding well but he could not afford to become complacent the two ancient wizards of the redoubt remained very powerful to defeat them and also accomplish his other goals he would have to be very clever indeed and he would have to get his hands on both the scrolls of the ancients and wulfgar morgannas bastard son true he still did not have the scroll of the vigors and leaving eutracia without having found it gave him great pause but he had the scroll of the vagaries and the work of his consuls back at the citadel needed to begin besides once his herbmistress was finally able to view the other scroll he could always instruct his demonslavers to retrieve it for him wherever it might be the prince continues to sleep belowdecks grizelda asked breaking into krassus thoughts krassus placed his hands into the opposite sleeves of his blueandgray robe yes he said although untrained he can still be quite dangerous as he has so adeptly proven a number of times as a precaution i have decided to have him transferred to one of the other ships under no circumstances shall the chosen one and the scroll of the vagaries be allowed to continue sharing the same vessel should the scroll fall into the hands of the wizards in tammerland our cause might be lost he smiled again i wonder if the good prince knows how to row he added nastily suddenly impatient his dark gaze bored its way into her now then he said i suggest you get on with it krassus smiled he was gradually finding himself a reluctant admirer of the old womans talents before finding her he had located several partial adepts but none had the particular combination of talents he hoped would help him fulfill his oath to nicholas as a precaution he had killed them on the spot he wished he had killed abbey too but he hadnt dared fearing he might need her as leverage with wigg should she ever cross his path again he swore he would not make the same mistake twice in order to accomplish his goals he needed to find wulfgar in addition there was no telling what other persons or things of the craft he might need to collect while on his path to victory for this only a welltrained partial adept would do he immediately set out to locate one he had finally discovered grizelda in the city of warwick watch she had been doing sleight of hand and other lesser aspects of her arts for the amusement of the crowds apparently living on whatever meager offerings they might deign to throw into her bowl he had watched her for some time then closed his eyes and reached out to her blood with his specialized senses finally sure he waited until the small crowd had dispersed and the shadows of the day were beginning to lengthen picking up her meager things the haggard woman counted her coins carefully then tied them up in a dirty rag and scurried into the depths of a nearby alley following her krassus saw her stop at the end of the alley near the protection of its angled dead end and the large wooden box that sat against one wall a few rusty cooking utensils lay nearby crouching she set down her makeshift coin bag and began to light a small fire silently krassus came to stand before her she did not see him until the length of his shadow crawled toward the flames looking up she snatched her coin bag to her breast and scrabbled back toward the false security of the dilapidated wooden box krassus regarded her carefully she was very old her long gray hair fell crazily over her shoulders and her face was weatherbeaten presumably from living for so many years out of doors wrinkling his nose he wondered how long it had been since she had bathed her plain black robe tattered and worn covered a thin unremarkable figure who are you she demanded her piercing dark eyes betrayed a sharp intelligence what do you want i know what you are he answered quietly you may fool the simple unendowed peasants in the streets but not me what are you talking about she shot back go away and leave me alone krassus smiled this is what im talking about crone he answered he raised one hand and the azure glow of the craft appeared about her as he moved his index finger slightly a small incision began to form in her right palm several drops of her blood fell to the floor of the alleyway looking down krassus watched them twist their way through the thirsty dirt forming signatures as he had suspected they were partials only the softer curvier halves revealed themselves the womans mother had been her only parent with endowed blood youre a partial he said calmly and because your blood reveals a signature without the aid of waters from the caves it is also clear that you have been trained that makes you a partial adept tell me what are your skills i may have need of you he was becoming more certain of his find by the moment the old woman shook her head i have no such skills she said sullenly i am but a poor street performer trying to make a living go away and leave me be she inched farther backward a bit closer to the wooden box her knuckles whitened from her tight grip around the coin bag oh you are far more than a simple woman of the street krassus countered the blood signatures prove that his jaw hardened if he was forced to use violence against her in order to learn the truth then so be it all he cared about was getting his answers what is your name he asked harshly grizelda what of it tell me grizelda are you really what you seem no answer came are you a trained herbmistress perhaps he asked again only silence reigned his patience growing thin he took another step closer are you a blazegazer as well the answers to your questions depend she said sensing an opportunity she stood up and he saw that she was taller than he had first thought on what he asked knowing full well what her answer would be she took a step toward him on what youre willing to pay she answered craftily as you can see i do not eat well my stomach has long pressed emptily against the insides of my ribs for the first time she smiled crookedly at him krassus had suddenly had enough he raised his arm and the familiar azure glow of the craft appeared in the air between them and coalesced into a recognizable shape a human hand with a twitch of one of krassus fingers the hand tore across the remaining distance to the woman and wrapped its glowing fingers around her wrinkled throat the force of the impact was so great that it lifted her off her feet slamming her hard against her wooden box she began to choke drool frothed at one corner of her mouth spilled over to snake crazily down her chin her body shook with the convulsions rattling her starving lungs twisting and turning his hand slightly krassus pointed to her shoes the laces began to untie themselves then the shoes slowly slipped from her feet and fell to the ground with a simple turn of his head krassus caused the small fire the old woman had lit to rise slowly into the air and come to rest just below her burntorange shadows darted across the darkness of the alleyway krassus turned his hand again and the flames licked upward at the soles of her feet her scream came out as a rasp now then he said quietly lets try again are you a blazegazer the old woman nodded very good krassus answered you are now onethird of the way toward staying alive tell me and do not lie believe me you dont have the time are you a trained herbmistress again came a single nod her face was turning from red to light blue and her toes were twitching involuntarily trying to escape the flames im impressed he said two out of three just to see her suffer he paused before asking his final question the moments ticked by slowly dangerously as the flames scalded her naked feet and are you protected by someones time enchantments he asked intently she shook her head finally satisfied he extinguished the flame and let her go she tumbled hard to the dirt of the alley her feet badly burned and her lungs crying out for air youll do he said simply youre coming with me i have need of your services with the toe of one boot he lifted her chin provided of course you have been telling the truth he added but that we will discover later wont we grizelda the haggard herbmistress managed to come to all fours how do you know i wont run away she gasped with a cry she collapsed again and curled up on the dirt of the alley protectively gripping her tortured feet thats simple krassus answered almost politely i traveled halfway across eutracia to find you do you really believe i could not search you out again especially given the short distance you might travel before i discovered you had fled we have a great mission to fulfill you and i disobey me or fail in the demands i shall make of you and you will die do as i say remain successful in the arts you have admitted to possessing and you shall live all she could do was give him a short nod from that moment on she was his he had then gone on to use the craft to heal her feet not because he wished to be kind but because a partial adept who could not keep up would surely prove more of a hindrance than a help and there remained a great deal to do i am ready mlord the herbmistress said now breaking into the wizards reveries once more he turned from the sea to look at her several open bottles of herbs sat on the table next to her their contents spilled out and combined into a pile in the center of the large iron bowl next to her feet you may begin krassus said but first tell me will we be able to hear what they say no she said with certainty for that i would need something truly personal of one of those we wish to view and we still do not know who possesses the other scroll she reached down into the basket again and produced steel and flint without hesitation she struck them together and the pile of herbs came ablaze krassus watched as the flame grew into a bonfire grizelda motioned with one hand and part of the fire separated itself from the main bodya lesser offshoot that would allow her to work in closer proximity to her creation that arm of fire lengthened and flowed parallel to the deck of the ship grizelda tossed a few more herbs into the branch of the flame standing as close to it as she dared she held out a piece of blank parchment recently taken from the scroll of the vagaries then she closed her eyes almost immediately an azure window began to form in the main body of the flame the partial adept opened her eyes and stared into the window in the fire eager to see the results krassus stepped up beside her and looked in what he saw disappointed him and his mouth twisted into a sneer as had been the case every time before when trying to locate the scroll of the vigors all that the gazing window revealed was blackness chapter thirteen t win azure bolts so strong and brilliant that they could barely be looked upon seared across the expanse of the courtyard and smashed into the upright marble column with an earsplitting explosion the ground shook from their impact once again the target had been destroyed rent in two by the sheer force of the magic as the smoke and dust cleared it could be seen that the two huge chunks of marble had been thrown several meters apart many smaller fragments lay nearby their shattered ends still smoldering from the heat well done wigg said but your control over the bolts is still not all it could be remember they are malleable and their shape can be altered to suit your needs once you have mastered this stage it will serve as the foundation for the finer applications of your gift such as slicing through an object manipulating an object or even actually grasping something and lifting it into the air in truth he was stunned by the amazing progress his pupil had made in so short a time now then lets try again he pressed but i want you to attempt a smaller target this time say the piece of column lying on the right smiling he gave her a wink and this time he continued use only one hand fold the thumb and last fingers of your right hand inward and point only the remaining three using those three fingers alone try to sustain the life of the bolts and slice the marble column into three equal segments rather than simply destroying it remember he added almost anyone trained in the craft can use the bolts to destroy but only a master can employ them in a useful way to create something that was not there before a short smile graced his lips whenever youre ready he said quietly yes father celeste answered the earlymorning sun shone down on the courtyard of the royal palace where she and her wizard father stood she was growing tired and wigg knew it but he also knew that her fatigue was an invaluable part of her learning that would serve to build her endurance celeste raised her right arm and trapped her little finger beneath her thumb aiming the three remaining fingers at the piece of marble she loosed three azure bolts one from each fingertip concentrating she turned her head slightly as she forced them to change shape turning them into slim razorsharp edges of gleaming azure they tore across the courtyard in a flash easily finding their marks straining with every fiber of her being she guided the bolts up and down against the columns fluted surface trying to slice through the marble rather than destroy it for a short time she continued to move them successfully up and down against the polished unforgiving surface of the stone but then her aim slipped and with it her concentration the bolts widened out again and the column exploded loudly it shattered into a thousand tiny pieces that flew high into the air before finally falling to the earth like dry dusty rain exhausted she sighed and lowered her arm shailiha walked up caprice her violetandyellow flier of the fields sat perched on her right forearm the way a hunting hawk might you almost did it that time she said trying to reassure celeste surely it wont be long now before you grasp it celeste looked back at shailiha with tired eyes somehow it doesnt feel that way she answered back knowing the pain shailiha was suffering over tristan she tried to give her a reassuring smile then she looked down to examine her fingertips they were red and sore again the effect would lessen over time her father had told her but right now it was one of the prices to be paid for learning to control her gift wigg put an arm around her shoulder he knew he must take the time to teach her to control her forestallment as quickly as possible under no circumstances could he allow another disaster such as the one that had occurred at abbeys cottage but it was hard for her to concentrate these daysand hard for him too worry for tristan filled all their hearts when wigg and celeste had learned of tristans capture their shock had given way to tears their tears then pushed aside by anger and frustration faegan and shailiha could offer no idea as to where the prince might be or what he might be enduring at the hands of krassus and his slavers worse yet they didnt even know whether he still lived after tristans defeat shailiha and faegan had fled back to the campsite and their minion guards knowing the demonslavers couldnt be far behind upon learning of the princes fate ox had gone nearly wild with grief he begged to take his troops few as they might be and fly straight for farpoint in his rage he vowed to tear the town inside out if necessary to find the prince but despite how much he desperately wished to see tristan returned faegan couldnt allow it a dozen minion warriors no matter how brave and skillful would have had little chance against the untold numbers of demonslavers under krassus command besides there was no time as it was the minions had lifted their litter into the sky just as the slavers entered the moonlit glade swords waving with heavy hearts the winged warriors had flown north safely returning the princess and the wizard to tammerland after everyone had returned to the redoubt and told their stories the lead wizard introduced abbey to the group the others did all they could to make her feel welcome but it was obvious that she was wary of her new situation clearly her trust was something that would have to be earned minion warriors were dispatched to her smashed cottage and they returned with her entire collection of books scrolls and ledgers simply cataloguing them again had taken the better part of the last two days their first priority was to find tristan abbey was the key wigg knew to viewing subjects over great distances but the herbs she required to ignite her gazing blaze were in short supply here in the redoubt despite the various species faegan had growing in his atrium for the last several days he and the partial adept had been trying to discover the most efficient way to overcome the shortfall the wizards had of course considered sending squadrons of minions aloft to scout for the ships that faegan and shailiha had seen at the docks in farpoint in case tristan might be aboard one of them but if and when they did sight a ship at sea what were they to do it had been too dark even for faegan to read the names of the vessels that night in farpoint having the minions fly over and board every ship that plied the sea of whispers was not only impossible but might also provoke unnecessary confrontations between the winged ones and what would surely be the terrified confused seamen who saw the fearsome warriors suddenly descending on them nonetheless several thousand of them with the indefatigable ox at their head had volunteered to do just that out of sheer desperation wigg and faegan had finally agreed for the last six days the minions had flown as far out over both land and sea as they could only to return exhausted and disheartened having seen no sign of the prince suddenly the voice of shannon the short broke into his thoughts begging your pardon lead wizard he said but master faegan and abbey have asked that you and the ladies join them in the hall of blood records smoke billowed from the corncob pipe held between his teeth wigg took in the gnomes red hair matching beard and dark eyes shannon was dressed as always in his red shirt blue bibs and upturned shoes a black watch cap sat atop his head and his everpresent ale jug was firmly clamped in one hand shannon took a deep irreverent slug of his brew then wiped his mouth on his sleeve despite his outward courtesy there was always a hint of comic disrespect on the little ones faceespecially where wigg was concerned ever since the lead wizard had met shannon there had never been any question that the gnome accepted none but faegan as his master wigg had never been fond of the gnomes but he had to admit grudgingly that they had become trusted allies their courage had impressed even the lead wizard when they had helped defeat nicholas birds of prey in the invisible valley that guarded shadowood the home they had shared with faegan for more than three centuries shannon cleared his throat they say its important he said wigg raised an eyebrow faegan and abbey had been meeting almost nonstop for the last several days much of that time had been spent with abbey showing faegan her resource materials and explaining what she would need in the way of herbs blossoms and roots while the crippled wizard tried to ascertain whether they were immediately available wigg sighed they needed abbeys abilities desperately just now he hoped with all his heart that they were about to hear good news w hen they reached the hall of blood records they found abbey and faegan engrossed in fervent conversation both looked tired neither noticed the arrival of the others faegan was sitting in a newly constructed chair on wheels at the magnificent mahogany table in the center of the room abbey stood by his side looking over his shoulder at a document every inch of the huge table was covered with abbeys parchments scrolls and ledgers numerous blood signature documents had also been pulled their storage left open drawers yawning rudely before the imposing majesty of the room dozens of bottles of dried herbs sat on the table many of them also open their combined odors spoke both of magic and of the ephemeral hope of success scowling wigg looked first at the argumentative abbey and faegan then back to shailiha and celeste shaking his head slightly he rolled his eyes for three centuries he had wondered what might happen if the proud partial adept and the eccentric wizard in the chair ever met he realized he was about to get his answer while abbeys and faegans voices continued to rise wigg sat down at the table and cleared his throat loudly it didnt help and im telling you that blossom of sintrinium is no substitute for nectar of oleaster abbey shouted she threw her hands into the air it just wont work no matter how much youd like it to if any substitutions are made then either the gazing flame will burn too hot thereby clouding the view or there will be nothing to see at all trust me i know what im talking about these are timehonored formulas and they must be respected half of the palace could go up with your tinkering and i say youre wrong faegan countered angrily slapping one hand down on the arm of his chair looking at them wigg was absolutely certain that this had been going on for some time now and it showed no signs of stopping if your charts of similars say sintrinium will work then why wont it faegans jaw stuck out like the prow of a ship because similar does not mean equal abbey exclaimed this is a delicate process not a parlor trick were trying to ignite a gazing flame you old fool not make rabbits scurry out from under your robes exasperated she ran one hand through her dark graystreaked hair why dont you come and sit down wigg asked abbey startled she glanced at him at last and he pulled out the chair next to him with a loud sigh abbey relented and walked over just before she sat down she placed her lips next to wiggs ear and i used to think that you could be difficult she whispered fighting back a smile the lead wizard turned his eyes to faegan is there a problem he asked politely indeed faegan answered it seems your herbmistress is being uncooperative regarding my proposed substitution of certain ingredients needed for igniting her gazing flame after careful review it seems we do not possess all of the required elements i was only trying to save us a trip back to shadowood where my selection of such goods is far greater and i need remind none of you that time is not on our side is he right wigg asked abbey can we make substitutions to save time abbeys attitude softened a bit at first glance i can understand how faegan might jump to that conclusion she said leaning forward she placed her forearms on the table but what both of you must realize is that the ingredients dont just help create the flamethey also serve as its ongoing fuel the formula must be perfect in addition if you wish me to perform the ritual more than once i shall need quite a lot of these substances if substitutes are allowed it simply will not work leaning back in her chair she looked at the group it seems someone must go to shadowood wherever that is she said simply this means that we must wait even longer before abbey can use her gift to find tristan doesnt it shailiha asked her lovely face had grown hard with frustration and anger she was sick of waiting and she was willing to do anything risk anything to bring her brother back wigg looked at her shailiha had always been strongwilled but until the recent past there had been very little reason for her to display that trait now especially with tristan missing things were vastly different first had come the awakening of her forestallment allowing her to communicate with the fliers of the fields then she had accompanied tristan and faegan to farpoint fighting alongside them as well as any man could have she had taken her first lives and wigg suspected sadly that they would not be her last shailiha tossed back long blond hair and turned her determined eyes to faegan im tired of hearing you blather on about herbs and roots she countered if you and abbey must go to shadowood then do so and quickly but first i have questions and i want the answers now as always princess i will do my best faegan answered respectfully first of all she began that night at the docks i know the slaves were being branded but why what did the two branding irons say pursing his lips faegan laced his gnarled fingers and tried to think of where to begin wigg and i think we have part of the puzzle pieced together but certainly not all of it he said please go on the princess said one of the branding ironsthe one that was used most oftensaid talis that is the old eutracian word for unendowed the other one read rtalis or endowed the men in the blue robes sitting at the table were no doubt consuls of the redoubt some of those who were turned by nicholas and swore allegiance to him they are now unquestionably under the leadership of krassus we also believe that the person with krassus that night was his partial adeptthe one he bragged about the day he infiltrated the palace and attacked wigg when i described her to abbey she agreed that the woman sounded like the one who helped krassus ransack her cottage what were the consuls at the table doing shailiha asked testing the blood of the slaves faegan answered if he or she was unendowed as most of them would be they were branded accordingly if they were endowed they were branded with the other iron but the consuls were doing more than that shailiha remembered there were strange tools on the tables before them i couldnt make out what they were tools like this faegan asked unlacing his fingers he reached under the table and brought out two oddlooking objects the first was a wooden frame holding an hourglass and a small vial the vial contained what looked to be the vibrant red water of the caves of the paragon the hourglass held what seemed to be no more than a dozen tiny black spheres the second device was a threelegged wooden tripod about half a meter in height with a magnifying lens at its top embedded into the lens were dark wire crosshairs the two upper quadrants created by the wires were marked off on each side by degrees from the vertical axis outward stymied all the princess could do was look and wonder she turned to celeste but the look on celestes face made it plain that she was as lost as shailiha wigg pointed to the frame holding the hourglass and the vial this is called a blood criterion its purpose is to assay the quality of endowed blood the lower the assay number the higher the quality of the blood that is being examined the plans for this device were found in the tome of the paragon during faegans first reading of it the ones who came before through their dictates in the tome ordered us to construct it and assay your blood immediately following your births just like the azure glow surrounding your deliveries your blood ratings were further proof to the directorate that you and tristan were indeed the chosen ones at the mention of tristan shailihas face darkened again how does it work she asked its really quite simple wigg explained first the criterion is placed upon a piece of parchment then a drop of the subjects blood is placed on the parchment a specific distance from the criterion the hourglass is turned over at the exact moment a single drop of cave water is released from the vial and lands on the parchment as you have already been taught endowed blood and water from the caves immediately attract but to varying degrees depending upon the quality of the blood the stronger the blood the faster the two seek each other out and join to form a signature the number of spheres that drop in the time it takes for the two fluids to meet equates to the number of the blood quality ingenious celeste said shailiha reached out and drew the tripod device toward her standing she closed one eye and looked down through the lens although simpler in design this tool is as valuable as the criterion wigg went on the plans for it were also found in the tome called a signature scope it is used to determine whether the blood signature on the parchment beneath it leans to the left or the right and to what degree a high blood quality rating coupled with a severe degree of lean one way or the other results in a person of very great potential power indeed reaching out shailiha took up one of the parchments on the table that held a blood signature sliding it beneath the tripod she squared it up as best she knew how then looked down again sure enough she could see a slight tendency to the right she raised her face back up to wigg and you have said that both my signature and tristans lean to the right she mused correct the lead wizard answered and wulfgars blood signature leans as far to the left as you have ever seen regrettably also correct and his blood assay is one and onehalfequal to yours and second only to your brothers which has a bloodquality rating of one wulfgars blood given these particular traits is most probably the most dangerous in the world is there a copy of his signature registered here she suddenly asked nodding wigg caused the appropriate drawer to slide open but this time instead of only the parchment floating over to the table the entire drawer did as it landed shailiha could see that it contained not only a copy of a blood signature but a lock of sandycolored hair bound together with a red ribbon she picked up the lock of hair this came from wulfgar didnt it she asked wigg nodded it was taken from him the morning of the day your mother gave him up he replied softly it was one of her most prized possessions and she felt it rightly belonged here alongside his blood signature wulfgar is the reason why the rtalis are being taken isnt it she asked they are searching for him yes wigg said we believe so in truth they may already have found him but why also take the unendowed celeste asked looking over at her father or the endowed women for that matter if wulfgar is the only one they seek then what theyre doing doesnt make any sense that is still unknown faegan said but considering all of the effort it takes they must have a reason why farpoint shailiha mused quietly what wigg asked why farpoint shailiha repeated why would krassus concentrate his search there and not elsewhere we dont know that he has wigg answered but your question is a good one for the moment we can only suspect that nicholas told him to search there just before he died and where did the demonslavers come from celeste asked from what everyone tells me their like has never been seen in eutracia before now another unknown faegan answered but from what the princess and i saw that night in farpoint i think it safe to assume that though they appear to be a product of magic they have no command of it much like the minions they represent only a blunt instrumentone that is most useful when wielded by others they may be what remained of the consuls mutated by krassus or they may have sprung from another source entirelyconjured perhaps be that as it may it is abundantly clear that they serve only him he paused and sighed unfortunately only time will answer your questions and as i said time is not on our side something suddenly occurred to shailiha can abbey locate wulfgar she asked quickly if he has already been captured perhaps he and tristan are together wigg raised an eyebrow well done he answered he turned to abbey can you view wulfgar from the blood dried on this certificate or from the lock of his hair im afraid its all we have of him he passed them over to her abbey looked intently at them perhaps she answered how old are these samples thirtyfive years wigg answered abbey sighed i wont know until i try blood tends to lose its vibrancy far more quickly than hair so the latter will afford the better chance of success gently touching the locket that hung around her neck she gave wigg a coy smile a slight blush spread across the lead wizards face but as i said before all of this is academic until i have a sufficient quantity of the right ingredients she added wigg looked at faegan clearly our first priority must be to secure from shadowood the goods abbey needs to construct her gazing flame there is something else that must be done shailiha said adamantly i want to lead a party of minions to farpoint well turn the city upside down if we have to to find my brother and bring him homeif hes still there sitting back in her chair she angrily folded her arms over her breasts wigg looked at faegan they had been expecting something like this from her and they also knew that under no circumstances could they allow it in the first place should tristan already be dead it was vital that they not put shailiha in harms way and second it might well be exactly what krassus wanted the opportunity to capture the second of the chosen ones and perhaps to take the palace which would be far too vulnerable without sufficient minion guards to protect it taking a deep breath wigg placed his hands flat on the table and calmly explained to the princess why they could not go through with her plan as he did it was easy to see the anger and frustration build in her face once more for a long time she sat there seething looking down she gently touched the gold medallion lying around her neck then she finally spoke very well she said softly but i refuse to sit here and do nothing while my brother is out there somewhere and in danger she looked at abbey and the herbmistress felt shailihas hazel eyes go straight through her give me a list of things you need and ill go to shadowood myself the princess said ive already been there oncethe gnomes know me the journey is safe enough even you and faegan can agree with that much i should think and i will go with her celeste announced enthusiastically together we will be stronger a slight smile came to shailihas lips absolutely not wigg thundered he glared at the two women as if they were completely mad the telltale vein in his right temple had begun to throb again i can use my gift to protect us if need be celeste said quickly and if we employ faegans portal we wont be gone long at all what could be safer smiling she mischievously tugged the sleeve of her fathers robea gesture she knew always softened his heart youll never even miss us especially given the fact that you now have an old friend here to keep you occupied so to speak she added coyly at that reference to abbey faegan grinned widely wigg blushed and the vein in his temple throbbed even harder you still do not know how to use your gift effectively he argued really celeste asked i already used it once to save your life didnt i wigg looked beseechingly at faegan and what say you to this madness he asked faegan smiled actually i say yes abbey and i will send along a list of our needs to lionel the little the caretaker at my mansion along with a letter of permission from me to give what we need to the ladies you will be bringing back only dried herbs not fresh ones if time permits we may send you back for fresh herbs later why do you want only dried herbs with rare exceptions herbs must be dried before they can be of use in the craft faegan answered and unlike the process used by ordinary cooks the drying of herbs for magic can be long and meticulous in its stagesand our needs are immediate in addition dried herbs are far easier to mix im sure once you reach shadowood lionel will be happy to tell you more he can be amazingly talkative for the first time in days shailiha grinned very well wigg said reluctantly but this little errand of yours should take no more than a single day if the two of you do not come home on the appointed hour i am coming to shadowood myself to get you understood sighing the lead wizard sat back in his chair and looked at the two women who had just bested him chapter fourteen t he woman on wulfgars bed looked him up and down in his robe her eyes filled with hate i see youre already dressed for the occasion she said nastily just do whatever you want to me and get it over with her voice was defiant wulfgar looked at her despite the fact that her sea voyage had made her thin she remained beautiful dark ringlets curled down over her breasts her taffeta gownno doubt supplied by januswas stunning and the yellow complemented her deep blue eyes given her situation he might have expected her to cower before him but she did not only anger showed he immediately found himself respecting her for it and wanting to know more about her no harm will befall you here he said quietly im a slave just like you she let go a short derisive laugh dont lie to me as well as abuse me she looked briefly around the room and then shook her head no slave has quarters such as these taking another step wulfgar pulled down the left shoulder of his robe at first she recoiled but then she saw the brandthe exact duplicate of her own her mouth dropped and she began to relax a little we may have to be slaves for them but we dont have to be for one another he added gently he gestured to the silver table full of food when he did so her eyes greedily followed his would you like something to eat he asked you look very hungry she nodded but it was abundantly clear that she wasnt ready to trust him sensing that she might feel less threatened out on the spacious balcony wulfgar walked over to the breakfast cart and pushed it out into the sun sitting down in one of the upholstered chairs he gazed out over the everrestless ocean come and eat he said casually i promise not to harm you she stood tentatively and walked to the balcony after a cautious look at him she stared straight down over the balcony wall then she raised her eyes and looked out to the west toward eutracia and tears began to form for some time she stood still the only movement the gentle swaying of her ringlets in the salty sea breeze please sit down wulfgar said he fixed a generous plate of food and handed it to her before she had even sat down she snatched it from him and then bent over her prize protectively the way a starving animal might tearing into it as though she hadnt eaten for a lifetime smiling slightly wulfgar waited as she continued to look warily at him in between bites of cheese warm rolls and fruit wulfgar poured her a cup of tea she took it from him greedily still trying to gain her trust he smiled again what is your name he asked where are you from i am serena she answered cautiously another bite of roll went quickly into her waiting mouth of the house of winslow winslow wulfgar asked she nodded from farpoint another nod uncrossing his legs wulfgar leaned forward in his chair and looked intently into her face is your father by chance simon winslow the animal healer surprised she stopped chewing for a moment yes she answered then her eyes narrowed how did you know i know simon well he said smiling we do business his practice is on the west side of town is it not on baylor street i take horses there whenever i am unable to cure them myself your father is very good at what he doesthe best in the city as far as i am concerned my parents are jason and selene of the house of merrick finally starting to believe she stopped chewing and put her plate down for a moment her eyes searched his face the merrick stables she whispered incredulously yes he answered i am their son wulfgar she relaxed a little my father has spoken often of you she said he respects you and jason greatly wishing he could talk to her forever a sudden darker thought crossed wulfgars mind standing and walking from the balcony he went into the bedroom to fetch the hourglass janus had left behind it was the only gauge he had to tell him when the painted freak and his monsters would return when serena saw it again her face hardened why are we here she asked and how is it that you are being treated so differently from the rest of us i dont know he answered they made a great fuss over me when they took my blood at the pier and then i was immediately brought here they are waiting for someone called krassus to arrive apparently he will tell me more he thought for a moment tell me he said how much of this building have you seen did you notice any way out im sorry but i saw no exits she answered honestly and i viewed little compared to the gigantic size of this place i have heard some of the slavers refer to this structure as the citadel all of us with this rtalis mark the men and women alike are kept in gigantic cages they give us just enough food and water to keep us alive new rtalis prisoners arrive every day we have no idea where the people with the other kind of brand are being held or even if they still live every morning janus and his slavers come and take a different selection of us away those taken never return it is all very strange wulfgar looked at the hourglass more than half of the contents of the top globe had already spilled down what happened this morning he asked janus came to us early i now know that it was to select one of the women for you she said ashamedly but none of us knew that then we thought that he was simply taking more of us away when he chose me i was terrified he had me taken to other quarters rather like these this gown was laid out on the bed and there was a room for bathing then her face lowered he watched the entire time as i bathed myself and changed into this dress she whispered all the while he was smiling and clinking those strange spheres of his in one hand it sent shivers down my spine then he and his slavers brought me here along the way i saw many dark hallways lit by torches and a very large open courtyard but most of the time was spent navigating stairways the walk was very long and hundreds of demonslavers filed by us in the halls i also saw a few of the men in the dark blue robes i can tell you that this place this citadel as they call it is very well guarded wulfgars heart fell if there was any way to escape he still hadnt found it there was something else about my walk here she added softly taking him away from his thoughts something horrible what he asked anxiously serena closed her eyes the screaming she whispered please go on he said he could tell she was upset and a part of him hated having to press her further one of the halls we went down was lined with huge marble doors she said shaking her head from the other side came horrible insane screaming from men and women alike it went on and on until we finally rounded the corner and it faded away it didnt seem to bother janus at all she paused to wipe away a tear i cant begin to imagine what was going on behind those doors silence passed for a time when serena felt like talking again they spoke of farpoint and told each other more about their families they ate a bit more and sipped more tea when wulfgar turned to look at the hourglass he saw that very little time remained he looked into serenas eyes do you trust me he asked urgently for a moment she hesitated then seemed to decide yes she finally said good he answered back you were brought here to please me and janus said that if you did not he would punish you i cant allow that to happen come with me he ordered then he stood and led her back into the bedroom where he pushed her gently onto the bed going back to the balcony he retrieved the hourglass and replaced it on the table in the bedroom where janus had left it then he pushed the food cart back into the room hurrying back to the bed he sat down next to her and looked into her eyes if you want to survive this day you must do as i tell you he ordered stand up wulfgar quickly pulled the bedspread and silk sheets apart and purposely tangled them then he mussed up the pillows turn around he ordered to her surprise he quickly began unlacing the back of her gown after it was partially undone he whirled her around to face him then he grasped the bodice of her gown with both hands and tore it down the front partially exposing her breasts ordering her to lift first one foot then the other he removed both her slippers and tossed them aside he ran his hands through her ringlets making a mess of them then he did something even more unexpected reaching down he quickly captured her right hand tightly in his then before she could protest he placed her fingernails hard against his left cheek and scratched himself drops of blood began running from the three scrapes and he purposely did not wipe them away horrified serena looked up into his face tears came to her eyes once more taking her by the shoulders wulfgar shook her trying to get her to focus on what must be done he felt her suddenly go limp as though she had almost given up listen to me he whispered your life depends on it the bolt on the other side of the door will slide open at any moment when it does im going to kiss you kiss me back like you mean it dont stop until i do and then let me do all the talking be surprised by nothing i do or say do you understand slowly the strength he had first seen in her eyes came back she nodded wulfgar took her into his arms and held her tightly untying the sash of his robe he let it fall open pressing his naked body against her he tried as best he could to give her a smile of encouragement turning to look at the hourglass they both saw that the last few grains of sand were sliding into the lower globe for several moments the room went silent the only sounds the beating of their hearts and the waves crashing on the rocky shore below right on time the bolt on the other side of the double doors began to scratch its way across wulfgar turned to look into serenas eyes a final time they both held their breath just as the doors opened a crack he bent her deeply beneath him and put his mouth down on hers the double doors burst open and janus and his slavers walked arrogantly into the room ignoring them wulfgar kissed serena hard letting his hands explore her body as if he owned her understanding serena obeyed him and responded passionately running her hands through wulfgars long blond hair widening her stance she moaned and pulled him harder against her for a moment wulfgar stopped kissing her and bent her back even farther to slowly bury his face in the torn bodice of her dress well done wulfgar heard the painted freak call out as if angry to have been interrupted wulfgar slowly reluctantly stopped what he was doing breathing harder than he needed to he turned his damaged cheek toward janus so the freak could get a good look but he did not let go of serena her body locked tightly against his he felt a quick shudder of fear go through her janus walked over to them and ran his index finger across wulfgars bloody cheek so she can scratch as well he mused but it looks as if you have tamed herat least for the time being he smiled tell me he asked conspiratorially was she good wulfgar let serena go good enough for me to want more he growled as he closed his robe as you can see i had a bit of trouble getting her to disrobe the first time i was about to take her all over again but you returned before i could he gave janus a wicked knowing smile then he looked back to serena its just like breaking a horse he said nastily after the first ride theyre usually far more willing he smiled again its always better when they help smiling janus gave wulfgar a nod then suddenly his eyes narrowed and he took a menacing step closer to serena but if you were going to take her once more why did you let her dress herself again he asked wulfgar thought his heart might stop he hadnt considered this then he remembered something serena had told him about her captor he smiled i like to watch dont you then he shot serena a nasty disparaging look as though she were the lowest whore in creation oh yes janus said indeed i do apparently satisfied he motioned two of his slavers forward take this trollop back where she came from he ordered they immediately grasped serena by both arms and began roughly shoving her toward the door wait wulfgar interjected as he took a brazen step forward one of the slavers drew his sword what he was about to dare was risky he knew but he had to try what is it janus demanded wulfgar let go another leering brutish smile bring her to me again in a day or two he said adamantly i want more wryly rubbing the scratches on his face he looked serena up and down again and give this shecat something better to eat he added commandingly i like them with a few more curves on their bones his demands had been a gamble to be sure despite the lustful look on his face his heart was pounding with worry wondering how the painted freak would react raising an eyebrow janus took two quiet steps closer reached down to the twin spheres hanging from his belt and began clinking them together janus closeness made wulfgar want to cringe but he held his ground the freak turned to study the woman once more then looked back at wulfgar as he smiled the painted red mask crinkled menacingly at the outer edges of his eyes you are clearly in no position to make demands wulfgar he said surely you know that yet i commend your courage i suppose what you request could be granted he smiled again until next time then saying nothing more he went out the double doors as the slavers pushed serena toward them she turned to give wulfgar a final glance there were tears tracing down her cheeks he knew she dared not speak but it didnt matter the thankful look on her face said it all as the great doors closed with finality wulfgar heard the bolt scratch its way across on the other side his chest was heaving closing his eyes he took a deep breath he stood there that way for some time listening to the crashing of the waves as they broke on the rocky shore hundreds of feet below for a short delicious moment he thought he could still smell the perfume she had been wearing then he opened his eyes and walked to the balcony looking down he saw the plate and teacup serena had just used as if it could somehow bring her back he took a sip it was still warm even so his loneliness was already again so great that it was almost as if she had never been here he hung his head for a moment some of what he had just said and done to her sickened him but it had been necessary and despite it he still had no idea whether he would ever see her again or whether he had helped her plight looking out over the sea he watched sadly as the whitesailed masts of yet two more ships broke over the western horizon chapter fifteen k rassus looked at the ancient parchment lying on the table before him the oil lamp hanging from the ceiling cast its golden light down upon it as it countermatched the ceaseless rhythmic swaying of the ship the beautiful script on the dry ancient document seemed to call to his blood beckoning him to enter its timeless infinite wonder the fabled document was truly majestic just as nicholas had promised about one meter long and half a meter in diameter it was rolled around a solid gold rod with a fluted golden knob at each end a wide gold band engraved in old eutracian secured the massive document around its middle heavy marble bookends kept it from rolling off the table he stood and stretched then walked across the sumptuous room and swung open one of the stainedglass windows that lined the curved graceful stern of his flagship dappled sunshine bounced off the frothtipped waves and the salty sea air immediately invaded the room the air was brisk and the sojourner was making good time as she ran before the wind he smiled he already had the male of the chosen onesand the scroll of the vagaries two prizes remained to be secured wulfgar the bastard son of morganna late queen of eutracia and the scroll of the vigors obtaining the first scroll had been simple enough indeed had its mate been there with it as nicholas had promised he would now have them both but when he had finally found and entered the glowing enchanted base of one of the destroyed gates of dawn he had been shocked to find only the scroll of the vagaries present the other had obviously been taken but by whom and why hadnt this one been taken as well the gold that made up their center rods and end knobs alone was worth a kings ransom these confounding questions had plagued him ever since that fateful day and he meant to have his answers the mystery had led him to two frightening conclusions first whoever had taken the other scroll probably had no idea of its overall importance or he would have returned to steal the second one and second if the thief truly did not know what he had then the missing scroll could be in grave dangerthe gold in it melted down for instance and the pages tossed away or destroyed outright his need to find the other scroll intensified with each passing day but he also needed to get to the citadel as soon as possible to begin the other part of his task only one loose end remained to be dealt with as he had learned when invading the wizards minds there was yet another place in eutracia where the herbs blossoms and roots used in blazegazing had been collected in abundanceand his plan for that problem would be accomplished this very day far away from where the sojourner sailed toward the secret island in the sea turning from the window krassus looked at the two other persons in the room grizelda sat in a chair on the opposite side of the table she looked tired and worn under krassus orders she had been using her gazing blaze to try to locate the scroll of the vigors her approach had been to employ bits of blank vellum taken from the edges of the scroll already in their possession in the hope that they would be enough of a match to let her view the whereabouts of its mate so far she had been unsuccessful this greatly angered krassus for it might also mean that there was no way to find the missing scrolls from a distance or worse it might indicate that the scroll he sought had already been destroyed these were not scenarios he was willing to accept the other person seated at the table was tristan bound to his chair he was still unconscious due to the spell cast over him he looked pale and drawn and the dark stubble on his face was becoming thicker by the day his head slumped down toward his chest krassus looked back at grizelda i think its time for the good prince to rejoin the world he said simply the herbmistress face darkened with worry begging your pardon my lord but are you sure this is wise you said yourself that he can be very dangerous even though he is still untrained and the scroll is here in this very room do you really want him to see it her face suddenly pinched with fear that she had just overstepped her bounds what difference could it possibly make krassus replied confidently given his situation he cannot possibly harm us and i want him to see it i want the chosen one to know how close we are to vanquishing his wizards before he is forever confined within the purgatory that is the citadel pausing for a moment krassus face became harder besides he is of little importance he continued if he dies he dies and if he survives the voyage he will live out his days as a slave on the citadelunless i finally decide to kill him of course either way i win with that krassus narrowed his eyes and the glow of the craft began to surround the prince moaning softly tristan began to stir weakly he lifted his face his eyes were glazed and his jaw was slack drool dripped from the corners of his mouth welcome back chosen one krassus said quietly you have been gone five days you are groggy but you are basically well and should suffer no lasting effects from my ministrations i trust your dreams were pleasant trying to focus his eyes tristan looked blankly around the room through the haze of his vision he saw grizelda and the scroll resting on the table before him but his first concerns were not for them or for himself faegan and shailiha he croaked anxiously his throat so dry it might have been made of paper are they dead krassus smiled no im sorry to say they are not but it wasnt for my lack of trying the bridge faegan so cleverly conjured allowed them to get away but it seems the poor quality horse you were on didnt make it to the other side your sister and the crippled wizard were lifted into the air by your minions just as my slavers began to corner them in the woods tristan turned his attention to the haggard woman seated next to him at the table and this must be your partial adept he rasped the woman you bragged about in the palace she was with you on the docks shes lovely his head slumped forward again how droll krassus said but i suggest you save your sense of humor where youre going you will surely need it as he smiled the creases in his thin cheeks deepened raising his head tristan tried desperately to clear his mind he looked at the majestic scroll on the table the scroll of the vagaries he asked yes krassus answered simply and my brother wulfgar tristan asked what of him unfortunately he still eludes my grasp krassus sighed but it is only a matter of time until we find him his mind finally clear tristan thought for a moment looking down he saw that he was bound hand and foot with heavy strands of rope and he could not reach his weapons that was when he first realized that either the room was rocking or his mind still was then the oil lamp swinging from the ceiling and the sounds and smells coming from the open window finally told him they were at sea as his powers of concentration strengthened so did the anger in his heart he focused his eyes on krassus something the wizard had just said had sparked a question within him you mentioned farpoint tristan said slowly what makes you think wulfgar is there krassus smiled i see no harm in answering that he said your son nicholas told me to search there just before he met his untimely death atop the gates of dawn surely you remember that day tristans brows came together in a frown how could nicholas have known the heretics of the guild told him krassus said your esteemed sons magnificent powers allowed him mental communication with the hereticsor didnt you know that the wizards expression was one of wicked glee from their place in the heavens they see everything he added in fact due to my illness i will soon be joining them it is a reward i look forward to where are you taking me tristan growled to a place that is almost as old as the craft itself krassus answered nicholas told me of it and it is said that many of magics greatest secrets can be found there some even say it is one of the places where it all began if the winds hold we should arrive there in less than a fortnight tristan tried to twist his hands back and forth testing his bonds they were completely unforgiving he turned his eyes back to krassus this ship is full of slaves you branded that night on the farpoint docks isnt it he asked of course and the consuls seated at the tablesthey were testing the slaves blood werent they then you ordered them branded accordingly so that it would be easier to tell them apart later on smiling krassus turned to grizelda see my dear he said i told you he was clever he turned back to tristan meet grizelda chosen one she is my personal partial adept blazegazer and herbmistress she is the one who will find the scroll of the vigors for me unless wigg and faegan find it first tristan said menacingly oh that will be quite impossible after today krassus answered happily before we sailed i ordered something be done in eutracia it is happening as we speak and it will change everything tristans blood went cold what are you talking about he demanded no reply came tell me you bastard oh no chosen one krassus said gently almost as if he were talking to a child that would be revealing too much silence settled over the room for a moment why do you need all of these slaves tristan finally asked of what possible use could they be to you for much the same reason i require your brother krassus smiled but you will probably go to your death never having learned the answer then the look in the wizards eyes intensified and he leaned forward lovingly placing his hands on either side of the massive scroll you have yet to ask the one question that i thought would be foremost in your mind chosen one krassus said and that is tristan asked skeptically why i allow you to live the wizard answered quietly for a time tristan continued to glare at krassus then he glanced at the haggard herbmistress grizelda only smiled back wickedly exposing the absence of several teeth very well tristan finally said why because i want to bear witness as you pay for your sins krassus hissed softly the sin of killing your only son nicholas the messiah who was also my master thats why were having this little talk as you find yourself suffering by my hand today and in the future i want you to know why tristans jaw hardened the wizards continual mentions of nicholas conjured up conflicting emotions within him he glared hatefully at the wizard across the table i would see him die a thousand times again if need be tristan whispered venomously he was of my seed that much i cannot deny but he was conceived in an act of violence and against my will his azure blood was adulterated with forestallments placed there by the heretics of the guild forcing him to cherish only the vagaries much the same way i suspect he tainted your blood seeing the anger rising in krassus face tristan smiled having nothing to lose he decided to press but in truth how perfect could nicholas have been after all his blood failed him just when he needed it most did it not he again paused for a moment allowing the import of his words sink in i didnt kill nicholas he finished i didnt have to his own imperfections did that job for me while i watched and i enjoyed it krassus temper suddenly reached the boiling point standing up he pointed an angry finger at the prince liar he screamed standing he walked around the desk he slammed his fist into tristans face with a force so great that the princes head hit the back of the chair azure blood snaked down from one corner of tristans mouth as he shook his head trying to clear his mind grasping tristans hair krassus violently jerked the princes face up to meet his tristans eyes fluttered open bruises were already showing beneath the dark stubble youre very good at beating people who cant fight back arent you tristan croaked why dont you just use the craft to do it traitor krassus bent over the prince until their noses almost touched because sometimes this is far more enjoyable he whispered and as i told the lead wizard that day in the palace ive been ill i will kill you tristan snarled through his pain i swear it you represent nothing but evil like nicholas i will watch you die just as i watched him and i will enjoy that too krassus wrenched the princes head up farther evil he replied he who has yet to be trained dares to call me evil dont you know that there is no such thing as good or evil chosen one there is only the vigors or the vagaries there is still so much your wizards have not told you but i would have thought your experiences with the coven of sorceresses would have taught you something tell me dear prince do you really believe failee was evil or was she simply doing what she was born to do compelled to do given the undeniable call of her leftleaning signature did she truly have a choice dont you see you fool it is the same with me im not evil i dont even know the meaning of the word once again he smiled wickedly you see my dear prince i simply have a different point of view with that krassus again slammed his fistwith a force supplemented by the craftinto tristans face this time the blow was even harder it launched the chair off its feet and sent it crashing backward to the floor the prince immediately went unconscious wasting no time krassus walked to the door and violently threw it open several demonslavers entered immediately swords drawn get this abomination of the craft out of my sight krassus ordered them pointing down at the prince signal the wayfarer and order her to come alongside transfer this refuse to her i want him immediately ordered to the wayfarer he is to man an oaring station and keep him in his clothesi want him easily singled out from the rest it should be most interesting to observe how that famous azure blood of his holds up looking down at the bloodied prince the wizard smiled again well see how much he likes to row he added softly begging your pardon my lord one of the slavers said what shall we do with his weapons as krassus looked at the princes dreggan and throwing knives his lips came up into a sneer strip him of them he answered have them transferred to the other ship i want nothing of this bastard left around to remind me of him untying tristan from his chair the slavers lifted him up as if he were a rag doll and dragged him from the room on his toes chapter sixteen s hailiha came awake first groaning slightly she shook her head and opened her eyes to the sky above the weather was unsettled in shadowood with dark slowmoving clouds randomly checkerboarded among the white the breeze was fairly strong waving the new grass to and fro and carried with it the unique fresh smell of coming rain shailiha took a deep breath and sat up slowly trying to clear her mind from the effects of faegans portal not far from her celeste was stirring in the grass rising to her knees the redhaired beauty lowered her head and shook it back and forth lightly before tossing back her long hair she gave the princess a sly smile shailiha smiled back of course the wizards would never have allowed her to lead the minions against farpoint she and celeste had known that from the startjust as they had known that making that request was likely to result in the granting of a second request neither woman was willing just to sit by like some dainty ladyinwaiting doing anything was better than nothing even if that meant going herb hunting for a threehundredyearold partial adept both women were dressed in black trunk hose kneehigh riding boots and leather jerkins with long closefitting sleeves shailihas was brown celestes dark gray the jerkins were gathered at the waist by broad leather belts on their hands they wore tight black leather gloves and daggers hung from their right hips in sheaths that were tied around their thighs shailiha also carried a short sword at her left hip upon the swords gold hilt was engraved the lion and the broadsword the heraldry of the house of galland reaching beneath her jerkin the princess searched for both the list of goods that abbey had given her and the letter of permission that faegan had penned for lionel the little to her relief they were both still there it seems we have finally made it after all celeste said we had best hurry though youre right shailiha answered as she readjusted the baldric that held her sword then she paused taking a sniff of the air for a moment she had thought she smelled smoke but no she must have been mistaken as she rose to her knees she smiled again at her friend for a moment there i thought the vein in wiggs temple was going to she stopped in midsentence holding one hand out to indicate silence she wrinkled up her nose again this time the smell was unmistakable placing one finger vertically over her lips shailiha indicated that celeste should follow her on all fours through the grass wiggs daughter nodded back the short ridge that lay just uphill would look down onto the area where the gnomes lived casting her eyes to the sky the princess could now see the dark acrid smoke that was finding its way to her nostrils she began to crawl celeste right behind her as the women approached the ridge they went down on their stomachs and wriggled the final distance to the top as shailiha cautiously raised her head to look down the air left her lungs in a rush tree town was on fire at least half of the beautifully intricate houses and the huge magnificent trees that held them were wildly ablaze flames shot up toward the darkening sky thick black smoke billowed out of collapsing roofs and smashed windows like dark undulating rivers rising to lay over the town in a gloomy cloud gnome children ran about screaming for their parents the adults had formed bucket brigades from the well in the center of the glade but without their master faegan here to help them with the craft they were clearly fighting a losing battle holding her breath she tried to peer through the smoke and locate the distinct roofline of faegans mansion finally seeing it she let out a small sigh of relief somehow it seemed unaffected by the fire and then out of the corner of her eye she saw the demonslavers dozens of the awful monsters were pouring around a corner screaming and waving swords torches and tridents laughing wickedly they tossed their torches into an area of stillintact homes immediately the dwellings burst into flames armed with pitchforks and knives a group of male gnomes started bravely for the demonslavers but were hacked to death amid the fire blood and screaming some of the whiteskinned monsters were walking about in triumph holding up their tridents with dead gnomes impaled upon them lowering her head for a moment shailiha was sure she was about to be ill but abruptly unexpectedly the sounds of havoc stopped leaving only the snapping and roaring of the flames and the crying and moaning of the gnomes shailiha risked another look the demonslavers had gathered the surviving gnomes into a group and forced them to their knees one of the slavers shouted a command then another group of slavers rounded a corner carrying dozens of large canvas bags stuffed full and tied shut they piled three of the bags on the ground and gleefully touched their torches to them the oddlooking bags went up in flames emitting a riot of unfamiliar odors and colors as the flames went higher and the bags were consumed more were thrown on the burning pile shailiha knew it wouldnt be long before all the remaining bags had been turned to ashes then a realization seized her and she closed her eyes the slavers hadnt been sent here simply to kill gnomes or to destroy tree town she and celeste had to act and act soon she turned to speak to celeste but suddenly a sharp penetrating scream forced her eyes back down to the horrifying scene two of the slavers had stepped forward taken hold of one of the male gnomes and were swinging him over the burning bags the more he screamed the closer to the fire they lowered him then his clothing erupted into flames and laughing they dropped him in shailiha turned desperately to celeste can you kill them she whispered urgently at first a look of concern came over celestes face but then she nodded i can try she said but i cannot be sure i will not kill some of the gnomes as well better that only some of the gnomes die quickly at your hand than all of them die that way shailiha responded she looked down in horror to see that the two slavers were dragging another screaming gnomea female this timetoward the burning bags when you see me coming out of the woods at their right stand up and do your best then run down the hill as fast as you can continuing to kill any of them that might have survived im sorry but that is as much of a plan as i have and there is no time silently she drew her sword and whatever you do try your best not to kill me before celeste could say anything more the princess was gone crawling off to the right through the grass celeste raised her head up a bit she tried to follow shailihas progress but the brown leather of the princess jerkin made her blend in with the surroundings and then finally celeste saw her standing just inside the edge of the woods at the bottom of the hill her chest heaving and her palms wet shailiha stood with her back against a tree her sword held upright as she tried to steady herself slowly silently she turned her head to look the two demonslavers were laughing and swinging the screaming gnome over the fire as the others cheered them on and it seemed that they might drop her in at any moment embers were already teasing the hem of her dress and threatening to burst it into flames looking up at the ridge shailiha caught a sliver of celestes red hair just over the tops of the swaying grasses thinking of tristan and morganna she closed her eyes for a moment gathering her courage and then her sword held high she ran out into the glade celeste acted immediately standing straight up she raised her right arm and pointed her fingers a magnificent azure bolt shot from her hand in a continuous stream just as it had yesterday in the courtyard with her father looking on the bolt screamed down over the grassy field straight toward the demonslavers taunting the gnomes continuing to sustain the bolt celeste ran down the hill as fast as her legs could carry her sawing into a group of slavers the bolt exploded dozens of slavers flew into the air their torsos blown apart organs and blood splattering all over the glade the surviving slavers scattered looking around for the source of the magic still running down the hill celeste manipulated the bolt by turning her hand trying to avoid the gnomes and kill the straggling slavers many of the horrible monsters went down but not all of them screaming shailiha ran at the first of the two who had been torturing the gnome a surprised look came to the slavers face then his white eyes went wide with horror as he realized he was already too late with a single perfect stroke shailiha took his head off at the shoulders blood erupted everywhere and the scalded gnome went flying landing to one side in the grass just as tristan had taught her she wasted no time gloating over her victory and instead spun on her heels like a dancer searching for the other slaver but she was not as experienced as her brother and she was too slow had her sword not already been raised she would have died there and then as the second slavers blade came singing down at her the two swords clashed together sparks flying from their razorsharp edges and the princess immediately knew she had lost the upper hand turning she backed up on the balls of her feet as quickly as she could to afford herself some maneuvering room but her opponent was just as fast the tall whiteskinned monster slashed relentlessly raining down blow after blow forcing her to keep backing up she nearly panicked when she felt the heat of the fire licking at her back and realized she had nowhere left to go as the monsters blade came whistling through the air yet another time she knew she had only one option left raising her sword with both hands she purposely fell to one side before the roaring fire the monsters blade flashed over her head its edge coming so close that she felt it tearing through the ends of her long blond hair just as her right hip touched the ground she brought her blade around with all her strength slicing through the slavers calves screaming wildly he fell to the ground next to her coming quickly to one knee shailiha raised her sword high and rammed its point straight down between the slavers eyes and out the back of his head impaling his skull she stood put one boot against his face and pulled back hard on her sword freeing it blood dripping from her hands and blade she quickly looked around dead slavers and gnomes lay everywhere celestes bolts had ceased and an eerie quiet descended over the glade punctuated only by the snapping of the fires and the somewhat more subdued crying of the surviving gnomes turning frantically to search for celeste the princess found her alone at the edge of the glade her right hand still outstretched the tips of her fingers were badly scorched before her knelt three demonslaversapparently the last of those remaining alive disarmed their weapons in a pile a short distance away they glared up defiantly with a hatred that made shailihas blood run cold shailiha walked to celeste and gratefully placed a hand upon one of her shoulders are you all right she asked without taking her eyes off the slavers celeste nodded if any of them make the slightest move kill them all shailiha said sternly one corner of celestes mouth turned up love to she answered her eyes never wavering shailiha walked back to the site of the battle some of the survivors had begun to gather up their dead and wounded while others remained bent over the victims small broken bodies and sobbed it seemed to shailiha that the wailing might never stop another group of survivors had formed bucket brigades and they were furiously working on the fire she was heartened to see that some of the homes might be spared after all seeing her coming some of the stunned gnomes stepped tentatively forward a few of them fell at her feet kissing her bloody boots some others wrapped their arms around her legs weeping openly as the gnomes gathered around her shailiha lowered her head looking at what was once tree town she saw that the houses that had been set alight were all but gone the charred ash of their remains cradled strangely in tree branches that stretched forth like dark skeletal fingers but about a third of the houses seemed to have been spared including faegans mansion about a dozen of the canvas bags that the slavers had been burning remained untouched she turned back to the gnomes i am shailiha princess of eutracia she said loudly some of you might recognize me from the last time i was here tell me does lionel the little still live at first no one spoke no one moved and shailihas heart fell then the crowd parted slightly to allow an old gnome to pass through his head was bald and shiny with a single island of gray wispy hair growing in the center of where his hairline used to be sharp highly intelligentlooking eyes stared back at her he was dressed in dark torn trousers a matching shirt and vest and upturned shoes he came to stand before the princess and bowed his head briefly i am lionel he said on behalf of all of us i would like to thank you for what you have done i would he said oddly the gnomes standing around him buzzed with agreement with a bloody hand shailiha reached beneath her jerkin and retrieved both the letter faegan had written and the list abbey had provided she gave him the letter first seeing faegans familiar red wax seal on the back of the envelope lionel took it from her eagerly reaching into his vest he produced a pair of cracked spectacles pinching them as best he could into place near the end of his nose he broke the seal on the envelope and opened the letter as he read shailiha gave another quick anxious glance back at celeste and the captive slavers nothing had changed i understand yes i do lionel finally said refolding the letter for some reason he looked even more crestfallen than before and shailiha was reasonably sure she knew why and your list he asked quietly the princess handed it to him this will be nearly impossible you know he said apologetically as he scanned the list in the end there may be little i can do yes very little i understand but it is imperative that we try shailiha answered she turned to look at the slavers then faced lionel again please take your survivors away from here she half asked half ordered him you may come back later for your dead we will join you at faegans mansion but first there is something i must do and your people have already seen enough understanding lionel carefully folded the list and tucked it into a vest pocket i will await you both i will he said simply in the meantime i will do what i can after an indication from the diminutive caretaker a few of the male gnomes picked up the remaining canvas bags then as a whole the crowd began to trudge tiredly out of the glade still holding her bloody sword shailiha walked back to the three slavers celestes arm was still raised poised to let go another bolt the demonslavers continued to glare at them with their strange white eyes without speaking shailiha came to stand before the first of them bending down she wiped her sword in the grass cleaning its blade of demonslaver blood and slid it back into its scabbard then she drew her dagger from the sheath on her right thigh after blatantly running his white eyes up and down her body the demonslaver leered up at her smiling he ran his black tongue up and over his lips youre pretty bitch shailihas eyes narrowed you arent with a quick unforgiving stroke she slashed the dagger across the slavers throat blood rushed out cascading down his chest at first his eyes registered surprise then glazed over raising her right boot shailiha kicked him beneath the chin launching him over onto his back she stood there for a moment listening to the desperate gurgling sounds as the life force poured out of him she walked before the second of them placing the dagger hard against one of the things lower eyelids she gave it just enough of a nudge that a single drop of blood ran slowly down the daggers blood groove and onto the handle with her free hand she pointed to the slaver she had just killed that was an object lesson she said quietly i want some answers and i want them now krassus sent you here to eradicate faegans stores of herbs didnt he thats what was in those canvas bags you were burning tell me how much of it did you destroy the second slaver just looked up at her then he spat all the saliva he could muster into her face with a single thrust shailiha drove the point of the dagger upward cleaving the monsters eyeball blood and vitreous fluid poured out of the ruptured orb as the point of the knife continued on slicing into his brain as she pulled it back out his face contorted into a mask of pain and he fell facedown at her feet she stood there quietly for a moment watching his tortured death throes and listening to the last bit of breath rattle from his lungs calmly slowly she stepped before the third of them hopefully you are bright enough to have learned by example she said pressing the bloody point of her dagger up against the base of his right eye ill keep this simple she snarled where is my brotherthe man you took away that night in the alley fight in farpoint the slaver smiled up at her he is off to the place that is the most horrible on earth he said softly some even say it is the birthplace of the craft it is a place from which your brother will never return and even if he did you would find him quite unrecognizable your highness he paused for a moment and smiled again showing pointed black teeth so kill me if you must he hissed for i will tell you no more no death by your hand could ever match the horrors that would be visited on me by krassus should i talk her mind made up shailiha took a step backward resheathing her dagger she drew her sword and grasped it with both hands then she walked around behind the slaver and raised the sword high swinging it down and around with everything she had she beheaded the thing with a single stroke celeste dropped her tired arm and they looked at each other shailiha held her sword limply its point hanging toward the ground thunder rumbled softly across the sky then the wind picked up blowing the debris of the battle around in little maelstroms shailiha cast her tired eyes upward the clouds had become darker and the rain suddenly began as the water collected on the ground it swept up the fresh blood of both the tortured and the tormentors into little red rivers flowing through the grass shailiha sheathed her sword and then she and celeste walked into the charred remains of tree town chapter seventeen y oure worried arent you abbey asked wigg took a deep breath and let it out slowly he had of course known that celeste and shailiha had been trying to maneuver him into letting them go to shadowood he knew too that his eventual agreement to their request had perhaps not been altogether prudent but he also understood their frustration at being virtual prisoners here in the palace while tristan remained missing and so knowing how much each of them cared about the prince he had finally relented wigg sighed on the surface of it letting the two strongwilled women go alone had at first seemed safe enough especially given the emergence of celestes forestallment in his more than three hundred years of experience in the craft he had never seen bolts so dynamic as those his daughter could now command while it was true that she needed more training the degree of power she already possessed was unmistakable but now that they were gone he was having misgivings about his decision he scowled if celeste and shailiha did not exit faegans portal tomorrow by the end of the appointed hour he would enter the enchanted passageway himself and bring them back by their ears if he had to would that retrieving tristan could be as simple four seasons of new life before wigg had himself chosen krassus for the position of first alternatea fact that added heavily to the lead wizards increasing sense of guilt at the time krassus had been everything the wizards could have asked for he was very powerful and learned for a consul and seemed humbly steadfastly devoted to the exclusive practice of the vigors famous among the brotherhood for the number of good deeds he had performed he was well known for his compassion and patienceso much so that wigg had nominated him to the post without the slightest reservation the directorate had heartily agreed installing him into the lofty position by unanimous vote even when nicholas had begun abducting the consuls to help him construct the gates of dawn wigg had hoped that krassus might be among those who had eluded his grasp but all that had changed that day in the gaming room when krassus appeared with his evil demands the krassus that wigg had observed that day had been far more than simply evil he had also been angry impatient and quick to employ force without thinkingmuch the same way the sorceresses of the coven had been not only had he become far more powerful than ever before but he clearly now had a wild unpredictable side making him the worst possible kind of enemy and his new illnessthe sudden violent coughing up of endowed bloodremained a mystery the memory of the unmistakable glint of depravity in those eyes made wigg more fearful for tristans welfare with each passing moment they simply had to have the goods from shadowood as quickly as possible if there was ever to be any hope of finding the prince and bringing him home alive a kisa for your thoughts abbey said breaking into his reveries turning over in wiggs huge fourposter bed she raised herself up on one elbow and smiled lifting his left hand he gently ran the backs of his fingers down her cheek you surprised me this night he said softly although i cannot say i am disappointed three hundred years is a long time lead wizard she teased in spite of the time enchantments moving her face closer to his she smiled again a girl shouldnt have to wait forever you know simply because forever has been made available to her wigg smiled back at her it was well after midnight and from the open doors of his balcony came the gentle peeping of the tree frogs and the sound of the breeze as it rustled through the palaces once welltended gardens the night sky was clear and the stars twinkled brightly as if winking to the lovers that the heavens knew of their secret and approved occasionally the form of a silent patrolling warrior could be seen eerily silhouetted in black flying across the triplet spheres of the rosecolored moons in his worry over tristan shailiha and celeste wigg had been unable to sleep it had already been late when the door to his chambers had unexpectedly opened then quietly closed again he had sat up in bed and raised his arm ready to defend himself then hed seen abbeys form move silently across the doorframe of the open moonlit balcony he had tried to speak but shed moved to the bed and placed a finger delicately across his lips shed dropped her robe to the floor and stood for a moment her body shining in the rosecolored light then she lowered herself into his bed wigg had taken her into his arms and their three hundred years of separation had finally truly come to an end turning wigg looked into her eyes i am most worried about the prince he said the herbmistress felt warm next to him and she smelled pleasantly of the many fragrances of her art the longmissed sensations were both familiar and good tell me truly he asked if you have the right supplies will you be able to find him narrowing her eyes with thought she shook her head and sighed it would be far better if i had something truly of his body like a lock of his hair or a clipping of toenail she answered but he and the princess are twins so her hair may be sufficient or perhaps a drop of her blood but remember even if the flame allows us to see him unless you or the others can identify some landmark or city we still will not know where he is i will do all i can of course but it may not be enough and this ancient scroll krassus spoke ofwhat of that viewing that will be much more difficult even impossible i daresay i would need something of the scroll itself and we do not have such a sample attempting to view that document will be like trying to find a needle in a sneezeweed stack while wearing both a blindfold and pair of mittens and wulfgar hopefully the lock of his hair will work i will only know for sure once i try i know this is not what you wanted to hear but thats how things are nonetheless silence reigned for a moment as they each retreated into their private thoughts they love each other dont they abbey asked unexpectedly who he asked back tristan and celeste she replied she smiled again after having known the lead wizard for so long she could easily tell when he was being purposely obtuse and she wasnt about to let him get away with it only a fool could miss the attraction they have for each other she went on although i am not sure even they realize how strong it is oddly it is sometimes the lovers themselves who are the last to know wouldnt you agree wigg remained silent for a moment then one corner of his mouth turned up yes he answered softly youre right about a great many things but still they do not act upon it she said why is that do they think it might displease you it wouldnt wigg answered in fact i would welcome it to see tristan the male of the chosen ones whom i have loved with all my heart and celeste the daughter i have only just discovered finally unite would truly be one of the most joyous days of my life but part of the reason tristan does not act on his love for her i think is because he fears it might change his relationship with me and it no doubt would but not in the ways he probably imagines the greater worry in this is celeste and she troubles me deeply tristan understands this other concern as well i can see it in his eyes and i suspect it is yet another reason why he hasnt tried to more deeply enter the recesses of her heart in short he is being a gentleman lowering herself down abbey laid one side of her face on wiggs chest i dont understand tristan is waiting for her psyche to heal wigg answered sadly and that may never happen celeste never speaks of the abuse she suffered at the hands of ragnar it is as if she believes that by denying it she can erase that part of her past but until she voluntarily admits those horrors to herself embraces them as an indelible part of her past and then finally lets them go she will never stop hiding behind the shield of denial that she carries the same shield i suspect that bars tristan from coming closer i saw all too much of this during the aftermath of the sorceresses war three hundred years ago i never believed i would ever have children but i felt sure that if i did as lead wizard i would be able to protect them how wrong i was wigg paused for a moment thinking i have two other equally deep regrets you know he said softly tell me abbey found herself saying even though she was quite sure she knew what at least one of them would be the first of them is you he answered quietly you know that i should never have voted with the directorate to ban the partial adepts it was cruel and unnecessary as were so many of our decisions of those days instead i should have resigned my seat and gone away with you we could have had the last three hundred years together and the directorate could just as easily have gone on without me raising her head abbey looked deeply into his eyes no she said adamantly youre wrong everything happens for a reason your destiny was to rule the directorate and oversee the birth and growth of the chosen ones and then with tristans help to save shailiha and the paragon from the depravity of the coven just as it was mine to live alone and hone my arts in the hartwick woods so that i might return to help you when you needed me most had you voted against the directorate and then deserted tammerland the world would today exist only as a plaything of the sorceresses in your heart you know that you stayed here because it was your fate just as we now find ourselves together again through a different yet similar act of fate that is clear to me now and forgiving you is unnecessary you did what you had to do dont you see and now all is finally as it should be she moved her body a bit closer to his to ward off the breeze wafting in from the balcony even if it did take you three hundred years to come around she added impishly wigg laughed softly and the other regret she asked wulfgar wigg said the late king and queen charged me and the consuls with the burden of finding him but we never did i made a secret pilgrimage to the wizards orphanage that gave him away of course and i spoke to the head matron but by the time i arrived at the address she had given me the family had moved and i never found their trail again thats understandable i suppose given the size of the nation and the passage of time but i can feel wulfgars presence out there somewhere just as i can feel tristans and my heart tells me that they are both in grave danger their paths may even cross someday without either of them knowing who the other truly is i must find them both before it becomes too late wigg lay back into the luxurious sheets thinking i can only hope that if i find wulfgar circumstances will not make it necessary for me to kill him he said in a low voice it is an order from my queen that has plagued me for decades and i dont think my heart could survive it they lay there together quietly for a time listening to the wind so many secrets wigg finally said half to himself and each of them more a burden than a blessing i assure you abbey smiled knowingly and still so many you have yet to share with us im sure oh yes wigg answered simply many secrets indeed there is still so much that tristan shailiha and especially wulfgar do not know about themselves things that only time will allow me to teach them and time is running out and what about our secret abbey asked the one we formed here this night shall we tell the others wigg thought for a moment no i think not he said smiling at her i have been without you for over three centuries and i would like to keep this part of our relationship to ourselves if we can call me overbearing if you wish but you are new to both the palace and the redoubt the others will find out soon enough there is no need for us to hurry that day forward and when they do discover it rest assured that their teasing will be merciless in fact celeste and shailiha have in some ways already started his infamous right eyebrow arched up driving home his point very well she said sleepily wigg lay silent for a moment thinking faegan will know without being told of course he mused how abbey asked softly sleep had finally come padding to her on silent cats paws and her eyes were closing as wigg ran his hand through her long hair he listened to her breathing deepen hes a wizard he whispered to her softly as she drifted off in his arms and wizards always know chapter eighteen w hump whump whump the incessant sound of the beatmasters hammer seared through tristans head like a dagger as he pulled hard on his oar the heat in the galley was overpowering as was the stench bound in chains weaponless he found himself surrounded by other men in the same straits trying to row as best they could lest they suddenly be struck with either the lash or the trident for some reason he had been allowed to remain in his clothes rather than being forced to don the shabby loincloth all the others wore and the food they gave him was better than that given to the others this had caused furtive distrustful glances from his fellow slaves making him feel like an outcast worse in the increased heat his clothes made him more fatigued and dehydrated by now he actually envied the others the simple almost indecent rags they wore as he rowed doing his best to keep up sweat poured off him and his muscles felt as if they were about to crack apart he watched with hatred as the whiteskinned slaver before them hammered out the incessant mindnumbing beat other slavers strode arrogantly up and down the alleyway using their gruesome weapons with impunity he had not been struck yet but knew it would only be a matter of time before that happened tristan was positioned in the front row in the first seat to the immediate right of the alleyway as he pulled the oar to his chest over and over again he looked down at the number that had been so crudely carved into its handle one despite the desperate nature of his situation his mouth turned up slightly at the irony suddenly a wave of nausea rolled over him he had no choice but to bend over toward the pitching deck and just let it happen by now this had occurred so often that nothing but clear bile emerged the sounds of sick men retching were almost continual and the unrelenting stencha combination of vomit blood and urineonly added to his queasiness tristan had not been surprised when he first became seasick for he was completely unaccustomed to being on the water in fact he knew very little about oceangoing vessels since the end of the sorceresses war more than three hundred years earlier the monarchy had sponsored no navy given the fact that the sea of whispers was supposedly uncrossable from any direction and that no other nation at that time had been known to exist a seagoing force had been deemed unnecessary but the unexpected return of the coven and the revelation of how they had crossed the ocean had changed all that for some time tristan had been acutely aware of the vast importance of the minion armada anchored just off the coast of parthalonan armada that he now supposedly commanded but the ships might as well have been moored on one of the three moons for all the good they could do him the view out the oar slit in the hull told him that the ship was traveling east but to where parthalon what in the name of the afterlife was krassus trying to accomplish tristan looked down at his chains they bound him not only to the deck floor but to the rest of the oarsmen each of them had the word talis seared into his shoulder tristan had not been branded but he had the distinct impression that they were all expendable including him the chain system made that point should the ship founder the slaves linked together as they were would never be able to get out in time number one he thought as he pulled the heavy oar to his chest here he was no longer the crown prince of eutracia or even the chosen one just number one and number one would be granted no special favors or undue mercy as of yet no one seemed to have recognized him he was simply one of the slaves trying to stay alive another day and here there were no wizards to help him escape just then a demonslaver came down the stairway from the deck above raise oars he shouted at once the relentless pounding of the hammer stopped as a group the slaves lifted their oars from the sea of whispers and held them still just a few feet above the waves tristan knew what was about to happen for he had seen this ritual before a fresh beatmaster had come to take the place of the one who had just served it seemed to happen every four hours or so during which time the slaves did not row tristan obediently pushed down on the handle of his oar as best he could muscles burning keeping the paddle well out of the ocean he wanted no undue attention and the only way to ensure that was to keep doing an especially good job tristans dark eyes watched as the seated beatmaster laid down the two great hammers and the other slaver walked across to replace him in truth tristan had been waiting and hoping for this precise moment he harbored no illusions about escape he knew there was no way he could ever overpower the slavers and freeing himself from his chains was impossible but this rare moment would provide the precious seconds of quiet distraction that he needed he simply had to know the answer to the mystery that had plagued him ever since he had awakened here and the time to find out was now slowly he turned his head toward the slave seated on his right the fellow was balding sullen and perpetually quiet they had said very little to each other and tristan had immediately distrusted him he had no choice though soon the incessant pounding would begin anew and tristans chance would be lost he would simply have to make his attempt and trust to luck feigning another attack of nausea tristan forced his weight onto the handle of the oar at the same time surreptitiously slipping his right hand free of the handle and down toward the top of his right boot as tristan had intended the man next to him turned his head away from the sight of a fellow slave going through another bout of seasickness while trying not to drop the oar straining with everything he had but not wanting to hurry tristan let go another series of false retches at the same time gradually moving his hand closer to the top of his boot turning his head slightly he could see that he was nearly there finding the top of his boot his first two fingers slipped inside tristan froze there was nothing there unsure of what to do he nearly panicked but with yet another great effort he pressed the oar handle a bit lower allowing his fingers deeper access inside the boot raising his eyes he saw that the beatmaster had risen from his seat only seconds remained before the new slaver would call out the order to lower oars and he would have to begin rowing again and then his fingers touched metal the brain hookthe slim razorsharp stiletto with the tiny curved hook at the endthat he had carried hidden in his right boot ever since the death of nicholas and the destruction of the gates of dawn was still there undiscovered by krassus and his demonslavers tristan was overjoyed but then just as he was about to grip it his fingers touched something elsesomething pliable and scratchy it was tucked away farther back near his calf whoever had put it there probably hadnt noticed the brain hook driven so far down as it had been risking everything his muscles straining to the breaking point he captured its upper edge between his fingertips lifted it gently to the top of his boot and looked down it was a piece of vellum and he immediately recognized it as being a fragment of the scroll of the vagaries the ancient document krassus had had lying on his desk aboard the sojourner who would have put it in his boot and why but there was no time now to ponder this new mystery muscles shaking with fatigue and effort he leaned against the oar while using his fingertips to push the piece of parchment back into the deep recesses of his boot but the strain of holding the oar in place for so long with only one hand finally became too great just as he started to sit back up the oar handle slipped from his grasp and the other slaves in his row cried out as they attempted to keep the oar in place without his added strength the demonslavers immediately snapped their heads around and leveled their vacant eyes at him and several of them trotted over to where tristan sat chained trying to catch his breath the demonslaver who was to have become the new beatmaster reached him first he smiled showing his black pointed teeth when tristan looked up at him he saw a large ring of keys hooked to the top of a leather belt running around the monsters waist krassus told me you would become a problem number one the slaver said softly menacingly and so you have it didnt take you long to live up to our expectations did it reaching out he took a ninetails from one of the other slavers standing nearby and began coiling it up slowly you shall of course be punished he said and the best method i can think of is to give you something that will remind you of your new place in life every time you bend forward to pull on your oar we still have a long way to go and with every new stroke you will be reminded of me he smiled again tristan looked up hatefully you arent as good as you think you are you know he growled i killed several of your kind back in farpoint it was easy and i enjoyed having their blood on my hands there will be many more of you dead before i am finished i swear it and you will be one of them the slaver placed the handle of his whip beneath tristans chin and viciously forced the princes face up really he mused tell me how many of my brothers did you kill tristans reaction was immediate at least five he retorted without thinking it was only after saying it that he realized his mistake the thing standing before him smiled again thank you he said almost politely then five it shall be removing the whip from beneath tristans chin he nodded shortly to the slavers standing next to him two of them grabbed the princes hands while another of them began to unlace the ties at the front of his black leather vest before he knew it the vest had come over the top of his head and was lying on his forearms then he was grabbed again and forced to bend over at the waist everyone had gone silent and the only sound was the creaking of the wayfarers hull as she rocked back and forth on the sea of whispers tristan knew what was coming and there was nothing he could do to prevent it all he had to fight them with was his mind for every lash of the whip he decided he would think of someone he cared for and whatever happened he would not give these abhorrent monsters the pleasure of hearing him scream the ninetails whistled through the air and broke the skin of his naked back the leather strips sent shock waves through his body causing him to convulse shailiha he thought the sister i brought back from parthalon again the lash came down rupturing the skin at a right angle to the first cuts crossroads of azure blood began to drip down his body jangled like a marionette wigg my teacher the one who will someday instruct me in the ways of the craft the nine leather strips came yet again opening up part of his lower back glowing azure blood ran down in earnest now collecting eerily upon the roughhewn wooden seat and the unforgiving rusty chains that bound him faegan the rogue wizard from shadowood with his violin and his blue cat again the strips came around this time deepening the first set of gashes gritting his teeth desperately he almost cried out sweat dripped down his face and his breath came in short ragged puffs he closed his eyes trying to brace himself for the next assault geldon my friend so small in stature but with so great a heart the fifth and final stroke came down with the greatest intensity of all sending azure blood splattering wildly across the slavers face and hands smiling the monster began to retract the whip coiling it up slowly as the bright glowing blood flowed from tristans back down onto the deck slaves and demonslavers alike stared at the strange wondrous substance as if it had just come from another world and celeste my love suddenly he felt an unexpected rush of cold saltladen seawater splash against his wounds it was more than he could bear groaning softly tristan lost consciousness and collapsed to the filthy deck chapter nineteen w elcome to the herb cubiculum lionel said without turning around faegans diminutive caretaker seemed to be searching urgently for something now where on earth did i put my equalizing spoons he began rummaging about anxiously on the top of the broad cluttered table if i cant find them it will make things far more difficult for us yes it will he chattered nervously and i know master faegan has a deadline that he does pulling with frustration at the single tuft of hair on the top of his head while at the same time trying to keep his broken spectacles in place lionel the little jumped down off the stool that seemed far too high for him and began scurrying about the room on his short bowed legs as though everyones lives depended upon it in many ways the princess thought perhaps they did after shailiha had killed the slavers in the glade she and celeste had made their way to faegans tree house mansion there they were directed to a secret door in the trunk of the ancient gnarled tree and had come up the spiral staircase to the foyer they were greeted immediately by a rotund gracious gnome who curtsied then politely introduced herself as samantha the squat beckoning them to follow her she turned and led the way down a series of dark highly polished woodenpaneled hallways the mazelike quality of the place reminded shailiha of the redoubtalbeit a smaller wooden version after climbing two flights of stairs another hallway led at last to a set of double doors of inlaid mahogany samantha knocked twice after hearing a welcoming call from lionel she smiled curtsied again and took her leave shailiha and celeste opened the door and walked into the room then stopped and gazed about wideeyed the huge room seemed to take up the entire third floor of the mansion the ceiling was constructed of curved clear glass its various sections separated by leaded panes outside the rain had stopped and rays of sunlight streamed down between the parting clouds the herb cubiculum as lionel called it was part nursery part laboratory and part library one of the long walls was filled from floor to ceiling with bookcases holding texts charts and scrolls charts carrying esoteric symbols covered another of the walls the nursery area took up about half of the floor and was full of short tables littered with potted plants of innumerable colors shapes and sizes in many cases their leaves branches and vines had grown long enough to reach the floor and even to snake their way down the narrow aisles between the tables some of the hardier gnarled vines had found their way to the walls and pillars which they were climbing in their continued quest for the sunlight that streamed in through the glass ceiling the remainder of the cubiculum was given over to a laboratory the tables there held strangelooking instruments and containers beakers burbled and bubbled cauldrons steamed and through crisscrossing lines of glass tubing flowed brightly colored swirling fluids the air was warm and fetid but conversely its odor was light airy and herbal as if thousands of exotic petals had just bloomed releasing their scents only moments before but a part of the laboratory area was in terrible disrepair an entire wall of shelving had been pulled down spilling hundreds of jars and vessels dried herbs lay scattered across the floor among shards of broken glass and weathered labels oils had run together into shiny multicolored puddles not far from the mess the canvas bags that had been rescued from the slavers fire lay in a heap next to a large vat i must find my equalizing spoons i must lionel continued to chatter as he searched the room the boards of the hardwood floor occasionally squeaking beneath his feet as he went they are absolutely necessary dont you see if i have lost them i will be very vexed yes terribly terribly vexed after watching lionels distraught antics for a moment shailiha gave celeste a questioning look shaking her head slightly wiggs daughter raised an eyebrow much the same way her father would have sensing their lack of understanding lionel turned to them well dont just stand there gawking he said anxiously waving them into the room with one of his short stubby arms there is much to do come come doing as he asked the two women stepped deeper into the room shailiha pointed to the canvas bags those contain herbs dont they she asked thats why krassus sent his thugs hereto destroy as much of faegans stores as possible thereby making it far more difficult for us to employ the services of our herbmistress quite right lionel said still waddling briskly from table to table in search of his mysterious spoons master faegan explained your predicament to me in his letter a true quandary i agree but now things have gone from bad to worse i must say yes they certainly have please explain celeste said stopping at another table lionel began rummaging around under some papers then he squealed with delight i have found them he hollered waddling back to shailiha and celeste he proudly held up what looked to be an ordinary set of cooks wooden measuring spoons fastened together by a brass ring but then his expression darkened dont you see he said worriedly the coming of the slavers has changed everything oh indeed it has but why shailiha asked anxiously her impatience was clearly beginning to seep through we saved a lot of the herbs didnt we why cant we just take them back to eutracia and be done with it forgive me for being abrupt but we have no time to waste tristan is missing and we need those things to find him but youre forgetting something princess yes you are lionel countered one of his stubby little index fingers went imperiously into the air as he emphasized his point and just what is that celeste asked reaching into the pocket of his vest lionel pulled out a piece of paper abbeys list he said given the fact that the bags arent labeled even if you take them back with you how can you be sure that they contain what you need many or all of her requirements could have already gone up in smoke in the bags that the slavers burned and this vat presents the same problemfull of a mixture of oils but which oils most of the individual containers have been spilled im afraid thats only the beginning of the problem yes it is he added shailihas heart fell what was to have supposedly been a simple mission had quickly turned into a nightmare if she and celeste didnt return to eutracia with the ingredients abbey required for her gazing flame then none of them might ever see tristan again much less find wulfgar or the other scroll of the ancients and the other problem is she asked not altogether sure she wanted to hear what the gnomes answer would be not only are the bags and the vat not labeled but their contents have been mixed lionel explained sadly if you were to dip into one of them you would come back with a fistful of herbs or a cupful of oil to be sure but you would have absolutely no idea what they were or in what ratios they had been combined dont you see if you better understood the art of herbmastery you would know that this is without question the greatest tragedy that could befall us second only to the complete destruction of the cubiculum of course of course suddenly both celeste and shailiha fully understood what it was that lionel was trying to tell them why would the slavers go to all that trouble mixing everything dragging it out to the fire in the glade shailiha asked if all they wanted to do was destroy whats here then why not just set fire to the mansion sit back and watch everything go up in flames wouldnt that have been far easier easier yes lionel agreed as he walked back to the high stool and laboriously climbed up but there was more to their mission yes much more and setting fire to the mansion so soon would have been counterproductive to their goals yes it would how so celeste asked youre forgetting something again lionel answered he pointed to the far wall those texts and scrolls represent more than three hundred years of master faegans research in the art of herbmastery they are without doubt the single greatest such collection in existence and are among his most prized possessions surely this krassus fellow would have wanted them apparently the slavers orders were to make certain that the herbs and oils were destroyed first and then to abscond with the research materials i can only assume that the demonslavers decided to take the herbs and oils to tree town to use them to feed the fires and put even greater fear into the hearts of the gnomes then they could take their time removing the research i also have no doubt that some of the slavers would have stayed behind to kill off the rest of us and set fire to the remainder of the town including of course the masters mansion but then you two arrived and stopped them lionel paused as a look of deep gratitude came over his face master faegan doesnt know it yet but he has much to thank you for then he paused again but there is still something else to tell you yes there is he said sadly shailiha wasnt sure she could take hearing any more she closed her eyes briefly what is it she asked softly when the demonslavers as you call them first invaded the mansion they came upon me here in this room strangely they had their own list of requirements just as you do then they held me as they went about selecting various herbs and oils packed them up and took them away before the mixing started it took some time to search them all out but in truth the job was not difficult since all of the vessels were clearly marked master faegan is nothing if not organized you know then this group of slavers left quickly with their stolen goods and i think they may have escaped you and if that is true then krassus is now in possession of the very items you came here to procure i suspect krassus herbmistress is either running low on stores or she wishes to try new ingredients in her quest to view wulfgar and the scrolls either way she now has the means to do the job he is a very clever fellow this krassus yes he is but how could krassus have known all of this was here celeste asked shadowood was supposed to have been one of the directorates greatest secrets was it not i already know how shailiha answered sadly shaking her head that day in the palacethe day krassus materialized out of nothing it is something i shall never forget remember how he violated wigg and faegans minds from wigg he gleaned the existence of shadowood and from faegan he learned the whereabouts of his stores and library he claimed he was searching their memories for information about wulfgar and the scrolls but he found much much more and he never ever let on suddenly thinking of tristan shailihas heart fell but then something began prodding the back of her mindsomething that had been bothering her ever since she had first seen the slavers in the glade but shadowood is protected from the rest of eutracia by enchantments she mused including the invisible canyon that surrounds it the deadly forest and the tunnel of bones isnt that so and the slavers cant fly or at least i have never seen one do so so how did they get here safely i cant imagine the wizards protective mechanisms all failing at once it doesnt make any sense if your assumptions are true about krassus more completely violating my fathers mind than we first thought then he would have known about those dangers as well celeste said rubbing her brow but that still doesnt explain how he overcame them i think i know lionel said quietly how the two women asked in one voice i believe the slavers came by sea lionel answered rather than overland through eutracia when shadowood was created during the sorceresses war the wizards of the directorate were far more concerned about invasion from the land side than from the ocean remember at that time the sorceresses of the coven were their great concern and the covens armies were approaching from the west the only safeguard on the eastern side is the sea of whispers and the invisible canyon if krassus already knew of the canyon getting his slavers over it might not have been so difficult especially if he is now as powerful a wizard as master faegans letter suggests remember the canyon was made to keep out those who didnt know it existed rather than those who did its invisible only to the untrained there are many ways that an accomplished wizard might cross it though master faegan would know much more about that than i he paused for a moment the slavers that took the goods are now long gone he finally added in fact there is most probably another ship still anchored just offshore waiting for the ones that you killed suddenly it all made perfect tragic sense seething in her newfound knowledge shailiha yearned desperately to rush right to the coast where celeste could use her powers to blow that ship out of the water along with any demonslavers that might still be aboard but she knew that she couldnt gathering up whatever herbs and oils which were still salvageable and getting them safely back to faegan and abbey simply had to take priority krassus she realized had bested them at every turn she turned back to lionel so what do we do now she asked urgently are any of these mixed herbs or oils still useful lionel sighed some yes but the rest must first be separated again then tested to see how and to what extent their potency has been altered even then i cannot be sure how they will react if used something like this has never happened before on so grand a scale curious celeste walked over to one of the canvas bags bending down she untied the cinched rope at its top and reached in she came back with a handful of what appeared to be groundup multicolored leaves isnt there any way to tell what these herbs are she asked the gnome bring them over to me and i will try lionel said but dont expect too much no do not celeste carefully emptied her handful of herbs onto the tabletop from another area of the table lionel produced a magnifying glass peering through the glass he pushed and prodded at the herbs then he bent over and sniffed at them his face fell this is even worse than i thought yes it is he said shaking his head there is an absolute riot of colors and odors in this handful alone too many to even try to count lifting his small head he looked forlornly at the canvas bags lying on the opposite side of the room this could take years perhaps even lifetimes to unravel he added and from what i glean from master faegans letter we dont have that kind of time still even on a small scale it is worth trying before i send you back reaching across the table he picked up what he had referred to earlier as his equalizing spoons unhooking the ring that held them together he placed them on the table in a neat row there appeared to be about a dozen of them he put a small amount of the herb mixture into each one then sat back and closed his eyes emasteratu ventricumtitas didebfan sente he chanted deeply almost immediately the spoons began to move shailiha and celeste watched spellbound as the line of spoons rose into the air over the tabletop lionel opened his eyes watch carefully he said the wooden spoons began to shake back and forth spilling some of their precious contents onto the table as they did they rose a bit higher each to a different level then they came to hover in a neat level row once again when they had finally all stopped moving lionel spoke again rsantos tenticualrem wensicat the spoons obediently lowered themselves back down to the table curious shailiha and celeste looked down into them there was now a different color and amount of herb in each spoon each spoon now only contains one kind of herb doesnt it shailiha asked but gnomes dont have endowed blood how could you make this happen and that was old eutracian you were speaking wasnt it celeste interjected how does a shadowood gnome come to know old eutracian lionel chuckled master faegan is indeed wise he answered he took the liberty of enchanting these spoons centuries ago for just such an emergency as thisnamely the untangling of mixed herbs they are enchanted to react to anyone who recites the proper phrases in old eutracian one need not be of endowed blood to make them workone need only be able to say the commands correctly there are other items here in the herb cubiculum that the master enchanted so that i might be able to use them if need be and it certainly seems our day has come still this only solves part of the problem and only to a very minor degree im afraid the most difficult part is yet to come hopping down off his stool lionel beckoned the women to follow him over to what appeared to be a bare wooden wall he raised his hands pintastoretas vintostmante erasdeat tomirenticas a vertical line appeared down the center of the wall dividing it into equal halves then the gap grew wider as the two sections slowly slid to opposite sides eventually revealing another wall covered by a gigantic chart the chart was arranged in dozens of horizontal rows each row held hundreds of individual squares and each square was its own color the color of each row darkened slightly in hue as it ran from left to right as shailiha looked up she saw that the top row was all descending hues of violet each of the squares becoming lighter as ones eye followed along to the right and as one looked down the rows from top to bottom the colors of the rows changed gradually following the order of a rainbow after the violet rows came others in blue green yellow orange and finally red each of the individual colored squares seemed to be labeled a ladder was propped up over the chart topped with wheels that lay in a track running along the entire length of the chart i give you the chart of herbal hues lionel said proudly master faegan and i created it its beautiful celeste said but what is it for it uses the color of the herb to help us identify the family it comes from he explained from the top of the table he took up a clear glass globe that had a wooden vertical handle mounted at its bottom in the center of the globe could be seen a vertical rod with what looked like a miniature weathervane mounted at its top carrying the odd globe upright lionel walked to the ladder and climbed about halfway up he pointed to the equalizing spoons that still lay on the table please bring me one of those he asked for our purposes just now any will do celeste retrieved one of the spoons and handed it up to lionel the color of the herb in the spoon was a soft yellowgreen lionel looked down at the herb and then he raised an eyebrow not an altogether simple one to start with but it should prove an interesting challenge he mused asking shailiha to push the ladder he directed her to a spot about midway across the face of the chart placing the spoon down carefully on one of the ladder steps he used both hands to twist the handle at the bottom of his globe it popped open carefully he sprinkled a pinch of the yellowgreen herbs into the base of the open handle then twisted it closed again he handed the spoon back down to celeste now we shall see what we shall see he said with a wink holding the device before one of the many rows containing the yellows and greens he closed his eyes wntesirare ostumae ventarntateratu oderastic almost at once the familiar glow of the craft began to surround the globe and the little weathervane within it began to spin slowly lionel held it still for a moment then he started to move it horizontally along one of the yellow rows as he did the vane started to turn more rapidly then it went faster still until it revolved so quickly that it became a blur he kept it in place for a moment taking note of the spot on the chart then he moved the device a bit to the right and the vane began to slow when he moved it back to the left it sped up again lowering the globe lionel took note of the writing beneath the colored square before which the vane had spun the fastest the azure glow surrounding the globe finally faded and disappeared y he muttered to himself as he climbed down the ladder and waddled back to the stool at the table hopping up on it he placed the globe on the tabletop next to his equalizing spoons y yes it is he chattered to himself as if he were in danger of forgetting it quickly he made a note of the letter and numbers on a sheet of parchment only then did he seem to relax what did you just do shailiha asked bursting with curiosity both she and celeste walked over to the table and bent over to examine the odd globe that device is called a hue harmonizer lionel said simply yet another invention of the masters it senses the color of the herb in its handle then matches it to the one most closely represented on the chart it is enchanted to make allowances for the passage of time since once the herbs are dried and ground their colors generally fade somewhat this can of course also be attempted by the human eye but the results are far more vagueoftentimes even dangerous anyway once the correctly colored square is found one makes a note of the code written below it in this case our herb is of the yellow family square number interesting is it not but we are not quite finished he looked to the wall containing the vast library source book of herbal families please he said loudly yellow family code numbers two hundred through three hundred almost immediately a dusty ancient book slid out and came soaring through the air it landed gently on the table in front of him the thick giltedged book looked as old as time itself thumbing through the text lionel finally found number ah at last he announced proudly yellow number is the blossom of the witherwood treea rarity employed primarily for the relief of pain in the joints particularly in the upper extremities probably nothing that abbey needs but with herbmistresses one never knows then he looked at the bags lying on the floor perhaps after having seen these procedures you can better understand the immense nature of the task ahead he said sadly yes the herbs can be isolated but do you you realize how long it took to identify a pinch of just one there are thousands of herbs in those bags and they are all mixed together and making things even more difficult is the fact that abbey has a particular list of things she requires and she needs them now but because they are so mixed up there is just no way to give priority to searching for the ones she wants we must simply go through all of the bags one by one and trust to luck that we come upon those she needs and soon enough to be of help he shook his head for a moment frankly the task is monstrous he added quietly and im glad im not the one who has to explain all of this to my master shailiha looked skeptically at celeste all wiggs daughter could do was shake her head then the princess saw a curious look come over lionels face but we still do not know the effects upon the witherwoods potency from having been mixed with so many other herbs he said it would be most interesting to find out dont you think and it would provide a ray of sunlight for master faegan to be sure oh yes to be sure being able to tell him the potency of at least one of them might soften his mood when he hears about all of this yes it might taking another small pinch of the dried witherwood blossom from the spoon he eagerly walked to another table at the far end of the laboratory there he dropped it into a flat gold pan one of the best ways to determine an herbs purity is to test the sample with fire he called back to the women the amount i have here is far too small to cause much reaction still it should tell us something striking a common match against his trouser leg he held the small flame to the herbs celeste and shailiha cringed instinctively as the match burned the top of the tiny pile of herbs began to singe and smoke a bit but nothing more finally the match went out smiling lionel turned to them see he shouted triumphantly i told you so the potency must be so weak that the explosion that followed sent lionel flying through the air he landed hard onto the tabletop near them beakers overturned and fragile glass tubing shattered their contents pouring out as the gnome came to rest on his back in the slick multicolored mess flames shot upward into a giant red ball its concussive force so great that it shattered a section of the ceiling sending smashed glass raining down the roiling smoke was at first so thick that shailiha couldnt see a thing fearing for lionels life she held her breath and waved her arms madly as she tried to make her way to the table she had seen him land on the glass crunching beneath her boots as she went by the time she got there lionel was sitting up holding his head bits of glass fell from him his spectacles were more shattered than ever and lying halfway off his nose he was wet and sticky from head to toe and part of his vest was still smoldering shailiha quickly began patting lionel down making sure that he was not truly on fire in the final analysis he somehow didnt seem too much the worse for wear then the doors to the herb cubiculum blew wide open and an anxious group of gnomes burst in carrying buckets of water seeing that the fire was already out they simply stood there glaring at lionel then an obviously indignant samantha the squat marched straight up to lionel threw her hands into the air then pushed one of her stubby index fingers at his stunned sooty face how could you do this again she shouted at him shailiha couldnt decide which was more merciless samanthas shrill voice or her imperiously wagging finger you know you arent supposed to experiment unless the master is present he has told you that countless numbers of times what in the name of the afterlife is the matter with you are you deaf as well as stupid aghast the princess and celeste turned to samantha do you mean to tell us that this has happened before celeste asked oh yes samantha answered angrily as she lifted one of lionels eyelids to examine an overly dilated pupil you just love to impress folks with your supposed knowledge of this room dont you lionel smiling stupidly lionel looked back at her his eyes partially glazed over i cant hear you he screamed shailiha and celeste recoiled at the loudness of his voice you know its like this every time there is an explosion he shouted as he swayed back and forth animatedly gesturing to one of his ears beginning to wonder whether lionels hearing had suddenly become selective rather than simply impaired shailiha turned to look around the room although the entire herb cubiculum was a slippery tangled mess the canvas bags of herbs blessedly remained unharmed as did the vat of oils but how in the world were she and celeste going to manage getting them toand throughfaegans portal not to mention the chart of ascending and descending hues and the massive library that faegan and abbey would now apparently require and then there was the matter of lionel she couldnt leave the curious gnome here free to conduct more of his experiments without faegans guidance only the afterlife knew what might come of it there was only one solution she would have celeste and lionel help her hide the bags the vat and as many of the books as possible before faegans portal opened the next day then all three of them would go back through the portal that way in the event that other slavers returned they would find neither the missing items nor the princess and wiggs daughter she hated the idea of leaving the rest of the gnomes defenseless but she could see no other way she shook her head as she tried to imagine the wizards reactions when she walked out of the portal with only celeste and a sooty overconfident gnome who had just blown up faegans herb cubiculum wigg and faegan would not be pleased chapter twenty s uch a beautiful boy you are cooed the aging woman in the ragged red dress as if in defiance of her advancing years there was a suggestive slit running a bit too high up one side of her frock and her cheeks were overly pink with rouge her eyes were sharp but her voice was old and cracked much like the lines in her skin she smelled faintly of cheap perfume and body odor running a gnarled hand over the boys curly red hair she bent forward slightly so as to examine him better he felt her coarse fingers grip his chin then turn his face first one way then the other would you like to come and work for me she asked coyly you look like you could do with a hot meal and it is warm and dry where i live not cold and wet like here she dragged her long painted nails gently down one of his grimy cheeks leaving oddlooking contrasting rows of what had once been healthier cleaner skin he cringed you do trust me dont you dearie she asked sweetly her face only inches from his own she widened her mouth and kissed him lightly on the lips with the kiss came the smell of garlic wine and halfdigested fish his back hard against the brick wall marcus cringed his foray to steal some food from this still largely unknown city had inadvertently led him to one of its darkest and most crimeridden niches bargainers square he had heard someone call it night was falling and the light cast from the oil streetlamps had begun to spread silent shadowy fingers across the sidewalks and streets morphing the silhouettes of passersby into twisted misshapen monsters halfway into this human wasteland he had realized his mistake and tried to turn and leave but by then the aging harlot had cornered him in the alley and it had been too late having just turned twelve seasons of new life he was streetwise enough to understand what it was the old whore was trying to entice him into he had heard stories about purveyors like her she was one of those who sold young people to older ones and every fiber of his being told him he wanted no part of it he had to get free of her quickly before any of her friends might appear and help her abduct him outright because if that happened becca would be alone and becca needed him but just as he thought he might be able to give the old woman a sharp push and run around her a shadow loomed marcus raised his face to see a mana large dirty mancome up behind the woman he had a thick beard and long tangled hair he wore a dark cloak around his shoulders and huge knobby boots from where marcus stood the mans hands seemed the size of small hams whatcha got here allison he asked in a heavy gravelly tone the woman just smiled the man studied marcus a good one he said approvingly nice and fresh with him in the stable we can sit back and make a pretty pile of kisa thats for sure a yellow broken smile spread across his bearded face and hes never been touched id wager i wouldnt mind breaking him in myself but i wont for his first time should bring a tidy sum might even be able to get an auction going and get the losers to pay to watch his debut just like we did with that little blond girl we took from her screaming nanny on highbridge street last season now that was a night to remember eh with surprising speed the bearman turned his great bulk and took a quick look around there was no one nearno one at least who would be willing to help he looked confidently down into marcus frightened green eyes so are you going to come with us peaceablelike or do i have to rough you up trust me you little bastardif you resist you wont fare the better for it and we dont want any bruises on that pretty face now do we marcus glanced back at the woman she was smiling as the bearman stood there staring greedily at him marcus realized that if he didnt act now he would lose his only chance casually sliding his hand into his right pocket he grasped his springloaded knife and ran his thumb over the button on its handle he had never used his knife on a person before and he knew he was about to do something awfulbut it was unavoidable if he wanted to stay alive and return to becca he forced himself to smile i am not so inexperienced as you think he said slyly while fingering the comforting coolness of the knife handle ive lived my entire life on the streets and i know what it takes to get along in fact i like it but im tired of foraging for myself and i do need someone to look after me sick inside he smiled again before i go with you would you like to see what i can do the old harlots face lit up of course she purred then she tilted her head back toward bearman why dont you prove your talents on him first ill watch marcus mind raced this was exactly what he had been hoping for but there would be only once chanceone razorslim door of opportunity if he failed his failure would last forever and then there would be no one left to take care of becca he took a few steps forward then went to his knees holding out his left hand he crooked a finger suggestively at the man standing before him with an eager grunt the huge man stepped nearer the dark cloak parted large meaty hands unbuttoned the front of his breeches his face looming over marcus was split in a wide grin trying to control his revulsion marcus grinned back in kind and moved closer yet inside his pocket his right hand closed carefully around the knife hilt with his left hand marcus reached out toward the mans groin the leering brute groaned and closed his eyes better yet marcus thought the knife felt cold and hard just like his heart with one swift movement he slipped it from his pocket and pressed the button on the hilt click at the sound the mans eyes popped open and he recoiled but it was too late marcus had grabbed the exposed privates and pulled hard with a single relentless slash he cut straight down marcus cringed feeling the sensation through the blade as it first struck home ripped its way in and then finally broke free the amputated entities in his left hand suddenly felt warm soft and sticky and he dropped them to the ground even before the man could scream marcus was back on his feet turning on the harlot with a single slash of the knife he cut the right side of her face from ear to chin then he whirled and ran leaving behind the earsplitting inhuman screaming of his victims marcus ran from the alley and down the long dark streets until he thought his lungs would burst finally he stopped his chest heaving and leaned against the wall of a closed rug shop he was on one of the more widely used boulevards numbly he wiped the knife off folded it and returned it to his pocket then he looked cautiously around the corner of the shop not far from him a dark alley loomed as he walked toward it on unsteady legs he suddenly felt queasy the moment he entered the alley he fell to his knees and vomited retching over and over until he thought it might never stop and then finally he curled up on the ground in a little ball thought of becca and cried silently shoulders shaking until at last sleep came r ebecca of the house of stinton was shivering the fire in the abandoned oneroom shed had gone out hours ago and even the embers had long since faded away she couldnt light another for she had no more wood besides marcus had told her never to do so on her own no matter what and marcus always knew best and so she remained hungry and cold in the little dilapidated shack while she waited for his return watching the shadows from the single oil lamp creep silently across the clapboard walls she wondered what would happen when their dark twisting fingers finally reached her the cold hearth smelled acridly of spent wood soot and charcoal and her hands were shaking curling up on the single cot she felt terribly alone and began to cry she was very frightened marcus had never been gone this long before her stomach growled as she pulled the single thin sheet closer around her shoulders she had not eaten since the previous morning and even that had been meager almost past the point of caring she reached down to touch her belly as she did it growled again then she suddenly saw the glow and she froze with terror the strange blue light beneath her cot had returned all the other times this had happened marcus had been with her but he wasnt here now and the thought of being left alone with it horrified her pulling her head under the dirty sheet she cowered hoping the strange light would simply go away but the light didnt stopit just kept getting brighter the glow continued to strengthen she thought she should look under the cot but at first couldnt summon the courage finally forcing herself to get up she went to the ground on her knees before the light despite her fear she knew exactly where the strange light was coming from the thing she and marcus had stolen was glowing again dozens of pinpricksized rays of azure light streaked up through the soft dirt where it was buried hauntingly illuminating the underside of the cot and the walls and roof of the shed with their shimmering ethereal glow ever since she and her brother had found the object in the midst of the rubble she had begged him to leave it behind having it always with them made her so nervous but marcus had remained adamant about keeping it telling her that he thought it had to do with magic it might be valuable hed said and so they had kept it and secretly brought it to the only place they knew where such a thing might be coveted she just wanted the rays of light to stop she began clawing at the earth trying to gather up more dirt in the hope of covering up the frightening invasive light but the more she tried the more the glow just kept coming seeping up through the ground like a silent neverending ghost frustrated and frightened she began banging her fists on the ground as the tears ran down her cheeks finally she gave up and fell to the dirt beside the cot it was just then that she heard the rusty hinges on the door creak and she turned around sitting up and wiping her dirty tearstreaked face with one hand rebecca looked up hopefully marcus stood there with a bag in his hand he looked like he had just been through a war he appeared distraught and tired and parts of his clothes were splattered with what looked like dried blood closing the door quietly he walked into the room and placed the bag on the table getting up on her good foot she limped to him and held him tightly they stood like that for some time saying nothing the azure rays of light mixed oddly with the yellow flickering of the solitary table lamp finally he let her go and looked meaningfully over to the cot how long has it been this time he asked tiredly not long she answered it started just before you came in i was terribly afraid im so glad youre back studying him more closely she saw that his hands were bloody what happened she asked nervously are you hurt i had some trouble but im all right he answered as casually as he could manage he took a moment to look at her at seven seasons of new life becca was tall for her age with a bright smile long dark hair and deep brown eyes but she had been born with a clubfootsomething that she had always managed to shoulder with grace and dignity despite her awkward halting gait she had a lot of strength and he loved her for it it had always been her dream that their parents might one day save enough kisa to make the pilgrimage to tammerland and seek help for her at the royal palace once there they would gladly have waited for as long as it might take to gain an audience with the king and his wizards in the royal chamber of supplication then if she was lucky the king might order one of his wizardsperhaps even the lead wizard himselfto heal her but the money for the trip had never come now the king was dead and it was widely rumored that all the wizards of the directorate had been slain along with the entire royal guard as marcus looked down at beccas tattered plaid dress grimy face and clubfoot his heart ached their parents were dead all they had was each other he did not enjoy stealing but they had no money and the way to tammerland had been hard that was why he was so determined to hold on to the amazing thing they had found if there was any place in eutracia where it might have value he reasoned it would be where the wizards had once lived and where the craft was said to flourish even if he found no buyers for the object itself he could at least sell off the gold they had actually found two of the things but had been forced to leave one behind becca had not been strong enough to carry off the other by herself and he had not possessed the stamina to handle both at the same time they had returned later to try to take the twin but by then it was already gone at first he had stolen it just for the gold but when it had started glowing he had immediately become convinced of its potentially greater value as for what purpose of the craft it supposedly served he had absolutely no idea but if he could find someone who would pay enough for it he might be able to secure a healer to help with beccas foot and perhaps even have enough left over to help them start a new life here in the capital but they were strangers in tammerland and in the absence of the royal guard the city had become a very dangerous place that lesson had been abundantly proven today when he had wandered into the wrong part of town being no fool he understood all too well that he needed to be supremely careful for what they had buried beneath the cot could just as easily get them killed as set them free is there food in the bag rebecca suddenly asked taking him away from his thoughts yes he answered this time i was able to get enough to last us for two days chicken stolen from a store and bread taken from a windowsill can we eat now she asked eagerly im so hungry marcus he smiled you go ahead i have something to do first just be sure you leave me some i know what a piglet you can be then his eyes turned again to the blue light beneath the cot rebeccas face fell he was going to dig it up again he did so every time it glowed to make sure nothing had happened to it and every time he didwhich seemed to be happening more and more frequentlyit made her nervous but her hunger was greater than her anxiety and the lure of the bag on the table was too great so she turned her back on her brother and went to eat marcus knelt and peered under the cot at the narrow rays of light shooting up and out of the loose dirt this was the seventh time it had glowed since he had stolen it and each time its illumination had increased in strength that was a large part of why he had decided to bury it but clearly that was no longer working even before uncovering it he could tell that this time would be the brightest yet narrowing his eyes against the azure light he began slowly moving the dirt aside soon their treasure was exposed filling the room with its brilliance he did not touch it but instead examined the scroll as it lay there about a meter long and half a meter wide it was secured in the middle with a gold band the rod running through it was gold as well as were each of the fluted end knobs the writing on the parchment was in a beautiful script that looked utterly unfamiliar to him which added to the mystery the scroll appeared to be unharmed he sat back on his heels thinking one thing was certain he needed to find a buyer soon for the glow was becoming too difficult to hide he had no money to purchase any kind of container for it and hed buried it as deep as possible before hitting bedrock beneath the shack as far as he was concerned the sooner he turned it into kisa the better quickly he covered the scroll back up as he did the glow began to extinguish itself of its own accord just as it always did he did not know why the glow came and went but was glad to see it die for the time being when it was completely covered he stood and walked to the table her mouth and fingers covered with chicken grease becca beamed up at him and handed him a piece of bread s tanding on the mizzen deck of the sojourner behind grizelda krassus was greatly encouraged by what he was seeing it was a clear starry night and the three moons were out bathing the ship and the sea in their familiar rosecolored light though there was little wind the sojourner continued to make good time as she plowed her way east through the restless waves the lights of the other two ships running alongside them twinkled in the night thinking of the chosen one pulling on an oar krassus smiled grizelda selected some herbs from her bag and tossed them into the gazing flame hissing the fire shot higher and the viewing window in its center grew just a bit clearer in his desperation to find the other scroll krassus had been forcing her to perform the ritual often and by now both grizeldas stores of herbs and her own energy were running very low but finally this time she had been more successful the view was cloudy but for the first time she actually had something to look at holding up a small piece of vellum taken from the scroll of the vagaries she tried to make the scene unfolding before her clearer the scroll of the vigors came into view it was glowing with azure light and a pair of hands were starting to cover it over with dirt then the hands pulled away and all that remained in the viewing window was a dirt floor that could have been anywhere she dropped her arms to her sides and the flame lowered accordingly we have done it my lord she said with a smile the sea wind snatched at her long gray hair and she hooked a portion of it behind one ear i now know why we have had such trouble trying to view the scroll she went on whoever took it is hiding it burying it in the dirt only when it is exposed may we view itwhich may not be often whoever is in possession of the scroll knows nothing of the craftof that much i am certain if it were with the wizards of the redoubt they would be busy trying to decipher its secrets rather than burying it for a moment she looked perturbed but then she smiled again when the herbs and oils you promised me arrive at the citadel i will be able to do much bettereven from that far away krassus looked down at her you may retire now he said simply with a short bow grizelda picked up her bag and started for her cabin turning the wizard in the grayandblue robe walked to the gunwale and leaned his forearms on it as he looked out to the evershifting sea the wind had picked up a bit more and the waves were frothy and whitecapped soon he assured himself soon he would have the scroll of the vigors and there would be nothing the wizards in the redoubt could do to stop him and once he had wulfgar the world would see wonders of the craft that had not been witnessed for eons chapter twentyone g et up now you talis pigs time to get back to work the chorus of harsh voices shouting the same thing over and over again rang in his ears he just wanted them to be quiet so he could go back to sleep didnt they know they were being rude shouting like that he would have to remember to speak to the lead wizard about it after he got up and had his breakfast determined to sleep he started to turn over on his side but something tugged at him preventing him from doing so suddenly the searing pain in his back returned bringing him fully awake his nostrils were immediately assaulted by the stench of his surroundings he opened his eyes to darkness then faint light began to push away the shadows and he saw that demonslavers were moving about hanging flaming oil lanterns on the columns supporting the deck above other demonslavers were starting to unchain their captives from the floor as the light in the hold increased tristans situation slowly came into focus he didnt remember being brought here or being chained all he could recall was passing out just after one of the slavers had poured saltwater on his wounds he looked down the length of his body his hands and feet were still bound together by the same shackles he had worn while rowing additional chains lay across his chest and lower legs securing him to the deck raising his head as best he could he saw row after row of his fellow slaves all male also chained down like animals it seemed their numbers took up every inch of the filthy deck as they were unchained one by one they stood awkwardly blinking their eyes against the light the pain in his back was excruciating his vest had been put back on him its laces retied in the front his wounds must have begun to scab over because they now itched as well as hurt one of the slavers sauntered over to him and looked down with lifeless opaque eyes without warning the monster kicked tristan in the ribs knocking the wind out of him pain burned in his side then the slaver raised his trident high over tristans face wondering if he was about to die tristan made a last promise to himself not to flinch he kept it even as the trident came down at him with unbelievable speed the three silver points of the trident buried themselves loudly into the deck just inches from tristans head then the slaver let out a laugh if you give us any more trouble i have permission from krassus to add to the artwork on your back he sneered and i beg you to try dear prince for i would love another such excuse tristan looked defiantly up into the white eyes as he did he noticed the ring of keys hanging from the slavers side then he remembered this was the same one who had whipped him he was sure of it the monster unchained him from the floor still shackled hand and foot tristan was pulled roughly to his feet and shoved into the line of slaves waiting their turn to climb the stairway to the deck above after being chained to his seat tristan looked out his oar slit and decided it was early morning he then turned to watch as the rest of the slaves were chained down the slaver who had beaten him was using one of his keys to close the massive padlock that secured the single chain running through all of the slaves shackles the key that fit it was the largest of them and lay in the center of the ring normally hooked on his belt tristan filed this information away in his head even though he realized that given the tight security of the slavers system such knowledge would be unlikely to help him one by one the exhausted weakkneed men they were replacing were herded to the trapdoor between the rows and forced down the stairway several slavers followed them down to chain them to the floor in the same filthy spots the fresh rowers had just vacated then the pacemaster started pounding out the mindnumbing beat and tristan and the others began to pull on their oars despite the searing pain he rowed as best he could he had no other choice he wasnt sure he could survive another savage beating from the slaver as he rowed he felt his wounds rip open the pain cutting through his back like hot knives he looked up to see the slaver who had beaten him staring coldly at him as if waiting for him to make another mistake pulling determinedly at his oar tristan drew comfort from the thought of the brain hook hidden in his right boot as all of the unfortunates pulled on their oars the wayfarer began to plow faster through the sea of whispers t he demonslaver manning the crows nest aboard the sojourner twisted the third cylinder of his spyglass as he tried to confirm what he had seen with his naked eyes he had no wish to suffer the consequences of making a false report to krassus peering across the sea he scoured the horizon there they were three frigates sailing as a group and making a direct line from the north they were running quickly before the wind while sojourner and her two sister ships were wearing out their rowers to stay on their easterly heading he ran his glass over them carefully they were not part of krassus fleet judging by the way their spars and masts had been lengthened to carry more sail they were a fast lotof that there was no doubt faster than the sojourner could be even if she werent loaded down with slaves and at their present course they would soon be upon the three slower heavier slavers but who were they and what did they want searching for an identifying flag he turned his glass to the lead frigates rigging finally he found what he was looking for it was high atop the mainmast fluttering back and forth proudly turning the cylinder on the spyglass again he brought it into focus at first he thought he must be seeing things taking his eye from the glass for a moment the slaver stared across the ocean and drew a quick breath he put the device back to his eye so it was true after all the blueandgold banner carried both the lion and the broadsword and every man woman and child in eutracia knew what it represented it was the royal battle flag of the house of galland he rang the alarm bell almost before it had finished pealing another slaver had climbed up the rigging to a spot just below him pointing out to sea with one arm the spotter relayed the message the other slaver climbed back down and ran to find krassus he found him standing on the stern deck by the ships wheel looking over some charts his herbmistress was there with him the slaver came to attention begging your pardon my lord he said urgently but the crows nest has spied three ships frigate class on a direct course to intercept us from the north their speed is great they run the blueandgold battle flag of the house of galland krassus froze snatching up his spyglass from the table before him he turned to look north there he saw the three ships plowing directly toward them running before the wind with unusually large sails he moved the lens up to the enemy ships rigging and saw the blueandgold flag his mind racing he slowly lowered the spyglass they were clearly after him but who could they be the wizards of the redoubt perhaps but the redoubt had no standing navy still who else but the wizards would have the gall to run the royal battle flag then it hit him these could be vessels of the minion fleet under the assumed command of the wizards but those vessels were rumored anchored off the coast of parthalon at a port far to the north of his present position how could wigg and faegan have gotten word to them supplied the ships and had them catch up to his present position in so short a time the logistics simply didnt work and if it was indeed the minions then why were there only three ships still there they were and he knew he had to take action quickly or all might be lost lost in thought he stared out over the sea he would have preferred to stand and fight throwing bolts at the three enemy ships and blowing them out of the water but he could do that only by letting them come much closer and thereby losing his precious lead and if wigg and faegan were aboard them they could presumably throw twice the number of bolts at him as he could at them then there was the problem of whether the minions were aboard the enemy ships if so they could board him at any moment simply by flying to him no the distance between the sojourner and the enemy frigates had to be maintained the only way to do that was to sacrifice the other two slavers sailing with him to buy him time true one of them could be carrying wulfgar but they were transporting countless slaves in many sea crossings the odds of wulfgar currently being aboard either of his two sister ships was not great he would just have to risk it besides for all he knew wulfgar might well be in custody already and he could allow nothing to stand in the way of getting the scroll to the citadel he turned to the waiting demonslaver hear me well for our lives depend on the next few moments he ordered call for my first mate and tell him to bring my lantern hell know the one have every talis slave except those currently manning the galley and one equalsized number to relieve them brought topside they are to be immediately killed and thrown overboard to lighten our load the rtalis captives are not to be touched and order the slaves to stop rowingtheyll only slow us down go now and be quick about it immediately the slaver was gone soon the first mate appeared holding a lantern you are familiar with the situation krassus asked abruptly the slaver nodded good krassus said taking the lamp he closed his eyes the lamp began to glow with the blue of the craft he handed it back to his first mate take this to the stern gunwale and signal our situation to the wayfarer and the stalwart they are to come about and intercept the three frigates while we sail on they are to stop the enemy at all costs and kill everyone aboard do you understand the first mate nodded very well krassus said go now looking astern krassus saw the wayfarer and the stalwart following in their wake saw the alternating beams of azure light shooting toward them from the lantern giving them their orders he turned to grizelda now we shall see what we shall see he said quietly the herbmistress face showed concern surely my lord has not forgotten that the chosen one is still aboard the wayfarer she said questioningly he could be killed before answering krassus turned to see the additional sails being raised and the first of the talis slaves coming topside blinking their eyes in the sunlight a gang of slavers stood waiting swords drawn as the slaves appeared up the stairway one by one the slavers stepped up behind them quietly cut their throats then tossed the bodies over the gunwales and into the sea sharks swarmed snaking through the increasingly bloody water krassus turned his dark eyes back to the three enemy frigates ignoring the screams of the dying slaves as if they werent there of course i havent forgotten he said quietly if he dies he dies in the end it doesnt really matter as i have already told you for what i have planned his blood signature is of no use to me but if he should be rescued i have arranged a little surprise for him and his wizardsone that could be very much to our advantage so you see there is no need to worry about him he watched intently as the wayfarer and the stalwart began to alter course heeling hard to port to take on the three advancing frigates hundreds of demonslavers could be seen on their decks swords waving in the air as the sojourners extra sails snapped open she began to pick up speed distancing herself from the impending calamity t ristan pulled hard on his oar while trying both to keep one eye on the commotion coming from the deck above and to ignore the searing pain in his back they had been rowing at battle speed for the last quarter of an hour ever since the wayfarer had made a sharp unexplained course change looking out his oar slit he was sure they were now headed north as the pacemaster continued to pound out the impossible beat slaves began groaning and collapsing at their stations and the lone guardall the other slavers had been ordered topsidewas using his ninetails with abandon trying to force them back to work for the first time tristan noticed a hint of concern in the faces of the two remaining slavers then the wayfarer lurched to port leaning over hard as she did one of the oarsmen on the other side of the ship suddenly dropped his oar pointed out the slit in the hull and began babbling wildly ships he screamed his eyes alight with hope three eutracian ships and they fly the war banner of the monarchy picking up his trident the demonslaver mercilessly stabbed the man through the abdomen then he pulled the prongs out viciously twisting them to maximize the damage the man was dead before he hit the deck but he hadnt died in vain almost every slave in the galley let go of his oar and craned his neck to look outside shouting and pandemonium reigned as the slaver tried in vain to whip them back into submission tristan could see nothing on his side of the ship but empty sea nonetheless he was stunned by the slaves words there was only one answer they had finally come for him part of the minion fleet had arrived and wigg and faegan might even be aboard his heart sang with the promise of escape and of killing krassus and his herbmistress and taking as many of his horrific captors to their graves as he could they might even be able to recover the scroll of the vagaries there were debts to repay and he meant to have his revenge while the slaver who had beaten him was preoccupied with trying to whip the excited oarsmen back into submission tristan reached into his right boot and slid out the brain hook cupping it in his hand he laid the blade up along the underside of his forearm then placed his arm down by his side the blade felt sharp and comforting against his skin he knew this would have to be a very closely run thing for his chains did not allow much freedom of movement he would only get one chance and it had to be right hungrily he eyed the ring of keys hanging from the slavers belt the large one in the center was still there amid the screaming and confusion tristan willed the slaver to come to him almost as if he had heard tristans silent pleading the slaver turned glared at the prince hatefully and began walking to the front of the ship summoning up all the saliva he could muster tristan spat toward him and then smiled the slaver took another step then another finally he was directly alongside tristan with a smile he raised his trident but suddenly the wayfarer collided with something a massive blow struck hard against the port side and the hull tipped hard to starboard losing his balance the slaver slipped to the right as the prongs of the trident came down tristan slid toward the bow and grabbed the handle of the trident using the ships momentum to pull the surprised slaver down into his lap in one smooth motion he grabbed the slaver by the throat and shoved the point of the brain hook into the things ear the slaver screamed and began to struggle with a vicious twist tristan yanked out the hook the slaver was dead blood pouring from his ear tristan shoved the brain hook back into his boot then he snatched the key ring from the slavers belt and pushed the corpse off him into the aisle the gigantic pacemaster was already on his feet waving a hammer and coming toward tristan finding the large key in the center of the ring tristan shoved it into the padlock lying on the deck and turned it nothing happened a quick glance told him that the pacemaster was nearly upon him again he turned the key in the rusty lock the lock sprung open as fast as he could tristan pulled his chain free which allowed him to move his feet but his wrists and ankles were still shackled together and there was no time to pick up a weapon the pacemaster hammer raised was looming over him as the great hammer came down tristan slipped to the right dodging the heavy blow then he slid back in placed his hands together and swung them around slamming his wrist shackles into the slavers right cheek and eye blood sprayed and the slaver crashed to the deck atop the other ones body praying that the same key would unlock his shackles tristan shoved it into the lock binding his feet together and turned it this time the lock sprang open immediately the same proved true for his wrist shackles smiling he turned and passed the key to the man seated behind him there were tears in the fellows eyes tristan started to speak but suddenly realized that words were not necessary reaching beneath the body of the first slaver tristan recovered the things short sword he darted for the stairway then stopped and purposely slowed his breathing picking up the gold medallion that hung around his neck he gazed at it for a precious dangerous moment and thought of all his loved ones then he dropped the medallion back to his chest raised the cool blade of the sword vertically to his forehead and closed his eyes from the way the hull of the ship had been impacted and the sounds of battle coming from the deck above no one had to tell him that they were being boarded holding his sword before him tristan ran up the stairway and into the light chapter twentytwo s erena felt like an outcast as she looked down at the sumptuous plate of food she sat alone at a dining table that was very well appointed complete with candlesticks and wine she was dressed in yet another lovely gown picked out for her by janus starving clothed in rags her fellow slaves stared out at her from their bondage it made her nervous fearful for her safety every time she finished such a meal and the demonslavers put her back into confinement with the others two slavers armed with swords sat nearby watching carefully although hungry she didnt really want to eat for it seemed so cruel to the others but wulfgar had told her she must do so when she could and over the course of the last week she had come to trust his judgment so she tentatively took her first bite of the delicious veal trying as best she could to ignore the ravenous envious glares of her fellow captives as they watched from inside the barred cages this bizarre unexplained treatment of her had been janus doing she was sure of it janus was apparently not willing to honor wulfgars request to feed her more without twisting it into something evil shaking her head she thought of the insane sadistic nature of her predicament she felt naked and alone as she sat there with her fancy meal and suddenly she realized that the only time she was ever at ease was when she was with wulfgar in his quarters she gazed around the great hall it was without doubt the largest room she had ever seen constructed of smooth beige marble lit by numerous open skylights and otherwise quite stark all that the chamber contained were the many large cages holding the other rtalis slaves she had never been in a position to count the cages but assumed their number to be in excess of one hundred each of the glimmering silver coops stood alone separated from the others by several meters the cages contained people cots for sleeping and buckets used for waste the buckets were not emptied often enough and they filled the chamber with their stink none of the captives knew why they had been brought here or what their eventual fate might be even serenathe only one allowed out of here had not been able to figure out the answers to those questions she had so far made four more trips to see wulfgar each time at his request she enjoyed visiting him and found herself growing to like him more and more he had a strong understated quality that always made her feel safe even in this horrific place sometimes she wished she could simply stay there with him but she doubted that janus would ever grant such a request he wouldnt want to give up the pleasure of seeing her squirm as she ate in front of the others and watching them suffer as she was forced to eat the delicacies provided only to her just then a door opened in the far wall and janus sauntered in the twin iron spheres on his belt clinking together as he walked serena cringed as he sat down in the chair opposite her and poured himself a glass of wine then he placed his legs on the table crossed one over the other and leaned back the painted red mask contorted as he smiled looking down at her plate he feigned an expression of disappointment you really must eat something my dear he said unctuously or if you prefer i could have something else brought in he raised his eyes to her with a menacing almost envious stare after all nothing is too good for wulfgars whore laying down her fork serena glared back at him im not his whore she said softly we care for each other something i doubt you could ever understand janus placed his free hand sarcastically over his heart im touched i really am he sneered in any event he asks for you again you must be very good at what you do perhaps if wulfgar tires of you i might take a turn serena remained silent filled with hatred standing janus picked up a fork and casually stabbed it into a slice of serenas veal then he walked over to the nearest cage and waved it back and forth in the air sending its enticing aroma toward the slaves like starving animals they pushed to the front of the cage and hands and arms stretched pleadingly out from between the bars turning back to her janus smiled food he mused simple everyday food curious isnt it to assume power one need not torture or even kill one need only withhold simple sustenance to suddenly become a king among men such an interesting simple elegant form of punishment and reward wouldnt you agree there really is no equal tears welled up in serenas eyes although she knew that none of this was her fault she couldnt help feeling as if she were to blame stop it she begged isnt it bad enough that you force me to eat this way before them must you add to that torture how can you be so cruel cruel janus asked he seemed genuinely perplexed you find this cruel this is not cruel my dear this is merely theater but what is happening to the other slavesthose branded talisnow that could truly be defined as cruel those poor bastards have simply become a means to an end serena was about to ask him what he meant by that but she stopped herself not only did she doubt that he would tell her but she also wasnt sure she could bear hearing the answer she lowered her face and placed her hands on her lap janus smiled again and waved the piece of meat higher you he shouted out to a tall man in front show me how far you can reach perhaps you will be rewarded the slave eagerly stretched one arm out his fingers waggling desperately janus walked up to him and carefully placed the veal on the floor several inches past the end of the mans reachjust close enough to tempt and just far enough away to make touching it impossible then apparently satisfied he walked back to the table serena buried her face in her hands now then shall we go janus asked her politely we mustnt keep your whoremaster waiting serena rose on shaky legs and followed him toward the door despite how badly she felt for those in the cages she desperately wanted to put this place behind her pausing before two demonslaver guards janus pointed at the first of them you he ordered come with me then he bent down placing his mouth next to the other slavers ear you stay here he whispered softly just loud enough for serena to hear if one of them actually reaches that meat take him out and kill him the slaver turned his white eyes to the cage and the desperate crushing mob within he smiled with pleasure with that janus the other slaver and serena walked out the door and into the hallway night was falling in the citadel and the hallways were brightly lit by wall torches the walk was long but by now serena could have negotiated her way to wulfgars quarters alone as they went down one of the hallways she heard the insane screaming that seemed everpresent in this area of the citadel and she suddenly realized that this might be what janus had been referring to when he mentioned the plight of the talis slaves she shivered finally janus stopped at wulfgars door at a nod from him the two slaver guards on duty there slid back the bolt this is where i leave you my dear janus said simply i am needed elsewhere do enjoy yourself the two guards escorted her inside then walked back into the hall she heard them swing the door shut again and slide the bolt across locking her in it was quiet and cool in the rooms a direct contrast to the horror of what she had just left hearing her enter wulfgar came in from the balcony and came to her as his strong arms closed around her she began to cry he started to speak but decided not to instead he just held her placed his face against her long dark ringlets and let her weep when the tears finally stopped she wiped her eyes and looked up into his rugged comforting face then she led him over to the bed and pulled him down to sit beside her taking both his hands in hers she began to speak she told him of how the painted monster had teased the other slaves then ordered the slaver to kill whoever might manage to get hold of the prize laid before them on the floor as he listened wulfgars face darkened and the muscles in his jaw clenched tight when she had finally finished her tears came again wulfgar held her close she looked pleadingly into his hazel eyes i cannot go on like this she whispered sadly i know janus will keep humiliating me this way he enjoys it far too much to let it stop ashamed she lowered her face again what can i do wishing he knew what to say wulfgar stroked her cheek wiping away some of the tears i dont know he answered truthfully i feel sorry for the others but my heart also wants you to survive as best you can is that selfish of me perhaps he paused for a moment thinking for some unknown reason i seem to be important to those in power here he said at last when this leader named krassus finally comes i might be able to persuade him to let you stay here with me placing a finger beneath her chin he raised her face back up to his would you like that for the first time in days serena managed a smile her heart was sure of this strong gentle man she took one of his hands in hers and placed it on her breast understanding wulfgar looked into her eyes are you sure he asked gently smiling she reached behind him and freed his long sandy hair from its worn leather band she watched his mane fall down around his shoulders and ran her fingers through it slowly narrowing his eyes slightly wulfgar gently laid her down on the bed his breathing had quickened and there was a strong sense of command about him that she desperately wanted to surrender herself to as his mouth met hers her body rose to meet him chapter twentythree y ou did what to my herb cubiculum faegan shouted shailiha had never seen him so angry as if the loss of tree town and so many of the gnomes he loved hadnt been enough now he had just learned that his cubiculum had been partially destroyed his face was bright red and his graygreen eyes were practically bulging out a rare sight indeed the paragon swung from its gold chain around his neck refracting its bloodred light about the room lionel the little sat at the table his little body trembling his broken spectacles hung off the end of his nose the singed tuft of hair was bathed in sweat and stuck flat to his forehead he suddenly wished he had never ever heard of herbs but the explosion was a small one master he countered lamely not as large or destructive as the two others and i there have been others faegan exploded he slammed both his hands down on the armrests of his chair on wheels shailiha celeste and lionel had returned on schedule after hiding the bags of herbs and the vat of oils and cleaning up the laboratory as best they could they had spent one night in shadowood during which time there had been no sign of any other demonslavers when they finally exited faegans portal they found wigg abbey and faegan waiting anxiously for them seeing that the womens jerkins were bloodied and that they had none of the herbs or oils abbey had requested the wizards had demanded an explanation but first shailiha anxiously inquired about tristan only to learn that there was still no word after hearing what shailiha and celeste had to say the wizards then ordered everyone to the hall of blood records to discuss the situation further at the table sat wigg faegan abbey shailiha celeste and lionel shailiha had requested that morganna be brought to her and she now held her baby happily in her sling atop a pedestal in one corner of the room sat the tome of the paragon with a great sigh faegan leaned forward placing his hands flat upon the table he looked directly at shailiha as he did she could feel his immense power do you mean to tell me that every remaining bit of dried herb and refined oil left in my cubiculum has been contaminated he asked yes she answered sadly as she rocked her child we arrived in time to save most of the gnomes from death and some of tree town from fire but not in time to keep the slavers from stealing what they needed and mixing together the remaining herbs and oils had we not arrived when we did there would most probably be nothing left to use at all im sorry we didnt do more dont be sorry wigg said compassionately from the other side of the table if it hadnt been for the two of you we would have lost everything were very proud of what you have done smiling at them both he placed an affectionate hand over his daughters yes they are indeed to be commended abbey added and thank the afterlife for celestes forestallment but do any of you fully understand how much more difficult our task has just become the herbmistress was clearly frustrated sighing angrily she ran a hand back through her graystreaked dark hair what was once considered arduous has now become virtually impossible she continued and we are still no closer to finding tristan wulfgar or these scrolls you speak of not to mention discerning what krassus eventual goals in all of this might be celeste looked over at faegan if only a small bit of one herb blew up the laboratory then why is it that all of tree town didnt go up when the demonslavers were burning the herbs by the bagful she asked faegan scowled i can only assume that is because they were so well mixed i have never experimented with mixing all of my herbs together because i feared what might happen he rubbed his chin thoughtfully so now we know he said in a soft voice still this was a terrible way to have to find out shailiha looked to wigg there is absolutely no word of my brother she asked none of the minion search parties have turned up anything the lead wizard shook his head i am sorry he answered sadly but they continue to search and they wont give up several days ago we sent geldon and traax to parthalon to activate the minion fleet they have been on patrol since plowing the sea of whispers in an attempt to intercept krassus supposed fleet and recover the chosen one we have yet to hear from them shailiha and celeste looked wideeyed at the two old wizards so you sent the fleet out anyway celeste asked incredulously why didnt you tell us because you werent needed and there wasnt time for us to endure yet another of your blatant pleadings to go along with them wigg said trying to keep his tone light you are both very strong valuable allies and we thought your considerable talents might be better used for other things as it turned out we were right shailiha glared at the wizards as she tried her best to be angry with them but in the end she couldnt she and celeste had been so sure they had manipulated them but in truth it had been the other way around she was once again reminded that there was always more to dealing with wigg and faegan than first met the eye so what do we do now she asked the table in general morganna cooed and the princess gave her a little hug abbey and lionel shall eventually go back to shadowood to try to unravel the riddle of the herbs and the oils faegan answered the bulk of the minion forces will remain here after all we cannot be sure that krassus and his demonslavers arent still in eutracia we must make sure the castle and the redoubt are well protected he paused there is something else i wish to tell you all he added after a moment and this must come first before anyone returns to shadowood i have been doing research into the tome to see if i might come up with something more to help us with these problems of the herbs and oils and after hearing your story i am most glad that i did raising one arm he commanded the tome to come to him it rose into the air and floated across the room to come to rest on the table narrowing his eyes he employed the craft to open it to a particular section of the text then he looked back up at the lead wizard tell me he asked wigg have you ever heard of the chambers of penitence no wigg answered skeptically what are you talking about at first i did not remember the phrase either faegan replied but when i used my gift of consummate recollection to scan the tome for the words herbs and oils a strange thing happened i also kept seeing the words chambers of penitence in my mind not just once mind you but over and over again until they started to crowd everything else out it was as if the tome was desperately trying to tell me something heretofore the text had only been a silent static entity but now it was as if it had suddenly come alive just as the paragon has its own otherworldly form of existence it was astounding so i decided to actually read the pages rather than simply rely on my memory and when i did further references to these chambers kept popping up taking me to other related pages in the text and after crisscrossing back and forth in the text this way i was finally led here to a specific volume of the vigors by itself the passage would be confusing but now after having been led here from its many sources the meaning is becoming more clear and just what does the passage say wigg asked faegan looked down at the page and there shall be discovered many chambers of penitence which shall both help to guide their way in the craft and also ensure the existence of the vigors each chamber shall be different in its secrets than the last but each shall reveal aspects of the craft so complex that they must be hidden within the earth but be forewarned for the psychic price of such knowledge shall be dear perhaps even mortal faegan looked up from the great book do you see he asked excitedly wigg leaned forward intensely interested let me show you faegan went on narrowing his eyes again he commanded more of the pages to turn to another part of the text running his finger down the page he finally found what he was looking for if it be of the herbs and oils of the craft that one seeks guidance it shall be found in one of the chambers of penitence within the chamber they shall find the floating gardens of the craft eternally guarded by the watchwoman of the waters but the cost of such knowledge shall be dear indeed and it should be searched out only in times of great distress for the risk is great at the base of the woman of stone one shall begin to find the answers but only with the help of the paragon for it alone shall light the way the woman of stone celeste asked what is that the woman of stone is a rock formation on the coast not too far from here wigg answered rubbing his chin over time the waves have carved the profile of a woman into the rock wall overlooking the sea of whispers it has supposedly existed for eons long enough it would now appear for the ones who came before to know of it as well and use her as a landmark by which to leave one of these socalled chambers of penitence pausing for a moment he looked back over to faegan but what of these floating gardens he asked and who is this watchwoman who is supposedly eternally guarding them and what does the tome mean by the psychic price to be paid we wont know until we go there will we faegan cackled his expression and posture reminded wigg that nothing so entranced his old friend as an unexplained secret of the craft especially if he was the only one to possess the answer i think we should depart first thing in the morning faegan added wigg looked over to abbey to see a hint of disappointment in her eyes it seemed they would be separated again after all then he looked back at faegan and sighed he hoped the master wizard was right chapter twentyfour r aising his sword high tristan narrowly parried the sharp strike from the demonslavers blade the guard had rushed from the deck above to confront him even before he had ascended the last two steps of the stairway struggling against the ceaseless blows he somehow made it topside and gained some badly needed maneuvering room as his opponent raised his sword yet again tristan finally sensed an opening sliding in on the balls of his feet he swung the blade around in a flat perfect circle the tip of the sword sliced the slavers abdomen open and the monster fell to the deck trying to ignore the desperate pain in his back tristan stole a precious moment to get his bearings there were five ships involved in the struggle the wayfarer and the stalwart lay next to one another in the water two of the stillunidentified frigates flanked them the third lay before their bows the three mysterious frigates had employed heavy grappling hooks to pull all the ships together and hold them there there was nothing for the monsters to do but stand and fight all five of the vessels decks swarmed with combatants many of the slave ships sails were torn and hanging down while their masts had fallen shattered to the decks rigging lay everywhere making fighting all the more difficult small fires had broken out here and there dark smoke rising to blur vision suddenly tristan realized what was wrong about it all there were no minion warriors about not a single one the fighters who were struggling alongside him and his fellow slaves seemed to be a ragtag unorganized lot at best each of them fought with skill and abandon as if every moment were his last they seemed to have precious little fear of the demonslavers and relished killing them almost as if they all had personal scores to settle amid the blood the screaming and the clashing of weapons tristan found himself stunned and confused a trident came whistling through the air to bury itself directly beside his head in the thick mast that stood just behind him instinctively he reached behind his right shoulder to grasp one of his throwing knives only to remember that they werent there cursing he finally saw the demonslaver that had thrown the trident he stood a little way across the bloody deck glaring at him sword in hand the monster smiled and nastily beckoned the prince forward on impulse tristan raised his sword high and ran toward the slaver across the slippery deck as he neared though he caught a glimpse of yet another slaver running around the corner of the wheelhouse and realized he was trapped tristan knew he couldnt possibly take them bothespecially without his usual weapons at his command so he kept going for all he was worth intent on cutting down at least the first of them holding his blade in a onehanded grip straight out before him tristan ran in and roughly pushed the slavers sword arm to one side with his free hand then he plunged the point of his sword directly into the demonslavers throat he turned the edge of the blade sharply then raised one foot and pushed the body off his sword blood rushed from the slavers neck as he fell to the deck tristan turned around as fast as he could to face the one rushing up behind him if he died this day so be itat least he would have the satisfaction of knowing that he had taken several more of the awful demonslavers to their graves with him but what he saw surprised him a great bear of a man had come up behind the other slaver and taken it around the neck with one of his huge arms the mans other arm was pushing on the back of the demonslavers head forcing it down and forward suddenly the man gave the slavers head another forceful shove downward and tristan heard the neck snap like a dry tree branch then the giant picked up the dead body and threw it a good five meters across the deck as if it weighed nothing tristan couldnt help but stand speechless for a moment looking into the eyes of the fighter who had just saved his life he was the largest human being the prince had ever seeneven taller and heavier than most of the minion warriors easily topping seven feet he wore torn bloody breeches and nothing elseno shoes shirt or weapons of any kind he seemed to be a bit older than tristan and his eyes were dark his head was cleanshaven and his hugely muscular body was covered with scars of every description one of which ran diagonally down across his forehead over his left eye and onto his cheek tristan watched in awe as yet another demonslaver his sword held high rushed toward the giant with a speed tristan would have thought impossible for one so large the man turned and grabbed the slavers sword arm giving it a sharp twist the arm broke blood and splintered bone erupting through the white skin as the slaver screamed in agony the giant picked him up easily and then let him fall straight down onto his raised right knee then he lifted the dead body up into his arms as if it too were weightless and it went flying across the deck after giving the prince an expressionless look the giant turned away searching for another victim tristan looked around but could find no immediate enemy the battle was clearly subsiding and it seemed that his mysterious saviors had won the day exhausted chest heaving tristan lowered his sword his first impulse was to find the sojourner but clearly she was not here turning to the east he squinted into the sun and let his gaze pan across the horizon finally he found it the white speck of sail in the faroff distance that meant krassus and his herbmistress had escaped angrily he turned back to the nowquiet battle scene bodieshuman and demonslaver alikelay everywhere in impossible poses the wayfarer and the stalwart lay low in the sea and the fires upon them were still flaring up here and there groups of the stillunidentified crew were busy trying to put them out before the flames licked their way over to their own ships weapons bone and organs littered the decks which were awash in blood slaves walked vacantly amid the carnage staring at nothing others simply sat on the bloody decks sobbing in horror and gratitude some of the victorious fighters were already looting the two slave ships loading their bounty of humans food and water aboard the three mysterious frigates in one corner of the aft deck of the wayfarer part of the crew that had saved them were busy lining up the surviving captive slavers forcing them to their knees and beheading them one by one the bodies and heads were thrown overboard drawn by the blood packs of sharks had begun to form their dorsal fins curving ominously through the waves at first tristans heart recoiled at the casual beheading of the demonslavers and he gave momentary thought to trying to stop it but then he remembered that he wasnt in charge here he finally decided that after witnessing all of the brutality the slavers were capable of he simply didnt care what happened to them he walked on deciding that he had to discover who was in command surely this group of saviors would have a captain and tristan was anxious to meet him then one of the men who had helped free them began rounding up the slaves in a firm controlled voice he told them to walk to the bow deck of the peoples revenge the ship still barring their way there they were to await further orders tristan soon found himself among a trudging crowd of slaves as the pitiful mass of humanity slowly made its way across a gangplank and aboard the mysterious frigate the crowd quickly became huge and at first tristan couldnt see what was occurring after a time he could tell that the slaves were being asked to come forward one by one to be viewed by the captain who was seated in a redupholstered highbacked chair that had been brought up on deck after the captain had carefully looked at a slave he would then motion him or her to one side to receive food water and better clothing tristan desperately wanted to tell the captain who he was and request that he take him to tammerland as soon as possible however he was reticent about revealing his identity to a stranger as he neared he decided to ask for a private meeting at last tristans turn arrived he stepped forward he looked up and his jaw dropped the captain was a woman stunned tristan looked again he had at first mistaken her for a man due to her short hair and manner of dress she sat very casually in the highbacked chair with one long leg thrown up over one of its arms she wore battered black knee boots tight breeches of brown and tan vertical stripes ran high up her waist ending just short of her breasts one of the demonslavers short swords hung low on her hips from a wide leather belt that stretched suggestively from the top of the right hip to the lower part of the left blood still dripped from its hilt telling tristan that she had done more than simply give orders this day her stiff brown leather jacket was buttoned about halfway up it was topped with an open equally stiff collar that ran up around the back of her neck in a semicircle that reached almost as high as her earlobes her face was pretty but also conveyed a strong sense of power dark fine brows arched over large expressive blue eyes with exceptionally long lashes her nose was short and straight her lips were red and full the unusually short dark brown hair was some sort of outrageous urchinlike affair that went every which way it was almost as though she either had no conception of how to wear it or didnt much care how it looked for some reason tristan thought it was the latter from each of her earlobes dangled large gold hoops the scarred giant who had saved tristans life stood obediently by her side his arms folded over his great barrel chest she looked the prince over quietly for a moment taking in his unusual clothes scraggly beard and dark blue eyes apparently unimpressed she then motioned for him to move to one side and join the other slaves she had already examined but tristan knew he must speak to her now or he might never get another chance for better or worse he decided to stand his ground i must speak with you captain he said loudly as one of her crew tried to lead him away at first he didnt resist he still had the sword but he didnt want to cause trouble unless he had to i have information that is vital to us both you simply must hear me out she leveled her blue eyes at him i feel sorry for you all but have no time to hear individual stories she said calmly her voice was smooth and had a sort of smoky sensuality about it with a nod from her two more of her crew began to take him away but as they turned tristan around and began to push him to one side he heard her voice ring out wait her crewmembers immediately stopped and tristan turned toward her again stepping down from her chair she walked around behind him she closely examined the glowing blood that was dripping from his back then placed a finger under his vest and touched one of his wounds lightly tristan cringed but held his ground removing her hand she looked at the bizarre azure blood on her fingertips saying nothing she turned and motioned for the giant to come to her he was there in an instant as he leaned over she whispered something in his ear the giant nodded and took tristan by the arm looking up at the colossus tristan knew there would be no escape from him with a single twist of his free hand the giant took the princes sword away and tossed it to the deck this man is called scars she told tristan quietly the reasons why should be obvious he is my first mate he will escort you to other quarters where you will bathe and shave then i will speak to you tristan tried to take a step forward if for no other reason than to test the strength of the one called scars but it was like being locked in an iron vise i dont need to be treated any differently than the others he protested but it is imperative that you and i speak he looked back up at the giant then at the captain again preferably in private he thought he saw a hint of a smile cross her lips but if so it vanished just as quickly saying nothing more she indicated to scars that the prince should be taken away scars lifted tristan to his toes as if he weighed nothing and literally danced him across the deck like a marionette as he took the prince down a stairway leading to the lower decks of the peoples revenge the captain took her chair and resumed her odd process of reviewing each and every slave t he quarters scars led tristan to were humble but after life as a slave they seemed as luxurious as anything in the royal palace there was a bed a tub and a washstand containing shaving things there was also a mirror and a porthole after some crewmen brought water and filled the tub the first thing the prince did was remove his right boot and make sure he still had the brain hook and the piece of mysterious parchment setting the weapon aside he unrolled the parchment and turned it to the light of the window there was no writing on it it was very old and yellowed and he felt certain somehow that it had come from the scroll of the vagaries but who had put it there however it had gotten there he knew it must be taken to the wizards at onceand it was up to him to find a way to make that happen without letting anyone else know that it existed wondering how he would ever manage such a thing he carefully replaced both the brain hook and the parchment back into the boot then he removed his other boot and the rest of his clothes and set about shaving and bathing trying to pay special attention to the wounds on his back tending them hurt terribly but it had to be done just as he was finishing he felt the peoples revenge lurch and he knew they were leaving the scene of the battle as he dressed he wondered two things first he wanted to know where his own weapons were had they been found he always felt naked without them and now was no exception second was scars still outside in the hallway waiting for him that question at least was easily answered opening the cabin door he saw the giant standing there quietly arms folded over his huge chest seeing tristan scars solemnly pointed back the way they had come and shortly they were topside again the sunlight and breeze felt good on the princes freshly shaven face things had changed drastically in the short time he had been below the peoples revenge flanked by her two sister ships was headed west at full sail her ragged crewmen swarming over her like an army of busy ants back to the east clouds of smoke billowed on the horizon tristan respected this female captain whoever she was as scars led him aft he looked over the men who had saved his life they were definitely a ragtag group their clothes were torn and bloodied and many of them wore colorful bandanas on their heads earrings occasionally dangled alongside their faces which were more often than not covered by beards and mustaches each man seemed to bristle with weapons and most of them had the hardened weathered look of those who had spent most of their lives at sea tristan had never heard of pirates running the sea of whispers these men certainly looked the part though scars led tristan past the ships wheel and down another flight of stairs finally the giant stopped before large double doors after knocking once he waited for the reply then opened the doors and ushered tristan inside the prince was surprised at the size and beauty of the room curved stainedglass windows lined the entire stern wall and had been opened filling the space with dappled sunlight bouncing off the waves ornate giltedged scrollwork lined the corners of the ceiling and the window frames the floor was covered with patterned rugs a huge desk and several chairs sat just forward of the windows a luxurious fourposter bed filled one wall next to the open door to what looked to be a private washroom the room smelled faintly of wine smoke and fresh salt air the captain sat at the great desk poring over several charts her sword and baldric were slung over the high upholstered back of her chair on the desk were a large wheel of cheese with a knife stuck in it and a broken loaf of bread accompanied by a halfconsumed bottle of red wine tristan suddenly realized how long it had been since he had last eaten finally the captain looked up saying nothing she indicated an empty chair on tristans side of the desk id rather stand he said wryly ive had quite enough of sitting down for a while the captain gave scars a look and the giant picked tristan up in both arms and unceremoniously dumped him into the leather chair as if he were a rag doll wincing at the fresh pain in his back the prince scowled doesnt he ever talk he asked angrily the captain actually smiled she looked up at scars you may leave us she said simply i think i can handle whatever might arise are you sure captain the giant replied his speaking voice was unexpectedly elegant his manner seems quite uncivilized to me scars diction was eloquent and educated at odds with his rough appearance yes im certain she answered but if it makes you feel better you may stand just outside the door scars gave tristan a distinct look of warning then went to the double doors as he walked through them his body seemed to take up the entire doorway then the doors closed quietly behind him and tristan and the captain were alone she wasted no time now then who are you she asked you clean up nicely but i have never seen blue glowing blood before its quite unique tristan thought for a moment something inside still made him reticent about telling her who he was but he suspected that if he was ever going to get home he would probably have to be at least partly honest with her taking a deep breath he looked intently into her eyes i am tristan crown prince of eutracia he said firmly son of nicholas and morganna now dead my blood glows because i am of the craft of magic this time the captains smile was followed by outright derisive laughter but of course you are the crown princehere on my ship how amazing perhaps i should bow he scowled you dont believe me her face suddenly became more serious actually i do she answered opening a drawer she produced a parchment it was rolled up and tied with a ribbon she casually tossed it across the desk reaching out tristan took it and opened it it was a copy of one of the wanted posters of him that his son nicholas had ordered distributed across eutracia before he died at the gates of dawn tristan looked back up at her its a good likeness dont you think she asked and weve recovered some weapons like those shown in the portrait she paused for a moment thinking this proves an interesting situation i must say i might just turn you in and claim the reward myself one hundred thousand kisa is a great deal of money and my men have not been paid in some time tristan tossed the awful warrant back onto her desk im sorry to disappoint you but the reward no longer exists he answered the one who was distributing the posters is now dead really she asked it was clear she remained unconvinced what happened to him tristans jaw hardened i found him first unperturbed the captain put one long leg up on the desk then crossed the other over it reaching out she grasped an ornate inlaid wooden box and pulled it toward her from the box she produced a cigarillo rolled of some type of dark plant leaf pulling an oil lamp near she placed the tube in her mouth lit the end and blew the smoke down through her nose finally she looked back at him from what city were you taken she asked and tell me is it really true that you murdered your own father and also oversaw the murders of the entire directorate of wizards as this poster says my my but you have been a bad boy you might fit in well here tristan was growing angrier by the moment despite the fact that she had saved him and the other slaves that wasnt enough to make him trust her he was tired of her insults and he desperately wanted some answers of his own you first he said who in the name of the afterlife are you and what gives you the right to fly my battle flag calmly drawing in more smoke she raised her face and blew it toward the ceiling as she did tristan watched it disappear into the saltladen air i am teresa of the house of welborne she answered calmly my friends call me tyranny tyranny yes she smiled apparently i was quite a handful when i was growing up my late father jokingly bastardized teresa into tyranny and it stuck my mother never forgave him but then again i always was more tomboy than dainty little girl leaning forward in his chair tristan decided to press youre looking for someone arent you he asked thats why you and your ships are out here plowing up and down the sea of whispers its also why you lined up all the slavesin hopes of finding whoever it is youre looking for he could tell he had struck a nerve but he also realized that if he ever wanted to get home now might be a good time for some flattery and by the way he added quietly the blood i saw on the hilt of your sword tells me that you do more than simply give orders well done tyrannys eyes narrowed you catch on quickly she answered my older brother was taken by the demonslavers one night both my parents were killed trying to fight them off and give me time to escape we lived in farpointwhere most of the slaving activity seems to be taking place my father owned the largest fleet of fishing vessels in the city and i used to work with him i have been looking for my brother ever since and i wont stop until i find him that explains your familiarity with these waters tristan mused and scars he asked i have never seen anyone quite like him where did he come from scars was one of my fathers most trusted employees she answered we grew up together he got his wounds and his huge muscles from wrestling live sharks out of the sea for fun from my fathers boats he loved my father dearly and he would die for me and he can tear a demonslaver apart with his bare hands tell me tristan asked do you know how to safely cross the sea of whispers have you ever done so i do know she answered and we have we tortured the information out of one of the captured demonslavers theyre a tough lot but time spent with scars can be very effective it seems that with the death of the coven of sorceresses the necrophagians are now willing to accept their grisly tribute from anyone who wants to crossprovided the dead bodies are sufficient in number of course we used the demonslaver bodies as payment but we have only done so once and i certainly dont recommend it casually she lifted her glass and took a sip of wine would you like some she asked and nodded toward an empty glass it seemed her demeanor was starting to soften too thirsty to stand on ceremony tristan took the glass and poured himself some wine he drank it down in a single draft then poured another and sat back in his chair where did this crew of yours come from he asked how do you pay them and how did you come by these ships my crew is a combination of my fathers old employees and other men who asked to join us after my reputation began to grow she answered as you might imagine many of them are also looking for lost friends or relatives and what better way to do it than this they have become a ruthless and determined lot i can assure you pausing she took another sip of the wine then another lungful of smoke she hissed what remained of the smoke toward the ceiling as for their pay and food both come from the kisa and provisions usually given us by grateful family members when we return their loved ones to them she continued i dont demand such payment but i dont refuse it either after all this operation has to run on something besides altruism wouldnt you agree how i got my ships is another story the first belonged to my father we renamed her the peoples revenge and went from there the two other frigates that now sail alongside us are both slaver conquests tristan stared at her even further impressed by this strongwilled woman he thought for a moment and then decided to take a risk do you know a man named krassus or a woman named grizelda he asked or have you ever heard of documents called the scrolls of the ancients tyranny shook her head have you ever encountered a slave named wulfgar no she answered why do you ask theyre people and things i am searching for much the same way you search for your brother he said as nonchalantly as he could he decided to change the subject do you know why these demonslavers are taking our people again she shook her head then tristan thought of something else have you ever heard of a place called the citadel he asked he fully expected her to say she had not but her face darkened not only have i heard of it but i have seen it she answered solemnly its an island to the east with a huge stone fortress atop ita massive forbidding place hewn directly from the living rock that makes up the island it looks ancient we learned of its location from a captured demonslaver i have even charted its location on my maps we decided to go there and actually got to within half a league of it before being forced to turn back the waters surrounding the citadel are swarming with slaver ships after they saw us we came about and barely got away with our lives it was clear that despite her bravado tyrannys experience with the citadel had had a strong effect upon her and tristan was by now quite sure she was a woman who was not easily frightened fascinated he leaned forward in his chair could you lead another fleet there if you had to he asked eagerly do you really know the way of course she answered i know this ocean as well as anyone alive but hear me well going there is blatant suicide tristan looked at her for a long moment absorbing all that he had just heard the breeze from the open windows wafted through the room gently moving her scruffy dark hair and her blue eyes continued to regard him with confidence a slight smile came to his lips so youre really a pirate he asked tyranny smiled we prefer to think of ourselves as privateers doing the work that the vanquished monarchy no longer can we would of course prefer to do so under authenticated letters of marque but the king and the wizards who might have granted them to us are now all dead letters of marque tristan repeated quizzically for the crown prince of eutracia you dont seem to know much about your own history she quipped letters of marque were papers granted by the wizards to privateers during the sorceresses war these documents gave official sanction to the raiding of the covens vessels and the killing of their servants they also allowed the privateer to legally keep a portion of any of the booty recovered it was a very nice arrangement actually the wizards didnt have to dirty their hands and a brave enterprising privateer could do very well it was almost impossible to take a ship that had a sorceress aboard of course but if one could be found manned only by blood stalkers or unendowed humans who had been pressed into the covens service it could be a great prize indeed for the sorceresses ships often carried treasure but those days are long gone im afraid how do you know all of this tristan asked some of the original privateers of the sorceresses war were my forebears she answered then inhaled more of the smoke leaning back she arched her back like a cat and adjusted her slim frame slightly in the chair when the war ended their continuing love for the ocean turned them into fishermen not as exciting but infinitely safer you also might enjoy knowing that the resolve the vessel the lead wizard supposedly used to banish the coven to the sea of whispers was owned by the last of my privateering grandfathers and was loaned to the newly formed directorate for just that purpose her ships wheel was taken from her and handed down through the generations it means a great deal to me and is now the same one that guides this ship tristan smiled and shook his head and you run my battle flag he mused the lion and the broadsword where did you get it that was simple she replied unfortunately since the destruction caused by the coven your flag can often be found needful of a place to fly besides what other banner should we run in our fight against the demonslavers i love my country leaning forward tristan placed his glass on the desk he wasnt sure he could trust her but he had no other choice he looked meaningfully into tyrannys wide blue eyes how would you like to make more kisa than youve ever seen in your entire life he asked quietly just now youre in no position to pay such a sum she answered and youre in no position to ask for any favors either another puff of bluish smoke poured out her nose but my wizards are he answered and all you would have to do is take me to the cavalon delta and release me from there you and i could easily make our way to tammerland where you would be paid no harm would befall you and my wizards would be most appreciative i assure you with a word from me they could conjure enough kisa to sink this ship certainly more than enough to allow you to continue to look for your brother and to do so for as long as you need to we might even be able to help you find him tyranny removed her long legs from the desk and sat upright in her chair she ran a quick hand through her short hair tousling it even further the wizards are all dead everybody knows that she answered skeptically shaking her head this is just a trick to secure your release the reported deaths of the wizards were not entirely true tristan countered wigg the lead wizard still lives as does another named faegan in fact i believe they would be happy to hear about what you have been doing i might even be able to convince them to give you your letters of marque and recognize you officially if it means that much to you then he sat back desperately hoping his offer was enough he simply had to get back to tammerland and give the wizards the scrap of parchment hidden in his boot he could see that tyranny was sorely tempted if i were to do this thing my price would be the one hundred thousand kisa that were supposedly offered by the warrant she said craftily and i would also require some form of collateral against the possibility that youre lying in that regard i think the medallion hanging around your neck would do nicely the quality of its gold appears to be particularly high melted down it would go a long way toward convincing me tristan looked down at the medallion he saw that he had little other choice he looked back up at tyranny with determined eyes i agree he said quietly but i have conditions conditions tyranny asked i could just have scars come in and take the medallion from you you know then set sail for any place i choose yes he answered but i dont think you will something about honor among thieves silence reigned for a moment their eyes locked together in a battle of wills what are your conditions she asked finally leaning her arms on the desk no detourswe sail directly to the cavalon delta he answered if other slave ships are sighted on the way you do not engage them you are also to return my weapons to me and keep my real identity a secret on this ship in addition when we reach the palace you will draw a chart for my wizards showing them the exact location of the citadel and there is one other thing he added tyrannys blue eyes narrowed it was clear she wasnt used to demands and that is you allow me to wear my medallion until our business is concluded either one way or another tyranny leaned back in her chair you demand a great deal she said one hundred thousand kisa is a great deal of money he answered he purposely let his words hang in the air for a moment from our current position how long before we could reach the delta she looked down at one of her charts if the winds hold six days silence engulfed the room tristan held his breath wondering what her answer would be finally she stood raising her right hand she spat into her palm and held it out done she said standing up as well tristan looked at her quizzically its the way a privateers bargain was sealed in the old days tyranny said with a wry smile and it remains the best she held her hand out a bit farther smiling tristan spat into his right hand and took hers into it and done he answered back for the first time since entering the room he thought he might be able to trust her but only time would tell tyranny pulled a small piece of parchment toward her took up a quill and began to write out their agreement she handed it over to tristan and he read it like its author it came straight to the point picking up the quill tristan signed it with a false name then handed it back to her studying the fresh signature tyranny raised an eyebrow this is not who you said you were i also told you that i did not want your crew to know who i am tristan replied calmly youve already shown me the warrant and threatened to turn me in for the reward what kind of fool would i be if i added my real signature to your documents as well dont worrytheres no place for me to run to when you come before my wizards you will have your kisa i assure you and if im lying you and that monster first mate of yours can easily kill me you still have a fortune to win and nothing to lose take it or leave it after thinking for a moment tyranny finally countersigned the agreement folded the parchment and slipped it between her breasts she then called for scars the double doors blew open and the giant was by her side in a flash return this mans weapons to him she ordered he is one of us now and change course for the cavalon delta at full sail we have new business there then she looked at tristan heres the first rule of the peoples revenge she said if you are going to eat our food you must work for itregardless of what other circumstances might prevail between us scars take him topside and feed him then give him something to do perhaps we can make a privateer out of him yet agreed tristan answered without further fanfare scars escorted the prince from the room standing tyranny went to the windows and looked out on the restless sea sensing the peoples revenge heel over to her new course she smiled chapter twentyfive t wentynine watched as his fellow slave pounded the hammer down on the glowing strip of redhot metal then he heard the hiss and saw the steam rise as the man plunged the strip back into the brackish water tempering it again the emerging blade would soon become the business end of a short sword and be added to the heap of homely but effective weapons already lying in the far corner of the room other slaves went about fashioning hilts and guards while still others sharpened and polished the blades then the parts would be assembled into the doubleedged razorsharp swords carried by the demonslavers on the opposite side of the room another group of slaves sat fashioning leather into scabbards and baldrics periodically a slaver would come in to choose a weapon from the pile of new swords and tridents twentynine hung his head still unable to believe that he was plying his craftwhich had always been his pride and his passionfor the benefit of these evil monsters the simple stone chamber in which he worked was very large and had been hewn directly from the rock just as the docks had been a great hole had been fashioned in its ceiling to allow the escape of the smoke generated by the everbusy hearths light was supplied both by the massive oil sconces on the walls and the surging glow of the orangered coals the raucous clanging of the hammers against anvils never seemed to stop and armed demonslavers paced slowly watching every move of the hundred or so slaves who toiled here the room smelled of sweat soot and hot iron twentynine remembered when janus and several of his monstrous servants had first come to where he and his fellow talis slaves were being held and demanded to know what their various trades had been it was a day he would never forget if they were leathersmiths or weapons makers the freak had said then their lives could soon become much easier there was no point in lying he had added for the men in the dark blue robes could enter minds and read the truth punishment would be instant death and so hoping that janus promises would somehow hold true twentynine and a number of others had raised their hands it was not long until they all wished they had not he looked down at his gnarled broken hands knowing that even though he could never properly wield a hammer again he still carried within him an exquisite uncommon knowledge of the craft of sword making even at the relatively young age of thirtythree seasons of new life he had amassed far greater skill than most of the graybeards who had been fashioning swords their entire lives he had owned one of the most prestigious weapons shops in all of eutracia and had employed over one hundred artisans all of them serving under his personal mentorship he had been one of the largest suppliers of arms to the royal guard and had even been asked from time to time to craft special ceremonial weapons for the royal house but those days were long gone due to the destruction of the royal guard at the hands of the winged ones that were rumored to have come from across the sea without the continued support of the monarchy his shop had fallen on hard times then he had been captured and brought to the citadel ironically some of the very men he had employed in his shop now labored with him here in this living nightmare and knowing them as he did twentynine could tell that they were as ashamed of their work as he was but once a person was assigned to this area there was no going back and janus had lied to them for this was a harsher existence than the one they had left behind in the cages when they had first been brought here and told that it would be their job to produce arms for the demonslavers many of them had refusedhimself included janus had simply smiled and marched in another group of fresh talis slaves then he had calmly ordered his demonslavers to behead them as casually as though he had been speaking about the weather from then on he had said every time a craftsman slowed in his production or objected to his duties the number of deaths would double and then double again and so they had grudgingly gone about their work after repeated questioning by janus regarding their various histories and abilities twentynine had been singled out to oversee the labors of all the others and take ultimate responsibility for the quality of the weapons they made he yearned to fight back but he didnt know how he knew his ruined hands could never effectively employ a sword against the slavers even if he and his fellow slaves did manage to take up arms there were more than enough guards stationed in this room alone to cut them to ribbons but there was one way to hurt them he realized he would take his own life for he was the glue that held the workers together and kept them productive without his presence the quality of the weapons would suffer drastically that would not only hurt the demonslavers cause but perhaps even take a few of them when it came time for them to fight how he wished he could see that day but he would have to be satisfied with merely taking such knowledge to his grave his mood darkened even further as he looked around twentynine had always been an honorable man making superb weapons for the justifiable defense of his nation this was different this was the forced production of homely crude instruments meant for little more than outright butchery of the innocent and he would have no more of it today would be the day he began making his way toward the pile of finished weapons in the corner he was careful to give the appearance of wanting to inspect several of them as had become his custom it would not raise any suspicion until it was too late picking up one of the short swords he felt as much as saw the watchful eyes of several of the demonslavers on him taking a deep breath twentynine drew the sword and dropped the scabbard to the floor holding the weapon between both palms without wrapping his fingers around it twentynine let the blades point fall to the floor and bobbed it up and down a bit testing its balance then he grasped the hilt as best his damaged hands would allow turning it this way and that so as to inspect the crazing on either side of the blade satisfied he gently ran his thumb over one edge at a time testing the sharpness finally he grasped the handle and turned the blade around extending it as far from his body as he could its point squarely directed toward his chest and only inches from his skin then he made a great show of examining the blood groove for uniformity just as he had already done hundreds of times before in this awful place by now his tortured hands had begun to shake and he desperately hoped he wasnt about to give himself away as he closed his eyes he held the sword as rigidly before him as possible and let his knees collapse but as he started to drop a strange whirring passed by his right ear he felt a huge impact against the blade of the sword heard an awful earsplitting clang surprised he opened his eyes and stopped his fall just in time to see the blade go flying against the far wall then crash harmlessly to the stone floor janus blackandwhite iron spheres tangled with it had not only pulled the sword from his hands but had also cleanly broken its blade in half the weapon that was to have been both his salvation and his personal revenge on the demonslavers now lay in a broken useless heap demonslavers grabbed him by either arm and held him tight he knew what to expect janus was standing on the opposite side of the room gloating twentynine hadnt seen him there saying nothing janus walked over to where the damaged sword lay and unwound his weapon from the broken blade smiling again he coiled up the blackandwhite line and replaced it upon his belt with a single vicious swipe janus struck twentynine across the face groaning softly twentynine hung drunkenly between the slavers trying to regain his focus janus grasped twentynines chin and raised the slaves face up to his own did you really think it would be so easy he asked sarcastically you will never be allowed to die until we dictate it of that i can assure you but have no fear before we are finished with all of you you will beg us for your deaths and we will give them to you he looked at the two slavers holding twentynine from now on his hands are to be bound behind his back at all times he sneered even when he is sleeping the others shall hold the weapons for him to inspect when it comes time for him to eat one of you shall feed him then janus turned to look at a door at the far end of the room as an added incentive to behave i think we should show this one a bit more of what actually goes on here behind closed doors janus sauntered to the heavy stone door and opened it bring him he said casually over his shoulder the slavers lifted twentynine and dragged him toward it on his toes as the remaining slaves and demonslavers watched the four of them went through the door closed behind them still dazed held upright by the slavers twentynine at first couldnt make out the scene before him but he could hear the insane pleading and screaming well enough it was coming from men and women alike and never seemed to pause as his vision swam into focus he raised his head and looked the first thing he did was scream then warm urine ran uncontrollably down the insides of his thighs forming a puddle at his feet closing his eyes twentynine tried desperately to free himself from the slavers and bolt for the door but he was powerless in their grip he began to tremble and then to cry hold him janus ordered removing an ornate dagger from his belt he came to stand before twentynine and placed the cool sharp tip of the blade to the blacksmiths throat cold sweat beaded on twentynines forehead either look at what i brought you here to see or join those in this room janus said softly menacingly the same fate awaits you should you shirk your labors or try to take your life again do you understand twentynine opened his eyes as he did the men in the dark blue robes he had seen at the docks looked calmly back at him from their slow deliberate labors several of them smiled another even more terrified scream came from him mixing with the others still echoing horrifically through the room finally he could take no more he felt his mind slipping and he fainted away hanging limply in the grasp of the demonslavers smiling janus put away his knife part iii regret chapter twentysix regret such a simple easy word to say and yetfor so many of usso difficult to dismiss from our memories what other single word conjures up not only such sublime sorrow but also the sweet forlorn loss of what might have been act upon act regret upon regret turning with the time enchantments forever even so it is not the wise man who casts away such memories but rather the foolish one from the personal diaries of wigg onetime lead wizard of the directorate of wizards l ately i have noticed a distinct twinkle in your eye that i had not seen since my return to tammerland faegan told wigg wryly with a wink and a smile as the minion litter bounced them along through the sky my compliments by the way while its true she and i have had our differences regarding the art of herbmastery abbey is certainly a lovely and intelligent woman youre a very lucky man wigg pursed his lips then turned from the window to scowl at the wizard sitting across from him the morning air was cold at this altitude and wigg defiantly thrust his hands into the sleeves of his robe to warm them he hoped they would arrive at the coast soon wigg had expected faegan to bring up the subject of his relationship with abbey long before this especially given the way the other wizard loved to tease him at least faegan had chosen a private moment between them to broach the subject sighing wigg pushed his tongue against the inside of one cheek is it that obvious he asked back oh yes faegan answered happily there is a boyish spring in your step and a recurring smile on your face that i have not seen for three centuries the others may not notice but i do abbey and i would very much like to leave the others uninformed at least for the time being wigg said sternly his face reddened uncharacteristically i understand completely faegan said smiling mischievously shaking his head wigg gave a short derisive snort and returned to watching the ribbon of the sippora river snaking through the landscape far below they had been traveling for the better part of two hours and were very close to their destination their goal was to reach the coast by midday ox flew point a short distance ahead while six other minions carried the litter through the air and four more flew guard the morning was bright cold and cloudless and the lush greenery of the eutracian landscape passed below them peacefully belying the many troubles the nation still suffered suddenly the litter banked to the left and began to lose altitude through the window the jagged coastline could be seen stony cliffs constantly bombarded by the frothtipped waves of the sea of whispers then wigg finally saw it the smooth formation of stone that legend said had been carved out by the restless sea shouting out to the minions he ordered them to fly up to it and hover just above the waves both wizards gazed silently at the dark majestic stone face it was not a new sight for themthe woman of stone had long been an attraction of some note for eutracian citizensbut no matter how many times one had seen it viewing it was always an eerie aweinspiring experience especially now given the revelation that the image before them apparently held far more secrets than anyone had previously imagined wigg opened the door of the litter and stepped out into the air using the craft to hover just above the waves by the imposing edifice faegan levitated his chair exited the litter and glided up alongside him the roaring ocean below splashed constantly against the slick stone and the sea wind pestered the wizards snatching at their robes and hair looking up wigg beckoned to ox to come lower order the litter to the cliffs and wait for us there he shouted against the sound of the sea theres no telling how long we might be if the provisions in the litter run out order some of the warriors back to the palace for more or hunt for what you need but i want at least enough of you here at all times to carry the litter when we come back out wigg looked back to the edifice and his jaw hardened if we come back out that is nodding ox turned away to carry out his orders the cold salty wind continued to whip at the wizards as they hovered just feet above the angry waves wigg looked at the woman of stone again the face was largeat least ten meters high and another four or five meters acrossand impressive beautiful but at the same time commanding long strands of stone hair hung down past the shoulders to descend into the sea and the huge eyes lay peacefully closed behind heavy seductive lids the nose was slim the lips were both sensuous and inviting the cheekbones were high and elegant black as night and polished to a smooth luster by the sea she seemed the very picture of serene detached femininity whether a face of such elegance and detail could have been carved naturally from the waves had been a great subject of debate for as long as eutracia had existed there was a distinct minority who insisted she must be a purely natural phenomenona freak of nature as it were most however argued that she was far too refined far too perfect to be an accident and must therefore be the result of some arcane use of the craft from eons earlier wigg was entirely convinced it was the latter wigg looked over to faegan to comment on the beauty of the face and stopped stunned the paragon was glowing the squarecut bloodred jewel of the craft lying about faegans neck had always seemed to have a life of its own and tended to be faintly luminous no matter the time of day or the circumstances surrounding it but this was incredible the jewel was glowing with blinding red light suddenly without warning two narrow perfectly straight beams shot from the paragon and tore toward the stone womans eyes wigg and faegan hovered speechless wondering what would happen next then as abruptly as they had appeared the beams vanished and the jewel returned to normal baffled the two wizards looked at each other then back at the stone woman the eyes were beginning to open slowly the huge heavy lids parted revealing piercing eyes of the most intense azure the eyes regarded them calmly for a few moments the lids gently blinked and then the lips began to move you are of the craft the stone woman said her words coming to them quite clearly over the pounding waves her voice was compassionate yet strong you carry the paragon and so you may see me for what i truly am welcome and well done wigg found his voice first who are you he asked are you the watchwoman of the floating gardens no she replied she awaits within i am but one left by those you call the ones who came before i oversee the first of the tests required to successfully enter and leave this chamber of penitence do you wish to enter the lips closed again and the amazing azure eyes continued to regard the two wizards in silence fascinated faegan floated closer to the beautiful dark face yes he said simply we wish to enter the stone lips parted again and do you both know that there is a psychic price to be paid for what can be learned here be warned for it may be a demand that your human minds find too dear to survive what is this psychic price faegan asked that is not my place to say she answered softly the watchwoman of the gardens will tell you more should i deign to let you enter and how may we enter wigg asked you must pass my test she answered the beautiful face remained expressionless i must first be sure that you are not practitioners of the vagaries the knowledge kept within must never be allowed to pass into the hands of those who would prefer to practice the darker aspects of the craft for the first time she showed emotion her lips turning up slightly at the corners there is still so much neither of you understand about the craft or the true history of this land she answered softly his eyes gleaming with curiosity faegan leaned forward in his chair tell us more he implored i beg you no she answered educating you is not my mission it is now time for you to be tested what is it we must do wigg asked nothing she answered i shall do it all each of you please expose one of your wrists wigg and faegan did as she asked almost immediately the familiar azure glow of the craft coalesced around their bare wrists in each a small incision appeared painlessly allowing a single drop of blood to escape as the incisions closed and the azure glow disappeared the two blood droplets hovering in the air immediately began twisting into their respective blood signatures the eyes in the black face then narrowed slightly and the glow of the craft appeared again this time surrounding the two blood signatures the signatures began to enlarge until each of them was about two meters across in length spellbound the wizards stared in awe until the huge blood signatures faded and then disappeared clearly you are both of the vigors the stone woman said so now it is time for you to decide do you still wish to enter this chamber of penitence faegan turned to the lead wizard wigg took a deep apprehensive breath then nodded faegan looked back into the lovely azure eyes we do he said very well she answered behold her mouth opened wider exposing perfect white teeth farther and farther her lips parted until the opening was about two meters high only fathomless darkness could be seen beyond its depths occasionally interrupted by haunting eerie flashes of azure light like lightning across a night sky then her eyes closed and she remained still faegan again looked at wigg who responded with a raised eyebrow without speaking further the two wizards glided forward entering the chamber of penitence from where they stood on the sea cliffs above ox and the other minions of day and night watched in horror as the wizards disappeared into darkness and the lovely stone mouth closed behind them chapter twentyseven i m afraid marcus rebecca said quietly ive never done anything like this before are you sure this is going to work she shivered in the cold of the early morning as she held tightly onto her brothers strong comforting hand her stomach growled again she hadnt had enough to eat this morning and this place marcus had led her to scared her hoping her brother knew what he was doing she limped alongside him through the human carnival known as bargainers square with the demise of the royal guard bargainers square had become a hotbed of vice and crime it seemed to marcus as if all of the wicked of eutracia had for some reason suddenly descended on this single spot it had been bargainers square where he had accidentally found himself the night he had narrowly evaded the old harlot and her partner running for his life down the dark lamplit street but from that wayward experience had also come an unexpected blessing the rug shop where he had finally stopped running to catch his breath he had taken little notice of it at the time but now two days later he had suddenly realized how the little shop might be of great help with his problem regarding the scroll and so he had visited the shop once it was open and had formulated his plan yesterday he had brazenly stolen the contents of the canvas bag now slung over his shoulder today he would act looking into beccas trusting brown eyes he gave her an encouraging smile i know its scary here he said as he led her through the bizarre maze of people noises and vice and im sorry but you must trust me i havent steered us wrong yet have i now stay close to me keep your head down and try not to talk we dont need any undue attention nodding and biting her lip rebecca tried to smile bargainers square was actually a huge circular plaza paved with cobblestones a great many streets opened onto the gathering place from various directions shouting cursing and the smells of bad food and cheap liquor wafted on the breeze street vendors each of them trying to holler louder than the next filled the area virtually all of the men and many of the women were armed in some fashion seeing two children walking alone in this part of town was highly unusual and many furtive lecherous glances came their way whores pimps and male prostitutes stood on the corners their leering smiles tacitly promising sex for money cockfights and dogfights could easily be found in the alleyways with men and women crowded around them eagerly throwing their money away marcus gripped rebeccas hand tighter and they continued on when they reached the rug shop he guided rebecca to the other side of the busy street and into the opening of a relatively quiet alleyway peering out he verified that the store was indeed open for business from what he could see through the parted double doors the shop already had a smattering of patrons inside which he considered a good thing when the time came he would need all the distractions he could get kneeling down before her he pointed to the store thats it he whispered ill go inside first while you wait here after a few moments if you dont see me come back out walk in and begin doing as i instructed you keep one eye on me when you see that i have gone make your way out and meet me where i told you to all right trying to be brave rebecca nodded giving her a final encouraging smile marcus started across the street he approached the shop casually and entered as nonchalantly as he could inside the proprietor was going from one patron to another eagerly explaining to them why he or she simply could not live another moment without one of his beautiful most certainly inexpensive rugs he was a stout man whom marcus was sure wouldnt be able to run very wellyet another plus for choosing this place marcus ambled over to a pile of rugs in one corner his eyes going to the back of the shop there was a short counter that ran partway across the back leaving a space for access to the rear door a brief smile crossed his lips everything was in perfect order the rear door of the shop was wide open to allow a cooling morning draft for the heavy already sweating proprietor just as it had been the last time marcus had visited here the owner it seemed was nothing if not a creature of habit feeling the weight of the bag across his shoulder marcus thought of its contents and smiled again then turning his head toward the door he saw becca enter the shop she looked scared to death as her brown eyes finally found him he winked at her letting her know that he was about to proceed biting her lip again she nodded back and walked near the proprietor just as her brother had told her to do marcus then walked to one side a bit to a little oasis of bare floor slowly carefully he took the canvas bag from his shoulder making sure his back was to the others he untied the top of the bag and turned it over as the contents came falling out to the floor he tossed the bag aside and quickly looked over at becca then he winked again telling her to start it has often been said that the highpitched earsplitting scream coming from a young girl is unequaled and rebeccas proved no exception taking great lungfuls of air she screamed for all she was worth sending shock waves through the little shop the outcry was so piercing that at first marcus thought the glass panes in the double doors might burst snakes rebecca shrieked pointing frantically across the room and jumping up onto one of the piles of rugs she pointed again big snakes then her eyes wide with false terror she put her hands up to the sides of her head jumped frantically up and down atop the pile of rugs and let go another insane scream pandemonium immediately engulfed the shop a woman screamed and clambered onto the pile of rugs with rebecca then another joined them just as marcus had hoped the snakes quickly separated and began slithering across the floor trying to find refuge among the piles of rugs or make for the freedom of the open doors the startled patrons scattered women screamed men simply stood there frozen in horror the snakes marcus had freed from the canvas bag were especially large hungry and highly agitated long thick and brightly patterned these snakes were known as slickribbons and they were very quick marcus had boldly stolen an entire wire cage full of them from the front shelf of one of the exotic animal vendors in the square and then had run for his life narrowly avoiding being caught black shiny and menacinglooking slickribbons had triangular yellow markings on their backs making them highly prized for their skins they were not venomous or harmful to humans in any way but right now the terrified people in the shop didnt care about that all they wanted to dothe proprietor includedwas get out as the customers swarmed toward the front door marcus calmly picked up the rug he wanted it was rolled up and secured by twine but he guessed by its thickness and the length of the roll that its size would do for what he had planned hoisting it over one shoulder he sauntered through the open back door and went out into the alley walk he reminded himself walk as if you own this rug whatever you do dont run suddenly enjoying herself immensely rebecca let out another earsplitting scream just for fun jumped down off the pile of rugs and joined the rush for the open doors chapter twentyeight s eated at the ancient ornate desk in the scriptorium of the citadel krassus took a moment from his labors to enjoy the feeling of success four uneventful days of sailing had passed since he had cleverly avoided the unidentified frigates bearing down on him on the sea of whispers only an hour earlier he had descended the gangway of the sojourner and been told by janus that his consuls believed they had finally identified the bastard son of the late queen morganna overjoyed krassus had immediately come to the scriptorium to examine the supposed authenticity of the blood signature for himself before going to view the prize from which it had come he carefully drew the tripod toward him yet again then adjusted the parchment squarely under the crosshairs of the lens this was the fourth time he had done so as if with each new attempt the results would somehow change but of course they hadnt having already compared the upper and lower shapes of the signature to those of queen morganna and eric her onetime lover he looked down through the lens no less stunned at what he saw this time than the times before nicholas had told him that wulfgars signature would be a thing of wonder but nothing had prepared krassus for the likes of what now lay before him never before had he seen such a leftleaning signature only two others were known to deviate so widely from the vertical axis those belonged to the chosen ones themselves and they both leaned to the right taking his eye from the lens he looked at the assay mark written on the corner of the parchment the blood quality was equal to that of princess shailiha and second only to that of tristan himself krassus smiled janus and his consuls had been right the slave this signature came from was indeed wulfgar the bastard son of morganna krassus now possessed not only the half sibling of the chosen ones but also the scroll of the vagaries much of his work could finally go forward if and when he got hold of the scroll of the vigors he would be unstoppable he looked around this part of the scriptorium built of the palest tan marble the room was light and airy and its floor was partially covered with highly patterned rugs the stainedglass windowsnow open to let in the sun and the salt airwere numerous bookcase after bookcase lined the walls the texts and scrolls on their shelves were dusty from long neglect but they would not remain that way much longer the scroll of the vagaries lay nearby on another desk the engraved gold band around its middle still tightly imprisoning the knowledge contained within smiling krassus rose and walked out to the spacious balcony that overlooked the ocean standing there feeling the wind on his face he thought of how honored he had been when nicholas had told him of this place and what his mission would be it had been eons since the citadel had been inhabited and used for purposes of the craft his endowed blood sang with the excitement that was soon to follow and his pride at having been chosen as the new master of this fortress isle knew no bounds for a moment his mind turned back to the circumstances that had made it so he had been captured one day by nicholas great birds of prey and then taken to the caves of the paragon along with other consuls of the redoubt but as sole first alternate to the late directorate of wizards krassus had been kept isolated from nicholas other servants and his blood imbued with the forestallments required to turn him to the vagaries krassus instructions had come to him the very day the chosen one and nicholas had first met deep in the bowels of the caves not only had nicholas asked tristan to join his cause but he had also promised him a lifetime of ecstasy practicing the vagaries but in his ridiculous loyalty to the insipid vigors and the inferior wizards he commanded the prince had not only refused nicholas gracious offer but had threatened to kill him as well and krassus had been there the entire time hiding in a small alcove to one side of the room listening to every word after the traitorous prince left nicholas had bid his new servant to join him for krassus it had been like standing before a god you heard nicholas asked simply incensed by the words of the foolish traitorous prince krassus had nodded angrily nicholas placed a hand on one of krassus shoulders so now you understand how it is i am treated he whispered my own blood means not only to stop what i have planned at the gates of dawn but to see me dead in the bargain it was then that nicholas had first told him of the scrolls of the ancients and krassus had begun to understand that the construction and employment of the gates were but one facet of his masters plans then nicholas had dismissed him and had never spoken to him again and so after hearing of his masters failure at the gates of dawn krassus had zealously begun his work he had sought out the glowing base of one of the gates just as nicholas had ordered finally finding it he had been infuriated to see the secret door in its side already open and only one of the fabled scrolls present luckily the one remaining was the scroll he needed the most then he had used his new powers to create the demonslavers steal a fleet of ships and begin capturing slaves in his search for wulfgar at the thought of all those talis and rtalis slaves his mouth turned upward at the corners when all was said and done those hiding in the redoubt of the directorate would pay and pay dearly taking himself away from his memories he looked quietly out over the sea it was midday the sun having just reached the zenith of its golden luminescent arc sighing he took a great breath of salt air but then as his lungs convulsed he realized it had been too much for him coughing up blood he reached for the cloth in his robes and covered his mouth several small drops escaped however and fell to the marble floor to twist their way into his familiar blood signature cursing under his breath he wiped them away with the sole of his boot looking back out to sea the reccurring frightful realization once again gripped his heart he was dying he knew he must complete his work before he succumbed his lungs eventually drowning in their own blood and to be absolutely certain of success he had to have the other scroll suddenly there came a knock on the door krassus wiped his face and stuffed the bloody cloth back in his robes before answering it the wide double doors at the opposite end of the scriptorium opened and grizelda and janus walked in accompanied by two demonslavers janus seemed to be especially pleased for some reason as they approached the desk krassus came in from the balcony and sat back down at the same time motioning his guests to chairs on the opposite side the armed slavers retreated to take up guard in the hallway closing the doors behind them i have more good news my lord janus said excitedly the frigate loaded with the herbs and oils taken from the raid on shadowood has just arrivedwell ahead of schedule the goods are being unloaded as we speak then his painted smile melted into a partial frown i am told that some of the slavers in the raiding party never returned he added glumly those remaining aboard their frigate waited as long as they dared then finally set sail it is possible that the missing slavers were intercepted perhaps even killed by the chosen ones wizards scowling krassus considered janus news carefully true it was possible that wigg and faegan had interrupted the raid but if they had it appeared they had been too late to keep his slavers from taking what his herbmistress required the loss of a few more of his servants made no difference one way or the other he looked back at janus and our very special guest he asked how does he fare janus smiled again the edges of his red painted mask crinkling up as he did so very well he answered he remains quite rebellious however just as we expected from one of his unique bloodline he looked eagerly at the tripod and parchment on krassus desk you have had time to examine the document my lord he asked is he really wulfgar one and the same krassus replied and the woman named serenathe two of them have become close indeed janus assured him as planned she is reviled by the other slaves for the superior treatment she receives during mealtimes and wulfgar has asked that she be allowed to stay with him at all other times i have allowed it of course satisfied krassus turned to grizelda now that you have the herbs and oils you require i will expect you to successfully view the scroll of the vigors and give me some reference point in eutracia from which to begin the search then i shall send you janus and a group of my best slavers to recover it no matter where it might be is that understood bending forward slightly in her chair grizelda smiled greedily it shall be an honor my lord very well krassus replied standing up he made it clear that the meeting was over i go to converse with wulfgar his smile deepened the creases in his hollow cheeks he and serena are about to begin understanding the nature of their fates their reactions should prove to be most interesting the three of them walked to the double doors and went out into the hallway janus left to escort grizelda to what would soon become her new workplace while krassus went down the opposite length of the hall on and on nicholas servant of the vagaries went as he wound his way up through the labyrinthine halls and spiral staircases of the citadel tiring he resorted to the craft to carry him up the remaining flights then he continued on to the marble doors that marked the entrance to wulfgars quarters at a single nod from their master the guards slid back the iron bolt then before he could enter one of the slavers spoke forgive me my lord but the man inside is very strong shouldnt at least one of us accompany you inside krassus simply smiled i am a wizard of the craft he said patiently as if he were addressing a confused schoolboy what can he do to me that i would not allow with that krassus opened the double doors and walked into the room behind him he heard the doors close and bolt surprised by the sudden entry of a stranger wulfgar and serena looked up from the balcony chapter twentynine t he wind in his hair and the sea air in his lungs tristan leaned against the pitching gunwale of the peoples revenge as the great frigate plowed her way west through the sea of whispers his dreggan and his throwing knives had been returned to him and it felt good to have them lying across his back again the ship seemed amazingly alive the seamen and the many grateful slaves she was bringing home swarming over her decks tyrannys crew did all they knew how for the newly freed captives but her men were not professional healers and their gifts in such matters were limited now after having had the opportunity to look them over more closely tristan sadly concluded that many of these poor souls would not survive even the relatively short voyage to eutracia no matter how well the crew cared for them so far tyranny seemed to be keeping to their bargain of heading straight for the cavalon delta but the winds had proven fickle and the frigates had been forced to tack in order to stay on course something that tristan soon learned would make the voyage longer four uneventful days had passed since he had made his bargain with the highly interesting sea captain and sometimes his great desire to be home convinced him that he could almost smell the rich fertile soil of the eutracian coast soon he would set foot on dry land and see his loved ones again one corner of his mouth turned up as he thought of parading the brash tyranny and the huge colossus named scars unannounced through the royal palace and finally introducing them to everyone then he would live up to his part of it demanding that the wizards not only pay her a ransom of one hundred thousand gold kisa but that they award her with the letters of marque she so valued in his minds eye he could already see the vein in the lead wizards right temple throbbing and faegans evercurious graygreen eyes flashing with mischief tristan had encountered tyranny often during the last four days as she inspected the decks and spoke with both her crew and the slaves she had rescued sometimes it seemed to him that she had spent time with every slave aboard and he thought he knew why she was trying to glean from them any information she could about her lost brother twice she had graciously invited him to take his evening meal with her in her quarters where they had talked at length about their respective backgrounds tristan had used the opportunity to tell her about his past and bring her up to date with all that had happened in eutracia since the return of the coven he soon found that he not only respected this rather admirable outlaw but genuinely liked her as well perhaps he had promised her too much he suddenly realized he gave a quick derisive laugh too much or not he was sure that taking her and scars before the crusty indomitable wizards would be worth it but despite how badly he wanted to get home he had swiftly come to love the sea complete with all of its whims and dangers after scars had finally come to the conclusion that tristan was indeed not one of the enemy he and the prince had arrived at an uneasy truce the surprisingly eloquent giant had taken him under his wing instructing him in the ways of the great boat tristan had certainly not become a seasoned crewmember but he was fascinated by what scars was teaching him and each day he found himself eager to learn more he now understood the differences between the various sails spars and booms and how the rigging and sheets worked to help steady them and raise and lower the sails he had learned the various types of maneuvers the ship was capable of such as running before the wind tacking and being in irons tristan had even gingerly climbed the rigging all the way to the crows nest to gaze out over the ocean and feel the splendid exaggerated motion of the ship as she pitched and rolled beneath him dozens of meters below seeing his battle flag flying high atop the mainmast had done his heart good to his great surprise scars had suggested that tristan take the ships wheel for a timeunder the giants watchful eye of course if what tyranny had told him was true it was the same wheel that had once steered the resolve the vessel wigg had used more than three centuries earlier to banish the coven of sorceresses from eutracia as tristan had placed his hands on the worn curved grips that graced the wheels outer ring he almost thought he could feel the gnarled ghostly hands of those who had gone before turning it with him sensing the great ship obey him had been an experience he would never forget he had found a small plaque mounted below the wheel on it was inscribed the name of every single person who had commanded the various vessels the wheel had served over the course of the centuries toward the top he had seen wiggs name and the last name was tyrannys smiling tristan shook his head and wondered how many other names would be added to the plaque before the wheel was finally lost to the sea or otherwise destroyed he found himself hoping that would never happen turning to look toward the bow he felt the sharp pulling sting of the whip marks across his back they were healing but they still hurt he knew that when he returned to the palace the wizards would gladly enact an incantation of accelerated healing over them and they would soon mend but in truth he had to admit that it was neither the vicious beating by the demonslaver nor the healed scars that would forever remain on his back that now plagued him so there had recently come to him a new unexpected form of mental rather than physical anguish it was something that had been building inexorably in his soul ever since that fateful day in parthalon when his blood had suddenly turned from red to azure it was a foreign insidious feeling and one that had finally come to fruition for him not only at the savage whipping but when tyranny had pulled him out of the ragged line of slaves to speak to him as the contradictory rather frightening thought went through his mind he closed his dark blue eyes for a moment the unthinkable had happened he was coming to curse his glowing azure blood he was not distressed by the fact that his blood was endowed that much of it was his natural heritage his birthright but that his blood now glowed that it had turned the same color that always accompanied any significant use of the craft was just too bizarre his azure blood kept him from learning the craft because the wizards were concerned with the unknown ramifications of such a thing should they try to instruct him that angered and frustrated him for his desire to learn burned within him as hotly as ever even the tome the great book of magic stated that the male of the chosen ones must be trained so that he could attempt to join the vigors and the vagaries together into a single art thereby putting an end to the eonsold conflict between the two sides of the craft but as things stood now even wigg and faegan were at a loss over what to do and with all of the problems that had been thrust upon them since the unexpected return of the coven using valuable time to begin his training had clearly been out of the question worst of all he felt guilty because he was no closer to fulfilling his destiny as the tome said he must sometimes his unique blood made him feel very isolated every time he was wounded no matter how slight the insult to his body if his blood was drawn his enemies would be able to recognize him immediately they wouldnt even need to examine his blood signature to know who he was for the color of his blood would tell it all then he remembered faegans warning spoken that night in his mansion in shadowood not so long ago although it does not say how the second volume of the tome affirms that he may be forever inalterably changed you must be on the lookout for this change whatever it is to be and his own silent vow i will not rest until i have discovered who has poured such endowed blood into my veins and why i shall know why i have become the vessel that contains the blood of the fates he stared out over the sea yearning for home for the company of his sister and his friendsand especially for celeste he had fallen deeply in love with the beautiful redhaired daughter of the lead wizard and he knew it but he also knew her psyche wasnt ready to accept his affection on that level and he had no choice other than to accept it he could only wait hoping that one day they could be truly together engrossed as he was in his thoughts he didnt hear tyrannys footsteps until she came to a stop directly alongside him smiling slightly she laced her fingers together and leaned her forearms on the rail tell me about her she said simply tell you about who he asked tyranny responded with a wry knowing smile dont be coy she replied it doesnt suit you youre the straightforward type just like me besides you forget that i have been sailing these waters in the company of men for the majority of my life i know their every mood and the expressions and gestures that go along with them you miss someone special a womanim sure of it and you miss her very much but not in the same way you miss your sister the princess after some of the interesting things you have told me about yourself i must admit that im curious about the kind of woman it takes to hold your heart she looked around then conspiratorially lowered her voice so tell me crown prince of all of eutracia what is she like smiling and shaking his head tristan looked back out to sea its a long story he answered honestly three hundred years in the making in fact which also happens to be how old she is turning back he looked into tyrannys wide blue eyes and watched as the wind moved through her haphazardly cut hair it was the first time since knowing her that he had seen real surprise cross her face true to form however she recovered quickly my but you do like them mature dont you she teased then her expression softened a bit still its nice to have someone who wants to share the same rainbows end isnt it before tristan could frame an answer they heard the unmistakable peal of the warning bell high in the crows nest drawing her sword tyranny looked up to see one of her crew already climbing the rigging scars appeared by her side and only moments later the crewman who had scaled the rigging was back again screechlings he shouted at the top of his lungs three separate maelstroms of them about to rise no more than half a league off the bow confused tristan followed tyranny and scars as they ran frantically forward standing with them at the bow tristan could just make out three huge dark circles that seemed to lie atop the waves his first thought was that at last he was seeing the legendary necrophagiansthe monsters that made the sea of whispers impassable to all but those who were willing to make the necessary sacrifice but something about what he saw told him that was not the case perplexed he turned to tyranny she stood still brandishing her sword with one hand holding her spyglass to one eye with the other what is it he asked a nightmare she responded tensely not taking the lens from her eye creatures of the sea said to be of the craft no one knows for sure for they have only recently begun to appear what we do know is that they hunt in packs then she lowered her spyglass and tristan clearly saw the worry on her face i know of no vessel that has ever survived an onslaught of three maelstroms but i refuse to go down without a fight maelstroms tristan repeated what are they what can i do you will understand all too soon she answered her right eye squarely against the spyglass again try to stay near me or scars it seems that you are finally going to get your chance to show us how well you use those unusual weapons you carry across your back cant we outrun them no she said adamantly no ship ever built could outrun them at this rangenot even the peoples revenge the only course now is to stand and fight and hope we can survive them then she barked out some orders to her crew and everything began to change turning to look behind him tristan saw that the ship had become even more alive with furious activity shouting crewmen were forcing the confused slaves belowdecks while others frantically tried to close and lock all of the remaining deck hatches and stairwell doors the rigging was covered in seamen frantically reefing the sails one man was hurriedly tying off the ships wheel tristan was only a novice sailor but he knew enough to realize that with all of her sails reefed and her wheel tied off the peoples revenge would be dead in the water rocking back and forth at the mercy of the waves after having been told repeatedly that speed was often the only thing that kept them alive he was completely stymied he turned to look out over the bow again stunned by what he saw he quietly drew his dreggan from its scabbard a vast area of the ocean lying before them had come alive three whirling spouts of swirling foaming seawater had risen from the ocean dark and foreboding on and on the huge waterspouts rose spinning and rising with dizzying speed about oneeighth of a league ahead of the bow they were already nearly the height of the ships mainmast and they were climbing still then they began to glow strangely from within circling colors that spun in a continuous riot of alternating hues had he not been told the maelstroms were deadly he would have considered them one of the most beautiful things he had ever seen suddenly the glowing maelstroms flattened out at their tops gained some distance between themselves and then careened with impossible speed in a straight line toward the three unmoving ships tristan heard tyrannys voice ring out beside him come on then you bastards she screamed holding her sword high above her head you filthy scavengers come to me lets see how many of you i can kill on the first pass when they finally reached her she began swinging her sword with abandon and thin watery bright red blood began raining down when the first of them buzzed by his head tristan thought he must be seeing things as it passed he heard the unmistakable sound of teeth snapping together and realized that his hesitation had nearly cost him his life making insane screeching noises as they came another flew by him then more still until their numbers finally became so great that they blotted out the sun and covered the deck of the frigate with their shadows viciously they attacked both the crewmembers and the rigging tearing away those sails that had not already been reefed swinging his dreggan tristan missed the first one then finally managed to take one down it was a glancing not a killing blow but as the dazed thing lay bleeding at his feet he finally got a look at it up close he was amazed to see what appeared to be some kind of very large very strange fishlike creature it was almost two meters long half a meter deep and very brightly colored with what seemed to be luminescent stripes running down along its sides instead of fins it had three oddly shaped scaly wings one on either side of its colorful body and a third rising vertically from its spine just forward of its large wide tail as he watched its mouth opened revealing a multitude of razorsharp teeth seeing that brought tristan back to the reality of the battle raging around him with a single stroke of his dreggan he beheaded the monster but he had lost precious time pain seared through both his shoulders as he was swept off his feet and flown toward the starboard gunwale horrified he realized that two of the vicious powerful things had their teeth in him and were carrying him away he tried to use his sword but the pain in his arms was too great and as the gunwale grew closer he realized what was about to happen to him for he could see the same thing happening to a host of other screaming defenseless crewmen the monsters were about to fly him over the side and drown him in the sea of whispers the sea surrounding the ship was already swirling with the bodies of those who had gone over before him some were still alive flailing about trying desperately to swim back to the ship only to be dragged under by snapping jaws screaming and twisting wildly against his captors tristan almost passed out from the pain but it was no use in mere seconds he would be over the side lost forever then two massive hands reached out to take hold of the thing on tristans right side and muscle it down to the deck tristan landed hard on his back the teeth of the other creature still embedded in his shoulder but his right arm was free trying as best he could to ignore the pain he dropped his dreggan and reached back for one of his throwing dirks turning wildly to his left he plunged the point of the dirk directly into the monsters left eyeball killing it instantly with its death tristan finally found himself free of its jaws he threw it to one side and dragged himself to his feet to see scars standing near him the other beast still screaming and writhing in his awesome grip with a single grunt scars tore the screaming thing in half and threw the two pieces to the deck giving the prince a short nod he immediately went about finding more of the things to kill wasting no time tristan began using his dreggan to hack the things out of the air as best as his injured shoulders would allow many died at his hands somehow he managed to avoid being taken again after what seemed an eternity he saw that the struggle was finally abating his chest heaving he walked to the gunwale and looked over a mass of torn clothing and dead bodies bobbed on the surface of the water then he turned back to look at the ship bodieshuman and monster bothlay everywhere and the deck was awash with blood several of the ships spars were broken and dangling awkwardly from their ropes sails lay in tatters completely beyond repair looking across the sea he saw that the other two ships had fared no better the stench of blood filled the air and a terrible silence engulfed the stricken vessels as they rocked listlessly from port to starboard and back again after all of the screaming and noise everything seemed strangely quiet looking across the deck his azure blood still oozing from each of his shoulders tristan searched for tyranny he finally found her standing on the mizzen deck her face down her sword hanging from one hand as though she no longer had the will or the strength to raise it she was covered with blood and as he started toward her she slowly turned to him and looked him in the eyes just as he reached her she collapsed and he quickly hoisted her limp body into his arms holding her there he looked sadly at the bloody mangled ship and wondered what would become of them now chapter thirty s tirring from her nap celeste yawned then stretched her back and arms as she lay on the huge fourposter canopied bed the large hourglass on the nearby stand told her that a little less than two hours had gone by since she had left shailiha and abbey to make their way down into the redoubt and to the hall of blood records she rose up on her elbows and looked out through one of the four open stainedglass windows lining the exterior wall of her private quarters the soft indigo that always preceded dusk had begun to encroach on the turquoise edges of the sky and would soon overtake it altogether then the many lights from the minion campfires would begin to flicker like stars in the night beautiful and reassuring but then the usual frightening thoughts crowded in again and she lay back down on the bed staring at the red velvet canopy above her she was desperately worried as was everyone remaining here at the redoubt tristan had been gone for days and there had been no success in the search launched by the minions even oxs hopefulness seemed to deteriorate with each passing hour despite the fact that he was trying to act like a warrior and not let his concern show wigg and faegan had not returned from their journey to the place the tome called the chamber of penitence and her fear for her newfound father and the crippled wizard was great but it was tristan upon whom her heart dwelled the most she rose from the bed and padded in her slippers to the other side of the room to retrieve her pearlhandled hairbrush from the dresser then mechanically began brushing her hair her worry for tristan still filling her thoughts she wanted desperately to be near him again to see him to know that he was safe sometimes she thought she might burst with the conflicted feelings that surged through her whenever the prince was near but it was easy to simply miss him and worry about him when he was gone especially now that he was in danger as she ran the brush through her long deep red hair she heard the evening wind comfortingly rustling the trees outside her window then she heard the squeak of a window hinge the wind was stronger than shed thought and she turned to shut the windows in case a storm was rising her heart leapt into her throat and she dropped the brush three of the four windows were shut and locked and the last one was hauntingly closing by itself before she could run for the door an azure beam appeared out of nowhere snaked itself around her waist and threw her across the length of the room back onto her bed she raised an arm to counter with a bolt of her own but the glow had her pinned to the bed she was caught in a wizards warp she realized just like the one krassus had used against them all that day in the card room when he had assaulted wigg and violated the wizards minds she tried to scream but found to her horror that her voice carried no sound terrified she turned her eyes as best she could to look over at the windows the last of them had finished closing and the latch was slowly coming down locking itself into place her heart pounded relentlessly as she waited and watched unable to do anything else now another glow was building in the room growing brighter and brighter until it began to take on a shape her terrified mind convinced her that it must be krassus come back to the palace for some reason but as she looked closer she began to recognize the shape standing so dangerously close to the edge of her bed tears welled up in her eyes and cascaded maddeningly down her cheeks the thing spoke hello my darling it said in a deep melodious voice it has been far too long since we have lain together i have missed you dearly she was going to faintshe knew it but then her mind was touched by that of the being standing before her and she was fully conscious once more it was ragnar the half wizard half blood stalker who had for over three hundred years kept her his prisoner abusing her incessantly she saw the bald shiny head dangling earlobes and the long yellow incisors that that jutted down just below his smiling bottom lip his white robe was untied and slightly open down the center he was clearly aroused the mad bloodshot eyes looked up and down her body with a hunger that seemingly knew no bounds the small wound in the side of his head was still there and as a drop of yellow ooze dripped from it he reached up to wipe it away then he placed the wet fingertip into his mouth and smiled so many questions arent there my love he asked lowering his awful face closer to her own the smell of his fetid breath brought back horrible mindnumbing memories of her times with him did you and the wizards actually believe that nicholas my beloved master would really want me dead he added or did any of you as you reveled in the destruction of the gates of dawn actually see my corpse no i now serve krassus and together he and i carry on a part of nicholas glorious work but first i am going to take you back to the caves with me and this time you will never leave i promise you as he spoke he ran the long pointed fingernails of one hand down the side of her face you always were my favorite then a strange look came over him and he lowered himself even closer and one other thing my love he added softly krassus has very kindly imbued me with the forestallment that after three hundred years of failed attempts shall finally grant me the power to make you pregnant i cant wait to see what our children will look like he stood up again his robe falling open obscenely before we leave here together i shall take you right here in this very bed he added menacingly a fitting insult to wigg my dearest enemy dont you think to luxuriate in his only daughter yet again in the very seat of his power with both the wizards and the chosen one gone there is no one left here of any consequence to stop me and who knowsyou might even conceive here in the royal palace this very night deliciously ironic wouldnt you agree as she watched in helpless horror he reached down and parted his robe fully reaching out he caressed her face once more it shall be just as you remember it he said smoothly long and slow and again and again and this time my sweet it shall go on for eternity i may even allow enough of your powers of speech to return so that i might hear you softly whimper again the wicked smile came surely you remember how much i enjoyed hearing you weep ragnar held out a finger and pointed it at the bodice of her dress she heard a slow deliberate ripping sound and looked with horror as a rip parted her dress at the top and began to tear its way down her body wanted to shake with fear but couldnt locked as she was within the monsters unyielding warp saying nothing more his bloodshot eyes gleaming ragnar knelt by the side of her bed placed his wet pink tongue against the inside of one of her thighs and began moving it upward screaming celeste bolted from the bed and fell to the floor for a moment she remained on all fours her chest heaving and sweat running down her face then finally she dared to look about the room amazingly everything was just as it should be the windows were open and the night breeze was caressing the tree branches outside the minion campfires were lit sending their glow upward into the dark of the night sky and there was no ragnar it had been another nightmare lowering her head in shame she sobbed mightily wondering when she would ever be free of her horrific memories at last she rose to stand on shaky legs walked to the mirror and slowly lifted her head to regard the stranger staring back at her the eyes were red the long dark red hair was disheveled and the woman staring back at her was shaking uncontrollably she placed her quivering hands over her face so that she couldnt look any longer this is what he still does to you even though he is dead she heard her mind whisper suddenly though several more words floated to the surfaceunusually defiant challenging words that after three hundred years of torment finally transformed her life but i will allow it no more and then something in her psyche snapped she stamped to the door tore at the doorknob and sprinted down the hallway her newfound rage intensifying with every stride she went faster and faster trying to dispel her energy when she reached one of the secret passageways leading down into the redoubt she opened the door went through and practically ran down the circular staircase her fury was limitless soon she found herself banging on the door of the hall of blood records and screaming relentlessly demanding to be let in a startled shailiha came to the door only to have the exhausted furious celeste embrace her desperately the tears coming yet again the princess quickly dismissed abbey and lionel and the two women sat and talked until dawn chapter thirtyone t he darkness was impenetrable there was absolutely no sound for all the lead wizard knew this place could be either very small or endless uncertain what might lie beneath them he dared not release the spell that kept him hovering in the air floating weightless all of his senses deprived wigg wondered if this was what it was like to be dead he could not see his own hand before his face only the familiar squeak of faegans chair caused by the crippled wizards turning it in an attempt to look around told wigg that he was not alone as faegan raised his hand to produce some light the paragon hanging around his neck began to glow just as it had done earlier it flooded the room with its vibrant red illumination the stone chamber in which they found themselves was quite unremarkable one might even have called it disappointing it seemed to be little more than a small square room cut out of the rock with a matching stone floor and a rather low ceiling looking at each other in silent agreement they gratefully lowered themselves when they touched ground an azure beam shone from the ceiling illuminating a hole in the floor they went to it and looked down it was the opening to a circular stairwell that was barely large enough for faegans chair to pass through it wound its way down into utter darkness taking a deep breath wigg looked over at faegan after you he said dryly pursing his lips faegan looked tentatively down the hole then seemed to make up his mind levitating his chair he lowered himself into the depths the wheels narrowly scraping their way by on either side with a sigh and a concerned shake of his head wigg began following faegan down the winding staircase was very small and cramped lined by walls of solid stone that added greatly to the sense of confinement it was exactly like being trapped in a cramped stone tube like tristan the lead wizard hated being closed in the farther down he went the greater his sense of foreboding became the air grew cold and smelled increasingly damp and musty after a while wigg looked up trying to gauge how far they had come he paused taken aback the opening to the stairwell was gone replaced by another ceiling of solid rock just inches above the top of his head in fact the length of circular stairway they had just descended was gone too a solid stone wall had silently materialized only inches behind him blocking their way back between the cramped ceiling rear wall and sidewalls he could extend his hand no more than half a meter in any direction other than downward the red light from the paragon around faegans neck cast eerie sharp shadows against the unforgiving barriers and added greatly to the suffocating sense of helplessness wigg felt like a trapped rat despite the coolness of the air he broke out in a sweat his sense of dread growing by the moment looking forward he saw faegan continue down the staircase apparently quite unaware of their predicament wigg took another tentative step down the stairs glancing back over his shoulder he saw the wall just behind him silently quickly advance by the exact length of the step while the ceiling closed in by the same margin and the step he had last stood on had disappeared leaving only the one he was now occupying and those that lay below him someone or something had taken great pains to make sure the two wizards could continue their trek in only one direction downward i think you had best see this wigg said to faegan as calmly as he could the elder wizard turned in his chair and immediately understood the dilemma his face darkened with worry but for once he said nothing and simply turned back around with no other course of action possible the two wizards continued downward into the bowels of the earth after what seemed an eternity they exited at last into another simple square room of stone this one was even smaller than the first and barely large enough to accommodate the two of them there were no other doorways or holes in the floor such as there had been in the other room now so far above them suddenly a frightening thought occurred to the lead wizard and he turned around to find his suspicions confirmed the stairway they had just come down had vanished filled in by the wall that had so ominously followed them in their descent there remained no exit whatsoever and their only source of light was the paragon which seemed to glow even more brightly as they waited the silence in the room was oppressive and the air was thin wigg tried not to think about the prospect of dying in this unforgiving fortress of stone then a narrow line of azure appeared in the air before them it snaked toward the wall they faced and pressed itself against the stone in the shape of a rectangle large enough for a person to pass through the area within its borders began to glow then the glow faded and the section of wall simply dissolved where the stone wall had been stood a tall figure unmoving silent a dark cloak covered the body its hood pulled up over the head and face in one of the hands was a long gnarled wooden staff looking closer wigg noticed that the hand holding the staff was only a collection of bones wigg finally found his voice who are you he asked i am the watchwoman of the floating gardens the answer came back it was a womans voice but its timbre was ancient and her words seemed to fight and scratch their way across the distance between them but you come at a bad time for the gardens are not what they once were faegan wheeled his chair a bit closer she remained motionless and why is that he asked anxiously first tell me she said has there been a recent disturbance in the life of the stone yes faegan answered the dead son of the chosen one was returned from the heavens as a servant of the heretics of the guild he tried to take all of the power of the paragon into himself so as to allow the heretics to return here to the land of the living only at the last moment were we able to stop him and return the power to the jewel of the craft where it rightly belongs so the chosen ones have finally come for several moments she did not speak the silence in the chamber engulfing them all like a shroud tell me she went on at last are the chosen ones now the jinsai and the jinsaiou what are you talking about faegan asked so you do not know the watchwoman said softly but one day you will finally after eons of waiting the progression toward joining the two sides of the craft can begin her voice was a mere whisper perhaps the vigors may triumph after all silence reigned again for a time as the two stunned wizards tried to grasp the enormity of her words you still have not told us about the state of the gardens wigg pressed our need for your help is very great yet another threat to the vigors walks the land and has the potential to become the most potent danger we have ever faced the figure in the robe glided over to faegans chair reaching down to his chest with a skeletal hand she picked up the paragon and examined it closely even at this proximity faegan could see nothing within the dark confines of her hood finally she let go of the stone allowing it to fall back into place the gardens are not as they once were because all things of the craft take their sustenance from the power granted by the stone she answered as the stone neared its death so too did the gardens that i tend they have only just begun to rejuvenate because of this what you have traveled so far to find may no longer exist but we shall try what exactly is the nature of your request agents of the vagaries have mixed our stores of herbs and precious oils faegan explained they must be separated again reclassified and their potency revalued so that they might be employed by our herbmistress to use her gazing flame the chosen one is missing and we must find him we also seek the scroll of the vigors can you help us her answer was both frightening and immediate do you mean to say that the scrolls of the ancients have been loosed upon the world yes wigg answered can you tell us why they are so important no she told them for i have not been blessed with such knowledge but i do know that the importance of the scrolls is on a par at least equal to that of both the tome and the paragon for the vigors to survive you must recover the scrolls at once or all that we have worked for so long to preserve will perish the tome mentioned a psychic price to be paid for the knowledge that we seek faegan said cautiously what does that mean how long have each of you been alive she asked confused the two wizards looked at each other we are each more than three centuries old faegan answered honestly but why do you need to know only three centuries she mused still so young mere children in the intricate tapestry that is the craft due to your youth you may not possess the depth of experiences required to pay the price and trying to do so might well cost you your lives i dont understand wigg interjected what do our ages have to do with the psychic price that you demand to acquire what you seek the price to be paid is not money nor other physical goods of any kind the payment demanded is that one of you must leave behind a piece of your very soul to do so you must be forced to relive your greatest regret as if you were experiencing it for the very first time therefore the longer you have lived the greater the chances that you possess regrets that will satisfy the price as you make payment the psychic pain you experience in your soul shall be accompanied by an equally severe physical pain in your heartthe very seat of such regret and should your endowed blood not be strong enough to persist your heart will burst and you will die if that occurs you will never leave this place i realize your need is great therefore the price demanded shall be also how could you possibly know what each of our greatest regrets might be faegan asked we might try to trick you i do not need to know only you do but why must we pay such an awful price wigg asked why cant you simply give us what we need are our goals not the samethe preservation of the vigors that is not my place to say she answered the ones who came before built these chambers and others like them before they perished hoping they would be found by those who value only the vigors just as you obviously found both the tome and the paragon but in their wisdom they also dictated the price to be paid so that what might be given to you will not be taken lightly or squandered the nature of the price therefore demands that only those of exceptionally strong blood will prevail and be able to use that which they have been given as you will soon see many of your kind have tried over the ages and failed do those of the vagaries know of these chambers faegan asked practically bursting with curiosity that does not matter just now why not because possession of the paragon is required to enter and you are its current wearer she answered simply the others of your race who have come here seeking answers over the eons were like you in possession of the stone it is hoped that finally after all this time the chosen ones will accomplish what so many others have failed to do and at the same time will learn all that there is to know of what has gone before and with that shall dawn a new age his eyes alive with questions faegan looked into the dark recesses of her hood are you one of the ones who came before he breathed i am and i am not she said cryptically i have been here in this place for eons doing their bidding as you can see my flesh has fallen away but my mind remains but i will tell you that eons ago i was a woman of the craft tell me do women still practice the arts in the world above for a long time it was forbidden but now there are again such women wigg answered they are known as the acolytes of fledgling house but they are only newly trained and remain scattered across the land we would like to call them all home but we do not know how the watchwoman remained still for a time as she considered his words if the threat to the vigors is as great as you say you will need these women in your service she said i suggest you call them back immediately but as i said wigg protested we dont know how if you are able to find the scroll of the vigors examine it carefully looking for the formula that invokes the river of thought she told him the river of thought faegan repeated what do you mean no more talk she said flatly your questions are legion and i have accommodated you long enough it is time for you to make your decision do you wish to pay the psychic price for what you seek understand that if you agree and pass this portal into my world you are bound by your blood to keep your end of the bargain there can be no turning back faegan looked up to wigg with questioning eyes after a long pause the lead wizard nodded we agree faegan said then follow me the watchwoman ordered turning she walked into the darkness wigg and faegan followed tentatively behind wondering what lay waiting for them on the other side chapter thirtytwo c an i have one marcus rebecca asked she was fairly jumping up and down excited almost beyond words please marcus she pleaded pulling on the sleeve of his shirt please can i marcus looked up and down the street to which he had carefully guided them like bargainers square it was teeming with passersby and street vendors but this section of tammerland was infinitely more appealing not to mention safer the area they were standing in was known as the plaza of fallen heroes and here and there could be seen marble statues erected to those who had fallen over the centuries in the service of the crown by marcus side stood the wheelbarrow that had lain up against the shed he and his sister lived in and lying in the wheelbarrow was the scroll marcus was strong for his age even so he found the scroll with all of its gold adornments difficult to lift finding the discarded wheelbarrow had been a great stroke of luck the patterned rug they had stolen was wound tightly around it hiding it from view the open ends of the rug were stuffed with rags marcus hoped that these simple measures would be enough to hide the scrollat least until he had concluded his business with the man they were supposed to meet he prayed to the afterlife that it would not start glowing again he and rebecca had already survived several close scrapes and they didnt need another one the man he was waiting for was supposedly a purveyor of artifacts of the craft after marcus had described the scroll to him the fellow had seemed most anxious to examine italmost giddy in fact until yesterday marcus had not known that such vendors existed and had come upon the fellows establishment quite by accident during his latest foray to steal food subsequently asking around a bit he learned that since the demise of the wizards of the directorate such places had not only begun to spring up in tammerland but were also flourishing some of these purported merchants of the craft were legitimate it seemed and some were not selling anything they could get their hands on they all claimed their wares to be of the craft but what did appear certain was that with the fall of the royal guard and the directorate there was no shortage of those now willing to take advantage of a newly curious souvenirhungry populace many citizens had become morbidly anxious to own something that smacked of magic or its supposed connection to the fallen house of galland it was said that anything that had come from the looted royal palaceand had its authenticity verifiedwould bring nearly its weight in gold marcus looked down again at the rolledup rug in the dilapidated wheelbarrow thinking of what lay inside it he had no idea whether it had come from the palace but he was certain it was of the craft nothing else would glow like thathe was sure of it and he was anxious to turn it into kisa so he and rebecca could stop hiding and get on with their lives but that was not to say he was willing to sell the scroll to the first interested party who came along marcus had made it clear to the man meeting them today that he was merely to give them a price and that he and his sister were going to entertain other offers before bargaining their item away if an offer was good today it would also be good later he assumed still he remained nervous and his palms were beginning to sweat reaching into his pocket his hand found the cool comforting handle of his knife come on marcus rebecca started pleading again it only costs one kisa and i know you have a few in your pocket i heard them jangling together as you walked marcus smiled down at his sister as he took in her dirty tattered dress and the clubfoot that she never complained about he felt his heart slip a bit in truth he would have much preferred to carefully spend all the kisa on food it had been a long time since he had felt the comforting weight of coins in his pockets even if they were few in number and acquiring them had come hard he had been forced to lounge around almost all afternoon yesterday on a nearby street corner before finding the perfect victim to accidentally bump into and relieve of his coins and after all of that he had only come up with four are you sure thats what you want he asked i know its only one kisa but when you buy one of those it doesnt seem that you get much for your money i worked hard for these coins you know rebecca just gazed up at him with her big brown eyes giving him the forlorn look that she knew he could rarely resist as she expected marcus finally relented all right all right he said smiling and reaching into his ragged pocket but only one piglet do you understand nodding gleefully she snatched the shiny gold coin and ran over to the stand followed by marcus and the wheelbarrow the vendors stall was a simple squareroofed affair an ancientlooking woman sat inside on a stool taking care of her customers a young male assistant sat beside her tending to the wares dozens of small wooden cages hung from the roof and lay scattered along the countertop as rebecca looked them over marcus smiled reminded of what a nonsensical custom this was not to mention a very bad investment still they werent the only people standing here willing to spend their kisa on what the crafty woman offered each of the cages contained a throat lark the birds were remarkably small three of them could usually fit into the palm of a grown mans hand they had presumably acquired their name because of the bright colors adorning their throats the remainder of the bird was usually a very soft dappled blue although that sometimes varied well known for their singing voices they were prized as house pets as the larks danced happily about in their cages their twittering combined to create a singularly beautiful harmony attracting yet more of the curious to the old womans stall marcus smiled and shook his head as rebecca picked out a lark of soft powder blue with a deep green throat satisfied she handed the single precious coin up to the woman on the stool then she took the bird cage and all over to where her brother was standing the highly unusual implied agreement with the vendor was that once the purchase had been made the cage door was to be opened immediately and the bird set free then the cage was to be returned to the stall everyone knew of course that the birds were trained to fly immediately back to the old woman only to be caged again by her assistant to await yet another customer but none of that mattered to the buyers eutracian custom said that paying to set a caged creature free even if for only a moment would gladden the heart and bring good luck the practice had sprung up after the recent hostilities accompanying the return of the coven mourners had begun freeing birds already in their possession to honor the departed souls of their loved ones wishing them a safe journey to the afterlife smiling from ear to ear rebecca gingerly opened the cage door releasing the throat lark to the sky with a short clear call the bird left the cage and went winging straight back to the stall to land on the countertop rebecca turned back to her brother her eyes were wet no one had to tell marcus whom she had been thinking of when she had opened the cage door do you feel better he asked softly all she could do was nod then remembering her responsibility to the vendor she hobbled back to the stall with the empty cage watching her go marcus couldnt help but think how much he loved herand that he would do anything to make sure that unlike the birds in the cages she stayed free it was just then that his thoughts were interrupted by a deep male voice good afternoon right on time i see i like that in a businessman shows proper intent i always say turning marcus took in the mans tall plump frame silver hair and expensive clothes his name was gregory of the house of worth which fit him perfectly gold jewelry flashed at his fingers and wrists and a thick white mustache lay elegantly just above the decisive mouth his predatory eyes were dark and seemed never to miss a thing the moment marcus had first met him he had taken the fellow for a shrewd bargainer after making a few polite inquiries he had learned that worth seemed to have an honest reputation still marcus remained nervous as he tried his best to steel himself against whatever first offer worth might make even at the tender age of twelve seasons of new life he knew that someones first proposal was never the best and he had no intention of being taken advantage of he also had a plan with a distasteful grimace worth looked down at the rug lying in the wheelbarrow perhaps i was mistaken he said slyly i didnt come here to buy a rug thats good marcus answered calmly because i didnt come here to sell one worth smiled by now rebecca had joined them and marcus bade her nearer are you alone marcus asked him he realized that it was a foolish question for worth could have any number of confederates waiting here in the plaza to rob him and marcus wouldnt recognize any of them but he hoped the question would set a certain tone rather than glean reliable information of course worth answered stabbing his thumbs into the shiny expensive vest that stretched its way around his prodigious middle that was our agreement was it not looking down at the rug again he smiled then twisted one of the ends of his mustache its in there isnt it checking to see that no one stood too near to them marcus beckoned worth and rebecca closer until they all stood crowded around one end of the rug from this position even if someone walked directly behind them there would be little to see slowly carefully marcus removed the rags from the end of the rug grasped the golden rod at the base of the scroll then pulled it free a short distance it was just enough to give worth a taste of the glories promised within worth gasped he had never seen such a treasure of the craft to his mind it was easily worth tenfold the entire contents of his shop the glistening golden rod and its end knobs alone were worth a kings ransom to say nothing of the historical value of the elegant old eutracian script knowing he had succeeded in whetting worths appetite marcus quickly slid the scroll back into the relative safety of the rug how much he asked coming straight to the point sweating worth ran a pudgy index finger around the inside of his shirt collar sixsix thousand kisa he stammered marcus thought he might faint six thousand kisa was a huge summore than he might earn in an entire lifetime of honest labor still he tried to retain his composure twelve he said sternly rebeccas eyes went wide she was quite sure her brother had just lost his mind you just doubled your price worth exploded thats not how we negotiate where i come from then we obviously dont come from the same place marcus countered boldly besides i didnt double my price i never set one i simply doubled your offer saves time looking around again he moved one corner of the rug back a bit to reveal another hint of the golden end knob letting it shine in the sun youre wasting my time and youre not the only artifacts vendor in tammerland he looked hard up into the mans eyes the price just went to fourteen ten worth found himself saying sixteen thirteen worth answered hardly believing his own bid is that your final offer marcus asked him he began to sense resignation in the other mans eyes i fear it must be worth answered it is all i have then i shall consider it marcus answered but as i told you before i mean to speak to other interested parties after replacing the rags in the open end of the rug he picked up the handles of the wheelbarrow worth took an anxious step forward but how will i know if its mine he asked urgently his forehead was bathed in sweat i know where you work remember marcus answered you will hear from me but in the meantime i am leaving if you ever wish to see the scroll again you will now leave the plaza by walking away in the opposite direction worth nodded but if someone outbids me you will allow me the chance to make a better offer will you not he asked desperately marcus only smiled why would i bother he asked bluntly thirteen thousand kisa is all you supposedly have remember marcus watched as the beaten vendor walked away as they had planned he and rebecca headed the opposite way from their shack ducked into an alley and waited there for a long while when they were sure they werent being followed marcus began pushing the wheelbarrow toward home his mind roiling with the unimaginable prospect of having thirteen thousand kisa but he also knew he was playing a dangerous game and that his luck couldnt last forever it was just then that the scroll began to glow from out of the folds of the rags at each end again came the unmistakable azure hue of the craft worried he picked up the pace as fast as he could with becca limping beside him as one of the rags in the front came loose he stole a glance up at the sky to see that darkness was already falling as the glow bled out into the coming night it would be a miracle if someone didnt notice g rizelda krassus and janus stood together on the rooftop of the citadel watching the blue streaks of the gazing flame dance in the darkness of the night grizelda tossed a few more of the herbs stolen from shadowood into the fire and the viewing window in the center started to take form now that she had all of the goods she could possibly need the only limits on her search for the scroll would be her personal endurance and krassus had insisted on her trying every two hours this most recent viewing was her eighth such attempt in a row and she was tired nonetheless she did her best to persevere as the viewing window came into sharper focus it changed shape turning into a ragged circle from within the circle could be seen not only one of the gold end knobs of the scroll but also what lay past it it was apparent that the scroll was at least partially hidden and someone was taking it through a city but which one and then finally krassus saw a group of unmistakable statues this was without doubt the plaza of fallen heroes the scroll was in tammerland he had done it his joy at locating the scroll was quickly replaced by a sense of dread better that the scroll were in any city other than the one still inhabited by the wizards of the redoubt he knew that wigg faegan and abbey would also be desperately trying to find it presumably through the same methods he was employing true he had set their labors back by destroying those herbs and oils that he had not stolen from shadowood but the wizards were exceedingly clever which meant that there was no time to lose he turned to janus and grizelda the two of you are to leave for tammerland on the first ship that can be readied he ordered take the supplies youll need to continue attempting to view the scroll as often as necessary i dont care how you do itjust get the scroll back to the citadel anchor well off the cavalon delta and take a small quiet skiff up the sippora your crew must stay belowdecks out of sight while you are gone demonslavers have never been seen in tammerland and i wish to do this quietly not start a riot you will not be accompanying us my lord janus asked i cannot krassus answered briskly wulfgar needs my full attention as do other matters of importance here the return of the scroll i leave up to you do not fail me in this he turned on the herbmistress grizelda do not think for one moment that you will be able to escape me simply because you are out of my sight for a time i found you once and i can do it again if you make me hunt you down it wont be to employ your talents it will be to kill you slowly do you understand looking back to janus he had another thought when you discover whoever has the scroll kill him he added casually leave no loose ends the herbmistress bowed her head in submission while janus nodded once the gazing flame was extinguished and janus and grizelda were gone krassus walked slowly to the edge of the roof and looked out on the sea of whispers the three rosecolored moons were full painting the sea with their palette there was virtually no wind and the ocean looked like a sheet of magentacolored glass placing his hands into the opposite sleeves of his twocolored robe he turned and descended the stairs chapter thirtythree t ristan sat looking with worry at tyranny as she lay on the sofa in her quarters the everpresent scars stood by her side with an equally concerned expression on his face she had fought bravely and survived but she had been wounded and had passed out from loss of blood tristan and scars had tended to her as best they could before cleaning and bandaging tristans shoulders then they had waited it had taken some time for her to come around like any good captain her first concern had been for how many of her crew she had lost then she inquired about the general condition of the peoples revenge and the other two ships sailing with them their little fleet was in bad shape scars reported nearly a quarter of the peoples revenge crew had been lost a large number had been wounded but were still alive many of the sails had been ripped beyond repair along with much of the rigging and more than half of the ships spars were completely destroyed the other two vessels had fared no better each of them was also dead in the water drifting at the mercy of the elements even tristan was by now sailor enough to know that if they were struck by a sea storm or a fleet of demonslaver ships while in this condition they would be finished scars had ordered repairs to begin but it would be a difficult incomplete job at best they needed help but out here this far into the sea of whispers tristan knew there could be none tyranny sat up groggily and took a sip of the wine tristan held out to her then she stabbed one of her rolled tubes of leaves between her lips and lit it from the flame offered up by scars taking a deep draught of bluish smoke she slowly blew it upward toward the roof of the cabin what in the name of the afterlife were those things that attacked us tristan asked unable to contain his curiosity any longer i have never seen anything like them tyranny took another sip of wine then gingerly adjusted her position on the sofa we call the creatures screechlings she told him she took in another lungful of smoke and blew it out this was only the second time we have fought them scars named them for the horrible noise they make just before they attack they began to prowl these waters only recently about the same time the demonslavers started taking their captives from farpoint i think the screechlings must have originated at the citadel but no one knows for sure did you see how they glowed just before they began attacking us that tells me they come from magic but who of the craft would be so cruel as to create such monsters and loose them on the sea krassus tristan thought it had to be he would have wanted something that would protect his slave ships and attack any enemies no doubt the ability had been provided by yet another forestallment placed in his blood by nicholas tristan lowered his head and closed his eyes are you all right tyranny asked softly he raised his head and looked into her eyes no he answered but i will be he took a deep breath and forced his thoughts back to the problem at hand i saw many of the screechlings purposely destroying the sails as well as the spars and the yardarms he said why would they do that when they could have been attacking the crew it seems they are both highly intelligent and well organized scars answered for his captain as she took another sip of wine they know that if we are sufficiently crippled they can return at their leisure and finish us off and unless we can get these three vessels moving again that is exactly what will happen tyranny looked up at her first mate how much undamaged sail did we liberate from the slavers she asked hopefully not nearly enough to do a proper job scars answered especially considering the fact that we have three vessels to repair i have taken the liberty of ordering all three ships lashed together so that we might share resources and not drift apart on the nighttime sea dawn will rise soon and we can work faster then but even when we are finished the best we will be able to do is to limp along if the screechlings find us again we shall be easy prey he remained silent for a moment as he considered his next words our best bet is to make for the isle of sanctuary and hope that we reach it before they return he suggested i know this isnt what you want to hear but we are already wounded captain unless we reach the isle in time the deathblow may not be far off tyranny scowled then she looked up at her gigantic first mate please leave us now she said i have issues to discuss with our new friend here in the meantime make all the repairs you can with what we have available and then set course for the isle of sanctuary even limping along as you put it is better than sitting dead in the water as live bait for the screechlings after nodding to his captain and casting a questioning glance at the prince scars left the cabin closing the door behind him a combination of anger and confusion crossed tristans face what is this isle of sanctuary you are taking us to eh he protested i for one have never heard of it you can still trust me i swear it tyranny assured him our bargain remains intact the reason you have never heard of the isle of sanctuary is because it is a secret known only to a very few enlighten me he said shortly tyranny took another sip of wine please go to my desk and bring me back my charts tristan skeptically did as she asked placing the parchments on her lap rifling through them she finally selected one and spread it out we are here she said pointing to a section of the chart displaying open sea or at least thats where we were when we were attacked dead on course for the delta just as i had agreed our current position has no doubt changed a bit since we have been adrift but not by much since the winds have remained light anyway the isle of sanctuary is not far off our direct course to the delta look running one finger west toward the cavalon delta she stopped it near a small island shaped like a long crooked finger according to the scale it was about four leagues long by two wide several natural harbors indented its coast it was drawn in a darker ink as if it had recently been added to her map i give you the littleknown isle of sanctuary she said scars added it from memory but how is that possible tristan asked and why must we go there sitting back she looked him in the eyes you say that two of your wizards still live she asked yes wigg the onetime lead wizard of the directorate and his friend faegan from shadowood what of it because your directorate or should i say whats left of it is supposedly responsible for the isles existence she answered cautiously or so the legend goes tristan sat back in his chair even if what you say is true why must we go there he asked why cant we just set a course straight for the delta tyranny took another puff of smoke and let it out slowly there is still a great deal of sea between us and home she answered much of it is known to be infested with screechlings as well as slaver ships provided we can pay the price we should be able to procure both spars and sailcloth on the isle like it or not we need those to get to the delta in one piece even with our layover and taking into consideration the time it will take to make our final repairs we will still arrive at the delta faster than if we simply continued to plow along in our current state you must trust me on this i know what im talking about her face grew dark again and she reached out taking his hands into hers it was the first time she had ever done so i dont like the idea of taking us there either i would never have given such an order unless it was absolutely necessary nor would scars have suggested it brave as he is its a very dangerous place during previous visits there i have always lost good peoplecrew who chose to stay on the isle rather than return to the sea with me i wouldnt like to lose any more of them to that place but those here with me are here of their own free will what will be will be she looked away for a moment but there is also a personal reason why i avoid visiting the isle seemingly resigned to her decision she looked back at him the commanding eyes of the daring privateer had somehow transformed into those of a lovely desirable woman who suddenly seemed quite vulnerable in his presence you must believe me she said gently but insistently at this point everyone on the peoples revenge wants to get home as quickly as you do but we must have the necessary sails to speed our ship or we may never make it at all a small smile crossed her lips unless youd like to row again of course tristan found his mood softening nonetheless his mind was still full of unanswered questions but why do you say that this place has to do with the wizards he asked how could you possibly know that why is it so dangerous why did some of your men choose to stay there she gave a short laugh you sound like a schoolboy tristan felt his face flush with embarrassment suddenly the commanding calculating expression returned to her blue eyes and she let go of his hands no more questions now she said the isle of sanctuary is but one days sail from here even in our current condition you will have all of your answers soon enough now please help me up im still dizzy but i must get topside and look over my ships the wry smile came again the crewmembers need to know their captain is still able to pull her own weight standing tristan reached down to help her as she rose to meet him she winced at a pain in her left thigh and stumbled against him for a long uncomfortable moment they stared into each others eyes then he turned and helped her up the stairway to go look over her crippled ships it would be a depressing sight chapter thirtyfour a s wigg and faegan followed the ancient watchwoman through the portal they were engulfed in darkness again save for the light that came from the paragon hanging around faegans neck then the watchwoman stopped without turning around she raised one white fleshless hand in a gesture of warning follow my footsteps exactly and do not stray from the path she ordered the fall on either side is endless she set off again tapping her wooden staff against either edge of the stony path as she went along tentatively the wizards followed behind her in single file fog loomed up on all sides and the air was so cold that the wizards could see their breath streaming out before them although their minds were still brimming over with questions neither of them spoke at one point faegan produced a gold coin from the pocket of his robe and tossed it over the side of the path using the craft he trebled his wizards hearing and waited for the sound none came after that both wizards picked their steps with even greater care finally the watchwoman stopped and indicated that it was safe for the wizards to come up alongside her when they did she raised her hands radiance stones lining the ceiling immediately began to glow with sage light as they grew in brightness the light from the paragon faded until at last the jewel returned to its normal state faegan and wigg saw that they were standing in a very large cavern within the boundaries of its walls lay a small lake its waters glowing with the hue of the craft fog steamed up from the lake surface and encroached onto the jagged shoreline all around the lake rose tall black rocks whose slick sides shimmered in the glow from the lake on the edge of the shore lay a small rowboat there were no oars to be seen a slight breeze rippled the water and rustled the wizards hair it felt good on their faces looking out at the azure lake wigg was reminded of the azure waters he had seen in the caves of the paragon just before he and tristan had been bled and taken to ragnar nicholas servant he wondered how it was that such waters could exist here as well without speaking the watchwoman walked to the boat pushed it into the water and climbed into its stern raising her staff she then beckoned the two wizards forward to join her after exchanging a quick questioning look with faegan wigg stepped into the boat first then faegan levitated his chair up and over the side joining him still silent the watchwoman began using her staff to pole them across the fogshrouded lake after a time the fog parted and the wizards could see the far wall of the cavern where it plunged down into the azure lake seven circular openings had been carved into it in a row each filled about halfway with water a light breeze emanated from each of them softly disturbing the surface of the water the watchwoman carefully guided the little boat into the center opening and began pushing them down a long dark tunnel she paused only to raise her skeletal hands to illuminate the radiance stones that lined the roof of this place as well but though their light was very bright they revealed little it seemed to be a stone passageway nothing more at last wigg thought he could see an azure glow that signified the end of the tunnel the watchwoman stopped poling the boat and it slowly came to rest you search for the way to untangle the herbs and precious oils of the craft you say she asked in her raspy voice as wigg turned around to face her he saw that there was still nothing but empty darkness within the depths of her hood yes he answered very well then she replied pushing down on her staff she levered the boat forward again behold she said as they exited the tunnel the wizards were faced with a vision of such serene majesty that it nearly made them weep the square stone chamber was huge stretching at least one hundred meters in all directions there was no fog here the waters of the tunnel spilled out into yet another large lake of glowing azure this one so bright that its light filled the space and streamed across the stone walls and ceiling as they approached the far end of the chamber a sloped earthen embankment could be seen stretching completely from one of the side walls to the other its surface was covered with variegated vines and dark stronglooking roots the sharply sloped embankment rose upward in layered horizontal tiers each wide flat step of earth held what looked to be dozens of small pools of azure water water flowed from holes in the rock wall above the highest tier to tumble gracefully from one pool into the next all the way down to the lake in each pool grew plants of the craft their stems and blossoms rising just above the surface to create individual floating gardens these plants were bursting with every possible color a vibrant rainbow of living energy as the brilliant water coming from the wall above ran down and into each of the tiered pools it burbled happily the sound bouncing off the stone walls and the surface of the lake as the wizards stared entranced they became aware of the incredible scents in the air each mingled with the next yet was somehow also singularly distinct to the nose if these gardens were not what they once had been wigg could not even conceive of what they might have looked like in their prime as it was their beauty was so great it made his heart ache the floating gardens of the chambers of penitence faegan breathed hardly able to contain his joy the tome was right they really do exist but his delight faded as the watchwoman began pushing their boat away from the gardens rather than toward them where are you taking us he asked anxiously what we require is back there is it not in the tiered gardens indeed the watchwoman answered quietly as her macabre hands continued to steer the boat toward the sheer rock wall to their right but before i give you what you need one of you must pay the price then and only then am i allowed to grant you entrance to the gardens and provide you with what you seek wigg and faegan looked at each other tentatively but they said nothing approaching the shore near the far wall she gently beached the boat and indicated that they should disembark then she began walking along the rocky shoreline the wizards followed she soon came to stand before a plain square doorway carved into the rock wall there she turned to them the darkness within the hood of her robe was as impenetrable as ever only one of you shall be allowed to enter the chamber she said she pointed her blanched bony hand at wigg it shall be you she added coldly why wigg asked the herbs you request are among the rarest in existence she answered therefore the psychic price to be paid is exceedingly high of the two of you the cripple has far less chance of survival i can sense that his mind is always struggling to control the pain in his legs the added burdens that await in the chamber of penitence shall be more easily borne by youwhich is not to guarantee your survival either the choice remains yours decide wigg looked down at faegan and nodded slowly if he died here in this place today then so be it but no matter what else might happen no harm could come to the paragon faegan looked up at wigg with wet guilty eyes im sorry my friend he said his voice cracking then he looked down at the stark wooden chair that was at once both his freedom and his prison i have far less to lose he added sadly wigg placed a hand on faegans shoulder its all right he said softly but if i never come back please do all you can to help celeste come to terms with her past i have only just found her and i would like to know that my oldest best friend will be looking after her just as i know you will also care for abbey and the chosen ones lowering his head slightly all faegan could do was nod wigg looked back at the faceless woman i am ready he said she turned and walked through the doorway and into the darkness beyond taking a deep breath the lead wizard followed her inside chapter thirtyfive y oure insane wulfgar breathed softly incredulously as he stared at the wizard even you in the warped twisted world of this bizarre island you command cannot believe everything you have just said and even if you do such things are not possible what you propose is monstrous and i will have none of it do you hear none of it smiling slightly krassus stood from his chair and came to stand by wulfgars side looking out over the nighttime sea he saw the running lights of several slave ships approaching the underground pier counting them he saw that there were five he smiled again with the exception of the ship janus and grizelda had just departed in most of his fleet was now home and here in the protection of the citadel was where they would stay at least for the time being with the discovery of wulfgar he had no further need for the taking of rtalis slaves even before the half sibling of the chosen ones had been found krassus had already secured more of the endowed captives than he needed to fulfill the other more esoteric part of nicholas plans nor did the wizard need more talis slaves even though they had been brought here for an entirely different purpose and so he had told janus to order all of the slaving activities in eutracia abandoned soon his entire fleet and most of his demonslavers and consuls would be back at the citadel awaiting his next orders from the moment he had first entered these rooms and looked wulfgar over krassus had been pleased tall broad shouldered and muscular wulfgar had intense hazel eyes that burned brightly with both his innate intelligence and the strength of his uniquely endowed blood his rugged good looks were not what one might have called classically handsome but he carried with him a defiant sense of purpose just as did the other two offspring of the late queen morganna krassus could barely contain his eagerness to discover just how strong wulfgars blood would eventually prove to be but first he would need to consult the scroll of the vagaries for the last two hours krassus had been explaining his plan in great detail to the unbelieving man seated beside him telling him why he had been brought here and what was about to happen to all of the other slaves both talis and rtalis alike some of it the wizard had said was already going forward at the hands of the consuls under his control as krassus had gone on talking the look of extreme horror on wulfgars face had turned to one of pure rage at one point he had actually tried to attack the wizard but krassus had of course been able to control him painfully but gently showing him the error of his ways after that wulfgar had simply paced seething knowing that there was nothing he could do but listen to the impossiblesounding plans of the wizard with the long white hair and the strange grayandblue robe krassus had fully expected wulfgar to react this way in fact he would have been bitterly disappointed if the son of morganna had not but he also knew that wulfgars feelings would change soon enough and there would be absolutely nothing wulfgar would be able to do to prevent it when krassus had explained that wulfgar was in fact the bastard half sibling of tristan and shailiha the chosen ones themselves wulfgar had laughed calling the wizard insane but after krassus had explained to him about the wizards orphanage and the fact that he had been given over to a couple named jason and selene of the house of merrick his derisive attitude had slowly subsided and when krassus had shown wulfgar the blood signatures of all three of morgannas offspring and then gone on to explain how they had been formed by the craft for a time wulfgar had become strangely silent why serena wulfgar finally asked his mood quieter now what do you mean krassus responded politely it was painfully obvious that that freak janus wanted us together and in a very bad way wulfgar answered i had never asked for a woman yet there she suddenly was presented to me on a silver platter to supposedly do with however i wished i now partially regret to say that it worked i care very much for her as she does for me but you know that already dont you so tell me why was it so important to you that we meet i handpicked serena for you myself as the dead son of the chosen one commanded me to do just before his illfated attempt to empower the gates of dawn krassus answered perfunctorily serena is not only quite beautiful but also highly intelligent the assay rating of her endowed blood makes her an excellent match for you it is in fact a value of threevery high quality indeed and her blood signature leans far to the left just as your does making her even more suitable but as of yet of course she is completely ignorant of such nuances still confused wulfgar scowled at the thought of how easily he and serena had been manipulated but his love for her was real now he knew why she had been taken away by the demonslavers this morning so that the wizard called krassus could come here and speak to him privately suddenly more concerned than ever for serenas wellbeing he glared at the wizard sitting so calmly across from him you still havent answered my question he demanded why was she presented to me it couldnt have simply been for our sexual gratification no no of course not krassus answered happily crossing his legs and taking a sip of the excellent red wine on the table before him although an offspring from your union would certainly be useful that is not my goal other more pressing matters must take precedence as i have told you you will eventually become the ruler of not only this island but a good deal more as well and every king needs a queen the woman behind the throne as they say serena was the obvious choice and is also the woman you will no doubt bestow this honor upon when the time comes when all is said and done you will eventually find that the two of you are compatible in ways you could never have dreamed wulfgar thought for a moment assuming that all of this insanity is in fact true how can you be so sure that i will choose serena because even though you dont realize it yet you are a highly superior specimen of the craft krassus said calmly at some point even you will finally understand that only the best will do your position the quality of your blood and the leftleaning nature of your signature will eventually demand it and serena is without question the most highly qualified woman here so you plan to do to serena what you wish to do to me wulfgar asked furiously guilt that he had somehow helped krassus draw serena into all of this piled on top of his anger and he stood again and began pacing the balcony oh no krassus answered when the time comes that shall be your task you will most assuredly want to do it yourself to make sure her arrival into your new world is perfect in all respects but if she is so important to you why did you make her an outcast from the other slaves feeding her fine food in their presence while they starve wulfgar asked what possible purpose could that serve except to reinforce your cruelty ah yes krassus answered you see it is time serena began learning how to handle what will soon be her new station in life as you will learn the unendowed are little more than a natural resource for the endowed to exploit mere cattle as it were and becoming immune to the pleadings of those of lesser blood is an essential part of that realization what better way to begin teaching her than to force her to watch her friends starve while she thrives besides as i understand it it was you who insisted that she receive better nourishment perhaps you should have been more careful with your words wulfgar you know what they say be careful what you ask for you might just get it seething wulfgar stopped pacing for a moment to glare at the imperious selfconfident wizard and that freak of nature named janus he said angrily what rock did you find him under krassus gave a soft chuckle interesting isnt he he commented nicholas suggested that i select a eutracian of unendowed blood to help oversee the slaving operations far easier to kill you see than someone of endowed blood should something sour in the relationship so i went shopping for an assistant in bargainers square that section of tammerland is literally teeming with criminals for hire janus seemed an excellent choice the wizard took another sip of wine but i can sense how much you hate him wulfgar krassus added conspiratorially so once you have attained your potential if you wish to kill him then kill him frankly i couldnt care less janus is merely a means to an end thugs like him are a kisa a dozen so to speak a short smile finally crossed wulfgars lips if i can eventually kill janus then how do you know that i wont also kill you and all of your demonslavers he asked i would enjoy that very much krassus calmly took another sip of wine because by then you wont want to he answered as you will eventually see you will need the slavers and by that time killing me would profit you nothing as i told you i now have a preordained life span it came to me compliments of nicholas in the form of my rather inconvenient but very effective lung disease a creative incentive granted to me by my master designed not only to hurry me in my work but also to grace me with the greatest reward of all to reside for all of eternity in the embrace of the heretics of the guild so once you can feel free to kill me my fate is sealed one way or the other wulfgars emotions reeled between disbelief and hatred could this wizard actually be telling the truth or was he simply mad and if it all really was true then how could he a simple blacksmith and livery owner ever hope to stop it how could one hope to defeat a madman of the craft why did you bother to come here to me and tell me all of this he asked angrily considering the barbaric inhumane manner in which we were all brought here not to mention your horrific plans for the rest of the slaves drinking wine and engaging in conversation is a bit overcivilized isnt it if youre as powerful as you say then why dont you just get on with it all krassus only smiled if thats how you feel then tell me wulfgar how would you prefer it be done he took another sip of wine you could struggle of course and i could have my demonslavers beat and torture you he went on calmly but that would be so pedestrian dont you think besides i need you healthy you shall need all of your strength to survive what i am about to do to you in the end your struggle would only prove a waste of time and energy for us bothand given my condition time is the one luxury i do not have also should you be entertaining any heroic notions of trying to kill yourself to thwart me know that from now on at least two armed demonslavers will be here with you watching you every moment until my work with you is finished then our roles will be reversed and you shall command me and i shall gladly obey you for as much time as i may have left but just now there is something i must do walking back inside krassus beckoned wulfgar to join him realizing he had no choice wulfgar reluctantly did as he was asked krassus pointed one hand in the direction of the balcony and the azure glow of the craft started to appear as it did the wizard gracefully moved his hand back and forth and the glow slowly began to cover the entire expanse of the doorway creating a thin transparent wall of blue krassus lowered his hand a wizards warp he said casually designed to prevent you and serena from doing anything unpleasantly athletic such as a lovers leap for example i have made it transparent though so that you might still enjoy the view given everything else you are about to endure it would have been quite heartless of me to have taken that away from you dont you agree wulfgar looked through the shimmering azure wall and out into the blackness of the night i will fight you you must know that he said softly at the same time wondering how he might ever accomplish such a thing so will serena somehow we will reach tristan and shailiha and together we will kill you krassus nodded knowingly yes he agreed you will no doubt struggle against all that is about to happen at first your blood will demand it of you but then the leftleaning nature of your blood signature will take over turning you toward your true calling in the end it will not matter how much you struggle for you cannot win nor can serena eventually you will both understand and thank me for the wondrous world i have lain before you and then i shall die leaving the rest of nicholas magnificent mission in your very capable hands placing his hands into the opposite sleeves of his robe he turned to leave but then stopped there is still so much you do not know he said softly as if he were speaking to an uneducated child things your unprepared mind and untrained blood are not yet ready to embrace but they soon will be in the meantime i will have serena sent back to you even if you tell her all that we spoke of tonight in the end it will make no difference so do with your newfound information what you will and enjoy your time with her in a few days we will begin our work together but first there is research i must complete and for that i need the rtalis slaves then when i am finished i will send for you be ready with that krassus called for his demonslavers the bolt scratched its way across the other side of the door and three of the monsters sauntered in armed to the teeth saying nothing more krassus walked from the room with one of them the twin doors closed behind him with finality leaving wulfgar alone with the remaining two slavers as wulfgar turned to look through the bizarre transparent wall left by the wizard his thoughts were again drawn to the hideous plans krassus had for not only the other slaves but also for the rest of the world for the first time since his capture in farpoint a single tear overcame the lower lid of one of his hazel eyes and rolled its way down one cheek chapter thirtysix s hailiha shifted her weight in the saddle as the bay gelding cantered across the broad rolling field of barley the wind created waves in the sea of ripe grain and the sun unusually warm for this time in the season of new life lit the tan stalks with sparks of gold and amber smiling she took a deep breath the field smelled fertile with the promise of a good harvest and she could hear the rosecolored valley swallows calling out to one another as they swooped through the clear sky helping to create the seductive but misleading impression that all in the princess nation was well celeste rode beside her on pilgrim tristans dappled gray stallion since coming to live with them celeste had been learning to ride now several months later she could very nearly hold her own with the best of them she had asked shailihas permission to use tristans horse today and the princess had gladly agreed aware that riding pilgrim made celeste feel closer to tristan the horrific nightmare celeste had suffered the night before had clearly been a turning point for her after her initial terror had passed an overpowering rage had rushed hotly suddenly through her veins and she had hurried to talk with shailiha her feelingsanger fear shamehad come pouring out and at last had finally crumbled away and for the first time in three centuries her denial of her past finally departed as well in its place had arrived a sense of acceptance with that newfound acceptance had finally come the freedom and the desire to taste all of the good things available to her in her new life and the thirst her soul most desperately wished to quench was to tell tristan how much she truly cared and to be with him unfortunately the best she could do for now was to ride his horse in the company of his twin sisterand her best friend smiling at celeste shailiha suggested that they stop for lunch and a rest in a nearby grove of trees celeste nodded her agreement and touched her heels to pilgrims flanks urging him toward the end of the field laughing shailiha followed after securing their mounts and untying the two saddlebags the women sat down in the shade of the trees the deep green carpet of grass was lush and soft and it felt good to be off the horses for a time opening the saddlebags shailiha removed some cold seasoned grouse fresh fruit and dark bread she also produced a bottle of very good white wine and two wooden cups eating and drinking in companionable silence they took in the stillness of the countryside and the warm soft breeze that came visiting from time to time high above ox and his minion squadron circled lazily in the sky in truth shailiha had at first been disappointed to know that she and celeste were going to be chaperoned but now seeing the silhouettes of the powerful minion wings against the blue background she felt comforted at last celeste spoke you think tristans still alive dont you she asked quietly taking a deep breath shailiha looked out over the field i dont just think it she said with conviction i know it as much as i love hearing you say it how can you be so sure shailiha looked down at the glittering medallion lying around her neck then she held it up for celeste to see call it intuition if you like she answered but ever since i first found this around my neck and i came out from under the awful spells the coven had placed on me i have felt far more connected to him than ever before in my heart i have always thought there is more to these medallions we wear than first meets the eye they are twins just as we are and i believe there is meaning in that sighing she let the bit of shiny gold fall back to her chest dont ask me to explain it for i cant she said honestly tristan is in dangerof that i am sure but he is also alive and trying to get back homei just know it if only the minion patrols flying over the sea of whispers could bring us back some scrap of informationanything that might help us find him but we cannot lose hope i will not lose hope she held her face up to the breeze eyes closed then her brow creased as a dark thought crossed her mind and now tristan and i learn that we have a brother out there somewhere most probably suffering horribly at the hands of the wizard krassus she said quietly half to herself we must someday bring him home as well she paused there have been so many secrets she finally whispered and i fear still so many more to learn for a time they both sat there saying nothing i hope with all my heart that you are right and that we can find them both celeste finally said she pulled her knees up beneath her chin tell me something she said softly what was your husband frederick like im sorry i was never able to know him with tristan still missing the princess wasnt sure she possessed the fortitude to speak of her late husband as well frederick had been the love of her life the father of her only child when he had been killed at the hands of the coven it had been as if the flame in her heart had suddenly been blown out sometimes it seemed that the part of her heart the flame had once inhabited had gone cold never to be rekindled again she had spoken little of frederick since his death but as she thought on it she realized that she needed to wanted to a sad smile came to her lips as she took another sip of wine frederick was the commander of the royal guard she began he and tristan were best friends and they constantly teased each otherespecially over who was the better swordsman frederick taught tristan everything he knows about combat yet in some ways the student eventually overcame the teacher it was tristan who taught me to use a sword and later on he introduced me to frederick when i first saw the stalwart officer in the splendid uniform i was so smitten that i couldnt breathe celeste smiled at her silly of me i know shailiha continued with a short sad laugh but thats how love is and now frederick is gone but at least he lives on in morganna i am immensely grateful for that and always will be the wind came up again moving through her long blond hair she pulled the disobedient tresses behind her then she turned her eyes back to celeste you love my brother very much dont you the princess asked gently already knowing the answer smiling celeste lowered her head a bit it is really so obvious she asked back blushing slightly oh yes shailiha answered everyone at the palace sees it and rest assured the same sentiment rests in his eyes as well but tell me now that so much has changed for you what will you do when you finally see him again it was celestes turn to look out over the field my newfound heart wont let me wait this time she said softly her mind made up i will tell him and then we shall see shailiha smiled as she wondered what the future might hold for celeste and tristan if and when her brother ever came home neither of them spoke for they both knew that there was nothing more that needed saying instead they packed up the remainder of the food and mounted their horses as they rode back through the field of waving grain the minion warriors still patiently circling above shailiha closed her eyes and called for caprice silently softly the beautiful flier of the field came fluttering down to land obediently on her mistress outstretched arm chapter thirtyseven d rop anchor scars shouted loudly the anchor went in with a splash and the peoples revenge all of her sails furled drifted for a moment before coming to a halt not far from them the other two ships in their little fleet likewise dropped anchor and came to a rest satisfied scars looked back to his captain and nodded tristan stood on the bow next to tyranny wondering how she could be so sure they had arrived at the isle of sanctuary it was midday and the sun was high but a dense fog bank blocked the view ahead of them but then through the salty sea air he was surprised to realize he could distinguish another odor the smell of land tristan was not the only one who welcomed the chance to stand on firm ground again tyrannys crew seemed extremely anxious to go ashore for some reason still unknown to the prince tyranny had ordered the slaves to stay aboard for the time being a smattering of crewmen chosen by lot stayed behind to watch over the ships as they lay at anchor the others were all joyously clambering into the skiffs hoisted along the length of the hull lowering themselves down into the water as quickly as they knew how and paddling off into the fog tyranny stood watching her crew depart with a distinct look of concern on her face the bandage tristan had wound around her forehead yesterday had been removed as had the ones on her hands only the cloth around her left thigh remained since that wound had been deeper and still tried to bleed through from time to time tristan wondered what she was waiting for arent we going ashore he asked her on hearing his words she seemed to come out of some kind of personal reverie and she turned her wide blue eyes toward him yes yes of course she answered rather absently at a gesture from her scars walked to the gunwale and prepared to lower the captains personal skiff into the sea tyranny started to join him but tristan gently took her by one arm stopping her i think its time you gave me some answers about all of this dont you he asked jaw hard with determination tyranny nodded youre right she said simply climb into the skiff and i will explain on the way but as the skiff made its way into the gloom scars rowing tyranny was silent the dense fog was cold and clammy against tristans skin and so thick that he could barely see tyranny next to him if it hadnt been for the reassuring sound of the oars slicing through the sea he wouldnt have known that scars was there at all tristan scowled what is it about this place that has unnerved you so he asked that isnt like you and why do you seem so hesitant to go ashore when the rest of your crew was so eager she closed her eyes for a moment and a short rather sad smile crossed her face youre very observant she answered i dont fear this place tristan there is nothing in this world that i truly fear including the screechlings that attacked us but there are reasons why i do not wish to see this place again he edged closer and put an arm around her not only to help ward off the cold but also he hoped to inspire a sense of trust she did not shy away from his touch may i know what these reasons are he asked the isle of sanctuary is a haven for pirates she said not privateers such as scars and myself mind you but true marauders of the seas these men and in some cases women make their living by plundering the honest merchant vessels that ply the coast of eutracia whenever they take a ship those captives who refuse to join them are immediately put to the sword because of this practice their ranks have swollen quickly on discovering this island they made it their base even the name of sanctuary that the wizards gave to this place suits the needs of the pirates ironic wouldnt you say but something else occurred to tristan how is it possible that you know of the connection between this place and the directorate of wizards a great library was found hereonly one of numerous structures the texts within held the plans for the island the directorate was clearly the force behind it the construction apparently began sometime just after the end of the sorceresses war but although the buildings were finished it seems they were never occupied stunned tristan turned to look back out into the fog for a moment his mind was teased by the idea that he might find the scroll of the vigors here but then he quickly dismissed the notion if the scrolls had been hidden here wigg and faegan would surely know he turned back to tyranny tell me he asked are these records still intact as of my last visit here yes she answered the pirates have little use for such things many of them cant even read but now i have a question for you i have been sailing these waters all of my life and i would bet my last kisa that despite the evidence contained in the library this island did not exist until the return of the coven so how is it that it has so suddenly sprung up from the depths so to speak for the pirates to use i have no idea tristan replied all i can tell you is that the wizards often have their own inexplicable ways of doing things he shook his head but you still havent told me your reasons for not wanting to come here he reminded her gently first of all i always lose a number of good crewmembers to this place she answered sadly the temptations here are too great for many of them to resist that is surely the only reason my ships are allowed entry herebecause i lose so many of my people to their cause it profits the pirates to let me visit if thats the case then why do you let your crew go ashore at all tristan asked tyranny snorted its easy to see you have never captained a sailing vessel my dear prince she scoffed just what would you have me do to stop them eh you scars and i certainly arent enough to keep them from going ashore are we these are basically good people tristan and when we are at sea they follow my orders to the letter but like all people they have their weaknesses especially after having been out for weeks on end when a vessel at sea is stopped by pirates the crew is forced into servicethey have no other option but here once a crewmember goes ashore and learns what sanctuary has to offer many of them join the pirates willingly and the pirates are smart enough to know that someone who has joined them of his or her own accord will probably serve them better than one who has not tristan shook his head and the other reason he asked gently hoping to finally come to the heart of the matter there is one here who is in charge of it all she answered softly sadly his name is rolf of the house of glenkinnon at one time he worked for my father in our fishing concern thats how we met later on he became not only my partner in my pursuit of the demonslavers but my lover as well but once we found this place and he set foot ashore all of that changed is sanctuary really that alluring tristan asked tyranny nodded i see he mused so this man was persuaded not only to leave you but to become an important part of what you despise im sorry tyranny that must have been difficult turning to him she placed a hand over his you must be very careful in this place tristan she warned him my common crew are welcome even accepted in this place but needless to say you look and act very different even though rolf and i are no longer together he can be insanely jealous especially when he is drinking we will not require his permission to buy our sails and spars from the tradesmen here but he could just as easily tell them not to deal with us should the mood strike him and they would obey him without question he rules by intimidation and is a quick and efficient killerthe best swordsman i have ever seen so give him a wide berth and let me do the talking i want to be in and out of here as quickly as possible she allowed herself a small half smile besides she whispered leaning in closer toward his ear you and i have business to conclude in eutracia i still havent forgotten about my money you know i must admit that i gave serious thought to having scars tie you up and then leave you aboard with the freed slaves until we could be done with our business here that way i could have better protected my investment in you but after coming to know you as i have i decided that as scars and i shopped for the things we need we were safer with you and your strange sword than without you this time it was tristans turn to give a snort tyranny was nothing if not clever he reminded himself he turned his attention forward again as he did he thought he saw the fog start to thin then the skiff plunged headlong out the other side of it and the isle of sanctuary suddenly lay before him chapter thirtyeight a s wigg followed the watchwoman of the floating gardens down the dark cramped tunnel his apprehension grew he was the lead wizard his knowledge of the craft second only to faegans as such he normally had little to fear but now faegan was no longer by his side and wigg was alone with this strange darkrobed creature as she led him along he felt a sense of dread shooting up his spine coupled with a cold nervous sweat as he thought about it he didnt know which was worse having to wait to endure the nature of the psychic price he was about to pay or facing the possibility of dying alone in this strange underground world should he fail to withstand it finally the watchwoman stopped coming up beside her wigg could see that he was at the exit to the tunnel standing on a stone landing a circular stairway led from the landing to a large simple room below the radiance stones here provided unusually soft light making it difficult to see the watchwoman beckoned him onto the top step and raised her hands almost immediately the circular stairway started to revolve lowering itself with each turn like a corkscrew disappearing into a cork as he and the watchwoman neared the floor wigg could see that the room was carpeted in skeletons they lay everywhere in no particular order all human of different sizes and probably genders and he saw as he looked closer they all shared one strange characteristic every single sternum bone had been completely destroyed as if it had been forcefully blown apart from within in many cases the ribs had also been rent asunder even scattered about the room leaving gaping holes what happened to them wigg asked as he carefully followed the watchwoman through the shining white skeletons the answer is simple wizard she replied they failed but how did they fail wigg asked hoping to gain some precious insight that might help him survive did their hearts burst because they were not strong enough to withstand the regrets you forced them to relive finally after having guided him through all of the bones she stopped and turned to him i didnt force them to do anything she answered sternly they came here of their own free will hoping to acquire certain herbs and oils of the craft so that they might better protect the vigors against the neverending wrath of the vagaries and they ended up forfeiting their lives just as you may and also like you they understood that chaos is the natural order of the universe the very principle upon which the vagaries thrive in their cases chaos prevailed you are all alike those of you who come here always believe that what you are about to endure is a test of the strength of your hearts it isnt puzzled wigg narrowed his eyes then what is it that is being tested the inherent goodness of your endowed blood wizard such as it may be your blood signature was verified as rightleaning by the woman of stone before you were allowed entry to this place was it not she turned to face the far wall of the chamber then she raised her wooden staff behold she said the air before them started to take on the azure glow of the craft then the gleaming began to coalesce forming into a very large shimmering cube that began to spin slowly what is it he asked tell me wizard what is your greatest regret she asked ignoring his question and remember you must answer truthfully wigg stared at the revolving cube as he considered her question there had been a great many regrets in his long life but one stood head and shoulders above all the others he looked back at the faceless watchwoman my greatest regret is having banished the coven of sorceresses to the sea of whispers rather than killing them outright he said softly had i followed my heart that night and drowned all four of them in the ocean as i was tempted to do i would have undoubtedly been forced from the directorate for violating their mandate but that would have been a very small price to pay for the coven eventually returned and laid waste to the land killing as they went thousands of innocents died including most of the royal family and all of the remaining wizards of the directorate it was entirely my fault for i alone could have prevented it but did not it was a mistake for which i shall never forgive myself for a long moment wigg lowered his head and closed his eyes very well she replied he opened his eyes to see that the gleaming cube was still revolving in the air what i say to you now is for your ears alone and never to be repeated do you understand she asked wigg nodded the greatest tragedy of regret is not what one did or did not do to cause it she said nor is it what we did or did not experience at the time it is therefore neither the doing nor the omission of some act that causes the greatest pain and suffering but rather its aftermath that burns longest in our hearts and eventually in the hearts of others the aftermath of your regret spirals down through the years like a plague infecting everyone and everything it touches it has always been this way just as it always shall be it is therefore this part of that aftermath that you shall now see for that night in the sea of whispers was only the catalyst not the result you just said so yourself did you not that is truly what the chamber of penitence is about wizard we are here to observe a small part of the results of what you caused not simply the lone act that caused them and may your endowed blood and your wizards soul possess enough inherent goodness to survive what you shall witness for it is only that same goodness as it struggles within you against the aftermath of your error that can keep you alive then the watchwoman turned toward the gleaming spinning cube and raised her staff as she did shapes began to form within it then the shapes came into greater focus forming an alltoofamiliar scene as the drama unfolded wigg was stricken with an intense excruciating pain that shot through not only his entire nervous system but cleaved into his very soul as well though transfixed by the view his pain took him to his knees sobbing he found himself screaming at the watchwoman begging her to make it stop but it didnt in truth it had only just begun the scene was of tristans coronation nightthe night that everything in the wizards world so irrevocably changed through his tears wigg could see the royal family standing proudly on the dais nicholas morganna frederick the chosen ones and the other members of the directorate were also there waiting for him to place the paragon around tristans neck sealing the princes reign for the next thirty years then came the smashing of the glass dome high above its sharp glass shards raining down as the first of the minions dropped into the great hall and began slaughtering the defenseless guests blood screaming severed body parts and yet more blood always endlessly the blood flowed until it seemed there was an entire sea of it sweeping across the oncebeautiful whiteandblack checkerboard floor and then suddenly he was watching the struggle that had gone on outside of the palacethe one that until now he had never witnessed the minions descended on the gathered citizens like madmen cutting them down as they went men women and children fell easy prey to the winged monsters wielding the strangely curved swords by now some of the royal guard had begun to fight back but the minion army was too strong and too large some of the monsters picked up severed human body parts and began using their bloody ragged ends as paintbrushes with which to scrawl obscenities and warnings across the walls raising one hand wigg tried to summon his gift and stop the vision but nothing happened he found himself forced to watch as it went on and on just as had happened the first time he found himself experiencing the cruel helplessness of not being able to stop any of it then quite unexpectedly his mental and physical pain multiplied searing through his system even more viciously than before as each minion sword came flashing down to cut through sinew and bone as each woman was thrown to the ground and brutally abused as each husband wife sister and brother bent over slaughtered loved ones and screamed into the night wigg was forced to feel their physical and mental agony his body convulsed with it his mind was seared by it and his heart pounded with it crying madly the exquisite agony wracking every iota of his being wigg fell facedown onto the cold stone floor nonetheless some unseen force lifted his face back up so that he had no choice but to continue taking in the horrifying carnival of blood gore rape and death and then he heard the beating of his own heart as the agony of the victims continued to flood into his being the beating grew more insistent ever louder ever faster it became so overpowering that he thought it might burst his eardrums blood pain the frantic screaming of the innocents and the pounding of his heart all combined into a massive unrelenting crescendo that he knew would soon kill him unless it stopped but it didnt it just kept on going and going seemingly without end then suddenly it was too much for even the endowed blood and the inherent goodness of the lead wizard to bear with the watchwoman standing over him wiggs face hit the unforgiving stone floor and the light went out of his eyes chapter thirtynine a s krassus walked into the weapons forge he could feel the intense heat from the hearths blast him in the face he could hear the constant hissing of the steam as the slaves lowered the redhot partially constructed weapons into the vats of brackish water to temper them the sound of their hammers banging down on the hot metal rang out endlessly smoke and soot hung darkly in the air infusing the entire place with a hot charred odor as he breathed it in he was overcome by the urge to cough quickly pulling the bloodied rag from his blueandgray robe he placed it over his mouth and involuntarily let go several deep convulsive hacks taking the rag away he looked down to see his familiar blood signature twisting its way across the fabric his disease was advancing he had been coughing even more of late it was becoming increasingly evident that he must hurry in his work if he was to successfully complete nicholas mission before he died and to be certain of his victory he needed to acquire the scroll of the vigors the only piece of the puzzle still missing angrily stuffing the rag back into his robe he walked purposefully up to the demonslaver in charge the monster bowed status report the wizard ordered simply all goes well the grotesque servant replied the store of new weapons grows daily and ever more slavers come to take them up there have been no further suicide attempts by any of the workers satisfied krassus cast his dark eyes around the room trying to find the slave that janus had told him about finally krassus found him standing on the far side of the room his hands tied behind his back bring him to me he said simply the head slaver immediately obliged walking over to where twentynine stood supervising another slave grabbing him by the throat the slaver manhandled him over to where krassus stood waiting krassus walked completely around the loinclad slave as if he were examining some beast of burden he might purchase then he grasped the slaves dirty chin and turned his face this way and that in the orangered glow of the hearths confused as to why he had been singled out twentynine wondered who this frightening man with the long white hair and the piercing eyes was he just as quickly found himself hoping that he would never have to face him again so youre the one who gave us so much trouble by trying to take your own life krassus said softly did you really think it would be so easy my friend im glad to see that you have been properly restrained and are giving us no further concern but as you will soon learn nothing here in this chamber including you and the weapon smiths you supervise will matter very much longer he turned back to the head demonslaver i was on my way to the scriptorium on more urgent business but i decided to stop here to tell you something he said i have ordered that no more slaves be taken from eutracia for our requirements have been filled therefore after you have fully armed all of the forthcoming demonslavers you may shut this place down turning on his heel krassus crossed the room and walked out the door closing behind him with finality as he strode down the open halls lining the manicured courtyard he took in the crisp afternoon air coming in off the sea and listened for the strangely comforting screams it was not long before he heard them the farther he walked the louder the screaming became finally reaching its crescendo behind two huge marble doors that he briskly passed by as he walked on the insane wailing faded then disappeared altogether there was no need for him to stop and inspect what was occurring behind those doors because as long as the screaming could be heard everything in that chamber was going according to plan besides he had other far more pressing matters to attend to just now in a different area of the citadel the room he finally entered was in stark contrast to the one he had just left this was the scriptorium the chamber in which so much of his mission had already been accomplished by the consuls in the dark blue robesthose of the craft who had been freed of their death enchantments turned to the vagaries by the son of the chosen one and left for krassus to command this was also the chamber in which so much of his mission was still to take place and in which longheld dusty secrets would be revealed the scriptorium was very large taking up the entire second floor of this section of the citadel and its light airy appearance belied the gruesome nature of the important work that went forward here sunlight streamed in through the many wide open windows lining three of the four long walls overlooking the restless sea of whispers below the air in the room was odorless the environment bordering on a cold sterility the scriptoriums size was deceiving it was in fact a collection of rooms separated by short curving walls with openings but no doors in this way krassus consuls could not only move easily from one chamber to the next as they went about their labors but they could also maintain a high degree of privacy so that their concentration would not be broken the only room that could be sealed off from the others was krassus personal study large in size but plain in appearance it held only an ornate desk and bookcases full of texts and scrolls it was lit by a single window approaching the door to his private chamber krassus narrowed his eyes calling on the craft the lock turned over once then twice more and the door slowly revolved on its hinges after opening the window behind the desk krassus sat down almost immediately the consul in charge of the scriptorium appeared before him awaiting his masters orders the moment he had arrived at the citadel with the scroll of the vagaries krassus had turned it over to the consuls so that they might begin the necessary research despite the fact that nicholas had made krassus fully aware of the purpose of the scrolls of the ancients before his death there was still a great deal of investigation that would need to be done before the scroll of the vagaries would give up the particular secret they were searching for to this end krassus had driven the consuls mercilessly the research had gone on unabated both day and night so far the going had been difficult although nicholas had known what he needed gleaned from the scroll even the son of the chosen one had been unaware of where it had been placed among the seemingly countless other calculations and inscriptions so elegantly written on the very long uniform piece of vellum each calculation the scroll relinquished had to be tested on a person of untrained endowed bloodan rtalis slaveto determine whether it was the one they were looking for the one magnificent calculation thatin its unparalleled awesome powerwould finally and irrevocably smash everything the wizards of the redoubt stood for had so far eluded them krassus looked up at the consul standing obediently before him your report he demanded for purposes of security the consul answered it seems the writers of the scroll chose to bury this most powerful of calculations somewhere deep within the body of the text and leave it untitled although hundreds of useful forestallments have now been mapped and recorded the one we search for the one shown to you by nicholas still eludes us to narrow our examination we are now putting into use only the untitled calculations he paused it seems that the heretics of the guild did not make our task a simple one growing ever more impatient the wizard scowled saying nothing he rose from his desk and left the room followed by the obedient consul striding across the length of the scriptorium he stopped before a particular entryway through which doorway the azure glow of the craft seeped out anxious to view the process he walked in the room was large along one wall lay a long rectangular table covered with reams of parchment more than a dozen consuls were seated there recording their observations with inkladen quills hovering before them in the stillness of the room was the glowing partially unrolled scroll of the vagaries the engraved golden band that had once been secured around its center had been removed and the scroll was unrolled to reveal the beautiful elegant script spread across its ancient surface one by one the consuls selected portions of the script the passages began to glow as they were chosen lifting themselves from the parchment and hovering in the air before the consuls the consuls read the old eutracian script floating before them first deciphering and then recording what they read onto sheets of individual parchment when each was satisfied that his translation was correct he ordered the glowing words back to the scroll then the name and use of the spell if given was recorded on the parchment and passed to a waiting demonslaver who took it from the room the consul would then begin anew selecting the next available passage from the scroll and so it went the faithful scribes deciphering and recording the contents of the scroll while their watchful master looked on krassus finally walked to the next room constructed of pure white marble this chamber was much larger than the one he had just left and the work here had a more intense deadly feel to it demonslaver guards wandered warily about their white eyes missing nothing bookcases covered every inch of the walls their shelves lined with ledgers that were arranged in perfect sequential order from time to time the consuls would come to the shelves either to take fresh volumes or to replace those they had just finished with these volumes contained the information gleaned from the endowed slaves as they had departed the ships at the underground pier the blood signatures and assay ratings had been dutifully recorded along with the names ages dates and locations of capture and sex krassus turned his attention to the center of the bright sterilelooking room one hundred white marble tables each a very precise two meters long by one meter wide stood arranged in neat rows upon each lay a live human bodya conscious endowed slave bound to its surface at arms legs and throat and covered by a curved dome of transparent azure over each of the tables stood a lone consul carefully going about his meticulous work krassus chose one to observe after finding the page in the ledger that held the information about the slave lying before him the consul caused a perfect duplicate of the slaves previously recorded blood signature to rise from its pages it came to rest next to the deciphered script on the parchment brought to him from the room housing the scroll the consul then reached one hand through the azure dome and placed his palm on the slaves forehead terrified almost beyond insanity the helpless slave struggled but to no avail closing his eyes the consul recalled the calculations of the stillunidentified forestallment just gleaned from the scroll then he carefully began infusing it directly into the endowed blood of the slave the slave on the table began to convulse foam ran from the corners of his mouth and his eyes rolled back up into his head as his body jerked violently a marionette dancing on someone elses strings although he screamed wildly no sound could be heard through the azure dome such an interesting phenomenon krassus reflected emotionlessly to see one convulse and scream so violently yet hear no sounds of torment and then finally it was over the slave collapsed eyes closing as the consul removed his hand from the slaves head the azure dome faded away is he dead krassus asked casually no the consul answered some of them live though most die interestingly it seems that those with a blood assay value of four or better often survive and can be subjected to the process again such information may prove useful one day narrowing his eyes the loyal consul again called on the craft he caused a small incision to form in the slaves right arm and ordered a single drop of the slaves blood to land on the parchment next to the blood signature reaching into his robes the consul produced a vial opening it he released a single drop of red water taken from the caves of the paragon almost immediately the two drops began to move across the page toward one another quickly becoming one as the slaves blood signature formed the consul removed another piece of parchment from his robe it held an exact copy of the forestallment branch they all searched forthe one given to krassus by nicholas just before his death after closely comparing the two he shook his head they were not of the same length nor did the various branches match as they trailed away from the blood signatures negative again master he said he summoned one of the many demonslavers in this area to come to the table take this one away he ordered suddenly they heard a shout of unmitigated joy come from the other side of the room navigating his way between the busy tables krassus hurried over to the consul who had cried out what is it he asked not daring to hope i have found it master the consul breathed his excitement barely allowing him to get the words out krassus looked down at the tabletop to see that the female slave the consul had been using was dead show me he ordered his hands were trembling with excitement with a slight bow the overjoyed consul handed over both his copy of the long angular forestallment branch they searched for and the copy of the blood signature just taken from the dead slave krassus examined them carefully as he did his heart leapt there could be no mistake this was the forestallment branch that nicholas had ordered him to search for now the next stage of this amazing journey in the craft could finally begin he turned to one of the demonslavers his dark eyes flashing bring me wulfgar he said quietly chapter forty a s the skiff approached the shoreline of the isle of sanctuary the sheer beauty of the island astounded tristan the other skiffs had already been beached and the last of the crew could be seen eagerly headed down a path into the woods steep sharply pointed hills rose almost straight up from the shoreline their tops obscured by gray mist below the level of the mist they were carpeted with a dense emerald growth he found himself smiling at first glance it looked like paradise gnarled multicolored trees grew wide and tall and were dotted with colors that could only be fruits and berries thick strong vines stretched between the trees to create an odd sort of twisted tangled harmony the air had a pleasant sweetsour aroma the scents from the flowers and plants combining with the saltiness of the sea as it washed up over the sandy shore the birdsong he could hear was unfamiliar and melodic as he clambered up out of the skiff to stand with tyranny and scars on the wooden dock tristan tried to remember what the captain had said about sanctuary being both alluring and dangerous the first part of the captains warning he now found easy to understand but as he took in the serene beauty he frankly found it difficult to convince himself that it could be dangerous as well as if reading his thoughts tyranny turned to him the same look of concern still blanketing her face where are all the ships you said were stationed here tristan asked as the three of them walked off the dock and onto the shore the ships are usually moored in various coves around the island tyranny answered that way if sanctuary is attacked all of them cannot be destroyed at once and at least some of them can escape as she spoke she began leading them down a narrow but welltrod path through the dense foliage between two of the hills that is why you anchored on this side of the island isnt it tristan asked so your ships wouldnt be found yes she answered pausing to push a lowhanging vine out of her way i want to enter sanctuary quietly on foot as i do not know what kind of reception i might receive from rolf if he is in port and not out to sea if he were to commandeer my ships we could end up here for a long time looking down at his right knee boot tristan thought of the small piece of the scroll of the vagaries that had been hidden there by his stillunknown benefactor all too aware that he must get it back to the wizards and their herbmistress as soon as he could his jaw hardened he had had quite enough of being controlled by others he longed to be home again and he would do anythingincluding kill if need beto get there and where do we get the sailcloth and spars from he asked there are merchants and smiths here scars told him most of them were part of the pirate group at one time but decided to go into the business of turning the stolen raw materials into finished goods good money and much less risk especially since most of the raiders would rather be out on the sea than sitting here sewing sailcloth and shaving spars an unusual arrangement but it works so unless rolf objects and orders otherwise they will do business with us but i fear their price may be very high indeed too high perhaps for our stores of kisa are not what they once were then scars pulled tristan closer indicating that he wanted the two of them to lag a bit behind tyranny curious tristan slowed down the truth is that i have my doubts about our overall success especially where rolf is concerned scars whispered in a rare example of emotion i can only imagine how he reacted after the captain finally left him one night without warning sailing away as she did by the light of the full moons by then he had begun to beat her and she wouldnt stand for it frankly im surprised she didnt kill him but love has a way of tempering ones resolve does it not and as you have no doubt noticed she is very adept at hiding the scars on her heart had i known what was happening i would have killed the bastard myself scars paused to look sternly at tristan keep your sword and your knives at the ready rolf is used to seeing me around the captain but he wont take kindly to a newcomer who is friendly with her and he is very good with his sword tristans jaw hardened again so am i he thought they walked on in silence for a time the narrow rutted path wound back and forth and tristan noted by the position of the sun that they were traveling west after a while he saw the first pieces of marble the huge sections of broken fluted column were the largest he had ever seen he estimated that it would have taken at least thirty men arms outstretched and holding hands to surround even the smallest of them they looked very old and were fashioned of a rare rose marble shot through with swirls of deeper red lying here and there on both sides of the trail they looked as though they had been randomly cast off by giants how did these get here he asked tyranny quickening his pace to catch up you tell me she answered without turning around as i told you its all the directorates doing theyre your wizards arent they with a soft laugh tristan shook his head and just watched for the marble pieces they were gradually increasing in frequency and number there were not only column pieces but entire columns as well sometimes standing alone and complete with their decorative capitals and he could see that they were built to the same proportions as typical eutracian columns he also saw freestanding sections of wall their surfaces adorned with intricate alcoves and pilasters waiting to form buildings that would never be constructed there were statues in evidence too representing both animals and humans finally tyranny slowed and held up one hand as tristan and scars came up alongside her the prince looked past her and down into the valley before them at the far side of the valley the sea of whispers crashed up against the shore dozens of ships their sails furled bobbed gently at anchor just beyond the wooden piers that jutted arrogantly out into the sea and nestled in between in the heart of the lowlands lay sanctuary it looked to be something more than a town yet less than a city with nothing surrounding it it was as if it had become somehow lodged forever inbetweenlike a stunted child that never reached adulthood long since abandoned by its parents and forced to survive on its own expecting nothing more than a series of hastily constructed ramshackle shanties tristan quickly realized that he couldnt have been more wrong despite the fact that sanctuary had apparently been built long ago its structures sparkling like precious jewels in the noonday sun had a timeless pristine quality about them they were laid out in neatly patterned order a great rosecolored marblefloored plaza lay at their center inlaid with a bloodred representation of the paragon its image vibrant and commanding tristan could now see people milling about the town as the three of them finally came closer and began walking among them he saw that things were not as genteel as they had first appeared from atop the hill the exteriors of the buildings were absolutely beautiful but as many of them had their doors open to the sun he could see what the pirates had done to them trash personal items and ale bottles lay everywhere it was almost as if animals lived here rather than human beings tristan felt disgusted men and women alike seemed to be in a constant state of revelry for the most part tristan and his companions were ignored so he studied the people without interference by and large the men here were a dirty slovenly bunch most of them wore sparse brightly colored clothing often parted to reveal intricate tattoos they bristled with weapons and shiny jewelry and were for the most part clearly in various stages of drunkenness but tristan could see a careful ruthless glint in their eyes whenever one of them looked his way he had been among their kind before in tammerland just after the return of the coven and the decimation of the royal guard war bred such men like flies tyranny had been right he realized these pirates were not only thieves of the sea but cold calculating killers as well now he could easily understand the attraction that a place like this far away from civilization and its demands would hold for such rebels as they walked on the noise level increased barkers loudly tried to entice them into wagering on games and contests from the balconies above courtesans in various stages of undress called out coy obscenities trying to entice passersby to come upstairs sometimes tristan could hear the shameless crude sounds of urgent intercourse coming from the alleyways as he walked by the entire city of sanctuary seemed to be nothing more than one great roiling mass of perversion drunkenness and greed as far as tristan was concerned the sooner they got what they needed and left the better finally tyranny led them down a narrower quieter street and stopped before a nondescript shop this is where we can order our spars she told tristan jonah the owner was a friend of my fathers we will be safe here for the time being tyranny walked in tristan and scars in tow as they did the bell atop the door announced their presence the store was small with a door in the back that looked out onto a woodworking shop several men could be seen quietly fashioning spars and other ships necessities the pleasant smell of shaven wood came to tristans nostrils as he looked at the man bent over the short businesslike counter he was older than the prince had expected and he wore large spectacles fashioned above one side of them was a smaller more highly powered lens that could be swiveled down for close work tan wood dust covered his curly irongray hair and the striped apron that stretched across his abundant middle arm garters secured his sleeves jonah tyranny said as he approached the counter i need help without looking up he rudely waved her away with one of his fat callused hands yes yes doesnt everybody these days the whole damnable island needs my services lately seems the screechlings have been more active than ever for some reason go away and come back when im not so busy he said gruffly his attention still planted firmly between the pages of his ledger tyranny smiled a bit jonah she said with a bit more insistence its metyranny jonahs head snapped up his face overcome with delight he ran from behind the counter and hugged tyranny so tightly that her toes left the floor she grinned widely its so good to see you my dear he bellowed finally putting her down how long has it been three four months then his face darkened you should never have come back you know ever since you left rolfs anger has been terrible have you lost your mind why are you here before she could answer he looked at tristan and who is this nastylooking character he is a friend tyranny told him jonah looked tristan over again then gave him a nod tristan nodded back you need spars you say jonah asked he looked concerned screechlings three maelstroms at once she answered we barely survived his eyes wide jonah ran one hand through his hair in disbelief as he did bits of shaved wood rained down no one has ever survived three maelstroms he whispered half to himself they have been far more active of late and no one seems to know why do you have any idea tyranny shook her head taking a deep breath tristan held his tongue he knew very well why but he also knew that now was not the time to speak of it do you have your specifications jonah asked her taking a piece of parchment from the pocket of his trousers scars handed it over with a quick automatic movement jonah swiveled the single lens down over one side of his spectacles and looked over the list hmm he mused five new spars all of unequal thickness and length he murmured this will take some doing but if i put everything on hold i can have them for you tomorrow morning say two hundred kisa thats at no profit to me child given rolfs attitude you need to be gone from here as soon as you can he swiveled the single lens back up into place tyranny nodded to scars the first mate reached for the leather cinch bag tied at his waist counted out a down payment of one hundred kisa and handed the coins over to jonah after slipping them into the pocket of his apron the shopkeeper looked back at tyranny with concerned eyes if you suffered three maelstroms you must also require sails then yes that may be a problem tyrannys face fell why she asked because a new arrival named ichabod is now the only sailmaker on the island jonah told her he paid hired thugs to kill the other two so as to have a little monopoly of his very own things have changed since you were last here tyranny there used to be at least some honor among thieves but ever since rolf took over all that has gone by the wayside rolf gets a cut not only of everything ichabod sells but from many of the other vendors here as well the likelihood of you getting your sails and leaving here without him knowing are slim at best tyrannys face hardened and she took a deep breath i have no choice where will we find this ichabod hes always at the wing and claw it seems he has become so prosperous that he can now hire others to do all of his work for him including watching over his shop jonah placed a caring hand on one of tyrannys cheeks be careful my child he warned ichabod is as slippery and devious as they come he would love nothing more than to cheat you tristan had a thought i think the two of you should stay here he said to tyranny and scars this ichabod doesnt know me we will have a much better chance of being successful if i go alone hoping for support he looked up at the shopkeeper jonah looked at tyranny do you trust him he asked yes then i think you should do as he suggests i know how much you like to handle your own affairs but this time it seems the wisest course tyranny turned to look tristan in the eyes as she did he gave her an encouraging look telling her it would be all right after a nod from his captain scars reluctantly handed tristan the leather purse and the list of required sails tristan handed the list over to jonah how much should i expect these to cost he asked jonah swiveled the single lens back down into place and perused the list four hundred kisa would be fair he mused but ichabod is not known for being a fair man make it five hundred for a rush job which this will have to be but under no circumstances should you pay more than six even to him he handed the list back to the prince is there enough money here tristan asked tyranny barely tyranny answered its all i have youd best leave half with me if you come to any agreement with him pay him a deposit only counting out three hundred tristan handed the rest back to her and tucked the purse into his vest stay here he said ill be back as soon as i can he looked over at jonah where do i find this wing and claw turn right on this street and keep on going jonah answered then his face puckered up with a look of distaste trust me you cant miss it reaching behind him tristan grasped the hilt of his dreggan and gave it a quick tug making sure its blade would not stick then he did the same with the first few of his throwing knives saying nothing more he turned and walked out of the shop but the moment he set foot on the street he heard the door open again and tyranny appeared she had a strange searching look on her face quickly putting her arms around him she gave him a surprising soft kiss on the mouth for luck she said tristan smiled back dont worry he said i want to get home too remember gently removing her hands from his shoulders he gave them a final squeeze then he turned and headed up the street as he walked he was increasingly hounded by whores barkers and thieves drunken men lay in the gutters while others stopped to rifle through their pockets the wing and claw was a large dilapidated building constructed of the ubiquitous rose marble the double doors in the front lay wide open a black wing had been boldly painted on one of them and a black claw on the other as if daring passersby to enter a rail stood just in front with about a dozen horses tied to it from inside came a combination of laughter music argument and clinking glass after first looking around he cautiously took the leather purse from his vest removing one hundred kisa he placed them into his pocket so that if he was required to make a deposit on the sails he could do so without revealing tyrannys remaining cache of coins with another quick look around he replaced the purse beneath his vest wasting no more time he walked up the marble steps and went in the moment he passed through the doors he knew he was in trouble chapter fortyone f aegan alone and desperately worried sat in the small boat by the shore the oppressive silence of the stone chamber only added to his anxiety ever since wigg and the watchwoman had disappeared into the tunnel faegan had been overtaken by a nearly crippling sense of dread a long time had passed since they had walked away and left him hereat least it felt like a long time here alone in this tomb of rock time had no meaning he looked back across the lake at the latticed floating gardens and the azure waters that flowed so peacefully down out of the wall above them such an amazing manifestation of the craft he thought but would wigg survive his ordeal so that they might finally go home and make use of the gardens secrets or would he never see his friend the lead wizard again faegan turned back to face the tunnel entrance and his sharp eyes finally caught some movement he froze it was the returning watchwoman in her outstretched arms she carried the body of the lead wizard faegans breath caught in his throat wiggs face was blanched and his arms dangled his head hung to one side his slack open mouth was flecked with foam faegan immediately levitated his chair over the side of the boat and came to sit before the watchwoman she laid wigg down in the sand before him your friend lives she said but barely he is one of the very few to have ever survived the psychic price demanded his regrets run deep but his heart and blood are of great goodness it was that goodness which sustained him through his travails faegan reached down to touch his friends cold forehead closing his eyes he called on the craft wiggs heartbeat was faint and his mind had gone deep faegan looked back up at the robed apparition will he recover his blood is strong she answered in time he should return to normalcy but his soul will forever wear the imprint of what happened to him this day raising her hand she indicated that faegan should levitate the lead wizard back into the boat he did so guiding wiggs body to lie on one of the seats then once faegan also entered the boat the watchwoman took up her place in the stern and used her staff to push the craft toward the opposite shore she beached the vessel near the floating gardens and then turned to him it is time to grant what you came for wizard she said calmly leave your friend here and follow me levitating his chair faegan followed her as she slowly climbed one of the stone paths that wound its way up and around the latticed glowing pools he could hardly contain his excitement at the mesmerizing sight every herb of the craft seemed to be represented here plus a great many that he had never seen before looking closer at the surface of one of the pools he saw such esoteric plants as muscle root gingercrinkle blossom of malcathion and even a smattering of the very rare everscent finally the watchwoman stopped her climb beside one of the largest of the glowing ponds faegan lowered his chair was all this left here by the ones he asked all things of magic are a direct result of either the ones or the heretics she answered simply or of what came even before themnamely the two glowing orbs of the craft the bright golden orb of the vigors and the dark sizzling orb of the vagaries forever power the twin but opposite sides of magic always attracting each other but never touching surely by now you have learned to call them into your presence and have witnessed their majesty and power nonetheless there remains much for you to learn not only of the craft but of those masters and their orbs who were here so long before you faegan bent over to study the pool and the items i require to separate my herbs roots blossoms and oilsare they here in this pool he asked there were several beautiful plants lying atop the water but despite his great knowledge he had to admit that he had never seen any of them before he could feel the water calling out to his endowed blood even as learned and disciplined as he was he found its allure intoxicating its entreaty irresistible his breath coming quickly his mind nearly overcome he let his hand creep closer to the pool stop you fool the watchwoman screamed just as his fingers were about to break the surface of the water with amazing speed and surprising strength she grabbed his wrist with her white lifeless hand stunned he looked up into the dark faceless hood whats wrong he asked thickly letting go of him she raised the bones of her hand directly before his eyes tell me wizard she said caustically how do you suppose i came to be this way do you wish to suffer the same fate and then he understood the azure waters here in the chambers of penitence were so powerful that they were literally toxic and eons ago her endowed blood had caused her to succumb to the same temptations he had just experienced she had paid for her mistake with the flesh of her hands perhaps even with that of her entire body and so the ones had somehow asked that she stay here for eternity to help safely guide other supplicants in their quests saddened for her and humiliated for himself he swallowed hard im sorry he said i didnt understand nor did i once she answered back for a few moments the only sound was the trickling of the water into the glowing pools this is indeed the pool that holds what you require she finally said but for obvious reasons it shall be neither you nor i who harvest it she raised both her staff and her free hand into the air come to me my pretties she ordered faegan heard a grating sound coming from the wall behind them as he turned to look he saw that one of the holes in the wall had stopped pouring forth its water and was widening dramatically until it was a full meter in diameter a bird popped its head out of the hole cautiously looked around and finally took to the air three more appeared and they began to circle overhead faegan watched spellbound he had never seen anything like them the multicolored birds glowed with the azure of magic their necks were long and graceful as were their wide brightly feathered tails they stood on long spindly legs like storks but their shiny bodies were more compact and their feet were webbed and yellow like those of a duck they had gullets beneath their long wide bills such as one might see on birds that lived near the ocean and fed on fish the watchwoman slowly lowered her hands as she did the creatures landed gently one by one next to faegans chair and stood there obediently as if waiting for the watchwoman to speak but she did not utter a word instead she pointed to the pool and the birds walked into it and began to swim carefully through the plants using their long wide bills to harvest leaves and flowers and stems faegan marveled at their quiet elegant efficiency reaching into her robe the watchwoman produced a glass vial with a hinged top opening it she handed it down to one of the birds the bird took it into its bill the open side of the vial facing away from its head then it dipped the vial into the water collecting the light green oil that lay in another part of the pool after a little while the birds made their way back out of the glowing pool and one by one came to drop their treasures at the wizards feet with a sure slow motion of its head the bird that had collected the oil put down the vial and shut the lid with its bill smiling broadly faegan looked back up at the watchwoman how is it that they are not affected by the waters as you were simple she replied they are a product of the ones placed here for just this purpose after my tragedy the ones conjured them and left them here to help me harvest the bounty of the floating gardens they have been my only companions ever since she then looked back at them and nodded one by one they took to the air and flew back through the hole in the wall the opening returned to its original size and water began spilling out from the hole once more faegan looked down at the treasures lying at his feet may i touch them now he asked no she answered they are still wet and are just as dangerous as ever the watchwoman reached into her robe again and removed a small azureglowing bag she opened it and held it wide before the wizard use your gift to place the plants and vial into this bag she told him it will protect your flesh from them until you arrive home it is also enchanted to absorb the water and render it harmless later you will be able to touch them i have cast a spell of accelerated drying over the herbs they will be usable soon hearing that such a remarkable spell existed faegan was almost overwhelmed by curiosity and the desire to learn but he managed to drag his attention back to the situation at hand doing as she bade him he focused on the plants and vial and using the craft caused them to levitate they slowly entered the bag and the watchwoman pulled the cinch tight she placed the bag on faegans lap thank you he said sincerely you have no idea how much you have just helped preserve the practice of the vigors your gratitude is not important now she said it is time for you to leave this place and make use of what i have given you do not fail and do not waste what you have been given there is only enough to make one attempt to separate your herbs and oils time is precious his mind racing faegan looked down at the bag and how do i use these gifts he asked first make sure the herbs have completely dried this will require several more days at least then grind them into a fine powder mix the powder deeply within your stores and watch from a distance before you do however make sure there are sufficient containers waiting nearby all will be revealed the oil however may be used to separate your other oils right away faegan looked at wigg who still lay unconscious in the boat given wiggs current condition i may not be able to levitate him all the way back to the surface he said thinking of the narrow confined stairway they had taken here the ones understood that anyone who was fortunate enough to survive this place would not possess the strength to leave on their own she said simply there is another way out she raised her arms light began to flood down from the ceiling forming a bright white circle on the floor of the chamber bring the other wizard with you into the light she said faegan placed the bag she had given him securely in his robe then he levitated wiggs inert body up to his lap and floated his chair into the circle of light as he did the white light turned to azure and his chair began to revolve what is happening he asked nervously you are departing the chamber of penitence she answered farewell wizard the chair revolved faster then rose into the air as it increased in speed faegan feared he would not be able to continue holding onto wigg using magic to augment his strength he held on as best he could as wiggs legs arms and robe went flying in circles with the dizzying disorienting revolutions of the chair looking up into the shaft of azure light faegan realized that it led all the way to the top to the fresh air and sunlight of the world above then the watchwoman raised her arms do not forget what i told you of the river of thought wizard she shouted from far below farewell faegan desperately wanted to ask her more but before he could the two wizards soared into the gleaming azure bolt of light and were gone part iv rebirth chapter fortytwo in a sense time has no place in the practice of the craft for to those who shall grant themselves the time enchantments sometimes a year shall seem as a day and a day as a mere moment and the forestallments granted into their blood shall give rise to great gifts some wondrous and some terrible in their applications from the scroll of the vigors a s tristan walked through the double doors of the wing and claw he stopped for a moment taking in the scene the room before him was very large and very dark lit only by several dim oil lamp chandeliers tables filled the room and a long bar sat before the wall to his right in one corner a stairway could be seen leading to the second floorto the bedrooms he assumed men and women were cavorting loudly some already in varying stages of undress were locked in passionate embraces others were busy drinking and playing at dice or cards the losers shouting out obscenities and invectives at the afterlife one man sat on a chair in the corner a pipe held between his teeth as he happily ground out ditties from an ancientlooking squeezebox the entire place smelled of sweat and stale liquor no one seemed to take any particular notice of tristan and for that he was grateful as casually as he could he walked up to the bar the oneeyed barkeep was a thin greasylooking creature who walked with a decisive limp where his other eye should have been there was only an empty hole crudely sewn shut with bits of leather the stitches looked as if they had been there for a long time forcing down his revulsion the prince looked steadily into the mans good blue eye ale he said simply dont got none the fellow said almost proudly why not tristan asked skeptically theyre drinking it on the street like i said dont got none the man repeated he smiled revealing the absence of two front teeth the same man who had taken the bartenders eye had probably gotten the teeth as well tristan thought then what do you have he asked mead the fellow answered simply as if it was something the prince should know simply because he was standing in the wing and claw produced special on the island and its all we sell here very well tristan said mead it is do you want the cheap stuff or the good stuff the bartender asked tristan reached into his pocket produced a single kisa and dropped it on top of the bar cheap he answered almost immediately questioning his decision greedily picking up the coin the bartender bit into it testing its worth apparently satisfied he walked down the length of the bar a bit and stopped before a great keg that sat atop it turning the spigot he released a dark amber substance into a tankard that looked as if it had just been dredged up off the floor of the sea of whispers he walked back and unceremoniously deposited the pungent concoction before the prince tristan took a swallow gagging he immediately spat it back out sure he was about to vomit he had had mead before but never any so vile as this after a fit of coughing he glared back up at the man behind the bar the fellow once again smiled displaying the dark vacancies between his remaining teeth takes a bit of gettin used to dont it he asked happily as the prince wiped his mouth he sensed someone beside him turning he found himself looking directly into the bloodshot blue eyes of a blond woman about his own age she wore a tattered dress and long earrings and smelled something like a musty abandoned candy shop smiling she inched a bit closer at the same time reaching down to touch his groin youre new here arentcha love she asked her hungry greedy eyes looked him up and down believe me if id been with you before id remember brazenly leaving her hand where it was she looked at tristans tankard then over at the bartender now caleb she admonished him still smiling dont tell me you served this fellow from the community keg the bartenders greasy perforated grin returned reaching down tristan moved her hand away he was almost afraid to ask the community keg he inquired amidst another short cough the blond pointed down the bar to the keg tristans drink had come from all of the mead from every partially drank tankard is saved and poured back into that barrel she explained then its aged good n proper and served as the cheaper stuff rolfhes the owner seehe doesnt let a drop go to waste ya see waste none want none nauseated tristan looked back into her eyes im not interested he said simply im looking for a man well why didntcha say so love she answered i can arrange that too but such a waste that is a fellow the likes of you not that kind of a man tristan answered im looking for ichabod the sailmaker i was told that he might be here the whore raised a tattooed arm hes sitting right over there she answered practically lives here now he does loves to play at cards and always seems to win you cant miss him handlebar mustache and expensive black clothes then she came closerso close that tristan could smell the stale mead on her breath and if you change your mind handsome ill be waiting quickly nodding his thanks tristan left both her and his tankard of mead and sauntered across the room he stopped short of reaching ichabod and sat down at an empty table nearby he wanted to watch and listen first hoping to form some idea of what the sailmaker might be like before trying to bargain with him ichabod was seated at a table with three other men playing a game of dreng a large pile of coins sat in the center and the game was very animated of the four players the biggest winner so far looked to be the sailmaker he was tall and dressed in black breeches jacket ruffled white shirt and vest rings adorned nearly every finger shiny black knee boots were on his feet and he sported an equally dark mustache that he worried almost constantly by twisting its curled waxed ends unlike the other men at the table ichabod looked very prosperous he also seemed to be unarmed but the prince knew that in a place like this that meant nothing tristan smiled to himself realizing that the sailmaker reminded him of a particularly unctuous eutracian undertaker he had once had the displeasure to know watching the game for a few moments tristan could see that ichabod was indeed a very accomplished player almost too good in fact then his eyes caught something else and he smiled to himself certain he had found his edge tristan walked casually over to the table to stand directly behind ichabod he looked down at the sailmakers hand then over at the values on the front sides of the cards being held by the others one of the other players glared angrily up at him then after looking tristan over went back to his cards any moment now one or more of them would most certainly object to his presence as the precious seconds ticked by tristan held his breath finally the moment came that the prince had been waiting for it was ichabods turn to play a card reaching down quickly tristan selected one of ichabods cards and threw it on the table amidst the others already lying there dreng he said quietly ichabod was up on his feet in no time as were two of the other players daggers drawn for a moment the entire place went silent as a tomb rife with tension all seventythree eyes in the tavern had fallen directly onto the man with the strange curved sword lying across his back and just who are you to be playing my cards for me you insolent bastard the sailmaker shouted a vein in his forehead beat noticeably he looked tristan over and his face screwed up at the sight of the princes unorthodox weapons im the one who just made you fifty kisa tristan replied calmly never taking his eyes from the sailmakers your king over the last players pageboy tristan gave the man a short conspiratorial smile that he hoped would soften things a bit i wont even ask you for half of the pot he added craftily all i want is a little of your time and now you can afford to give it to me sensing the possibility of a profit ichabod calmed a bit glancing back down at the table a short smile crossed his mouth dreng it is he said softly looking back over at the prince but thats not good enough who are you really and what do you want surely it isnt to give me card lessons ive never seen you before tell me true or ill have my friends here cut you from groin to gizzard with a dull deer antler and feed whats left to the sharks tristan looked over to the two glaring pirates who had so quickly risen from their chairs the light from the chandelier glinted off their weapons the fact that he had just cost each of them money had only added to their desire to act on ichabods grisly suggestion and he knew it but he stood his ground holding his own in the contest of wills im a prospective customer he told ichabod one with money to spend i need a rush job and im willing to pay extra for it is there someplace where we might speak in private thoughtfully rubbing his chin ichabod looked back at his friends with a decisive grunt he finally picked up his money and directed tristan to a table in the corner as the tavern slowly returned to normal the sailmaker came straight to the point i assume you have a list of your needs he asked tristan produced tyrannys list and handed it over this is a very big job ichabod mused you must have more than one ship in distress tristan nodded shortly almost rudely he didnt want much small talk for that might only trip him up we were attacked by screechlings he explained simply when do you need these by dawn ichabod tossed the list to the table these are unusually large and must be custommade not only that but you want them very quickly all of my people would have to put everything else aside and work straight through the night in order to accomplish this and that is going to cost you how much tristan asked holding his breath one thousand ichabod said confidently leaning back in his chair reaching up he began twirling one end of his mustache with his fingertips three hundred and you deliver them to my ships by dawn tristan countered ichabod scowled at tristan as if he had just descended from another world i dont even get out of bed in the morning for less than five four hundred then take it or leave it the prince said pushing his chair back with finality ichabod stood youre insane he said gruffly as he turned to go but before he could he found tristan had taken him by one wrist if you dont accept my offer here and now you will never be able to visit this place again tristan growled quietly in fact you may lose your life over it tell me is it really worth it bending over tristan reached down and stuck his hand into the surprised sailmakers right boot he pulled out several playing cards examined them closely and casually tossed them down onto the table what do you think will happen to you if i drag you back over to those men by your hair and show them what you keep in your boots whose friends do you think those drunken morons with the daggers will be then eh not to mention that you have been cheating your partners patrons right under his very nose and i seriously doubt youve been giving rolf a cutthats something he wont take kindly to tristans face turned as hard as granite now sit down before i cause you some real trouble still unimpressed ichabod gave tristan a confident arrogant glare go ahead and try he dared ill tell them the cards belong to you who do you think theyll believe tristan only smiled actually i think theyll believe me he said softly and just why is that because there is wax on the edges of these cards tristan answered casually as he grabbed one up from the table and held it before the sailmakers eyes the same as that on your mustache and in case you havent noticed im cleanshaven so tell me sailmaker now which of us is the insolent bastard ichabods face went white on trembling legs he searched absently behind himself finally finding his chair he sat down carefully four hundred you say he asked his voice breaking his tone had suddenly become far more agreeable four hundred tristan nodded far be it from me to swindle a card cheat and no deposit rather payment in full on delivery to my ships tomorrow at dawn youd best not cross me i wouldnt take it well where are you anchored the sailmaker asked on the eastern shore in the rocky cove just off the wooden docks do you know it yes then i will see you there at dawn tristan replied with the sails ichabods eyes narrowed a bit once you leave the wing and claw how do you know ill keep my end of the bargain reaching back tristan casually produced one of his throwing knives and held it to the chandelier the soft light glinted off the dirks razorsharp edges because if you dont ill come to you tomorrow night the prince said quietly sanctuary is a small island and ill find you no matter where you try to hide ill find you and ill cut you looking back down into ichabods eyes he smiled from groin to gizzard ichabod swallowed hard very well he said in a much smaller voice it shall be as you say remembering what tyranny had taught him tristan spat into his right palm and held it out after a moment ichabod followed suit and they shook hands the prince had been inordinately lucky he also knew that he should leave quickly before anything went awry but as he stood to go someone else entered the wing and claw someone he knew it was scars as might be expected the giants frame filled the doorway blocking out much of the afternoon sun but as tristan looked more carefully he saw that something was very wrong scars hands were tied behind his back and his face was bruised he was being prodded into the room by two leering pirates their sabers held to his back tristan froze trying to act as though he had never seen the colossus before his mind began to race scars and the pirates finally entered the tavern and slowly walked over to one side then from the sunlight beyond the doors tristan detected something standing there its silhouette dark against the afternoon sun it looked like a man but it had too many arms and legs to be a man and some of them werent where they were supposed to be then he saw the thing start to spin around and tyranny came flying through the air to crash into one of the nearby empty tables it collapsed beneath her and she went down hard dazed and hurt at first she seemed unable to get up tristan started to go to her but somehow her eyes found him in the crowd she gave him a short decisive shake of her head telling him to stay put understanding he fought down the impulse to help her and forced himself back down into his chair he heard boot heels on the clapboard sidewalk and a man walked arrogantly into the tavern striding over to tyranny he reached down and viciously grabbing a handful of her short hair wrenched her face up for everyone to see im looking for the other man who came into town with this he shouted it has come to my attention that there is another rooster in my henhouse reveal yourself whoever you are and ill let her live staring at the man with hatred tristans endowed blood began to rise hotly in his veins his hand closed automatically around the handle of his knife chapter fortythree t ell me wulfgar krassus asked are you comfortable the hard white marble table pressing against his back wulfgar looked around the scriptorium as best he could he and the wizard were alone he had been forced here by several of krassus demonslavers and they had tied down his hands and feet making it impossible for him to move he was naked save for a pair of emeraldgreen silk trousers his long sandy hair fell down over one edge of the table and stretched toward the floor as he lay there looking up into the smiling face of the wizard with the long white hair and the strange twocolored robe his heart beat wildly sweat born of fear poured maddeningly off his face and body craning his neck to one side he saw a partially unrolled scroll hovering in the air nearby it was magnificent and it glowed with the same strange blue color that he had seen come and go so often since being imprisoned here in the citadel what are you going to do to me he demanded straining against his bindings for what seemed the hundredth time krassus wiped the perspiration from his subjects brow it was almost as if he were a healer compassionately tending to a patient i am nothing if not a man of my word he said calmly im going to do exactly what i promised you that day in your quarters i shall introduce you to something wonderfulsomething that will change your life forever in the end you will thank me and before we are finished you will find yourself begging for more summoning all of the saliva he could wulfgar arched his back and spat it directly into the wizards face unperturbed krassus calmly wiped it away i will fight you you must know that wulfgar swore one day i will find tristan and shailiha and join them together we will kill youyou and all of these monsters that serve you exhausted he lay back down against the hard almost welcoming coolness of the stone of course you will fight me krassus said given the nature of your blood i would be very disappointed if you did not so will serena when her time comes but by then you wont want to kill the demonslavers wulfgar you will want to command them i am simply an intermediary doing my late masters bidding krassus turned to view the scroll i believe prudence dictates that we begin with one of the simpler forestallments he said casually although the process will not be pleasant it will have nowhere near the impact of some of the more powerful ones that will eventually follow but by then your unique blood will have adjusted when i finally deem you ready i will gift you with the one forestallment that will change the world foreverthe one my loyal consuls worked so hard to uncover in the scroll narrowing his eyes krassus called on the craft and a section of the beautifully elegant glowing text lifted itself from the scroll and came to hover before his dark eyes but just as it did krassus began to cough again taking his rag from his robes he covered his mouth his hacking went on unabated for some time it was becoming progressively worse he realized finally the convulsions subsided and he put the rag away now it was wulfgars turn to smile perhaps you will die before you can turn me wizard he said did your supreme master consider that before he departed of course krassus answered hoarsely but have no fear i shall easily live long enough to turn you perhaps even long enough to see you fulfill my masters plans what a glorious day that shall be now then shall we begin pointing an index finger at one of wulfgars arms krassus caused a small incision to form it immediately started to bleed reaching over to a nearby table the wizard retrieved a small glass vial with which he collected some of the blood then he closed the vial and caused it to glide back over to the table narrowing his eyes he watched the wound close the skin knit back together and the angry red scar disappear completely the wizard committed the glowing words and calculations hovering before him to memory with a smile he then placed one of his palms on wulfgars head wulfgar began to scream his body arched with exquisite pain drool ran from his mouth his body jangled mercilessly relentlessly against the cold white marble table sweat poured from him and at first krassus worried that wulfgars violent thrashing might break the bones of all his limbs but the wizard continued with the process of imbuing the first of many forestallments into wulfgars blood when krassus was done wulfgar had gone unconscious from the pain but he was still breathing pointing an index finger at wulfgars other arm the wizard caused another incision to form then ordered a single drop of blood to rise from the wound and come to rest on the table he picked up another container this one was filled with red waters taken from the caves of the paragon by nicholas and entrusted to krassus just before the son of the chosen one had died at the gates of dawn opening its top he released a single drop and watched it fall to the table landing next to the spot of wulfgars blood almost immediately the two beads of fluid began to move and join krassus pulled a scope closer and centered it directly over the freshly forming blood signature he held his breath and looked down the newly created forestallment in wulfgars blood signature was perfect looking further he found the other change he was hoping for wulfgars already leftleaning blood signature now tilted farther yet krassus heart leapt in his chest he had just proven in practice what nicholas had told him would work in theory that the forestallments inscribed so long ago on the scroll could still be correctly deciphered and imbued directly into the blood of the living looking up from the scope he gazed out one of the broad windows overlooking the sea of whispers as he did several realizations came to him failee wiggs deceased wife and onetime first mistress of the coven of sorceresses must have possessed and employed at least one of the scrolls of the ancients there was no other way that tristan and shailiha could possibly have obtained the forestallments in their blood even failee was not brilliant enough to have woven such wondrous aspects of the craft on her own and the same held true for celestes forestallments as well but the coven had not been in possession of the scrolls when wigg banished them to the sea of whispers so failee must have either discovered them in parthalon or hidden them somewhere in eutracia before leaving and then ordered her second mistress upon invasion of eutracia to return not only with the paragon and princess shailiha but with the scrolls as well but how had the scrolls found their way back to eutracia from parthalon he wondered how was it that they both eventually came to be in the possession of nicholas and perhaps most importantly how had failee come upon the scrolls in the first place then another even more fascinating realization hit him if failee had had only the scroll of the vagaries in her possession and if she gleaned from it the forestallments that she later placed into the blood of tristan and shailiha then all the stillunrealized gifts of the chosen ones would be of the darker side of the craft if she had had both scrolls would she even have used anything of the vigors if so why and what about those gifts in celestes blood would failee ever want her only daughters blood infused with anything remotely associated with the side of the craft that she professed to loathe his head spinning with questions and contradictions krassus looked down at wulfgars placid sleeping face he smiled to himself it didnt really matter if he found the answers he decided all that mattered was that he complete his masters mission before his disease took him to the afterlife closing his eyes he caused the glowing hovering calculations he had just employed to return to their places in the scroll then he selected another section of text and beckoned it to him after committing it to memory he placed his open palm back on wulfgars forehead wulfgars eyes snapped open his screaming went on long into the night chapter fortyfour h e will live faegan said with relief as he removed his hand from wiggs forehead he has been through a great deal and it was apparently very close his heart has been deeply strained as has his mind but i believe he will make a full recovery he said then faegan looked over at celeste abbey faegan celeste and shailiha were surrounding the lead wizards bed shailihas daughter morganna sat in an infants carriage newly made for her by shannon the short wigg lay sleeping the down covers pulled up to his shoulders his breathing was still labored and his face remained pale reaching out to touch her fathers face celeste found that his skin was cold as she withdrew her hand her eyes became shiny abbey and shailiha were no less worried the two wizards had been gone from the palace a long time and when the minions had finally landed in the courtyard with the litter the three women had run to meet them hoping for the best but what they had found was a stricken lead wizard and faegan frantic to have wigg cared for that had been several hours ago at one point wigg had opened his eyes looked at them briefly and then fallen back into a deep silent sleep once wigg had been put to bed faegan had told the others all he could of their amazing journey the bag of herbs and the vial of oil that had been taken from the floating gardens lay safely on a nearby table is it really true that you cannot use the herbs the watchwoman gave you until they have dried out shailiha asked as she rocked morgannas carriage with one hand the baby gave a soft coo the princess was very anxious for abbey to try to find her brother by way of the gazing flame there still had been no news from the flying minion patrols that stubbornly refused to give up looking for the prince or from the minion fleet that had supposedly left parthalon several days earlier under the joint command of geldon and traax but at least faegans stores of herbs and oils were now all here in tammerland rather than remaining in his mansion in shadowood just before leaving for the chambers of penitence faegan had ordered a contingent of minions to fly abbey celeste and shailiha back to shadowood to oversee the return of the goods abbey had been speechless at what she had seen there but she had taken it all in stride helping make sure that everything was packaged up and transported as ordered faegans stores now resided safely below ground level locked in one of the laboratories of the redoubt as he considered the princess question faegan turned to look at the bag and the vial then an unexpected smile crossed his lips and he turned his chair toward abbey tell me he asked the herbmistress can you effectively produce and employ a gazing flame through the exclusive use of oils rather than dried herbs taking a deep breath abbey searched her memory herbs work much better for that purpose she answered carefully that is why oils are rarely used for viewing there is one that will work but the results are often unclear the oil is called unction of scythegrass root and it is very rare do you know it smiling faegan nodded it awaits us in the redoubt mixed with the others i dont understand shailiha interjected i thought we had to wait for the herbs to dry no faegan answered the watchwoman told me that we could use the oil she gave me to separate the other oils right away smiling he looked around the room that being the case i therefore suggest we descend to the redoubt celeste turned her attention back to wigg i will stay here in case father awakens she said adamantly very well faegan agreed smiling at her thinking he turned to the princess i think the child should stay here with celeste he added i am not entirely sure what might happen best not to take any unnecessary chances he turned back to celeste if you need us you know where we will be he gazed down into the craggy face of the wizard who had risked everything for their cause sleep well my friend he said softly turning his chair away from the bed he wheeled himself over to the nearby table and placed the vial and the bag into his lap shailiha rolled the carriage over to celeste bending over she gave morganna a kiss goodbye the baby grabbed playfully at shailihas blond tresses causing her mother to cry out in mock consternation then the princess and abbey followed faegan out of the room they had a long way to go to get to the laboratory down numerous corridors they went the oil sconces on the walls surrendering a soft even glow the heels of the womens shoes ringing out crisply against the shiny marble floor faegan finally stopped before one of the seemingly innumerable doors of carved mahogany narrowing his eyes he called the craft and shailiha heard the lock in the door turn over once then twice more abbey opened the door and went through faegan and the princess following along behind her the massive carved door closed behind them heavily the laboratory looked as if it had not been used in some time it reminded shailiha of a teaching chamber complete with text and scrollfilled bookcases a long table near the far wall and rows of dusty mahogany desktopped chairs shailiha found herself smiling as she thought of days gone by when the room would have been filled with dozens of eager consuls listening to wigg or some other member of the directorate lecturing on some arcane topic of the craft faegan wheeled his chair over to the corner that held the bags of herbs and the vat of oils before attempting to use the goods obtained in the chambers of penitence it was vital that he employ his power of consummate recollection to recall exactly the instructions the watchwoman had given him he had to be supremely careful he knew for he would only have one chance of returning the oils to their previous states taking a deep breath he closed his eyes the watchwomans words came floating back to the surface of his consciousness faegan opened his eyes and looked around the room they would need many glass containers he realized after a good deal of searching the three of them finally found some in an abandoned cupboard but were forced to scour other nearby rooms to collect the rest it took some doing but when they were finished several hundred glass beakers stood in neat rows on one of the dusty abandoned tables beckoning the women to one side the wizard raised an arm and caused the heavy vat of mixed oils to rise and move through the air to land gently just behind the rows of waiting glassware he caused the hinged top of the vat to open exposing the oils within then wheeled his chair to the opposite side of the room indicating that abbey and shailiha should join him what happens now shailiha asked in a hushed tone as if her voice might somehow upset things now i am to mix the oil from the floating gardens with those in the vat faegan answered softly he pursed his lips after that even i do not know what will occur so stay alert raising an arm again the wizard caused the vial in his lap to rise into the air and float directly above the open vat the vial opened and slowly poured its contents into the mixture of other oils shailiha held her breath precious seconds ticked by but nothing happened then the entire vat took on the azure glow of the craft and began to revolve at first its movements were slow and gentle as if some unseen force were trying to stir its contents but soon it was rocking violently spinning on the edge of its bottom occasionally leaving the surface of the table faegans eyes went wide with worry that the vat might spill rendering his oils forever unusable there came a great howling noise and the contents of the vat rose into the air in a whirling multicolored maelstrom of oil on and on it came until all of it had cleared the vat free of its container it spun faster yet then centrifugal force began forcing the oil to fly outward gradually separating into individual pools that hovered just above the lips of the glassware finally the howling stopped and the oil pools poured themselves into the various containers all at once then things went silent the oils settling into their containers and finally growing still but surprisingly the vat began to shake again as it did elegant glowing letters rose from it snaking their way up in a column like smoke rising from a campfire on and on they came separating into groups each group finally collecting itself before one of the various beakers then the groups of letters began to swirl rearranging themselves into old eutracian words that landed on the sides of the glassware the azure glow finally departed stunned faegan wheeled himself over to the table abbey and shailiha followed him it was a very rare thing to see the master wizard surprised but he was clearly awestruck by what had just occurred he picked up one after another of the full beakers and slowly examined them after reading each of the labels he would hold the beaker to the light then carefully smell its contents after randomly regarding about a dozen of them he let go a happy cackle and gleefully slammed one hand down on one arm of his chair in a display of pure joy he levitated his chair a bit then spun it around in the air weve done it he shouted the oils have been separated and labeled this is unprecedented had i been forced to use the equalizing spoons the hue harmonizer and the chart of herbal hues this task could have taken a lifetime what we have just witnessed will change herbmastery forever shailiha was pleased that faegan was so impressed but her overriding concern was still the search for her brother can abbey now use the oil you mentioned to look for tristan she asked eagerly yes yes of course faegan answered absently almost as if he had forgotten the real reason why they had just gone through all of this wheeling his chair up and down the rows of beakers he began searching for one labeled unction of scythegrass root after a good bit of searching he finally gave another cackle and held up a beaker that contained a dark violet oil this must be it he said he held it carefully to the light then took a long expert sniff after a moment he grinned broadly unction of scythegrass all right he announced happily id bet my life on it he looked back at the two women now we go up to the courtyard and taking the precious oil he led the way back up through the labyrinthine passages of the redoubt once in the open expanse of the courtyard faegan turned to abbey a drop of shailihas blood should work shouldnt it he asked her abbey nodded faegan turned to shailiha please hold out one hand he said she immediately did so pointing an index finger toward her he caused a tiny pinprick to form and a single drop of her blood was released it rose from her finger and came to hover before them in the stillness of the late afternoon air satisfied faegan handed the beaker of violet oil to abbey you may begin he said after pouring a small amount of the oil onto the ground abbey produced flint and steel from one of the pockets of her dress as she struck them together the resulting spark launched itself obediently toward the pool of oil and a small flame erupted after releasing a few more drops of the precious oil down into the flame she stood back using her gift to force the azure fire higher and higher when it was at last about two meters wide and five meters tall she crooked one finger causing the flame to divide into two distinct but unequalsized branches curling her finger again she pointed to the right and the smaller of the two flames flattened itself out coming dangerously close to scorching her hands and her face reaching into the air she collected the single drop of shailihas blood onto one of her fingertips and held it high a rectangular window began to form midway up the body of the undulating blaze hoping against hope shailiha came as close to it as she dared trying to see what was forming within its midst equally mesmerized faegan wheeled his chair nearer at first shailiha thought she could see tristan sitting in a chair and surrounded by other men and women but the view was maddeningly fuzzy she turned to look at the herbmistress as she did the suddenly terrified look on abbeys face told her that something had just gone horribly dangerously wrong for a moment shailiha saw the herbmistress turn her eyes from her creation to look strangely at the princess then she immediately gazed back at her flame her mouth open with horror and gestured at the blaze as if she were desperately trying to change something about it then as if in slow motion she used every bit of her strength to turn and lunge at the wizard and the princess knocking shailiha down and sending faegans chair tumbling over backward amidst a great thunderclap of heat and fire abbeys gazing flame exploded chapter fortyfive s itting next to the sailmaker with the deafening palpable tension of the wing and claw raining down around him tristan felt his heart racing horrified he helplessly watched the man he assumed to be rolf pull even harder on tyrannys hair in an effort to force the prince to reveal himself even though she refused to cry out tristan could see that she was in desperate pain and there was nothing that scars could do to help her if the three of them were to somehow survive this it would be completely up to tristan tyrannys former lover was everything tyranny and scars had said he would be he was tall hardmuscled and somewhat older than the princeperhaps thirtyfive seasons of new life sandy blond hair fell haphazardly down around his face and shoulders part of it was woven into two narrow tight braids that hung alongside the left jaw their ends capped with small onyx ornaments his dark blue eyes were hard and unforgiving he wore a bright red sleeveless shirt tightfitting tan breeches black knee boots and a bright red sash around his waist numerous tattoos and scars could be seen on his chest and his chiseled arms at his left hip he wore a saber an empty dagger sheath was at his right tied down to his thigh come forward now rolf screamed again yanking tyrannys face a bit higher tristan saw tyranny wince then close her eyes against the pain remembering the piece of ancient vellum still hidden in his boot an idea came to tristan he stood up roughly pushing his chair out of the way the chair legs screeched loudly on the floor everyone turned to look at the tall darkhaired man with the strange weapons lying across his back his eyes never leaving rolf tristan slowly replaced his throwing knife into its quiver opened his hands to show they were empty and started across the floor as he did many in the crowd smiled greedily they were sure someone was about to die and their money was on rolf coming to stand before the pirate tristan looked hard into his eyes let her go he said shes with me now looking tristan up and down rolf let go a derisive laugh my men in the street said ya wore a black vest and carried childish lookin weapons but they forgot to mention how ugly yare he said tristan immediately recognized his accent as coming from the eutracian highlands just north of ilendium they also told me that they saw tyranny kissin ya in the street rolf went on so who are ya then i would surely like to know before i order the men in this room to tear yapart then the lass and i would like to be alone rolf smiled wickedly it seems she and i have some catchin up to do steeling himself tristan decided to take his gamble he put a snide look on his face then pointed down at tyranny this bitch and that idiot giant of hers are my partners now and i want them back tristan held his breath praying that neither tyranny nor scars would say anything they remained silent whats that ya say rolf demanded screwing his face up and just how did all this come about the same way everything does tristan said calmly playing up to the pirates greed he took another step forward i promised to pay for her knowledge and her ships she and the giant work for me now oh they work for ya is it rolf asked sarcastically just why should i believe all of this rubbishnot that it matters and out of idle curiosity just how much did ya supposedly promise to pay eh it would take a fine price indeed for tyranny to give up her ships even if she did steal them from someone else smiling he looked down at her painstricken face isnt that right lass he asked her nastily then he turned his dark blue eyes back up to the prince tristan smiled at him i paid one hundred thousand kisa he answered calmly the moment the words left his mouth he heard a hush come over the crowd if you dont believe me just ask her for the promissory note i signed he added she always keeps it hidden between her breasts holding his breath he hoped against hope that is was still there rolf looked narrowly at the prince then finally let go of tyrannys hair bending over he grabbed her under one arm and roughly pulled her to her feet is this true he demanded confused uncertain what tristan was doing she reached into her jacket and pulled out the note the two of them had signed that day in her cabin she handed it over to rolf upon reading it the color drained from rolfs face for a moment clearly he was intrigued but his knife remained steadily at tyrannys throat and just why would a man of your means want to be out there on the ocean eh he asked or in a place the likes of sanctuary the answer is simple tristan said she and i have each lost a brother to the demonslavers we want to find them she had the ships and i had the money even you ought to be able to understand that you dumb bastard a slight chuckle came from the crowd few had ever insulted rolf that way and lived to tell about it smiling greedily tristan let the insult stand hoping that he hadnt just succeeded in getting the three of them killed a tense silence held court for several moments rolf turned back to tyranny and just where is this money now he asked so far the greedy pirate was doing exactly as tristan had hoped he would im the only one who knows tristan said quickly before tyranny could speak its hidden buried on the coast of eutracia tyranny has seen itthat was necessary to prove that i actually had it but before i paid her i wanted a first voyage to see what she could do against the slavers thats why i signed the note before we set sail i moved the money making sure i was the only one who knew the location but soon after entering these waters we were attacked by screechlings and we had to dock here for fresh spars and sail do you really think we would be here in this dirty hole unless we needed to be rolf looked narrowly at the prince then cast his eyes down at the note this twentysecond day of the season of new life i promise to pay teresa of the house of welborne one hundred thousand kisa upon the successful completion of this voyage at the bottom of the page lay two signatures one belonged to tyranny and the other was the false name tristan had signed that day in her cabin when they had struck their original bargain his knife still at tyrannys throat rolf looked back up at the prince assuming what you say is true whats to stop me from simply torturing the location out of you rolf demanded you could but how would you know i was telling you the truth tristan countered as i said im the only one who knows and after you sailed me to the coast to prove it i could lead you all over looking for it perhaps even escape in the process kill me and youll never know torture me and you cant be sure thats no way to find it now is it he paused for a moment allowing the pirates greed and curiosity to build but given my situation im agreeable to letting you have the money in return for my spars and sails safe passage away from sanctuary and my ships and crews he offered gamely then he looked over at tyranny he knew that what he was about to say would hurt her but if this was going to work it had to be done ill even sweeten the deal by letting you keep the girl he added the longer im around her the less she appeals to me anyway someone should tell her that she dresses too much like a man but i find the giant useful give him back to me and ill be gone agree to my terms and you win in every way im gone from here and the money and the woman are both yours believing she had been betrayed tyrannys eyes became hard with hate then scars spoke up you liar he snarled pulling frantically at his bonds from the first moment i saw you i knew you couldnt be trusted the first chance i get ill kill you good tristan thought even scars believed him assuming i agree just what proof do i have that the location you give me is real rolf asked skeptically tristans heart leapt the moment he had been waiting for had finally come taking a breath he tried to calm himself then took another step closer i have a map he said i drew it for myself right after i buried the moneybags on the coast one key to the location is on the map and the other key is in my head neither part is any good without the other your proof will be that what i whisper to you will connect up what is drawn on the map with tristans mention of a map rolfs eyes lit up with greed even the crowd seemed mesmerized by the strangers tale and they inched eagerly closer and after you tell me what makes you so sure ill live up to my end of the bargain rolf asked skeptically tristan put a look of concern on his face look around the room he said i dont have many friends here and i want to live what other choice do i have rolf smiled none he answered none at all he greedily looked at tyranny relishing the things he would do to her body after this foolish rich man standing before him had told him all of his secrets he would then happily kill him just to watch him die very well rolf answered i agree where is the map tristan shook his head first i tell you he beckoned the pirate closer rolf finally lowered his knife tristan came closer and said a few words that tyranny couldnt hear rolf nodded then smiled and now the map rolf demanded tristan reached into his right boot the parchment was wrapped around the handle of the brain hook just as he had left it losing it to rolf was a terrible risk but he had no other choice with a single sure stroke he pulled them both out and slammed the pearl handle of the stiletto into rolfs jaw rendering him unconscious rolfs knife went clattering to the floor in a flash tristan was behind the pirate holding him upright his blade at rolfs throat several of the other pirates from the crowd had already come to their feet weapons drawn there was no time to lose tristan knew what he said and did in the next few moments would surely determine whether he tyranny and scars lived or died stay where you are or ill cut his throat he shouted praying that none of them would come any closer why should we care one of the ones in front shouted back several of them inched forward menacingly because i am willing to cut you all in on the money tristan shouted smiling he looked out into the crowd even the whores tell me do you think rolf would ever have done that and rolf now carries part of the location inside his head if you try to kill me and i kill him before you do youll still have only half of what you need to find the money he is worth far more to you alive than dead now back off greed won out and some of the men lowered their weapons slightly tristan looked at the two men still holding their sabers to scars back let him go or rolf dies do it now after looking skeptically at each other they cut scars bonds but what happened next surprised even tristan scars whirled on the first of them pulled the saber from his hands and then lifted him over his head to send him crashing down on top of the other one tyranny wasted no time either grabbing up one of the discarded sabers she was at the princes side in a flash now what rich man the pirate in front shouted at him it was clear they were nearing the end of their patience you let the three of us go and as a precaution against your doing anything stupid rolf comes with us tristan ordered i will give you the map tomorrow at dawn after you deliver my spars and sails to me dont worryour ships are in no condition to sail very far without what we need if they had been we would never have come here finding the swindling sailmaker in the crowd tristan nodded at him ichabod the sailmaker knows where we are moored he shouted after what we need has been delivered and we have been given time to make our repairs we are also to be given at least a halfdays start if we are followed rolf dies and your dreams of wealth die with him if we are not followed i will set rolf adrift in a small skiff along with the map and then you shall have both parts of the location and can do whatever you want with himeven kill him for all i care all the more for you but mark my wordsif you try to doublecross us or take us prisoner not only will i kill rolf myself but i will also destroy the map at that point i would have nothing more to lose and you will have lost the chance of a lifetime pausing tristan looked hard into the crowd before speaking again take it or leave it he said with finality greedy and confused the pirates started shouting angrily among themselves tristan waited and watched desperately hoping his gamble would pay off i says we take him up on his offer a woman shouted her voice rising above the din she had climbed up on one of the tables and was gesturing wildly with her arms looking closer tristan saw that she was the whore who had propositioned him at the bar what have we got to lose except for these three she went on and we might just make a bloomin fortune that sounds like a good bargain where i come from i say we let them go and see what happens tristan smiled and shook his head slightly it seemed the whore had done him some good after all but at the same time he realized that they needed to take quick advantage of the crowds hesitancy if they were ever going to get out in one piece there were flaws in his story and allowing the pirates time to think things through was certainly not to his advantage looking over at scars tristan nodded toward the door and scars nodded back reaching down as best he could tristan stuffed the brain hook and vellum back into his boot and began dragging rolf out by his heels the dangerous unsure crowd inched forward a bit more but no one made a move to stop him once through the door scars came quickly to tristans side and relieved him of rolf as though rolf weighed nothing the giant tossed him over the front of the saddle of one of the horses tied outside the inn then freed the reins and mounted tyranny and tristan untied two other horses jumped into the saddles and wheeled them around as they charged away tristan looked over at tyranny and she smiled at him warily turning to look behind him tristan finally smiled as well for the moment no one was following chapter fortysix m arcus shifted his weight against the corner of the building as he watched the sun begin to set over the plaza of fallen heroes it was that special indescribable hour of metamorphosis when the sky was just starting to change from the turquoise of day to the indigo of twilight then the blackness of a fullfledged night would cover everything the stars peeking out from their distant hiding places in the heavens marcus let out an exasperated breath he had been waiting here for the last two hours and he had more than one problem on his mind as he looked around the hundredth time for a suitable victim his stomach growled reminding him of how long it had been since he had last eaten rebecca waited for him at home in the dilapidated shack she was by now no doubt as hungry as he was for theyd consumed the last of their food early this morning pursing his lips he thought of her alone with the scroll that lay buried beneath the single shabby cot becca must be terrified he realized she always was whenever she was left on her own with the strange wondrous artifact he only hoped that it had not started glowing again while he was gone marcus had come back to the plaza for two reasons one was to find a suitable mark whose pocket he could pick the second was to tell mr worth that they had a deal for the scroll at thirteen thousand kisa the amount they had agreed upon two days earlier he assumed worth would still want the scroll but a delivery date had yet to be established and he needed money to feed himself and rebecca until then he looked across the street to worths storefront it was a fairly nondescript place with a glass front and a sign over the door that read artifacts of the craftall items guaranteed authentic several patrons had left the shop this afternoon cradling their new possessions as though they had just purchased the greatest wonders of the known world marcus had smiled at them with rueful skepticism as they rushed home with their supposed treasures over the course of the last two days he had found and approached two other parties regarding the scroll but he had not trusted them the way he had worth he couldnt put his finger on it but for some reason he felt that the fat ruddyfaced artifacts dealer was for the most part honest while his encounters with the other two had sent a chill up his spinea warning he always heeded deciding his game was fast becoming too dangerous he had returned to confirm the deal with worth as he looked up the street again he thought he saw a suitable candidate for pickpocketing as his target exited a clothing shop several doors down the street marcus casually shifted his weight away from the wall and began walking directly toward him the man was well dressed and was still counting his coins as he walked out of the shop his purchases in one hand his money in the other unbelievably foolish marcus thought he had been taught never to exit a place with money still in his hands not only could everyone see how much he had but they could also see which pocket he deposited it in slowing down marcus watched as the fellow stuffed his coins into the right inside pocket of his waistcoat perfect he thought squaring his shoulders a bit in order to maximize the impact marcus hurried his pace again and walked directly into his mark as the man twisted in an effort to maintain his balance his coat flew open one of marcus hands slipped in and out in a flash then straight down toward the top of his right boot to let the coins fall into it watch where youre going you fool the man shouted angrily as he juggled his packages after giving the man a quick seemingly embarrassed nod of regret marcus gracefully stepped around him and kept on going but he only took a few carefully measured steps before darting across the street and into worths shop looking out one of the windows he smiled the man he had just robbed was turning the far corner completely ignorant of how much poorer he had just become judging by the weight in his boot marcus had done very well he turned back to look over the shop the place was filled with arcane objects some of which looked very old mr worth was standing in the back talking politely to a prosperouslooking man and woman marcus walked closer when worth saw him his face lit up and he almost choked on his words after taking care of the couple worth hurriedly walked them to the door locked it and then turned its sign around indicating that the store was closed then he drew the drapes across the windows and walked back over to where marcus was standing a hopeful look crowding in around the edges of his face youre back he breathed excitedly i thought i might never see you again reaching up he nervously worried one end of his white mustache marcus tried to display his best look of indifference the scroll shall be yours he said for the thirteen thousand kisa that we agreed upon do we still have a deal holding his breath marcus prayed that the shopkeeper hadnt changed his mind oh yes worth exclaimed ecstatically he was fairly bursting with joy yes indeed but i will need three days to get the money together marcus narrowed his eyes he didnt like the sound of this he had hoped to finish his dealings with worth as soon as tomorrow and be done with the scroll forever he looked skeptically up into worths dark eyes worth seemed even more nervous now than the first time they had met and if he wanted the scroll as badly as he said then why didnt he already have the money ready marcus wondered or did he really have that kind of money at all a cold sense of dread shot through him why the three days he asked i thought you were in a hurry to own the scroll in order to pay you i must liquidate my entire stock worth replied nervously i have talked to two other artifacts dealers and they agreed to buy me out lock stock and barrel but it will take three days to accomplish the transaction then i can meet you wherever you choose marcus thought for a moment then finally decided that what worth was telling him made some sort of sense very well he said finally meet me at midday in the same spot where we talked before near the stand where the old lady sells the throat larks to release do you remember worth nodded place the kisa into bags and tie the bags onto a saddled horse marcus added ill be moving fast so follow my instructions to the letter or the deal is off my sister will be watching you so dont try anything stupid if i receive the wrong signal from her ill leave with the scroll and youll never see me again he looked as hard into worths eyes as he dared i understand completely worth answered quickly everything shall be as you say nodding marcus started toward the door then he paused and turned around smoothly pulling the knife from his trousers he touched the button on its handle it sprang open with a discernible click dont let my age fool you he said sternly if you do anything to try to cheat me ill find you again and youll be forever sorry worth nodded walking the rest of the way to the door marcus unlocked it and let himself out back on the street night had fallen in earnest blessedly he saw no sign of the man he had robbed so he walked into the nearest alley pulled off his boot and counted the coins ten kisa easily enough to keep them in food until the day he sold the scroll happily putting his boot back on he placed the coins into his pocket and made straight for the farmers market there might even be enough left over to buy one of the sweet cakes his sister loved so much he smiled becca would be pleased f rom behind a curtain in the back of the shop two figures came forward the one painted like a harlequin pulled his dagger from its scabbard and casually placed its razorsharp tip up against one of worths rosy plump cheeks the old woman stood next to him clearly enjoying the anguish that the artifacts dealer was experiencing well done janus said you have him completely fooled keep doing as i tell you and you just might live through this why dont you just follow him and take the scroll worth asked nervously why do you still need me janus pointed his dagger toward the door marcus had just gone through despite his early years that one is exceedingly clever he answered he has probably lived his entire life on the street and would surely realize he was being followed i should know for i was once just like him should he suddenly understand that he is being pursued he would run and we might lose him forever no better to let him come to us willingly i am agreeable to letting you take your three days to raise the money that adds a sense of wellneeded reality to our little game dont you think besides the boy is smart enough to want to check the contents of your moneybags so youd best have them full when the time comes and then i will keep your kisa for myself when this is all over im sure my master will not mind since he is well beyond such mundane desires he may well even compliment me on my ingenuity janus smiled menacingly as he did the red mask crinkled up at the corners and then once i have both the scroll and the money those troublesome children shall die howhow did you find me worth asked his voice trembling the bizarre man and woman had walked into his shop yesterday and threatened to kill him on the spot since then worth had lived in fear of his life hoping desperately that marcus would return janus smiled with the craft of course you need not know the details terrified all worth could do was nod janus ordered worth and grizelda back toward the curtain and let it close silently behind them chapter fortyseven g eldon felt the sharp sea wind running through his hair as he stood at the bow of the savage scar the flagship of the minion fleet more than two hundred other such ships sailed with her through the restless sea of whispers the sky was darkening and the three rosecolored moons had just risen bathing the frothtipped waves in their glow as the hunchbacked dwarf swayed back and forth with the rhythmic rocking of the vessel he looked out across the sea and was again reminded of how much had changed since the chosen one and the lead wizard had first come to his home nation of parthalon there were still so many troubles that would have to be surmounted if eutracia parthalon and the people he cared so much about were ever to find true peace reaching up to his throat he touched the place where he had been forced to wear the jeweled iron collar of succiu second mistress of the coven of sorceresses then a short smile passed his lips he owed not only his freedom but his very life to wigg and tristan and he would do anything they asked of him right now that meant seeing the minion fleet safely to eutracia nearly three weeks had gone by since the wizards had sent him through faegans portal to parthalon their orders had been explicit the fleet was to leave their moorings at eyrie point immediately carrying as many of the minion warriors as they could hold on the way back they were to fan out and search for any sign of tristan with so many ships and warriors at his disposal geldon could scour large sections of the ocean at a time even so he was enough of a realist to know that they had in fact searched only a small fraction of the sea of whispers and it troubled his heart to think that he might never see the prince again the trip so far had been horrific several days earlier they had been forced to sail through the area of the sea controlled by the necrophagians the beings also known as the eaters of the dead knowing that there was no choice wigg and faegan had reluctantly granted permission for the minions to engage in a shipboard battle to the death an activity guaranteed to provide the forty fresh corpses required to appease the necrophagians and gain permission to cross these waters after the battle in place of the usual minion tradition of the burning of the dead traax had ordered a short period of respectful mourning then the corpses had been lowered over the side to be consumed by the horrible faces that came rising hungrily to the surface of the waves the noise and gore that followed had been terrible geldon had been unable to watch the oncemagnificent warriors consumed by the everravenous circling maws that prowled the surface of the sea but at last the necrophagians sated for the time being had disappeared beneath the waves and the ship had been allowed to proceed with its voyage geldon wondered whether they would ever know just who the necrophagians were or why they existed here in the midst of this harsh cold ocean sighing he shifted his weight on the barrel he was standing upon placed his hands on the gunwale and gazed out again at the everchanging sea he felt as much as saw traax quietly come to stand by his side for a time neither of them spoke from the corner of his eye geldon suddenly saw a fleeting shadow cross the deck then came another and yet another glancing up he saw the returning squadron of minion warriors carefully circle the savage scar then land lightly on the ships decks they looked forlorn their wings drooping down tiredly seeing this he frowned another unsuccessful search he surmised he watched as the warrior leading this particular group gathered himself up snapping his wings into place behind his back before he approached when he reached them the warrior bowed the heels of his black boots coming together with a crisp automatic snap your report traax asked two more ships were boarded and searched sir the warrior answered tiredly i am sorry to report that they revealed nothing and neither of them were slavers very well traax answered it was clear by the look on the minion commanders face that he was disappointed traax had fought bravely beside tristan in the skies over eutracia just before the collapse of the gates of dawn and the two men now respected each other greatly added to this was the fact that tristan was his sworn liege and so it was traaxs duty to do everything within his power to find him how many more groups still search the sky tonight he asked the warrior just one sir the officer replied but i respectfully suggest that no more be sent out until dawn heavy clouds are rolling in from the west making the surface of the sea difficult to observe it was only by luck that we were able to find the fleet again traax nodded his understanding his face darkening a bit more you are dismissed he said simply with another click of his heels the warrior walked away to take advantage of some welldeserved rest traax turned back to look at geldon our search continues to go poorly he said to the dwarf the chosen ones wizards will not be pleased i know geldon answered equally dejected we are now just a bit more than two days from the coast the farther west we sail the less likely we are to find the prince but orders are orders saying nothing more he turned back to the sea and again cast his eyes out over the waves traax too remained silent lost in his own maze of concerns the silence was broken by the return of the last of the nights minion search squadrons coming to land on the deck at first glance these warriors seemed even more exhausted than the previous group had been but then geldon could see that they were talking animatedly among themselves they looked almost happy in fact the officer in charge hurried up to geldon and traax and bowed clicking his heels his name was kjarr and he was one of the finest longdistance fliers in the minion force geldon found himself holding his breath in anticipation speak traax ordered quickly do you have word of the prince regrettably no sir kjarr answered but we have discovered something else that might be of use to us in our search and that is kjarr smiled we found a small patch of fog it is less than a twohour flight southsouthwest from the fleets current position at first traax seemed annoyed by what he viewed to be an inconsequential find and this is important because he said exercising his considerable authority as he allowed his words to trail off its nature is highly unusual the officer answered it does not ebb and flow with the winds as one would expect instead it just stays in one place constantly somehow always retaining its shape then after about an hour of high surveillance we began to observe the ships geldons eyes lit up what ships he asked eagerly a great many vessels came and went from within the depths of the fog kjarr replied it is difficult to say for sure but to me they looked like fighting ships it seemed they were preparing for something we continued to circle high above using the clouds for cover i doubt that we were observed instead of soaring down to investigate further i thought it best to bring the squad directly back so as to give you my report as soon as possible after nodding his approval to the officer traax turned questioning eyes toward geldon does any of this mean anything to you he asked urgently no the dwarf answered but if ships are coming and going from the midst of this unlikely haze there must surely be more to it than meets the eye if it truly does not move then it is probably some manifestation of the craft magic is afoot exactly traax answered with a menacing grin it was the first time geldon had seen him smile since tristan disappeared do you think your wizards would mind very much if we made a small detour he asked conspiratorially geldon thought for a moment im not sure he answered but were about to anyway he looked back at the officer who had just given them the mysterious news give the heading to the helmsman and tell him to make the appropriate course change he ordered we are going to investigate this immovable fog bank of yours how long do you think it will take the fleet to reach it if the winds hold we should be there by dawn kjarr answered perhaps sooner very well geldon said go now the officer bowed to both of them and clicked his heels together then left tomorrow should prove to be a most interesting day traax said quietly taking a deep breath geldon looked back into the minions intelligent hazel eyes and so it shall he agreed neither of them fully realized just how meaningful traaxs observation was about to become chapter fortyeight s erena was worried wulfgar had changed not so much that she did not continue to love him and not in any way that made her fear for her safety if anything he seemed to love her even more but he was more commanding more sure of himself more discerning in his thoughts and actions than she had ever seen plus he seemed to have an even greater desire to be free of the confines of his quarters he would often stand and stare at the restless sea for hours saying nothing and then without a seconds warning he would begin pacing the rooms like a caged predatory animal eager to be released on an unsuspecting world more than once she had asked him what was preoccupying him so but somehow he never answered her distracting her instead with a kiss or by bringing up a different subject since she had come to wulfgars quarters to live he had been taken away by the demonslavers twice and it was only since then that she had begun to notice the changes in him she was sure his visits outside of these rooms were the cause of his strange metamorphosis but she was at a loss as to why and how as he continued to pace back and forth before the azure window that krassus had created serena realized that it was as if wulfgar had been suddenly involuntarily thrust into something far larger than himself and was being inexorably carried away upon the swelling rise of its tide what is it my love she asked gently what troubles you so he stopped for a moment and turned to her a short smile on his lips reaching down he gently stroked one of her cheeks with the back of his hand she took his hand into her own and pressed it closer never wanting to let it go lifting her face she looked into his eyes wulfgars eyes had always been beautiful hazel compassionate and strong they had been one of the first things that had attracted her to him but since his two mysterious visits to the outside they seemed literally to shine as if they had been shot full of energy that was waiting to be released they were mesmerizing and she quickly found herself lost within their polished depths there is nothing wrong my darling he answered softly everything is finally starting to become as it should be as it was foretold it would be only during my last few sessions with krassus have i finally come to understand there is much to tell what do you mean she asked still pressing his hand to her cheek sitting down beside her he looked lovingly into her eyes you are to become my queen he said simply his words passed though her heart like a sudden storm stunned she searched his face but you are not a king she answered gently not wanting to hurt him she was surely honored by his words and wanted to be with him forever but a queen i dont understand she said finally letting go of his hand as she did she found that her own hands were now trembling i know he answered at first neither did i but krassus has begun to show me the way i no longer fear him or his demonslavers in fact i now embrace them just as you soon will realizing that she was curious he turned his right wrist over and narrowed his eyes as he did a small puncture formed in his skin stunned and frightened serena instinctively pulled back but wulfgar only smiled tacitly telling her that it was going to be all right he then turned his wrist over again and a single drop of his blood fell to the silk bedsheets as she watched serenas eyes went wide the blood twisted its way into a small pattern with curved lines on the top and straight angular lines on the bottom it also had many smaller lines leading away from it like branches shooting off from the trunk of a tree it seemed to stir something within hersomething long hidden and immensely powerful she looked back up at him a thousand unanswered questions on her face wulfgar pointed down at the bloody signature within that pattern lies the source of all that there is and all that shall ever be he said quietly endowed blood looking at the brand on her shoulder he rubbed his fingers across it rtalis blood he added softly the blood you carry as well he then allowed silence to speak for a time as he sensed her trying to absorb the gravity of his words but how is it that you see yourself a king she finally asked smiling he took one of her dark ringlets into his hand and stroked it gently each time i leave this place i come one step closer to claiming my throne he answered cryptically just as you shall soon do for such a seat awaits you also all you have to do is reach out and take it as i am doing lost in his thoughts for a moment he looked away i have seen such wonders serena suddenly a knock came on the door it was almost hesitant as if the person on the other side did not wish to disturb them but must smiling wulfgar turned enter he commanded serena heard the bolt slide away the huge double doors opened and a single demonslaver entered the room remarkably he was unarmed then the slaver did something she would never forget looking at wulfgar the monster bowed yes wulfgar asked please forgive the intrusion but it is once again time the slaver said simply he asks for you his tone was surprisingly kind perhaps even subservient serena realized wulfgar nodded at the slaver then looked back at her i will return and then we can talk more he said i apologizefor locking the bolt my love but it is for your own good soon you too will have no need for the chambers to be secured just be patient saying nothing more wulfgar left with the slaver they closed and bolted the double doors behind them serena stared at the door for some time still overcome by her lovers words finally getting up and walking to the window she realized that she had already begun to miss him the three moons cast their magenta shimmerings upon the waters of the ocean highlighting the tips of the everrestless waves even though the transparent azure wall separated her from the outside world for a moment she thought she could almost smell the familiar saltiness of the sea breeze she tried to sort through the mysterious things wulfgar had told her but no answers came as she gazed into the distance the silent waves beckoned but provided no clues she shook her head a queen her mind repeated to her over and over again but a queen destined to rule over whom as the sea crashed against the shore below she stood there for a long time just as wulfgar had done her mind lost in the maze of complexities that had been laid before her l ying on his back on one of the white marble tables of the scriptorium wulfgar looked calmly up into krassus dark eyes he was not tied down this time for there was no longer any need for such crude measures the scroll of the vagaries hovered close by glowing with the power of the craft krassus smiled are you ready he asked simply yes came the willing eager answer youre beginning to love the way you feel are you not yes tell me then krassus asked what is it that you want i want more smiling the wizard resumed his work chapter fortynine a s the first rays of dawn crept down through the strange unmoving fog surrounding the isle of sanctuary tristan stood wearily against the gunwale of the peoples revenge he had been up all night helping with the repairs and he was exhausted letting out a deep breath he hoped that their labors would be enough to let them survive another day he desperately needed to get the parchment hidden in his boot back to the wizards but he was beginning to doubt whether he would live long enough to make that happen so far there had been no sign of the pirates but he knew that couldnt last much longer every moment that passed decreased their chances of escape late the previous afternoon they had arrived back at their ships without incident scars still holding the unconscious rolf over the front of his saddle after boarding the vessels and tying rolf securely to one of the masts tristan had convinced tyranny to order her three ships to another location well within the depths of the fog bank but when he had tried to convince her of his other suggestion her face had darkened and she had proven far more stubborn in a way he understood her concerns for there were parts of his plan he didnt care for either in fact had scars not finally agreed with him he probably wouldnt have made any headway with her at all i wont do it she had shouted loudly into the darkness of the nighttime fog stamping one boot against the deck of the peoples revenge they hadnt dared light the ships lanterns but in the rosecolored moonlight tristan could easily see the anger on her face her sharp jaw stuck out angrily i didnt come all this way just to leave them behind defiantly she folded her arms across her breasts only the afterlife knows what will become of them if i do frankly you surprise me what you managed to do back there in the wing and claw was wonderful and i will be forever grateful for it but what you ask of me now i will not grant i know how you feel tyranny tristan countered gently trying to calm her down but my story wont hold up long and i fear they may come for us anytime now rather than keep their side of our socalled bargain if we are ever to get out of here in one piece we must start work right away if we are forced to try to outrun them in our current condition we are done foryou said so yourself i know you dont want to leave anyone behind but you must trust me when i tell you that this is the only way tristans plan was admittedly desperate it involved cannibalizing the other two vessels and repairing the peoples revenge with what they had stripped from them then the remaining slaves and skeleton crews would be brought aboard the other two ships would be scuttled and tyrannys flagship would set sail for eutracia he knew full well that if they did this they would be packed to the rigging with extra crewmen freed slaves and provisions and that that would drastically slow them down still it was all he could think of that might gain them some semblance of a fighting chance back in the wing and claw he had never really expected the pirates to keep their end of the deal his entire scheme had only been about getting away safely and buying some time but tyranny would have none of what he was proposing knowing they were wasting precious time he looked over to scars and silently beseeched the faithful giant to agree with him finally scars relented and cleared his throat i fear he may be right captain we have just enough material from the two other ships to get the job done if we start now and everyone lends a hand we may be able to finish before dawn and leave before the pirates are any the wiser sometimes one simply has to know when to cut ones losses and move on this seems to be one of those times her face still a mask of grim determination tyranny continued to glare at them i believe its what your late father would do were he here with us today scars added tristan looked over again at the first mate and each of them knew what the other was thinking in order to get this done they could simply tie tyranny up and lock her belowdecks he supposed as long as her crew went along with it but something in his heart wouldnt let him they were all stronger with her than without her and he wanted the ships captain to be a willing part of whatever they did when they had first arrived back at the ships tyranny had ordered a head count it revealed that more than fifty of her total crew were still on shore and she had immediately made it clear that she wouldnt hear of leaving them behind in a way tristan agreed with her but he also knew that if any of them were going to survive they had to get going any crewmembers not back on board by the time they were ready to sail would simply have to turn pirateif they hadnt decided to do so alreadyor otherwise take their chances on the island finally deciding enough was enough he took tyranny by the shoulders and forced her around to face him and what about your brother eh he asked sternly you still remember him i assume how much good do you think you can do him if youre dead isnt he the real reason you started all this in the first place letting go of her he pointed to some slaves sitting on the deck sick ragged and coughing many of them looked as though they wouldnt even survive the two days it would take to get home and what about them he asked your men still on shore may be left behind but they knew the risks if they dont get back in time so be it but these slaves you have shed blood to save rightfully deserve their own chance dont you think or have you somehow forgotten about them too his dark gaze didnt give her an inch you trusted me once and now im asking you to do so again he said somewhat more gently reaching into his boot he withdrew the ancient slip of parchment and held it before her eyes i know this cant look like much to you but i must get it home at all costs there are things at stake here that you cant possibly imagine things of the craft of magic then his mood lightened a bit besides he added coyly wouldnt you like to live long enough to spend that one hundred thousand kisa i promised you her stance softened and she looked to scars for guidance the colossus slowly nodded his head with that tyranny reluctantly agreed to tristans plan they had labored hard all through the night and the decks of the peoples revenge were now literally covered with souls from the other two ships but her spars and sails looked to be in good repair again and the morning wind was stiffening tyranny quietly came to stand next to tristan at the gunwale she looked as exhausted as he did thank you she said softly for what for convincing me of what needed to be done she answered tousling her hair with one hand sometimes i can be a handful i know they dont call me tyranny for nothing tristan pursed his lips knowingly so ive seen he said wryly smiling he brushed an errant lock of her outrageous hair away from one of her wide blue eyes you still havent told me why your blood is azure or why it glows she then said surprising him how can that be who are you really scowling tristan looked back out over the ocean even my wizards cannot answer such things he said softly sadly all i know is that lately i have come to curse my azure blood and a large part of me wishes that i no longer had it i long to have normally endowed blood like wigg and faegan but right now that day seems far away indeed then he heard footsteps and turned to see scars approaching all is finally ready for departure captain the giant said shortly may i have your orders tyranny looked sadly out to where the two stripped deserted ships lay they had once sailed proudly beside her swift and sure in their service but now they looked for all the world like lost tattered orphans fearfully awaiting some unknown fate tyranny closed her eyes scuttle them she said softly with a sad resigned look scars raised one arm and gave the signal to the two crewmen still waiting aboard the other vessels after signaling back they quickly disappeared belowdecks only to come up a few moments later then they scrambled down into the small longboats that lay tied alongside and hurried back to the flagship once they were aboard and the boats secured tyranny turned to scars take us out she ordered simply the tone of her voice told tristan that her normally commanding demeanor had returned be quick about it and be sure to give us a wide berth around the others she added sternly i have no desire to be taken by the undertow as those two frigates go down glad to be finally leaving sanctuary scars began barking out orders to make way looking across the fogcovered ocean she and tristan watched as the other two vessels began to swallow seawater their bows slowly nosing down into the waves soon the briny encroaching ocean was crossing them amidships and the frigates were standing at a sharp angle on their bows finally the waves closed in over their aft decks and they plunged toward oblivion the swirling dark blue water closed over them leaving no trace tristan turned to tyranny im sorry he said i know she replied quietly they said nothing for a time as they watched the spinning whirlpools slow and finally vanish altogether then he heard the flagships sails snap open and the peoples revenge started to move soon they would be out of the fog and on their way home so anxious was he to see eutracia again that he almost thought he could smell the rich dark soil and the green waving grasses of the cavalon delta looking up he saw his blueandgold battle standard snapping back and forth in the wind and it gladdened his heart it was then that he and tyranny heard the arrogant hateful voice come snarling across the deck so tell me lass the pirate shouted out is it that hes bettern me where it counts or is it just the money youre after known ya as i do its probably both isnt it my little shecat turning tristan and tyranny looked over to where rolf stood lashed to the mainmast weaponless hands bound securely behind him his blond hair was matted and an angry red welt swelled his chin where tristan had hit him with the brain hook his narrowed eyes gazed at tyranny with an odd combination of hate and lust that tristan found unsettling youll never make it home you know rolf added nastily suren it was a fine notion to make your ship whole again by robbing from the other two and even i have to admit that she used to be uncommonly fast but if i know my boys they have already surrounded the island your new man here may have fooled them back at the tavern but youll never beat them out on the open sea yhave my word on it ya shouldve stayed in the fog lass but ycouldnt keep that up forever now could ya worse yet youre now too heavy to slip by their two hundred ships and yknow it then he cast his eyes lasciviously up and down her body it seems you and i will get to enjoy our little reunion after all he added wickedly he turned to look at tristan and as for you you clever bastard i look forward to giving you a taste of my sword he snarled we have unsettled business you and i im eager to know whether yreally are any good with that ridiculouslooking blade you carry but time will soon tell laddie yes it will and time is the one thing ya dont have then he smiled that and another two hundred ships of course tristan wanted to untie him and take him on right then and there but he reluctantly pulled himself back taking a deep breath he looked rolf in the eyes i welcome it he said quietly just then the peoples revenge broke out of the fog as the stiff easterly wind filled her sails tyranny ordered that the heavily loaded frigate turn west toward the delta but before her orders could be carried out the crewman in the crows nest started ringing the alarm bell for all he was worth looking up she saw him pointing frantically out over the bow tristan looked quickly to tyranny to find that she already had her spyglass to one eye as she trained it across the western horizon the blood drained from her face saying nothing she looked over at him and handed him the glass tristan put it to his eye and took a quick breath what looked to be a line of at least one hundred pirate vessels were tacking back and forth in the wind quickly converging on their position fearing the worst tristan quickly turned astern and raised the glass again a seemingly equal number of vessels were running before the wind plowing their way toward them in a battle line from the east the pirates strategy was immediately apparent the two battle lines planned to meet trapping the peoples revenge in a manmade vise of wood and sailcloth from which there would be no escape tristan knew that all they had now was the superior speed of tyrannys ship for the two groups of raiders clearly had the angle on them but how much speed could she muster loaded down like this the best the peoples revenge could do was to try to slip through the gap at the northern ends of their lines before it closed if they could the open sea lay beyond but as tristan gauged the distances involved and checked the direction of the wind his heart fell he was sure tyranny would give it her best but he knew they would never make it tyranny gave the expected order and the frigate immediately heeled over to the north to begin tacking into the wind tristan finally lowered the glass to see that tyrannys face wore the same sense of defeat that his must there would be no way to avoid being captured and once they were there would be no clever trick to save them this time and no wizards to help them avoid their doom they were all alone and they were about to die chapter fifty w alking gingerly down the hall with his daughter at his side wigg cursed both his weakness and the fact that he had been unable to sleep the previous night horrific dreams had disturbed him over and over again causing him to cry out and awaken to find his body covered with sweat his mind overcome with guilt and terror celeste had stayed by his side the entire night to calm and reassure him whenever he awakened he was still weak this morning but he had insisted on getting out of bed and going to visit his friends he very much wanted to see abbey faegan and shailiha with his own eyes for only then would he be able to breathe easier about what had happened to them in the courtyard yesterday after the unexpected blast had shaken the palace the minions had come to his quarters to inform him and celeste of what had just happened it had been a massive explosion but the warriors had finally been able to extinguish the numerous grass fires that had sprung up luckily the palace remained unharmed abbey faegan and shailiha had survived but they had been badly shaken after being carefully examined by the gnome wives they had been ordered straight to bed as expected faegan had argued but shawna the short had finally prevailed by scowling and shaking one of her pudgy fingers at him in the end he had simply been too tired to fight her once he had felt well enough to rise wigg had asked that the three others also be awakened so that he might immediately speak to them he had not wished to disturb their rest but he was concerned that what had just transpired could seriously impact their search for both the prince and the scrolls of the ancients time was precious and the sooner they met the better after hearing about what had happened in the courtyard he now suspected that what he had just gone through in the chambers of penitence may have been some form of immensely elaborate ruseone designed to supply him and faegan with exactly the wrong kinds of herbsthose meant to kill them the moment they were employed was the watchwoman of the floating gardens somehow in league with krassus he asked himself as he shuffled along the polished marble hallways and if she was how could they have possibly known that he and faegan would visit her there were surely easier far more certain ways to kill them than that none of it made any sense but he was determined to get his answers finally finding himself before the proper door wigg knocked once then let himself and celeste into the vast library known as the archives of the redoubt faegan abbey and shailiha were already at the mahogany meeting table around a large pot of tea and a silver plate of pastries the master wizard and the herbmistress were talking in urgent worried tones shailiha was listening to them intently morganna held close in her arms upon seeing wigg and celeste the baby made a soft gurgling sound after wigg and celeste took their seats the lead wizard cleared his throat abbey and faegan finally stopped talking looking from them to shailiha wigg realized that they were indeed lucky to be alive their faces and hands were decidedly reddened and parts of their hair and eyebrows had been singed abbey looked the worst of the three reaching out wigg took her hand she smiled and grasped it gingerly her skin felt good in his palm and he smiled back at her is everyone all right wigg asked softly abbey looked over at faegan then back at the lead wizard i think so she answered but it was very close we have some burns but faegan has already enacted a spell of accelerated healing over them he has also aided our hearing which was temporarily impaired by the blast in another day or so we should be far better but what about you placing his gnarled hands flat upon the tabletop wigg took a deep breath lets just say that what i went through in the chambers of penitence is not something i would ever care to repeat he said employing his usual sense of wry understatement i should soon be better as well but tell me how did this happen was it because of the goods we brought back as he looked at faegan his face darkened did the watchwoman try to kill us by intentionally supplying us with the wrong items was everything i went through for naught no i dont think so faegan answered almost perfunctorily it will of course be impossible to know for sure until we again try to use the oils and herbs but i believe what happened was a result of something we did ourselves rather than our having been betrayed by the watchwoman how so celeste asked we were actively seeking tristan faegan answered and it was the blood of his twin sister that we were employing to do so something physical of the subject to be viewed is always requiredor at least something as close to the subject as the practitioner can find sitting back in his chair he thought to himself for a moment as i understand it from abbey under normal conditions this would never result in the catastrophic results we experienced in the courtyard he went on since we had nothing personal of the princes body we thought a drop of shailihas blood might do the trick but remember tristans blood is now azurechanged in ways that we have yet to fathom it could simply be that his blood is not compatible with abbeys gifts and the process of trying to find him resulted in the flames destruction we may never know for sure in any event i certainly dont recommend that we use the exact same method to view him again abbey narrowed her eyes with thought actually there is some mention of such a phenomenon in the ancient teachings of the partials she said i had forgotten about it until hearing what you just said it makes no mention of tristan exactly but what happened is starting to sound more and more like what my teacher once warned me to be on the lookout for so many years ago she paused and it was clear to everyone that she was trying hard to retrieve the details from her dusty threehundredyearold memories intensely interested faegan leaned nearer and placed his long bony forearms on the table and that is he asked quickly what we experienced is supposedly called the furies abbey said as the legend slowly returned to her the woman who taught me spoke very fearfully of it telling me to pass the warning down to any of those partials i might eventually teach it tells of the twothose who shall eventually come among us possessing powers so great that we partials must never try to use our gifts upon them if we do we risk invoking the furies and our spells being returned to us thereby killing us in return much like what happened to us in the courtyard she paused for a moment as the sudden realization spread across her face the two the legend speaks of must be tristan and shailiha she said softly then the room went quiet as each of them tried to absorb the gravity of her news faegan however wasted no time pointing over at the table that held the tome of the paragon he straightened one finger the white leatherbound volume rose into the air and came to rest before him he turned his graygreen eyes to abbey the furies you say he asked her the herbmistress nodded closing his eyes the wizard called upon his powers of consummate recollection as he concentrated on the single word a vision began to form in his mind this time it was only a page number rather than an entire quotation opening his eyes he looked back down at the great book faegan caused the tome to open itself and its giltedged leafs started flurrying by when he found the page he wanted he caused them to stop turning after reading it a curious look crossed his face and he sat back in his chair what is it wigg asked without answering faegan looked back to the great book and began to translate the old eutracian on its pages and there shall come among you the two and they shall possess a blood quality so high that those known as the partialsthose sole practitioners of certain of the organicsshall come to dread them for should those of partial blood signatures attempt to employ their limited gifts upon the two the twos progeny or others of the same womb from which the two came their power shall be reversed upon them a thousandfold and destroy them for the blood signatures known as partials shall not be as strong as those of the fully endowed the two and their seed may therefore be the partials mortal enemies even though the two may not choose for such a reaction to be so trailing off faegan again sat back in his chair lost in thought what does it mean abbey asked at first faegan said nothing he was ensconced within the caverns of his amazing mind and his eyes almost seemed glazed over such a wondrous dangerous maze is the craft he finally muttered softly half to himself after three hundred years of trying we have barely scratched the surface of the knowledge collected by the ones who came before faegan wigg said forcefully trying to bring the old wizards attention back to the rest of them what does it all mean taking a breath faegan finally refocused on the people at the table it confirms something that i have long suspected regarding the craft he answered cryptically but more about that in a moment then he looked intently at abbey tell me he asked her exactly how did you know that something terrible was about to happen in the courtyard my gazing flame began behaving far out of the ordinary she answered after the viewing window started to form the top of the flame began to swell i have never seen one do that before it was almost as if it was somehow collecting energy instead of expelling it as is the norm when i saw it something told me it was about to burst so i threw myself at you and the princess apparently when the flame ruptured it did so at the top releasing its energy skyward had the rent appeared in its side instead i have no doubt that the three of us would be quite dead in all my years i have never experienced a release of such boundless energy faegan smiled at her thank you he said softly and we shall never forget what you did so what does it all mean wigg demanded impatiently arent you ever going to tell us whats rattling around in that centuriesold overactive brainpan of yours faegan only gave them that coy knowing smile of his again he enjoyed nothing so much as a mystery of the craftespecially when he was the only one who held its answer just one more question i promise he told the table shailiha do you remember anything out of the ordinary just before the gazing flame burst did you experience any unusual or uncomfortable sensations for example now that you mention it my heart began beating so fast and so hard that i thought i might pass out she answered but i didnt say anything about it before because i thought it was just caused by anxiety was it significant oh yes my child the wizard smacked his palm down on one arm of his chair in triumph indeed it was he looked like the cat that had just swallowed the proverbial canary and so wigg asked crossing his arms with frustration abbey is quite correct faegan began this is further evidenced by the princess extremely rapid heartbeat her blood coursed faster through her body in response to rejecting and further empowering a partial adepts spell and the energy was returned to abbeys flame by a factor of one thousand times so says the tome how fascinating he paused for a moment to let his words sink in unfortunately this dangerous practice was exactly what we were trying to accomplish yesterday in our benign ignorance out there in the courtyard he continued and we succeeded admirably in making fools of ourselves didnt we the fact that tristans blood is now azure may have only intensified the effect he looked around the table as we have already said several of us here are indeed lucky to be alive he looked over at the herbmistress i strongly suggest that you do not attempt to employ any of your gifts on either of the chosen ones again especially before wigg and i have had a chance to explore these new revelations further he added abbey rolled her eyes dont worry she said holding her palms upward in a gesture of surrender i have no such intentions i promise tell me faegan said do you know of any way to circumvent these furies as you call them so that we might still try to locate the prince there were always rumors among those in the partial community that such a process existed abbey answered legend says that it can be done provided one possesses the proper calculations for it but i do not know what the formulas are or where they might be found they supposedly involved sending the energy back yet again to the original subject in its newly constituted strength she thought to herself for a moment the possibility of circumventing the furies also raises another very interesting question she added thoughtfully and that is wigg asked whether such a spell should it in fact actually exist would fall within the purview of the wizards rather than the partials she answered slowly as if thinking aloud such uses of the craft would seem to reside well outside the realm of the organic it sounds far more like one of the paragons facets of the kinetic wouldnt you agree faegan furrowed his brow it was soon clear to the others that he found this last comment to be even more interesting than what had been discussed previously youre forgetting something arent you wigg finally asked from the other side of the table or should i say someone and just who might that be faegan asked wulfgar wigg answered solemnly again the room became silent faegan nodded quite right lead wizard he agreed and well done the quote i just read from the tome mentioned not only the two but also their progeny and others from the same womb that would of course include both wulfgar and morganna he looked over at abbey for the time being you are to strictly avoid using your gifts not only on tristan and shailiha but on wulfgar and morganna as well he ordered her the herbmistress nodded her agreement but still we have failed have we not celeste asked in addition to not finding tristan we have no idea where this scroll of the vigors may be it could be anywhere in the world and unless we find it soon krassus will be able to complete at least one portion of the mission originally begun by nicholasa mission that we still know virtually nothing about shailiha angrily shook her head she had been bitterly disappointed again her greatest goal continued to be finding her brother and now it seemed that they were even farther away from it than ever im tired of sitting here and doing nothing while tristan is in danger she cried out cant you all see that morganna cried a little with her mothers sudden outburst and shailiha kissed her cheek to soothe her isnt there anything that can be done she asked trying to keep her voice calmer the herbs and oils we brought back were to have been our solution to that wigg said sadly however with this sudden unexpected appearance of the furies im afraid we are now forced to discover another way to find him but hear me when i tell you that tristan is a very brave and resourceful man and if there is anyone in this world who can overcome whatever he is up against it is he i know that isnt much for you to hold onto right now but it seems to be all that any of us have wigg looked over at celeste to see a somewhat different but equally concerned look cross her face a growing sense of defeat crept silently over the room chapter fiftyone k jarr soared high and fast through the fading indigo of the earlymorning sky he wore his dreggan strapped across his back and his returning wheel securely fastened to one side of his belt a battle bugle was tied to the other side waiting to be used behind him the sun rose bringing a welcoming warmth to his ceaselessly beating wings his dark eyes scoured the sea of whispers below and he smiled blessing his highly tuned senses he would need them all today he knew he banked to the left slightly changing course and the one hundred specially selected minion warriors accompanying him followed suit officers all they had been handpicked not only for their overall intelligence and superior flying speed but also for their expert fighting ability they were the minion forces best of the best and their mission was clear find the mysterious fog bank and investigate it board and carefully examine the ships they found there they were to leave no stone unturned in their search for the prince they could not have been far from the fog bank when kjarr saw a line of ships heading west running before the wind they were still some distance away and moving fast surprised by their great numbers he counted them to find that there were just a bit more than one hundred in all then his eyes caught sight of a lone frigate desperately plowing her way north while the line of ships closed in on her from the west she was clearly trying to make a run for the gap in the northernmost points of the ships lines but the prevailing winds were easterly and tacking back and forth as she was she would never make it in time as he watched from afar the battle lines were closing together surrounding the single ship in a deadly seaborne ring of wood and sailcloth sensing a looming tragedy he flew faster his wings straining and there at last was the mysterious patch of fog he had been searching for lying peacefully and unmoving in the blue water blocking the single frigates escape to the south kjarrs jaw hardened with hate why would anyone commit so many vessels to the capture of a single ship he wondered it just didnt make any sense and then it hit him the chosen one might be aboard he watched in horror as the ring closed more tightly around the trapped vessel turning he called orders to the three officers who were to return to the minion fleet with the exact location of the fog bank immediately they peeled away from the main body and soared through the air flying hard in the direction from which they had just come he returned his attention to the action in the distance hoping against hope that his sworn lord was not trapped on that lone desperate ship it would be many long moments before he and his warriors could reach themmoments that the ones aboard the frigate clearly could not afford turning to the officer nearest him kjarr began barking out orders just then the lead vessel in the oncoming fleet rammed the lone frigate directly amidships as he watched kjarrs razorsharp eyes caught something that quickened his heart at the top of the ships mainmast flew the blueandgold battle flag of the house of galland kjarr drew his dreggan despite the rushing of the wind he could hear the reassuring ring of his warriors blades cutting through the air all around him he smiled grimly this was what they had been bred for had spent their entire lives training for there was no greater honor for a true minion warrior than to perish in the service of his lord many of them would no doubt meet their final reward here today somewhere over the sea of whispers suddenly snapping his wings closed behind his back kjarr held his sword before him and jacknifed into a dive pointing straight down in a perfect vertical free fall the warriors behind him followed suit faster and faster they fell plummeting toward the stricken ship as attackers swarmed over her decks the odds were overwhelming kjarr knew but if his lord was indeed here then there was no other duty no other choice than the one lying before them narrowing his dark eyes against the wind he led his forces down i n a violent cacophony of splintering wood the lead pirate ship had rammed the peoples revenge directly amidships then she had swung alongside her raiders screaming and jumping from their vessel to swarm like ants over the decks of tyrannys flagship one man leapt from the rigging with a knife between his teeth and swung his saber broadly in an attempt to take the princes head off but tristan saw him coming quickly slipping to one side he held his dreggan out with both arms and pressed the button on the hilt the extra length of blade launched forward catching the pirate across the belly the pirates face registered a moment of shock then the light went out of his eyes ignoring the gushing blood tristan roughly pushed the corpse off his sword with the heel of one boot but as he turned to look around his heart fell tyranny and scars were lost among all the fighting all around him men were dying worse yet the other raider vessels were approaching rapidly the deck of the peoples revenge was a mass of screaming struggling pandemonium blades clanging noisily amid the sounds of shouting and groans of pain it would be over very shortly he knew and they would all be dead the scrap of parchment hidden in his boot would never reach eutracia and krassus would win but before that happened tristan swore he would take as many of them down with him as he could seeing a pirate raise his sword against one of the slaves he instinctively reached over his right shoulder and drew one of his knives almost before he knew it the dirk was twirling end over end toward its victim as it buried itself into the side of the mans neck blood rushed out in furious uncontrolled spurts wet slippery waves of crimson cascaded down the mans left shoulder as he clutched frantically at the handle of the knife but it was already too late as blood spewed from his lungs his eyes became strangely fixed in the distance his sword dropped noisily to the deck and he fell stiffly face forward tristan turned to look up into the rigging from which his first attacker had come as he did his heart skipped a beat all of tyrannys crewmembers who had remained behind on the isle of sanctuary had been captured and hung from the pirate ships masts and rigging tristan had known some of these people he had laughed with them worked with them and learned the ways of the sea from them and now they were dead as he stood gaping up at the bodies that had once been so full of life a sudden wave of guilt swept over him bending over he tried to keep from vomiting later he would recall that it was truly a miracle he hadnt been killed then finally returning to his senses he spun around to rejoin the battle almost immediately another of them was upon him awash with rising anger tristan used all his talents to make sure the pirate died a s they neared the stricken ship in their headlong plunge kjarrs warriors fanned out they had been ordered to find whether the prince was aboard before joining the battle and to do so at all cost kjarr unfolded his wings and buffeted the air to hover at a point near the mainmast about ten meters off the deck he wanted very badly to join the fray but he had to monitor the progress of his warriors first if his lord was struggling somewhere on this ship they would soon find him or die trying finally in the midst of the battle they saw him a s the first of them went soaring by tristan thought he must be seeing things then one swooped down to land beside him dreggan drawn eyes flashing then came another and another until a multitude of them had formed a protective ring around him slashing viciously at their attackers as they came many of the stunned pirates died right there and then tristans heart leapt in his chest he didnt know how many of the minions there were here or where they had suddenly come from but now finally he thought there might be a chance to prevail after all kjarr landed beside tristan after quickly telling him the number of warriors under his command and the location of the minion fleet he waited calmly for tristans orders the prince looked out across the waves to see that the rest of the pirate vessels would soon be upon them then an idea struck him using precious seconds he gauged the speed and distance between them and the nearest of the oncoming ships he leaned toward kjarr again take half of your force and fly toward those ships he shouted urgently above the din leave the other half of your warriors here to help us secure this vessel when you reach the enemy vessels this is what i want you to do leaning in further he shouted some final directives to kjarr understanding the officer smiled he then took to the air again half of his warriors following him as ordered and flew directly toward the oncoming pirate ships tristan and the remaining warriors began grimly hacking their way through the raiders on board the peoples revenge the battle continued to rage but the prince thought there were now more of tyrannys crewmen standing than there were pirates still the scene before him was something out of a nightmare dead men lay tangled in the rigging of both ships body parts were everywhere the wounded of both sides were screaming pitifully for help and the decks were slippery with blood he desperately needed to find tyranny and scars and tell them what was happening fighting his way down the length of the decks with his warriors by his side he finally saw them amazingly they were both still alive as k jarr and his minions approached the encroaching pirate vessels they obeyed their lords orders and climbed higher then their leader gathered them into a hovering eager group and started barking out commands only two warriors to a ship he told them quickly when they were done with their work they were to advance to another vessel and then another always doing the same thing until the task was complete by then their fleet should have arrived and the killing could begin in earnest smiling to himself kjarr watched them go as two by two they bravely dove down on the pirate armada as they did the pirates began to notice looking up and staring at the winged ones with wide unbelieving eyes kjarr smiled trying to board these two hundred vessels and kill all of the pirates would have been blatant suicide still had tristan ordered them to do so they would have obeyed him without question but the chosen one had not commanded his winged warriors to attack the pirates he had ordered them to attack their ships o ut of one corner of her eye tyranny saw tristan coming then for the first time in her life she saw the minions so stunned was she that she literally stopped what she was doing and simply stared at them her sword hanging limply from one bloody hand only at the last moment did one of the warriors step in expertly slicing away the head of a sashwearing pirate who had tried to take advantage of her lapse in judgment running up to her side tristan shouted out to her telling her that the winged ones were his and that she shouldnt be afraid of them with the fighting on the peoples revenge finally starting to abate he did his best to explain what he had just ordered the minions to do and how their fleet was on the way there were still two hundred pirate vessels bearing down on them but at least now they had a slim chance as he told her he saw a glimmer of hope appear in her eyes then he looked over to see scars the everweaponless giant was holding a frantically squirming screaming pirate in his arms tristan knew from prior experience that there would be no escape for the man seemingly oblivious to everything going on around him scars calmly walked the terrified raider over to the gunwale the pirates red telltale sash dragging on the pitching deck as they went without fanfare scars lifted the man into the air then brought his head down sharply against the smooth polished edge with a sickening snapping sound it cracked open like an eggshell gray brain matter slipped from within its shattered depths to fall sloppily onto the deck saying nothing scars tossed the body overboard into the sea then he looked up at tristan and smiled broadly a s kjarrs warriors finally reached the oncoming pirates ships they drew their swords swooping and darting among the vessels staying aloft rather than taking to the decks they hacked savagely at the sails and rigging of the ships bringing them tumbling to the decks in tattered useless heaps of tangled rope and sailcloth all the angry pirates could do was to watch helplessly shaking their fists and cursing the days the winged ones were born a few of the more aggressive pirates started climbing the remains of their tattered rigging to reach the minions and fight them but that proved to be a huge mistake from their superior positions aloft the minions easily cut them to pieces the raiders mutilated bodies crashing back down to the decks or splashing into the sea of whispers on and on it went one ship after the next as the minions mercilessly hacked down the sails and rigging others of them destroyed the hulls of the ships longboats and skiffs making escape impossible finally exhausted but satisfied the minion warriors resheathed their dreggans and soared higher to regroup with their leader looking down kjarr smiled broadly just as the chosen one had hoped the warriors had been able to stop the pirate vessels dead in the water and now they drifted aimlessly at the whim of the currents their decks covered with white sailcloth the ships looked rather like oddly shaped clouds that had somehow fallen from the sky to land in the openness of the blue sea there was no way the pirate forces would be able to reach their comrades in the battle for the peoples revenge as the pirates screamed invectives at the winged ones who had crippled them kjarr knew that he and his warriors had just secured for their lord the one thing he had needed most time time for their fleet to arrive under the dual command of geldon and traax that would not be long now he knew then the real killing could begin in true minion fashion his blood sang with the promise of slaughtering the enemies of his sworn lord kjarr turned his sharp eyes toward the eastern horizon to his great delight he could finally see the sails of their fleet approaching then another dark fleeting shadow passed over the ocean below and he smiled the sky above him was suddenly swarming with minion troops traax was leading them and six of them were carrying a litter that presumably transported geldon traax waved kjarrs forces up and the two groups combined after a quick word of explanation from kjarr the warriors left the pirate ships in their misery and began flying as fast toward tyrannys stricken ship as their wings would allow despite their initial success traaxs face darkened their lord wasnt safe yet and every passing second mattered t yranny scars and tristan stood together back to back fighting against the remaining pirates who still dared to take them on tyranny had already been wounded in one shoulder and scars in his right thigh neither of their injuries was mortal but they needed attention or they would both soon become weak from blood loss tristan was still unscathed he continued to fight like a demon even though his arms were becoming so heavy he didnt know how much longer he would be able to raise his dreggan fortunately their attackers were becoming fewer and at last all three of them were able to stop fighting their chests heaving tristan and tyranny took a moment to rest on the hilts of their swords using a shirt taken from a dead pirate and ripped into strips scars temporarily bound tyrannys wound and then his own then a voice rang out across the deck causing tristans blood to run cold i said that you were a clever bastard rolf shouted and what you just did to my ships proves it doesnt it these winged monkeys of yours can certainly use a sword ill give them that but what ugly things they are suren its just you and me now what say you laddieare you up for a little fun at some point in the battle one of the pirates must have cut rolf free from the mast looking out across the ship tristan could see him standing arrogantly on the far side of an empty patch of bloody deck he beckoned tristan forward the red sash around his waist fluttering in the wind in one hand he held a bloody pirate saber and in the other a dagger smiling he wiped the sword blade clean on one leg of his trousers then he raised it expertly twirled it around in his hand and pointed its tip directly at the princes face for a split second tristan wondered how many of tyrannys men the pirate had just killed are you going to hide behind that traitorous bitchs skirts forever or come to me like a man rolf shouted then he smiled and bowed sarcastically to tyranny sorry lass but i forgotyou never wear skirts do you still that never kept me from finding my way in did it now enraged tristan stalked toward the pirate leader he knew that they had already won that this didnt need to happen and in his heart he knew that rolf understood that as well as he did but tristans supremely endowed azure blood was overcoming these sentiments both he and rolf had their reasons for what was about to happen and neither of them would be denied he paused by tyranny his eyes still fixed squarely on rolf if he kills me you must see to it that the vellum hidden in my boot gets back to the wizards in tammerland he said quietly my fleet will be here soon when it arrives give the paper to the warrior named traax he will most probably be in command and he can be trusted do you understand tyranny nodded reaching out she squeezed his arm be careful she whispered he is very very good i know tristan answered softly without looking at her reaching behind his back he removed one of his throwing knives then temporarily holding the dirk in the same hand that held his dreggan he used his free hand to unbuckle the knife quiver which fell to the deck his baldric scabbard and all followed he returned the knife to his left hand although almost without equal with a sword tristan was no expert at this kind of dualbladed fighting he had trained in the art briefly and knew he possessed the basic skills but watching rolfs sword and dagger whirl around in the bright morning sun he realized that this was the pirates chosen specialty tristan would have to be goodvery goodif he was to have any hope of staying alive but the die was cast and there was no going back now as he moved forward again he and rolf warily began taking stock of each other in the center of the slippery bloody deck a strange kind of quiet came over the ship crewmen slaves pirate captives and minion warriors alike watched intently as the deadly scene unfolded rolf acted first lunging sharply at the prince he slashed diagonally with his saber stunned tristan realized that he had never before encountered such raw speednot even that day when he had killed kluge the previous commander of the minions only at the last moment did tristan understand that rolfs first blow had been a feint designed to distract attention from the dagger as it came stabbing straight out from underneath it was a miracle that he saw the dagger come out at all but as it emerged from the shadow created by rolfs body it flashed for a split second in the sun only at the last moment did tristan violently swivel his torso to avoid the strike rolfs dagger sliced through the side of his leather vest narrowly missing his skin with rolf now off balance tristan rushed back in and stabbed his dirk directly at one of rolfs eyes but the pirate was too fast sidestepping immediately almost as if he had been expecting that very countermove at the same time he parried tristans strike with his sword and its greater weight nearly knocked the dirk from the princes tired hand holding their weapons high they circled each other again each looking for an opportunity to strike this time however tristan decided not to wait if he wanted to stay alive he would have to go on the offensive and stay there no matter how exhausted he was from his previous battles using both weapons at once tristan windmilled them with everything he had rolf was able to keep parrying them as they came but just barely the sound of the clanging blades became an almost continual ringing out of steel against steel tristans arms moved with lightning speed he was finally gaining ground forcing rolf over near the port gunwale just across from the mainmast but rolf seemed to be answering tristans blows more confidently as he was beginning to get a feel for the princes fighting style and for his equally amazing speed tristan could only hope that rolf was tiring as well but then the pirate surprised tristan backing away as he parried and struck with his saber the pirate placed his dagger between his teeth he then grabbed the nearby rigging and ascended onehanded with practiced ease continuing to fight tristan with his sword three rungs up rolf halted his climb and moved to the far side of the ropes where he smiled tauntingly down then he wrapped one arm through the rigging leaned back almost casually and spread his arms in an arrogant gesture of welcome it was clear the waiting spider had just dared the fly to come and enter his web seeing this tyranny almost cried out but not wanting to divert tristans attention from anything rolf might do she held back she closed her eyes for a moment she had watched her former lover singlehandedly kill over a dozen demonslavers with this very ruse back before he had succumbed to the temptations of sanctuary and had become a pirate rolf was a very different man now but his fighting skills were as sharp as ever she had never seen any of his unsuspecting opponents survive what he was about to do she looked over at scars who shook his head understanding how inexperienced tristan still was at shipboard fighting they both knew in their hearts that he had just committed suicide no sooner had tristan climbed up to meet rolf than the pirate dropped his sword grasped the far side of the rigging with both hands and kicked his feet away from the ropes launching his body out into space using the tension in the ropes to add power and momentum to the maneuver he swung around behind the opposite flat side of the rigging straightened out his legs and sent his boots plunging through the gaps between the squares of rope and smashing directly into tristans chest with tremendous force tristan lost his grip he went crashing back down to the bloody deck hitting his head hard in a flash rolf followed him down looking up through a cloudy concussive haze tristan saw rolf raise his dagger as if in slow motion his green eyes flashing with hate then tristan glimpsed a flash of silver and rolfs expression changed from one of conquest to one of surprise tristan watched as a bright red line appeared around the back of rolfs neck then the pirates head literally fell off his shoulders tumbling to one side and crashing to the deck his body followed suit landing hard next to the prince just behind where rolf had been standing stood tyranny her sword covered with fresh blood tristan felt hands under his arms pulling him to his feet he stood wobbly and dazed for several moments trying to understand what had just happened the silence was complete except for the gentle creaking of the ships hull finally tyranny looked tristan in the eyes im glad i killed him she said softly her voice little more than a whisper youre glad tristan answered rubbing the back of his head a strong familiar laugh rang out behind him turning the prince found himself looking into the clear predatory eyes of traax if she hadnt gotten that bastard in time i would have done it for her he said sheathing his dreggan the minion warrior smiled broadly but it seemed she really wanted to kill him herself and who am i to contradict such a beautiful womanespecially one who seems to care so much for our lord dazed tristan looked around the decks of the peoples revenge were overflowing with minion warriors still more circled in the skies above their numbers occasionally blotting out the sun a minion litter sat on the deck nearby he cast his eyes out over the sea not only had the pirate fleet been immobilized but the minion vessels had by now completely surrounded them as well thankful to be alive he took a deep breath it seemed they had done it after all but there were still difficult decisions to be made and he knew it then he saw geldon the hunchbacked dwarf was waiting patiently near the gunwale his dark intelligent eyes taking in everything tristan went to him on stillshaky legs and they gratefully embraced one another smiling geldon looked up into the princes eyes we were very worried he said simply we have been tearing our hair out trying to find you the sea of whispers is a very big place he smiled again at the same time giving tristan a knowing wink in case you didnt already know the minions can become very irritable when they are concerned for the safety of their lord a look of worry crossed tristans face and what of everyone at the palace he asked his mind finally starting to clear are they well as far as i know yes they are geldon answered but i have been at sea for nearly thirty days bringing the fleet across in any event you will soon see them for yourself looking back to the very confused tyranny and scars tristan beckoned them forward but as he was introducing them to geldon and traax he saw tyrannys face turn dark whats wrong he asked weve won you should be happy then he understood she had just noticed her dead crewmembers hanging from the rigging of the pirate vessel that had rammed them without speaking she walked over to the nearby gunwale and looked up no one followed her no one spoke after a time tristan walked up and put one arm around her and she laid her head tiredly on his shoulder im sorry he said but at the same time i must tell you that if i were forced to make that same decision again i would for a moment she did not speak i know she finally answered and i am not angry with you but no amount of kisa in the world can remedy this tristan turned to traax have them cut down immediately he ordered and have the bodies covered with sailcloth their remains are to be respected and buried at sea with a sharp click of his heels traax turned and began barking out orders raising her head from tristans shoulder tyranny looked up into his dark eyes thank you she said softly for everything knowing there was little more to be said tristan only nodded then another minion officer approached and tristan recognized him as the one he had ordered to destroy the pirate sails and rigging the warrior went to one knee his head bowed permission to speak my lord he asked politely granted tristan said the minion stood my name is kjarr and i wanted you to know that it was my great honor to serve by your side in the skies over farplain just before the destruction of the gates of dawn it was also my privilege to fight alongside you again here today tristan smiled at kjarr sometimes it seemed that the horrific battle over the fields of farplain had been many years ago rather than mere months thank you kjarr he said with feeling i will not forget you in the days to come traax reappeared then at tristans side his face showing uncharacteristic concern forgive me my lord but my news is urgent the peoples revenge is taking on watera direct result of having been rammed the leak is slow but our shipwrights tell me that it is irreparable it is imperative that we transfer all of the survivors to our other vessels and that we do so quickly looking forward tristan could see that traax was right in the heat of all the fighting he hadnt noticed but the ship was going nosedown her bowsprit already nearing the waves how long do we have tristan asked no more than one hour traax answered tristan turned to look at tyranny he could use the minions to force an evacuation but he wouldnt this was her ship and it would be her decision closing her eyes for a moment tyranny finally nodded tristan turned back to traax very well he answered he looked back at tyranny is there anything you wish to take he asked only my charts and navigational tools she answered looking over at scars she gave the faithful giant some silent commands with her eyes in a moment he was gone as tristan cast his gaze back down the length of the stricken ship another thought came to him pulling tyranny nearer he whispered something into one of her ears a relieved look came over her of course she said gratefully especially if you think it will help how could i have been so forgetful tristan gave her a smile youve had rather a lot on your mind lately id say he beckoned kjarr back to him and the warrior was by his masters side in an instant after hearing his new orders the warrior selected two other officers to help him and they walked dutifully away forgive me my lord but there remains one final issue to be dealt with traax said knowing full well that his lord understood what that was he said nothing more tristans face darkened he had to make his decision about the fate of the pirates walking over to the gunwale he looked out to sea again the pirate vessels were clearly helpless but the seething violent men aboard them were not they were killers and thieves of the highest order and they had to be stopped if he chose to he could order his minions to attack them and they would no doubt prevail but some of the minions would lose their livesas would all of the pirates unless they surrendered deep in his heart he knew he simply couldnt authorize a slaughter like that besides he reasoned he would likely need every single minion he could muster in what might very soon become a struggle with krassus and the demonslavers looking back he beckoned to tyranny and traax to join him at the gunwale i want you to take the pirates alive if at all possible he ordered traax there is a sizable island just to the south of us hidden in that fog bank take the pirates there and maroon them i also want you to station enough minion warships around the islands perimeter to ensure that none of them can escape the remainder of the fleet is to make for eutracia at the best possible speed and tow the pirate vessels back with youtheyre too valuable to waste anchor just off the cavalon delta and then come to the palace with your report together with my wizards we will arrive at some conclusion regarding the pirates he looked back out at the opposing fleets for a time as he carefully considered his next words if the pirates reject your terms and it becomes a case of you or them then you have my permission to kill them in a fair fight he said quietly it shall all be as you say traax replied tyranny watched as traax walked away they are amazing she said i wish they had been at my side when i was hunting down demonslavers upon hearing this one corner of tristans mouth came up he knew it may yet come to that where in the name of the afterlife did they come from she asked quizzically and how is it that they obey you so unerringly i have never seen anything like them shaking his head tristan gave a short laugh thats a long story he answered her one that i shall be happy to share with you on the way home you should have plenty of time to tell it to me she reflected its still a twoday sail to the coast tristan gave her an odd knowing look actually we shall be in the palace by sunset at the latest she watched confused as tristan turned around and faced the decks of her ship again two minion vessels had come up along the opposite side and the evacuation was already in progress minion warriors were taking the weak and the wounded into their arms and flying them across the sea to the waiting ships then she saw tristan grin and point to the litter that sat waiting on the deck not too far from them realizing what he intended she felt the blood rush from her face she raised her palms up in a desperate gesture of defiance oooh no she shouted oooh yes he ordered her you me scars and geldon then he smiled again i admit it takes a bit of getting used to but your prince commands it without giving her another chance to argue he took her by one arm and pulled her over to where the litter stood they were clearly running out of time and they needed to go by now scars had reappeared with the maps and tools he looked tired and was soaked from the waist down by the seawater that was already flooding hipdeep through the lower decks with a word from his captain he tentatively got into the litter finding that he had to stay bent over slightly to keep his head from hitting the roof at a word from tristan geldon entered next when it finally came tyrannys turn she turned and gave him a look youll pay for this you know she said coyly smiling tristan raised an eyebrow and as you already know my good captain that has always been my intent he replied but first we have to get home looking for traax in the melee he finally found him and walked over tyranny scars and geldon are coming with me he said i grant you three days to carry out my orders after that i expect you and the fleet to return to eutracia with all due haste traax was holding tristans weapons smiling he handed them back to him three days then he answered he held out his arm reaching out tristan heartily slapped the inside of his forearm against traaxs and grasped it neither of them spoke more for there was no need tristan turned away and walked back to the waiting litter to find kjarr standing there with two large packages both wrapped in sailcloth well done tristan told him he ordered the minion to lash them to the top of the litter as the last to get in tristan found barely enough room for himself and his weapons but he managed he looked back out at kjarr i want you and fifty of your finest warriors to escort us home tristan ordered what i carry is of the greatest importance and it must reach there safely make your course directly for the palace and we shall need a few additional bearers because of the extra weight honored to have been given the privilege of seeing the chosen one and his entourage to tammerland kjarr clicked his heels together and went to select his warriors at last the litter rose from the deck of the sinking ship leaning back tristan closed his eyes he was drained and exhausted but his heart sang with the knowledge that he was finally going home hometo see wigg faegan abbey and shailiha and her baby and celeste chapter fiftytwo s tanding in the midst of the white silent scriptorium of the citadel wulfgar looked lovingly down at the subject sleeping on the marble table krassus stood by his side the scroll of the vagaries hovered nearby glowing brightly wulfgars hazel eyes danced with the power of the craft you have done well krassus said quietly your use of the forestallment calculations provided by the scroll proved even faster than mine i have now done all i can for you because your blood and your current gifts already outshine mine by a considerable degree even greater i daresay than the combined talents of the two wizards of the redoubt pausing for a moment krassus took his eyes from the subject on the table and turned to wulfgar and that is to say nothing of what you will both eventually become he added after today you and serena will no longer need my powers to gift one another with additional forestallments the calculations for thousands of which can still be found in the scroll but for now far greater more urgent plans await your newfound talents the work for which you have been prepared is about to commence the transformation of the bastard half brother of the two chosen ones had easily exceeded the wizards wildest dreamseven more so than his late master nicholas might have guessed he surmised wulfgar stood tall and unflinching in his newly realized gifts his mind and blood were alight with the power of the craft his determination to see nicholas work through to its glorious end had become even more resolute than krassus he wore emeraldgreen silk breeches and a short matching jacket that lay partially open to reveal his chest black leather sandals adorned his feet the hard smooth muscles of his body rippled every time he called upon them as if even they had somehow also been enhanced by his recent transformation his sandy blond hair was still tied behind his neck but the old worn leather strap had been replaced with a narrow flat band of solid gold his sessions with krassus finally complete wulfgar was now protected by the time enchantments he was also fully committedheart blood and mindnot only to the exclusive practice of the vagaries but also to the work that his nephew nicholas had begun but was unable to finish as yet however the dying wizard had not told him what that was to be krassus reached down and gently placed one of his palms on serenas abdomen as he closed his eyes a smile came to his lips she is pregnant he said opening his eyes again well done your firstborn is to be a daughter i know wulfgar answered quietly serena has been with child for only a few hours i saw the azure glow gather around her the moment conception took place it is good that this happened during rather than after the gifting of her blood for now the child will be born with many of her mothers forestallments intact and will thereby be spared the painful process of their installation wulfgar looked again at the woman he so loved serenas strong beautiful face was placid in sleep framed by the dark ringlets that spilled gracefully down over her shoulders and breasts she wore a black fulllength gown of the finest satin with matching bowed slippers on her feet pure gold adorned her delicate throat wrists and fingers she was a true queen wulfgar thought worthy of standing by his side in their coming struggle with the chosen ones she will command powers of the vagaries that are virtually unheard of krassus said only you will be more powerful picking up one of serenas hands krassus held it as though it were made of the finest porcelain it is now her time in history as well as yours the wizard continued softly awaken her wulfgar let her finally see the world through her newborn eyes this time it was her lovers turn to touch her placing his palm on her forehead wulfgar watched her eyes flutter softly and open immediately she looked up into wulfgars face and smiled he reached out his hand grasping it she slowly sat up on the table then she placed her satin slippers on the marble floor and stood up without hesitation she threw her head back and stretched her body like a cat breathing deeply she smiled again clearly reveling in her newfound power without hesitation she purposefully walked closer to wulfgar placed her arms around him and kissed him on the lips thank you my lord she said simply as she drew one of her long freshly painted nails down his cheek thank you for granting me the time enchantments and for so generously opening the psychic portals of the vagaries and exposing their many wonders to my mind now i am able to serve you not only with my heart but also with my endowed blood i shall be forever grateful suddenly her eyes went wide and she took a quick breath of realization oh she exclaimed as she placed one hand on her belly then she looked back up to him and smiled again a girl it truly seems there is no end to the gifts my lover has bestowed on me krassus held his hands out to them and they each took one come with me he said simply walking them over to a pair of marble double doors he employed the craft and they swung open still holding hands the three of them walked out onto a broad balcony overlooking the sea of whispers the redorange ball of the sun was descending into the ocean and the night birds called softly to one another a gentle sea breeze swirled up bathing everything in its fresh clean scent turning around krassus looked them both in the eyes from this point forward your lives and your blood are inextricably bound to each other he said solemnly and all of what you see before you i bequeath to you and your heirs just as my late master nicholas told me to do if he perished in his travails at the hands of the chosen ones this citadel the fleet the demonslavers the brotherhood of consuls and the island that provides them safe haven are all yours as are all of the many creatures of the vagaries that call this sacred isle their home whether they be of the surrounding earth sea or sky protected by the time enchantments from here you will forever perpetuate the vagaries and strive to destroy the vigors never forget that your enemiesthe socalled chosen ones and their wizardsshall endeavor to annihilate you from their lair in eutracia and so you shall do the same to them from your new home here in the citadel smiling at them both krassus took a deep breath of the sweet sea air almost immediately his coughing began this time it was far worse than wulfgar had ever seen krassus leaned weakly against the short balcony wall as his hacking went on in great uncontrollable spasms finally after what seemed forever it abated krassus turned around to face them again his chin and the front of his blueandgray robe were covered with blood concerned wulfgar reached out to steady him but krassus waved him away do not be concerned for me he said hoarsely as he produced a rag from his robes and began to clean himself as far as my existence in this lesser world is concerned all is as my master said it would be this malady i am stricken withmy fatal gift from nicholaswill soon completely overtake me i estimate that i have scant time remaining before you two are left here without me to accomplish all that has been ordained by the son of the chosen one only two duties remain for me now before i go to the afterlife to secure the scroll of the vigors and to instruct you in your mission letting go another short cough he slowly turned back toward the sea grizelda and janus remain unheard from however he said softly the concern showing in his voice but even if they already had the scroll it would take them fifteen days to return it to us therefore we shall use the time wisely when he turned back to them it seemed he had regained a bit of his strength he smiled and looked to wulfgar first i suggest you show your new queen the wonders of this place he said she will be seeing it all as if for the first time and there is much to learn about its workings after you have finished please join me in my private quarters for dinner and we will begin the first of our discussions regarding your futures tonight finally you are to learn why you have been brought here and why all of this has come about looking across the room krassus pointed one hand at the stillhovering scroll of the vagaries it stopped glowing and then rolled itself up as soon as it finished collecting itself the familiar golden band with the old eutracian engraving rose from a nearby table and floated across to slide down over one end of the scroll then the bound scroll flew across the room into the wizards arms satisfied krassus gave them both a short bow as i said the citadel and everything in it is now at your beck and call until later without further ado he walked slowly from the room after the wizard had left wulfgar took serenas hand we shall take krassus up on his suggestion looking into her eyes he could see that they were alight with curiosity just as his had been after krassus had finally turned him to the vagaries and first shown him the true wonders of this place come with me he said gently he ran the back of his fingers down one of her cheeks there is much to show you leading her from the stark scriptorium he took her down a flight of stairs arm in arm they walked for a long time as they went they would occasionally come across armed demonslavers who bowed deeply to them the same was true of the bluerobed consuls they passed wulfgar would often stop to talk to them without exception they seemed honored to be in his presence but it was far more than that she thought as she walked beside her powerful lord the entire citadel seemed different to her it was far more alive more beautiful and more comforting then she remembered on the surface at least it now seemed a wondrous enchanting place or perhaps it was only she who had truly changed she didnt know regardless the fortress was a wondrous sight to behold rather than being constructed of marble or brick the entire citadel had been hewn from the gray rock that comprised much of the island it looked quite ancient it was as if the workers of so long ago had started at the top of a great stone mountain rising up from the sea and then chiseled away what they didnt want to reveal this massive collection of walls and buildings the island itself was angular and much larger than the area upon which the citadel stood a wide spit of fertile land reached its way east from one end stabbing its long finger out into the sea of whispers this was where the crops were grown and where the livestock was bred tended and eventually butchered for food wells dotted the island supplying fresh water the exterior of the fortress was dark and foreboding it completely belied the beautiful graceful nature of its interior rooms columns and halls most of which were constructed of elegant colored marble taken as a whole the citadel gave one the impression of a great selfsufficient city pilastered crenellated walls surrounded the entire fortress protecting both the inner ward and the various central buildings a single portcullis granted access to the outside the interior of the citadel was made up of many keeps towers and other structures most of them hundreds of feet tall and adorned with leaded stainedglass windows that could be swung open to the sea elegant catwalks extending from balconies connected many of the towers to one another the inner ward surrounding them held magnificently manicured gardens complete with stone walkways magnificent illuminated fountains danced both day and night in the center rising above everything else around it stood a tall spire within its center was a circular stairway leading to the top at its peak there was a broad exposed walkway that completely encircled it from here demonslaver guards could see many leagues out over the sea of whispers in any direction a warning bell was attached to the spire wall waiting to be rung demonslaver warships patrolled the surrounding sea constantly their graceful white sails full as they caught not only the wind but also the last rays of the setting sun many more lay peacefully sails furled at anchor just offshore so many in fact that their numbers virtually filled the waters surrounding the island the sight of so many vessels brought reassurance to her heart but they also brought more questions as well as she and wulfgar walked along one of the many torchlit porticos lining the gardens serena found she could no longer contain her curiosity tell me my lord she asked him who are the demonslavers that serve us where do they come from wulfgar smiled after he had been turned to the vagaries this had been one of the first questions he had asked krassus the answer had both surprised and delighted him the demonslavers serve us in much the same way the minions of day and night serve our enemies the chosen ones he explained krassus has told me of the minions he explained how they were first brought into existence by failee the late wife of wigg the lead wizard and how tristan came to become their current lord and master while it is true that our demonslavers cannot fly they are at the very least just as ruthless and loyal wulfgar finally stopped before a pair of double doors but before i answer your question about the demonslavers there is first something i wish to show you he said pointing one hand to the doors he caused them to open he then took serena by the hand and led her into the room as he did some of krassus words of explanation came back to him despite her transformation she would retain all of her former memories krassus had told him just as he and the many others over the centuries who had been so blessed as to have tasted the joy of the vagaries did and if she truly became one of us the wizard had gone on to say she would love only the vagaries and those practitioners equally devoted to its cause just as the heretics of the guild meant it to be as they entered the room he carefully watched her face they were standing in the room that held the rtalis slavesthe same stark prison in which janus had once forced serena to take her meals in plain view of the poor unfortunates starving before her the chamber was illuminated by many bright wall torches their shadows crisscrossing the beige marble walls even the magnificent table and chair she had been forced to sit at was still here complete with its tablecloth elaborate setting for one and matching gold candlesticks serena slowly walked toward the cages many of the captives started shouting insults at her and waving their arms with rage by now most of them were little more than skin and bones but something was different now serena realized both talis and rtalis slaves were here and the cages were no longer filled to overflowing wulfgar watched serena as she left the slaves and walked the short distance over to the table she ran her fingers over the fine gold plates and utensils as if she loved them revered them then she looked back at the slaves this time instead of weeping for the slaves plight as she had done in previous days she only smiled as wulfgar came closer to her he realized that the vagaries swirling in her blood had truly become a part of her soul he and krassus had succeeded he realized he took her hand and now that you see the world for what it truly is what say you my love he asked serena nodded slowly these puny untrained beings many of whom do not even have endowed blood mean nothing to me she told him i see now that they are no more than human resources for us to mine indeed if my lord would allow it i would like to once again take some of my meals here if for no other reason than to see the looks on their faces it should prove most entertaining do you think you could let me do that my love wulfgar smiled of course he answered but it may not be possible the sand in the hourglass of their lives is running short i dont understand she said taking her by the hand wulfgar led her to a door on the other side of the room as they walked through it serena felt an intense searing heat blast over her and charred dense air came suddenly to her nostrils the demonslaver forges were still in use but would not remain so much longer the slaves dressed only in their soiled torn loincloths worked tirelessly forging the instruments of sudden death that wulfgars demonslavers would soon use in the service of their master the incessant clanging of the slaves hammers and the stale telltale smell of human sweat filled the smoky air the orangered coals in the hearths glowed brightly casting an ocherous aura over everything in the room as they walked purposefully through the chamber the demonslaver guards there bowed obediently then serena noticed one slave whose hands were tied behind his back she stopped to look at him he seemed to be supervising the others as they fashioned the various weapons curious she turned to wulfgar and what of this one she asked should he not also toil in the service of his lord a troublemaker nothing more wulfgar answered they tell me his number is twentynine he will soon be dealt with as shall all of the others here in this chamber when twentynine finally saw wulfgar he immediately recognized him as the same man he had stood next to on the docks the day they first disembarked seeing the slavers bow to the man twentynine realized that he and the woman he was with had somehow become of great importance here knowing he was risking his life he brazenly hurried over to wulfgar the slavers reacted immediately grabbing him and roughly pushing him to the dirt at wulfgars feet with a shiny trident pressing into his back he could raise his face only enough to look up into his new masters eyes wulfgar was intrigued by the slaves wanton display of insolence you know me twentynine pleaded hoarsely in the name of the afterlife tell these monsters that you know me we were together at the docks you looked into my eyes dont you remember why dont you help us his words trailed away as the three sharp tips of the trident lightly punctured the skin of his naked back after emotionlessly examining twentynines face wulfgar looked back up at the slavers i have seen him before he answered coldly but i dont care for his welfare when this group has finally finished their labors and you are ready to dispense with them bring this one to me i want him to be one of the forty the slaver holding the trident to twentynines back smiled wickedly and nodded the forty serena asked quizzically wulfgar smiled you will understand soon enough he answered and he guided her to the doorway at the far end of the room without looking back serena followed him through the next room lay some distance below where they were standing and it was very large its brightness in direct contrast to the room they had just left like the scriptorium this chamber was also littered with white marble tables the walls and floor of the room were constructed of a very pale green marble and the many ornate stainedglass windows in its walls lay open to the night the breeze coming off the ocean filled the air with a cool welcoming scent consuls were busy at work here a great pile of what seemed to be demonslaver clothing lay unexplained in one corner of the room with several slavers standing next to it taking her by the hand wulfgar led serena down to the shiny green floor via a long curved series of steps then a door opened in the wall to their left and a large menacing squad of slavers began roughly herding a group of terrified slaves into the room ninetails cracked out in the air and shiny tridents and swords poked and prodded the unfortunate captives as they moved haltingly along serena recognized some of them as those who had shouted insults at her in the room of cages as she looked at them she smiled they didnt seem so arrogant just now she wondered what wulfgar had meant about the sand in the hourglass of their lives growing short wulfgar snapped his fingers and slavers immediately brought over two luxuriously upholstered red velvet chairs motioning to serena wulfgar bade her sit in one and he took the other then two more slavers appeared bearing goblets of red wine that they offered to their lord and lady wulfgar tipped his glass in serenas honor and took a sip after joining him in the excellent wine his queen turned her attention back to the helpless slaves being paraded before her the group contained both men and women and the brands on their shoulders told her that they were a mixed group of endowed and unendowed blood as the slavers began pushing them toward the marble tables the confused slaves cried out frantically in terror blatantly ignoring their wailing the slavers began hoisting them up onto the tables and tying them down the consuls silent and foreboding in their dark blue robes carefully watched the proceedings unfold when all of the slaves were secured one of the consuls walked forward to stand obediently before wulfgar lowering the hood of his robe he looked up into the commanding hazel eyes of his new master smiling back at the consul wulfgar nodded the consul turned to face the rows of tables then wulfgars servant bowed his head and raised his arms the torches in the room began to dim their light slowly replaced by the azure glow of the craft as the glow encompassed the entire room serena heard soft tearing sounds that gradually became louder and louder as the unusual noise increased so did the screaming of the slaves the two disparate sounds combining to create a bizarre chorus of anguish smiling the consul standing before them lowered his hands and calmly placed them into the opposite sleeves of his robe then serena realized what was happening the twisted loincloths of the men and the simple onepiece frocks worn by the women were being torn apart by the craft they fell to the floor leaving the terrified people on the marble tables naked humiliatingly exposed the consul standing before wulfgar and serena turned back to look at wulfgar after taking another sip of wine wulfgar nodded returning to his work the consul again raised his arms the azure glow in the room increased to a brightness that almost made it difficult to keep ones eyes open the slaves began to writhe painfully in their bonds and scream even louder and then their transformations began first the color of their skin changed into the stark blanched white so characteristic of demonslavers serena watched her mouth agape as the slaves hair began to fall out sliding from their skulls and bodies to drift down onto the various tabletops and the green marble floor then surprisingly their genitalia began to disappear the womens breasts flattened coming to resemble those of the males gasping with disbelief serena realized that what she had long assumed about the demonslavers being male had not been true they were asexual beings made that way by the craft as she watched the slaves fingernails and toenails began to fall away drifting silently to the floor in their place talons emerged suddenly still screaming and struggling against their bonds they all closed their eyes when they opened them again their eyes had been replaced with the white lifelesslooking orbs of the demonslavers then their muscles began to bulge becoming hard and strong their ears lengthened to points and as the victims twisted their mouths with agony serena could see that their teeth had become pointed and black the azure glow slowly faded and the room became strangely quiet as the subjects on the tables finally stopped wailing and lay still their metamorphosis complete turning to look at wulfgars profile serena smiled the creation of the demonslavers was ingenious she thought first the consuls of the brotherhood had been turned and now the chosen ones subjects as wellall aligned against them and their wizards how is this possible she asked wulfgar she took another sip of wine it has to do with something called forestallments he answered simply and they have to do with the craft but for now suffice it to say that the spells for the creation of the slavers were passed from nicholas to krassus who will soon show you how to use your forestallments as i am now able to do he ran a hand down her cheek and when that happens my love it is a wondrous moment of realization your blood will sing i very much look forward to sharing that day with you he leaned over and kissed her then straightened again and now that krassus has found the particular forestallment he wanted so badly and has placed it into my blood signature he is free to convert all of the remaining slaves both talis and rtalis alike into demonslavers we have nearly completed transforming them all he also tells me that only i of all the endowed beings in the world carry this special forestallment in my signature in my heart i know this single forestallment more than any other is the one upon which our struggle with the chosen ones shall soon turn but he has yet to inform me of its nature perhaps tonight he shall then the consul approached wulfgar and bowed wulfgar nodded permission to continue my lord the consul asked of course when you are finished you all may leave after a low bow the consul returned to the tables with a wave of his hand the bindings holding the newly created demonslavers vanished as they did the beings sat up and came to stand on the floor they were directed to the large pile of clothing in the far corner of the room which they used to dress themselves then the newly minted slavers filed quietly out presumably to take up the weapons that were still being constructed in the forge the consuls and senior demonslavers followed in their wake leaving wulfgar and serena alone in the great room rising from his chair wulfgar walked over to one of the open stainedglass windows and looked out lost in thought he took a deep breath and leaned against the window frame the three rosecolored moons were up and the sea below was calm concerned for him serena stood and went to join him linking her arm in his tell me my love she asked hoping to take his thoughts away from whatever was troubling him what is krassus part in all of this to be wulfgar took a deep breath for now we still need him he answered his eyes still leveled on the sea of whispers but not for much longer i believe nicholas only meant for krassus to be a tool an instrument of victory as it were rather than to preside over the victory himself that is to be our task as krassus said himself very soon now he will be dead and when he is we alone will be left to carry the battle to the chosen ones and prevail against their practice of the vigors he turned away from the window and looked around the deserted room very soon now all of the remaining slaves will have been transformed and the struggle can begin but what concerns me the most is that we are still not in possession of the other scroll nicholas and krassus have deemed it important that we have them both in order to ensure our victory and still i do not know why she could see the worry in his eyes krassus asked us to join him for dinner did he not she asked perhaps tonight you will finally get the answers you seek wulfgar nodded his silent agreement and escorted her from the room the walk back to krassus quarters was pleasant and the new master and his pregnant queen talked of many things as they walked along arm in arm the citadel was quiet now the only sounds coming from the lighted fountains as they danced and played in the manicured gardens of the inner ward and the quiet careful footfalls of the demonslavers on patrol finally arriving at the door to krassus private quarters wulfgar knocked lightly once then twice more an armed demonslaver let them in krassus was sitting alone at an elaborately decorated table his back to them as he gazed thoughtfully out to sea enticing aromas drifted up from the sumptuously laid table turning to look at wulfgar and serena krassus smiled there was genuine admiration in his eyes for these two magnificent beings of the craft he had been so privileged to help create lifting one hand he beckoned them nearer come in my children he said softly sit with me this night and we shall talk of the wondrous things to come as wulfgar and serena took their places at the table the demonslaver bowed once more walking out the door he closed it behind him and took up guard in the hall outside chapter fiftythree i still cant believe youre actually here shailiha squealed happily to her brother for what seemed to him to be at least the hundredth time she gave him yet another affectionate hug nearly squeezing the life out of him and causing him to spill his wine on the princes other side sat an equally ecstatic celeste who had embraced him closely when he descended from the litter the hour was late bordering on dawn tristan guessed and he was tired beyond all measure still bloodied and exhausted from the recent fighting he had already eaten several healthy portions of the gnome wives wonderful cooking washed down with a serious amount of red wine not ones to stand on ceremony tyranny and scars had done the same scars eating so much so quickly that the diminutive cooks had been forced to make five separate trips back and forth to the kitchens just for him of course the territorial little women had fussed worriedly over everything but tristan knew that deep down they were secretly delighted looking around the massive oak meeting table in the hall of supplication the prince realized what a disparate group of people had been gathered here it included himself shailihawith morganna playing on the floor close byceleste abbey geldon wigg faegan tyranny and scars or put another way he thought wryly the group consisted of a prince a princess an herbmistress a hunchbacked dwarf from parthalon two irascible wizards a threehundredyearold beauty a female pirate captain her giant first mate a baby and faegans blue cat of course tristan shook his head telling everyone his story would probably last well past sunrise and he needed to hear of all that had transpired while he was gone as well the chamber of supplication was the great hall in which tristans father and the late directorate of wizards had from time to time heard special urgent requests from the populace sometimes if the petition was worthy and within the wizards ethical and magical purview to provide it would be granted the chamber was made of dark blue ephyran marble patterned rugs adorned the floor and light flooded the room from wall torches and the great oillamp chandelier that hung over the table when wigg and faegan had suggested this room in which to talk tristan had quickly agreed he knew that the wizards would not want strangers poking about in the redoubt below and despite the fact that he trusted the pirate captain and her first mate implicitly tristan went along with the wizards request tristans arrival by minion litter had been joyous to say the least upon reaching the coast he had ordered kjarr to fly ahead and tell everyone they were coming as a result every person in the palace had come running out to greet them at once including as many minions male and female alike as could wedge their way into the courtyard being the first one out of the litter tristan had been immediately pounced upon by shailiha and celeste then ox had taken him up in his great arms like a vise hugging him tightly and lifting him high off his feet as he did the other warriors cheered tristan could scarcely breathe ox so glad to see chosen one the huge warrior bellowed ox worried geldon exited next followed by tyranny and scars when the sea captain and her first mate appeared things became a bit awkward to say the least first there had been the issue of scars tristan had known for some time that he had earned the giants grudging respect and with that had come a certain attitude of protectiveness when scars saw ox go for tristan his first instinct had been to free him caught in oxs arms tristan had barely managed to wave scars off but once ox had put tristan down the two giants had begun menacingly sizing each other up not knowing what else to do tristan had impetuously stepped directly between them and made the necessary introductions when both backed off tristan was greatly relieved he could scarcely imagine the outcome had these two giants actually gone after each other and then tyranny had stepped from the litter seeing her rather provocative striped pants and short lowcut leather jacket her dark urchinlike hair flying every which way in the breeze her gold hoops dangling from her ears and her sword slung low down over one hip shailiha and celeste raised skeptical eyebrows shailihas mouth puckered slightly and she gave her brother a quizzical not altogether approving glance celeste simply crossed her arms over her breasts and began tapping the ground with one foot as tyranny descended the litter she coyly held out one hand for the prince to take and he had no other choice but to do so immediately sensing tristans discomfort she couldnt help but take advantage of itpresumably as payback for having made her ride in the litter tristan assumed surmising that one of these two womenprobably the redhead she thoughtmust be the famous celeste tyranny leaned over gave tristan a short kiss on the cheek then linked her arm through his and smiled cattily at the two other women later on a grinning wigg would tell tristan that when all of this happened the princes face had become as red as the lead wizard had ever seen it for his part faegan had simply covered his mouth with one hand and let go a quite unnecessary cough after the rather stiff introductions had been made they had all adjourned to the palace now his dreggan and throwing knives hooked over the back of his chair tristan told them everything in between bites of food and cups of wine he described in great detail his capture his time rowing and his meeting with krassus and the herbmistress grizelda he went on to tell them of his rescue by tyranny the attack by the screechlings their time on sanctuary and their fight with the pirate fleet only hours earlier he also explained how he had marooned the raiders on sanctuary rather than killing them and that he had ordered a small contingent of minion warships to stay behind to guard them he did not however demand answers from them regarding the mystery surrounding the existence of sanctuary for he realized that the two secretive wizards would not wish to discuss it in the presence of two relative strangers wigg and faegan listened to his story intently they asked questions from time to time but for the most part they remained still when tristan finally finished the room went completely quiet the only sound the purring of nicodemus faegans blue cat it was wigg who finally broke the silence it seems we have much to thank you for miss he said turning to tyranny but tell us why did you decide to go demonslaver hunting in the first place it seems like a particularly dangerous occupation to take up even for a person as capable as you appear to be tyrannys face darkened they took my brother she answered and killed my parents in the process i escaped and i have been searching for my brother ever since my family name is welborne and we lived in farpoint my father ran a fleet of fishing vessels there scars and i know the sea of whispers as well as anyone alive then she looked over at tristan and a smile crossed her lips besides she added i am not so easily captured a look of recognition flashed over the lead wizards face the welbornes of farpoint he said a very long time ago i knew such a family there was once a privateer isaac welborne who sailed in the service of the directorate but that was more than three hundred years ago during the sorceresses war isaac welborne was one of my ancestors tyranny said proudly my father used to love to tell the story of how just after the end of the war isaac loaned his battered ship to the newly formed directorate so that they might use it to banish the sorceresses from eutracia the ship was a galleon named the resolve but that was a long time ago it might have simply been the retelling of the story or it might have been due to the lead wizards recent heartrending experiences in the chamber of penitence but for whatever reason wiggs eyes grew shiny he wiped them with the sleeve of his robe tyranny has brought you a pair of gifts tristan added softly she agreed with me that they probably belong here in the palace where they could be protected he gave geldon a nod and the two of them left the room for a moment when they returned they were helping each other carry two rather unwieldy packages each was wrapped in bloody sailcloth and tied securely with ships rope they placed them on the table before wigg then sat down again the lead wizard raised an eyebrow what are they the only way youre going to know is by opening them tristan answered a smile on his face as far as i know even you and faegan cant see through things from the other side of the table faegan gave one of his wry cackles dont be so sure wigg looked down at the crudely wrapped packages he couldnt imagine what they might be nor could he remember the last time anyone had given him something for that matter narrowing his eyes he called on the craft almost immediately the sailors knots began to untie themselves as they did tristan looked over at tyranny and scars to see that their eyes had become as big as saucers as the sailcloth was unwrapped it revealed a worn ships wheelthe one tristan had ordered taken from the peoples revenge just before she went down the other package contained the woodenandbrass plaque that listed not only all the names of those who had commanded the resolve but also the various other vessels the wheel had been passed down to over the centuries by the welborne family rather high up on the list it said wigg lead wizard of the directorate of wizards commander of the resolve the last entry read tyranny of the house of welborne captain of the peoples revenge the wizards eyes welled up with tears as he ran his ancient fingers over the engravings he then looked up at tyranny with genuine affection my greatest thanks child he said softly his voice cracking i couldnt possibly know how to repay you pushing his tongue against the inside of his cheek tristan looked over at tyranny actually he began there is a way and that would be faegan asked suspiciously tristan indicated to tyranny that she should hand over the promissory note when she gave it to him he unfolded it and passed it over to the lead wizard as wigg read the note his eyes went wide he remembered all that tristan had just told them about his recent adventures though and his expression softened a bit still he wasnt convinced that such a huge amount should be paid he finally passed the note over to faegan who scanned the page with a cackle he handed it to shailiha everyone around the table eventually read it after they had quiet settled in as they all waited for the lead wizard to speak wigg looked down at the ships wheel and plaque again then back up at the sea captain forgive me tyranny but i simply must ask wigg said quietly did you give me these gifts just to soften my mood no tristan interjected firmly it was all my idea then he smiled still i didnt think it would hurt wigg shook his head adamantly tristan surely you must realize what a huge sum this is he countered i fully understand that it is the identical amount that was once offered for your capture and as such it may therefore possess some small degree of justification but such a sum is without precedent in the entire history of eutracia such a reward would make tyranny the wealthiest womannay perhaps even the wealthiest personin the entire nation but tristan wasnt about to back down she had saved his life twice and he had given her his word a deal was a deal leaning over the tabletop he looked wigg directly in the eyes then its a good thing were all sitting in the chamber of supplication isnt it he asked wigg seriously what better place to grant such a request he leaned back in his chair and looked around the table again besides he said shortly there are other things i wish her to have as well things that are now in our own best interests to provide and just what might those be faegan asked i want the two of you to grant her letters of marque just as you once did for isaac tristan said these times we live in are no less dangerous than thenperhaps even more so i want you to draw the papers up immediately they are to validate her rights as a privateer to prowl the waters off the coast of eutracia and to attack and commandeer any demonslaver vessels she might run across and any pirate ships that might have slipped away during our recent battle despite the efficiency of the minion fleet given the great scope and confusion of yesterdays confrontation i would be very surprised if at least several of the raiders vessels hadnt eluded us in return tyranny is to give over threefourths of whatever booty she collects to the monarchy the remainder she is free to do with as she wishes wigg looked over at tristan is this all you want he asked sarcastically as a matter of fact there is one more thing the prince answered boldly but it is no less important he glanced over at tyranny to see a look of surprise on her face she and i havent discussed this last issue but i hardly think shell mind he faced wigg again of the pirate vessels that were captured and are now being escorted home by the minion fleet i shall give her one dozen he went on i shall also order my minions to make whatever repairs the vessels might require while tyranny goes about hiring the additional crewmembers she will need he looked back to tyranny again and now it was her turn to smile tristan gave her a wink stunned wigg sat back in his chair as usual faegan produced a broad smile at wiggs discomfiture i hope you have a very good reason for all of this the lead wizard finally replied his voice little more than a whisper as a matter of fact i do tristan replied reaching down into his boot he withdrew the ancient scrap of vellum and unceremoniously placed it in the center of the table a simple piece of vellum wigg asked quizzically i dont understand i believe this came from the scroll of the vagaries tristan said i found it hidden in my boot it was secretly placed there by someone while i was unconscious it matches identically the color and texture of the scroll of the vagaries i saw atop krassus desk on board his ship it was clear that pieces had been cut away from it and i believe this to be one of them i think the pieces are being used by grizelda krassus herbmistress in an attempt to find the scroll of the vigors if thats true it puts them far ahead of us in this race im afraid indeed for all we know they may have already found it someone is trying to help usthat much seems certain but i dont know who that might be in any event had tyranny not saved me this would not be in our possession we may eventually have more to thank her for than we can ever know faegan leaned forward over the table his eyes flashing with curiosity do you mean to say that you have actually seen one of the scrolls yes please describe it for us it was approximately one meter long about half as wide tristan answered it seemed very tightly wound and a golden rod ran down through its center golden knobs adorned each end of the rod what i could see of the parchment was covered with old eutracian a solid gold band also engraved in old eutracian secured the document around its middle and as i said before it appeared that blank pieces had been cut away from its exposed corners presumably to aid krassus herbmistress in her search for the other scroll faegan asked shailiha to hand him the parchment she did so after feeling it smelling it and examining it in the light of the chandelier he placed it carefully down on the table and sat back in his chair as was so often his habit he stared out at nothing mindlessly stroking his cat well wigg asked impatiently this is made of the same material as the tome of the paragon faegan said therefore this agesold sample may well have been produced by either the ones who came before or by the guild of the heretics but no matter which faction produced it this ancient scrap adds weight to tristans argument that it was taken from the actual scroll of the vagaries he sat back in his chair amazing he added softly his words trailing off wigg asked to have the scrap passed to him after examining it he handed it to abbey what do you think he asked her gently can you use this to find the other scroll perhaps she mused as she looked it over but needless to say the process must go as planned i have no desire to repeat the calamity that occurred in the courtyard what calamity tristan asked that is a topic best left for later wigg answered making it obvious that he did not want to speak of it before tyranny and scars right now however i would like to make my decision regarding your captain friend several quiet moments passed as the lead wizard weighed his options then he turned his brilliant aquamarine eyes toward tyranny and she felt their power go straight through her tristan held his breath i will grant all that tristan asks in your behalf wigg said to her solemnly as he says it is probably now in our own best interests to do so but before i do you must agree to two provisos and those are tyranny asked first that you conduct all of your nautical activities under our aegis alone wigg answered sternly this shall also be spelled out in your letters of marque the news that piracy has resurfaced in eutracia is disturbing to say the least so far your unsolicited services to the monarchy have been exemplary therefore i will grant all that the prince has asked for on your behalf but should we receive any word that you are using your funds or your newly acquired fleet to violate eutracian law or to enhance your own wealth outside of what shall be allowed by the letters of marque we shall take swift and decisive action against you in addition you are to visit the royal palace no less than once every three months at which time you shall relinquish our percentage of whatever bounty you have taken and give us your written reports sitting back in his chair wigg placed his hands flat on the tabletop my second condition is that all of your expensesincluding the purchase of further vessels their maintenance and repair and the payment of your crewsmust come either out of your share of the booty or the funds that have come your way as a result of this bargain he added as part of this agreement we may rescind our letters of marque at any time of our choosing and for any reason we deem necessary that is how it has always been even going as far back as isaac but until you see fit to retire or we see fit to retire you it seems you now work for us young lady as does your rather huge very quiet first mate tyranny had barely dared dream that the things the prince had told her might be true much less that she would be granted such gifts and privileges she looked over at scars and he nodded his approval she turned back to the table thank you she said softly her voice cracking thank you all oh dont thank me quite yet wigg answered with a sigh i havent written out a proper letter of marque in over three centuries im not even sure i can remember how one goes for all i know i may end up giving you the recipe for pheasant under glass everyone at the table laughed then tristan decided that it was time for him to reveal what might be tyrannys most valuable secret of all there is something else that our new friend has agreed to provide us with he said as the table finally quieted down she believes she has actually seen the island fortress where krassus is keeping the slaves she has marked it on her charts and is willing to make duplicates of them for us is this true child faegan asked breathlessly this time scars decided to speak it is indeed he answered for his captain in his booming voice when we first came upon the fortress i marked out our position and entered the location on the charts myself everyone except geldon tyranny and tristan turned toward the wartorn barechested colossus uh thank you scars wigg said awkwardly as this was the first time hed heard the eloquent first mate speak i should like to receive those copies of your charts at your earliest convenience the newly minted privateers nodded back dawn would soon be creeping through the windows and everyone around the table was clearly exhausted still there remained things that wigg desperately wanted to tell tristanthings that couldnt wait and that could only be said in private he looked up at the group geldon i would be very thankful if you would escort our two new guests to their rooms where they might finally get some rest he half asked half ordered faegan and i must speak to the prince in private now geldon tyranny and scars all stood wigg looked up at them and smiled sleep well he told them tomorrow there will be much more to discuss an eartoear grin on her face tyranny walked over to wigg and bent down to kiss his cheek the lead wizard turned red then she turned and followed geldon and scars to the door but before going through she stopped and walked back to where tristan was sitting raising her right hand to her face she spat into her palm understanding the prince stood and did the same he then slapped his palm into hers done he said and done she answered back and thank you turning on her heel she walked out the door with tyranny and scars finally gone wigg turned his aquamarine eyes toward the prince he didnt waste any time getting started much has happened while you were away he said solemnly and very little of it has been good tristan listened intently and for the next two hours the people he cared for so much told him of all that had happened in his absence when they were done tristan slumped back into his chair stunned there was so much new information to absorb his mind didnt know where to begin then faegan gave him the most recent piece of news the minion patrols have informed us that no demonslaver activity seems to be taking place anywhere in the kingdom the ancient wizard said none of their slave ships have been spotted within the minions flying range from the coast for the time being at least we seem to be free of them thinking for a moment he gave nicodemus another stroke on the head but that can only mean one thing no one had to tell tristan what that was if they have given up taking slaves that means they have finally found wulfgar he said softly sadly he looked over at shailiha and clasped her outstretched hand and if krassus now has both the scroll of the vagaries and wulfgar our futures will be very dark indeed for a moment his thoughts went to the half brother he had never seen had never even known existed until only a short time ago what was wulfgar suffering at the hands of the wizard krassus tristan wondered were they soon to become mortal enemies finding his reflections too painful to cling to his mind sheered away what about the isle of sanctuary he finally asked tyranny says that there were papers left behind that seem to indicate the directorates involvement and there are some extraordinarily beautiful buildings there some of which im sorry to say have been desecrated by the pirates how is it that we have never heard of this place until now sighing wigg looked over at faegan and waited for the inevitable reaction it wasnt long in coming yes please do explain faegan said with a frown it was suddenly clear to everyone that even he did not know about sanctuary and if there was one thing faegan couldnt abide it was being left in the darkespecially when the subject had to do with the craft the isle of sanctuary was not created by the directorate wigg explained at least not in the sense that we could cause an entire land mass to suddenly rise up out of the sea of whispers we do not possess such gifts im sorry to say the island already existed it was uninhabited of sufficient size for our needs and had not yet been charted it therefore seemed perfect faegan had already been taken prisoner by the coven at that time so he had no knowledge of it but why would you require such an island father celeste asked the tome ordered us to create a secret place of the craft wigg answered softly a sanctuary for the vigors as it werehence the name it was to be a place far away from prying eyes it was to be a sacred place to be used only by the chosen ones who would eventually come into our world given that description this site couldnt very well be the redoubt now could it as i said the island seemed perfect for our needs the buildings were constructed soon after the formation of the directorate the moment the buildings were completed a strange immovable fog bank surrounded the island to this day i neither know how nor why yes i remember now faegan said to himself as he reached back into his amazing memory there is such a command in the tome but as far as i knew it had never been carried out he leaned back in his wheeled chair thinking further sanctuary must be the sacred place from which the chosen one finally combines the two sides of the craft he finally exclaimed he trained his graygreen eyes on wigg im right arent i faegans words suddenly painfully reminded tristan of the fact that the wizards still refused to train him in the craft or allow him to wear the paragon because of the unknown nature of his azure blood he thought of the savage whipping he had suffered and how the strangely colored blood dripping down onto the filthy deck had caused fear and distrust among the other slaves i believe you are wigg told faegan but as yet there is no way to validate this hypothesis now given what we have learned here today where does this knowledge lead us he sat back in his chair patiently awaiting the answer silence reigned again until morganna tired of her toys fussed for shailiha to pick her up as shailiha lifted her daughter into her arms she grasped the implications of wiggs riddle krassus fortress she said so softly that the others could barely hear it is meant to be the direct antithesis of sanctuary isnt it the secret asylum of the vagaries the place from which the heretics of the guild mean to have their servants stop us from attempting to combine the two sides of the craft she hugged morganna closer to her chest in a protective embrace the citadel tristan breathed to himself what wigg asked curiously the citadel tristan repeated thats what it is called we know this because scars was able to force it from one of tyrannys captured demonslavers yes of course faegan said to himself i understand now sanctuarya sacred place of the vigors where tristans process of combining the two opposing arts might go forward in peace and the citadelan equally sacred place of the vagariesa place of darkness from which the process shall be killed indeed wigg replied and now wulfgar and the scroll of the vagaries presumably reside there both of them under krassus control if all that we have just deduced is in fact true it now seems that the crisis before us is of even greater magnitude than we first thought tristan looked back down at the piece of vellum he had risked life and limb to bring home we have to find the scroll of the vigors he said thoughtfully it seems the only chance we have of unraveling what this is all about he looked tiredly over at the herbmistress can you really use your gifts to find it he asked her if the sample you brought back is genuine then yes we have a chance she answered but it will not be simple and it will require all of my powers to accomplish turning to wigg she placed one of her hands over his but im tired and i need to rest before i try she rubbed her brow if you like we could all reassemble at midday in the courtyard then we shall see what we shall see and what about the herbs you said abbey needs tristan asked faegan have they been separated again will they work this time or blow us all sky high his fatigue also beginning to show faegan closed his eyes and shook his head the plants and roots wigg and i brought back from the chambers of penitence finally dried out and we were able to use them to separate and categorize my other stores he answered it was a long amazing process to behold but whether they will work properly is still anybodys guess i suppose at midday well find out wigg stood then i suggest we all try to get some rest it seems that in a few hours we may need it testing the sleepy muscles in his legs tristan also stood he felt as if he had been awake his entire lifetime after retrieving his weapons from the back of his chair he walked over to shailiha and celeste and gave them each a kiss its good to have you home celeste whispered into his ear and when you have the time there is something i would like to tell you she hugged him again and held him close as if never wanting to let him go the myrrh in her hair drifted up to him reminding him of so much he had thought he might lose forever its good to be back he answered her sleepily youll send someone to wake me smiling at him celeste nodded he walked to the door turned to smile at them all again then gratefully left the room his dreggan and throwing knives draped loosely over one shoulder the serpentine hallways of the palace yawned back at him as he went the heels of his knee boots rang out sharply reminding him of how lonely life could sometimes be in this massive overpowering place and of how many people had once constantly come and gone through these beautiful halls and of how relatively few did now from time to time he would come across a lone minion sentry silently standing guard at one of the many hallway intersections each sentry bowed and snapped his heels together as tristan passed but it was all he could do to nod back in return finally he found himself back at his own quarters dropping his weapons into a nearby chair he pulled off his clothes and tossed them aside then he walked to the open stainedglass windows and looked out for a moment the first rays of dawn were finally scratching their way up over the horizon and the birds had begun to sing smoke rose lazily from the minion campfires curling its way into the sky finally closing the windows he drew the heavy red velvet draperies across them naked he slipped in between the cool silk sheets of his bed paradise he thought in mere moments the chosen one was fast asleep chapter fiftyfour c ome with me my love wulfgar said to his queen there is still more i wish you to see dawn had broken over the citadel several hours earlier bringing with it the promise of a fine day the sea was high again and the white sails of the constantly patrolling warships dotted the ocean like so many floating daisy petals after sharing their evening meal with krassus the previous night both wulfgar and serena were now fully aware of all the details of their impending mission as he walked alongside his queen the new lord of the citadel could feel his endowed blood almost sing with the promises such a venture held and soon very soon now it could all begin wulfgar led serena across the magnificent gardens of the inner ward as they passed down one of the many stone walkways bees buzzed birds sang and the beautifully blooming flowers trees and shrubs filled the air with their scents finally reaching the western side of the compound wulfgar walked along the shaded portico lining the inner wall then came to a stop before two imposing doors guarded by armed demonslavers as he and serena approached the slavers bowed deeply calling upon the craft wulfgar caused the doors to open he took his queen by the hand and they walked in serena had seen many wondrous things here at the citadel but none compared to the splendor that lay before her now the room was huge and its entire western side lay open from floor to ceiling to reveal both the sky above and the sea below the floor was fashioned of dark green marble shot through with swirls of the palest gray a series of black columns rose from the floor to support the rather low ceiling in one corner of the room stood krassus in his blueandgray robe turning his thoughtful gaze from the sea he bowed serena acknowledged his presence with a nod then she heard the sounds of splashing water looking to her right she saw several women of about her own age naked except for the flowers in their hair happily bathing in a descending series of ornate marble pools the scented water splashed down from a wide curved trough in the wall above seeing serena the women stopped what they were doing stood and bowed to her turning serena looked questioningly back to wulfgar they are your new handmaidens he said to her i selected them myself from the few rtalis slaves who remain alive their minds are now ours and they have been granted the benefits of the time enchantments they are yours to command for all of eternity my lords gifts are truly great she said smiling she took one of his strong hands into hers and kissed it gently come he said beckoning to her there is more he led her toward the open side of the room where two thrones of black marble sat overlooking the sea on either side of the thrones stood a huge freestanding column of dark red marble each of them was circled by garlands of violet flowers and topped by a shallow black urn in which burned a bright flame from the edge of the shiny floor a series of wide dark green marble steps led down to the sea the stairway was lined by more freestanding columns each topped with a flaming urn the steps emptied out onto a broad terrace that lay just above the waves that continuously rolled over its leading edge the clean salty sea air drifted up to serena and stirred her dark ringlets the train of her magnificent black gown snaking along behind her as she went wulfgars queen walked tentatively over to touch the smooth cool marble of one of the thrones as she did it was as if the massive seat of power suddenly sparked something deep inside her she could feel her rtalis blood graced as it was by the presence of so many forestallments of the vagaries begin to swirl hotly quickly through her veins and like her lord she was filled with the urgent need for their sacred mission to begin krassus walked over to touch serenas arm bringing her back to the moment smiling the wizard walked her back over to wulfgar and the three of them looked out over the sea come krassus said to them simply and they descended the marble steps to the terrace there serena could see that their entire fleet of slaver warships had stopped patrolling and had formed a massive protective ring in the sea before them within the ring lay a great expanse of open water bring them wulfgar krassus said quietly bring them all theyre yours to command now by way of the gifts i have imbued into your blood bring them so that your queen may know the many that now do your bidding with a nod to the wizard wulfgar turned to face the sea and raised his arms almost immediately the vacant area of ocean surrounded by the demonslaver vessels seemed to come alive with huge swirling eddies then the watery tornadoes rose from the ocean and into the air dark impenetrable maelstroms as serena watched breathlessly they started to glow and turn colors spinning so fast that they became fluid riots of alternating hues wulfgar spread his fingers as he did several of the screechlings that made up one of the packs spun off and flew to where the three of them were standing after circling them for several moments the screechlings returned to the maelstroms that continued to whirl just above the waves suddenly another area of the sea began to churn and serena saw hundreds of menacing serpentine heads rise up slowly out of the sea their eyes were yellow and slanted with vertical black pupils each of the menacing heads was covered with dark red scales and was a good two meters across pink forked tongues slipped in and out of mouth slits as the creatures tested the air occasionally the beasts forked tails would rise up out of the water only to submerge again as they slithered their way through the waves suddenly serena noticed a softly distant pounding it grew in strength soon blotting out every other sound even the crashing of the waves against the edge of the terrace looking up she saw the source of the rising cacophony in their eagerness for their mission to begin the thousands of whiteskinned demonslavers aboard the warships were standing at attention on the decks relentlessly banging their swords on their shields wulfgar finally lowered his arms and turned to his queen she saw a determined powerful look in his eyes that she knew could never be conquered as the ceaseless pounding continued she turned back to the sea and took his hand krassus smiled chapter fiftyfive w hen tristan first heard the knock on the door he wanted whoever it was to go away and let him sleep in peace why couldnt they all just leave him alone hadnt he done enough he rolled over hoping whoever it was would go away the knocking came again even more insistent this time tristan realized that it sounded more like someone kicking at the door than knocking on it shannon the short he thought sent by wigg to come and wake him up he threw off the sheets and hobbled stiffly over to the chair in the corner where he grabbed up his trousers and pulled them on then he went to the door and opened it celeste stood there smiling at him she was dressed in black formfitting riding breeches black knee boots and a lowcut yellow silk blouse that was ruffled at the neck and wrists her dark red hair tumbled down over her shoulders tristan could smell the familiar fragrance of myrrh and it helped to awaken his senses in her hands she held a large silver tray its contents covered with a lid she gave him an unnecessary highly coquettish curtsy are you going to make me stand on ceremony all day your highness or are you going to let me in she asked then she nodded at the tray in her hands after all i bring gifts oh over here tristan said he led the way to the opposite side of the dim room where he drew back the drapes and opened the stainedglass balcony doors revealing a bright clear day celeste her eyes on the tray followed him and carefully placed the food on the balcony table how much of the day has gone by he asked sleepily it is nearly midday you have had only five hours of sleep but im afraid its going to have to do we are due to meet the others in the courtyard in one hour she lifted the lid from the tray spotted quails eggs she said with another smile poached just the way you like themor so the gnome wives in the kitchens tell me cured ham slices gingerwheat toast with violetberry jam and teaextra strong and extra hot and all enough for two she placed her hands on her hips and turned to look at him then she puckered up her mouth and shook her head youre a mess she said giving him a grin she took in the shadows on his face from not having shaved the comma of dark hair lying down over his forehead and the dirty trousers shall we eat first or do you wish to bathe eat he said with authority as he poured himself a brimming cup of the dark hot tea he took a sip and felt its warm goodness go all the way down bless you he said as he gingerly sipped some more suddenly remembering he was still half naked he put his cup down and walked back over to the chair to fetch his vest as celeste watched him go for the first time she saw the angry stillhealing scars across his back and her eyes went wide with concern as he walked back to her he looked up from lacing his vest and immediately understood taking her hands into his he saw that her eyes had become shiny its all right he said softly they dont hurt as much as they once did reaching out he touched her cheek did krassus do that to you she asked her face darkening with anger in a way these marks are from my time on the slave ship one of the demonslavers did this celeste looked down for a moment then he shall have to answer for what he has done she said so softly he could barely hear her that wont be necessary placing one hand beneath her chin he raised her face back up to his he has already answered he added gently to me silence reigned for a few moments you lead such a dangerous existence she said bravely trying to hold back her tears it would be safer for you if you stayed here in the palace one corner of tristans mouth came up it would be safer for me if i were someone else altogether he answered with a smile but we cant do much about that now can we no she said a hint of a smile returning i suppose not come and eat he said leading her back out in the sunshine i for one am famished im not sure ive ever seen you when you werent she chided as they sat down across from each other as they sat and ate in the sunshine celeste told him a bit more of what she knew about abbey and the prince expanded on his experiences with krassus and the pirates of sanctuary as they talked tristan couldnt help but notice a very discernible change in celeste she seemed more alive more spontaneous happier than he had ever seen her as he took another bite of the gingerwheat toast he innocently told her so when he did a more thoughtful look came over her does this have anything to do with what you said you wanted to talk to me about he asked gently celeste put down her teacup and looked into his eyes im finally free she said softly free he repeated free of ragnar she answered i will of course never forget my time with him but my horrific memories and nightmares no longer haunt me while you were away he came to me in a dream it was so real that i was sure i was awake he had returned from the dead somehow and had used the craft on me so i couldnt move he was going to abuse me again right there and then and return me to the caves but when i awakened from my dream my mind fought back this time and my anger finally came flooding out when it did something inside of me just snapped and the grip of his terror over me was broken taking his hands she closed hers lovingly around them im finally free tristan she said softly free to live laugh and love her eyes anxiously searched his face trying to discern what he was feeling the way it was rightfully meant to be she added the way it should be between a man and a woman his heart full tristan stood bringing her up with him pulling her close he held her for a long time when she finally took her face away from his shoulder he saw the tears in her eyes again is it too late she asked softly at first tristan didnt understand reaching up he dried one of her eyes too late for what he asked does tyranny mean anything to you her body trembled slightly and her voice was barely audible is it too late for you to love me closing his eyes for a moment he pulled her closer dont you know by now he asked her it has always been you from the first moment i saved you at the edge of that cliff and looked into your eyes feeling her body rise up to meet his he looked down at her open mouth and realized the time for words had ended reaching into her hair he gave it a sure but gentle tug as he did her body bent willingly beneath him and he put his mouth down on hers he looked into her eyes she smiled and cried and laughed and cried again her tears coming freely now she rested her face against his chest and held him so tightly that he thought she would never let go with his hands he turned her face up and pressed his forehead against hers at that moment tristan understood that he had never truly loved before certainly not in just this way nor ever with so full a heart and just what do you suppose your father will have to say about all of this he asked with a little laugh i have no idea she laughed too but i know i love you with all my heart and nothing in this world will ever change that i promise you and i you he answered softly taking a deep breath of selfdiscipline she tore herself away i have to leave she said and you need to clean yourself up her sapphire eyes seemed to stab right through his heart i will see you in the courtyard with a final smile of goodbye she walked to the door and left him alone with his thoughts long after she was gone he could still smell the myrrh in the air tristan walked back out to the balcony and looked down at the remains of the breakfast she had brought him and then stared out over the peaceful countryside realizing his lips still held the memory of her kiss he slowly grazed his fingertips over them it was then that the longawaited understanding finally came whispering its way into his mind and so it begins chapter fiftysix b y the time tristan had bathed dressed and finally reached the courtyard the sun was nearing its zenith abbey wigg faegan and shailiha were already there waiting for him caprice shailihas violetandyellow flier of the fields was perched calmly on the princess outstretched arm shailiha had left her daughter in the care of the gnome wives tristan assumed as he joined the group he gave celeste a knowing smile seeing tristan wigg scowled and loudly cleared his throat and now that were all finally here tristan paused in midstride glancing at wigg he sighed and pursed his lips the lead wizard turned to abbey are you ready he asked running one hand worriedly through her thick saltandpepper hair the herbmistress nodded perhaps this time our luck will hold she looked over at faegan the paragon hanging around his neck sparkled in the sun but given the fact that we still do not completely understand the furies i suggest we take some protective measures she added we have postulated that the furies arise only when the blood of the chosen ones is involved in this process but we also must admit that our understanding of this remains limited i have no desire to relive what happened the other day to that end i have a suggestion faegan looked up from his chair indeed he replied what is your idea can you use the craft to fashion something to contain my gazing flame abbey asked him something that would be strong enough to shield me from the furies if need be but that my hands and my gifts might also be able to actually reach through so that i still might accomplish my work faegan nodded there is a variation of the wizards warp that should do raising his arms he called the craft as he did the familiar azure glow appeared then the glow coalesced into a gleaming transparent cube sitting silently before them on the grass of the courtyard open at the top it was about five meters high and another five meters across on each side tristan guessed that faegan had left the cubes top open purposely so that if the process erupted the force would go upward harmlessly releasing its power into the sky faegan lowered his arms that should suffice he said thoughtfully i have fashioned it to be as strong as i know how yet also accommodate your other demands but what you need to understand is that whenever a warp is constructed so that one may pass any part of his or her body through it by necessity some of its inherent strength is lost he went quiet for several moments i certainly hope it will be enough he added casually his sense of understatement not lost on the others then it is time for me to begin abbey said quietly she held one of her arms out toward faegan the herbs i specified faegan untied the leather cinch bag from around his waist and handed it over to abbey then the herbmistress turned to wigg and the fragment from the scroll of the vagaries as wigg took the vellum from within his robes he looked down at it and a look of concern crossed his face tell me abbey he asked her do you need all of the vellum to view the other scroll while the relative size or quantity of the matching item is important it is not so critical to the process as the quality and quantity of the herbs she answered why do you ask because if this thing blows up in our faces i would prefer that we only risk half of the vellum rather than all of it do you think you could be successful using only one half perhaps we wont know until we try nodding wigg looked over at faegan what say you he asked i think we should proceed faegan said knowingly but we must also tell them the other reason we wish to divide the vellum in half and what might that be shailiha asked quizzically consider the following faegan said as he pushed his chair closer while its true that tristan brought us the vellum and that we believe it came from the scroll of the vagaries we still have no way of knowing who put it into his boot or even why for that matter since only krassus and the woman tristan describes as grizelda supposedly had access to the scroll logic would dictate that it had to be one of them but why would they do such a thing they certainly do not wish to aid us in our search for the scroll of the vigors but there is one thing krassus and his herbmistress very much would like to see us accomplish on our own he added wryly and what is that celeste asked to die tristan said softly half to himself he looked over at the wizard in the chair thats what youre getting at isnt it you and wigg believe that krassus and grizelda have somehow enchanted the vellum to destroy us should we try to use it to view the other scroll an enchantment set to enact with the onset of abbeys flame angrily he shook his head how could i have been so blind he groaned i might have gotten us all killed dont be so hard on yourself wigg said laying one hand on the princes shoulder faegan and i came to this hypothesis only hours ago ourselves as we were examining the vellum tristan scowled as he thought about it all then he suddenly realized that part of the wizards theory made no sense but how could he know i would escape he asked from the story you told us there was no way he could have faegan answered but youre a very resourceful individual and your reputation precedes you we believe he may have enchanted the vellum and then placed it into your boot as an additional strategy should you somehow actually find your way out of your predicament think about it why else would krassus show you the scroll as anyone in your position would do you immediately associated the piece in your boot with it and tried to bring the vellum back to us as quickly as you could pausing for a moment faegan cast his evercurious eyes over at the vellum wigg still held in his hand if you failed to escape it wouldnt matter he continued if you did he was prepared given the desperate nature of our situation he is no doubt counting on the fact that we will hurry in our attempts to employ his little gift without first considering the consequences faegan took a deep breath and he was very nearly proven right deeply discouraged tristan shook his head so what do we do now he asked we do what we came here for wigg answered provided of course that abbey is still willing to try after everything she has just heard we can hardly condemn her should she choose to decline and so the other reason why you want to divide the vellum in half is to lessen its deadly effects should krassus have actually enchanted it tristan surmised well done wigg replied he looked concernedly over at abbey are you still willing to try abbey shook her head just how strong is this warp of yours she asked faegan as powerful as i could make it faegan answered but there are no guarantees sighing abbey rubbed her brow then she looked up at wigg and gave him an ironic smile i just had to come back to tammerland with you didnt i she said ruefully glaring back at faegan she raised her eyebrows is there nothing else that can be done to help protect me she asked surely that legendary brain of yours can come up with something looking up at the sky faegan took a few moments to mull it over there might be something he said finally and what is that wigg asked if i begin to see the cube eroding wigg and i can try to shore it up again faegan answered slowly thinking out loud though by then it might already be too late he looked up into abbeys eyes do you trust me to keep you alive he asked seriously obviously unsure abbey hesitated is there any other choice she finally asked resignedly when neither of the wizards answered she gave a short derisive laugh then she bent over and put her mouth near faegans ear if you let me die ill kill you she said fully realizing the absurdity of her words faegan let go a soft cackle if you die ill let you he answered now then shall we begin but first i suggest that the rest of you retire to a much safer distance wigg if you would wigg nodded then turned to face the new brick wall he and faegan had conjured that morning upon coming to their disturbing conclusions raising one arm wigg loosed an azure bolt against it when the bolt reached it it flattened out encasing the wall entirely apparently satisfied the lead wizard dropped his arm just another little precaution in case something should go wrong faegan winked now then i want everyone except abbey and myself behind that wall wigg watched them all go then gave abbey a kiss on the cheek good luck he said quietly then he joined the others the wall was just tall enough for the three of them to see over when faegan was satisfied that the others were safe he looked at the herbmistress please give me the scrap of vellum once she did so he used the craft to divide the ancient skin in two he returned one piece to her then nodded you may begin whenever you are ready he told her and may the afterlife look over us taking a deep breath abbey opened the leather cinch bag faegan had given her and removed two smokecolored bottles taking a pinch of herbs from the first bottle she tentatively reached through one side of the cube watching as its azure wall closed in around her arm finally satisfied she dropped the herbs to the floor of the cube and withdrew her arm closing her eyes she bowed her head almost immediately the familiar golden flame erupted slowly snaking its way toward the open top of the cube abbey reached back through the side and cast a few more of the herbs into the flame roaring even higher the gazing flame gained strength and color abbey removed her hand from the cube and backed away a bit raising one arm she silently commanded the flame to split into two separate branches the smaller of the branches angled toward her opening the other bottle of herbs she carefully measured some out then reached into the cube again and dropped the herbs into the nearest of the branched flames the two branches rejoined returning to the vertical placing the two bottles on the ground at her feet abbey took the piece of vellum in both hands and raised it high as she watched the fire a rectangular azure window appeared in its midst within its confines an image slowly formed faegan wheeled his chair closer to the edge of the cube and peered in a street scene was unfolding it looked like a plaza of some kind but which city faegan wondered and for that matter which country eutracia or parthalon trying to examine the image was maddeninglike trying to solve a shimmering constantly moving puzzle with several of the pieces missing but then faegan saw the familiar statues the plaza of fallen heroes he realized the scroll of the vigors was there in tammerland right under their noses but suddenly the piece of vellum in abbeys hand began to quiver and turn azure nearly beside herself with fear the horrified herbmistress turned to faegan get out she shouted she shoved her arm into the warp and dropped the ancient scrap inside immediately she hiked up her skirts and charged toward the protective wall shaking off his shock faegan levitated his chair and soared over the courtyard to join her and the others as they all watched in horror the vellum in the cube began to emit strange pinpricks of light with the birth of the lights came great screeching sounds so loud that the people behind the wall could barely stand the pain in their ears the pinpricks became shafts and the shafts increased in size and began ricocheting against the inner walls of the cube some of them soared up through the open top screaming their way into the empty sky above the entire cube shook and jumped violently on the grass and then the walls of the cube began to crack like sharp threatening crevices wending their way through melting ice the fissures in the walls of the cube started to lengthen levitating his chair over the top of the wall faegan hovered there and raised his arms then he loosed an azure bolt at the disintegrating cube trying to shore it up against the power of the shrieking beams of light straining with effort faegan began to shake tristan watched in dread as the walls of the cube continued to shake split and crack hurrying out from behind the wall wigg shot another azure bolt against the cube but even with the lead wizards added power it was clear that faegans warp was deteriorating it wouldnt be long now tristan realized before more of the beams of light were unleashed then he heard faegan scream something out to wigg the lead wizard quickly nodded as one they both sent out azure bolts to lift the cube from the ground the piece of vellum still inside it using all their power they began moving it over to one side of the courtyard near the northern wing of the palace transfixed tristan realized what the wizards were about to do his jaw dropped were they insane with a great final heave the wizards shoved the cube toward double sidebyside stainedglass windows it tore through them as if they were made of paper and kept on going tristan watched aghast as the flashes of light screamed within the castle chambers they lit up the rooms with what looked to be lightning strikes he heard furniture being rent apart glass breaking and interior walls tumbling and crashing sections of the palace roof heaved throwing marble pieces high into the air some of the beams of light escaped and tore their way across the courtyard to slam into the opposite wing of the palace at last it was over dust and debris choked the entire courtyard into its midst swarms of concerned minion warriors landed dreggans drawn coughing deeply tristan shailiha and celeste walked out from behind the wall to rejoin the wizards faegan tristan exclaimed what in the name of the afterlife just happened never mind that now the wizard shot back anxiously waving his arms tristan wasnt sure he had ever seen him so animated the scroll of the vigors is in the plaza of fallen heroes im sure of it but its on the move and it seems to be wrapped in something as if its current owner is trying to hide it this may be our only chance to bring it back then he looked over at abbey i want you to remain here he ordered her youve done all you can for now the rest of you come with me we have to get to the stables but tristan had a question and he urgently grabbed faegans arm what about the minions shouldnt they help no faegan said thoughtfully this must be done very carefully pausing for a moment he looked over to shailiha to see that caprice was still perched on her forearm wasting no time he quickly beckoned the princess to him faegan whispered something to her shailiha raised the arm holding caprice and closed her eyes after several moments the flier launched herself into the air and flew away abbey watched in silence as wigg tristan shailiha and celeste sprinted from the courtyard faegan levitated his chair again and went soaring along beside them in mere moments they had rounded the corner of the partially destroyed palace and were gone completely exhausted abbey stared out over the hissing rubble and tried to fathom what had just happened no quick answers came turning back she looked apprehensively toward the corner where her friends had disappeared slowly tiredly she began making her way back to the palace chapter fiftyseven a s tristan sat atop pilgrim at the edge of the plaza of fallen heroes a sense of foreboding crept over him finding the scroll was going to be difficult at best and for all he knew krassus might also be here searching the sky he finally found caprice as she soared gracefully above all of her senses on alert ordering any of the fliers this close to ordinary citizens was always a risk but faegan obviously thought the stakes were too high not to employ her talents on the way to the plaza faegan had shouted out his orders tristan wigg celeste and faegan would approach the square from different directions then wait quietly on horseback at its outer edges shailiha would walk calmly to the center and wait from above caprice would have an excellent view of the scene and it was hoped would silently inform shailiha when she spotted the scroll when shailiha moved the rest of them would quickly follow her and converge on the scroll from different directions assuming it was still here tristan thought he could just make out wigg faegan and celeste as they waited nervously atop their horses at different spots on the plazas outer edges they were wearing dark blue consuls robes to help hide their identities to the wizards great consternation tristan had refused to wear one claiming it would interfere with quick access to his weapons he glanced back at faegan and one corner of his mouth came up in admiration since their battle with the demonslavers at the docks tristan had learned that it was very painful for the crippled wizard to sit a horse but somehow faegan was able to partition his mind and control the pain and the prince knew that the inquisitive wizard wouldnt have missed being here for the world as he stared out across the plaza his jaw hardened this wasnt much of a plan he thought then again there hadnt been much time to formulate one reaching behind his right shoulder he grasped the hilt of his dreggan and gave it a short tug making sure its blade would not stick if called upon then he did the same with the first three of his throwing knives as pilgrim shifted his weight beneath him tristan leaned one arm down on the pommel of his saddle and glued his dark eyes on his sister a re you ready piglet marcus asked rebecca encouragingly he could see that she was very afraid in truth rebecca wished that marcus would just forget about the silly old scroll but she also knew that this was the day he had worked so hard for and when his mind was made up it was made up leaning against the brick wall of the alley she took the weight off her clubfoot and looked down at the old wheelbarrow in it lay the scroll wrapped once again in the rug that marcus had stolen maybe this was for the best she finally thought at least after today she wouldnt have to watch it glow anymore she looked tentatively up into her brothers hopeful green eyes i guess im ready she said softly what do you want me to do marcus smiled thats my girl he said he pointed out into the plaza to the booth where he had purchased the bird for her to release do you remember that stand he asked her and the bird i bought for you biting her lip she nodded very soon now a man will lead a horse over next to it hes big and fat and has a white mustache there will be several bags tied to the saddle once i think he is alone i will walk out with the wheelbarrow speak with him for a little bit and then exchange the horse for the wheelbarrow that will be all there is to it but when i leave the plaza with the horse you must do something for me from where you will be standing you must watch and see if anyone is following me if youre sure they are i want you to run to me straight away ill hoist you up on the horse and well make a run for it but if no one is behind me then well meet later in our usual spot do you understand rebecca nodded her foot ached and she just wanted all of this to be over where do you want me to stand she asked quietly do you remember the place i showed you earlier this morning the one by the corner yes stand there from that spot you should be able to see everything marcus glanced out into the plaza time was getting short and if the artifacts dealer was truly coming he would be here soon only within the last hour the scroll had glowed again and marcus found himself as anxious to be rid of it as becca was bending down a bit marcus took becca by the shoulders and looked into her frightened brown eyes you can do this for me cant you piglet he asked as he searched her face your part is awfully important i couldnt do it without you you know looking up at her brother rebecca did her best to smile marcus looked nervously out into the plaza again i think you should go now he said and try to remember everything i told you very soon this will all be over and well be free taking a deep breath rebecca stood away from the wall and limped out into the sunlight after taking only a few steps she turned and looked back at her brother for a moment as she did marcus held his breath then she turned back to the teeming plaza and kept on going he watched the back of her tattered plaid dress for as long as he could until it finally melted away into the crowd his breath coming quickly now marcus leaned against the wall closed his eyes tight and desperately hoped that he had just done the right thing turning back to the bird booth he fingered the springloaded knife in his pocket and waited g rabbing mr worth by his expensive sweaty collar janus slammed him up against the nearest wall of the empty artifact shop worth shook with fear grizelda smiled then the painted freak looked down at the three heavy canvas bags lying nearby on the otherwise barren floor its time he whispered nastily time for me to obtain what i came all this way for as he smiled his red mask crinkled up at the edges reaching down to his belt he removed the twin iron spheres and held them up before worths frightened eyes i am deadly accurate with these he hissed emphasis on the word dead and my friend and i wont be far away so dont get any bright ideas about doublecrossing me or your head will soon be lying all by itself on the bricks of the plaza he smiled you could then be called one of the fallen heroes how deliciously ironic do you understand my instructions you fat bastard sweat running down his face worth nodded janus let worth go and he and the shopkeeper wrestled the heavy moneybags outside and onto the waiting horse m arcus looked out from the darkness of the alleyway right on time worth was leading a bay mare over toward the bird booth three bulging bags were tied to the saddle marcus forced himself to wait for a few moments before going out with the wheelbarrow let the artifacts dealer sweat a bit he thought might make him easier to deal with should he have suddenly acquired any new ideas slowly carefully marcus picked up the handles of the wheelbarrow and pushed it out into the light as marcus approached the shopkeeper seemed almost overjoyed to see him marcus carefully put down the wheelbarrow and looked around then he trained his skeptical eyes on worth is it all there he asked simply uh er yesyes of course worth stammered as if he didnt know what else to say all thirteen thousand reluctantly leaving the scroll for a moment marcus walked over to the mare uncinching the first of the three bags he pulled it open and worked one hand all the way to the bottom to pull out a coin at random after carefully examining it in the sun he bit down into it testing its worth then he repeated the procedure with the other two bags finally satisfied he tied them back up and looked at the sweaty shopkeeper now its your turn he said quietly no one had to tell worth what the young man meant walking to the wheelbarrow he unrolled part of the rug to expose a large section of the magnificent scroll as he did marcus winced whether out of greed stupidity or some other foolish reason the idiot was exposing far too much of his newly acquired treasure to the world but that wasnt marcus problem any more sensing victory he looked back into worths eyes i t is here mistress where in the center of the plaza near the booth with the captive birds it is hidden in a wheelbarrow you must hurry well done gathering up her robes shailiha quickly looked around then she started to make her way toward the booth at the same time a strangely dressed man with a painted face and a grizzled old woman in rags began moving in the same direction t ristan didnt hesitate as soon as he saw his sister move he walked pilgrim out into the busy plaza looking around he saw that faegan wigg and celeste were already converging on her tristan saw shailiha come to a stop near a wooden vendors stand and watched as she looked around searching for the scroll then the prince finally saw it the scroll seemed to be partially wrapped in somethinga rug perhapsand it was lying in an old dilapidated wheelbarrow a fat redfaced man was bending over and about to make off with the scroll barrow and all knowing he had to hurry tristan spurred pilgrim into a gallop across the cobblestoned yard that was when everything started to unravel faegan had also seen the scroll and was quickly nearing the man with the wheelbarrow as he did the fellow seemed to suspect something and began to run pushing the barrow as fast as he could raising one arm faegan sent a bolt of the craft toward him forcing him to drop the barrow amazed all worth could do was to look up with horror as the prize he so coveted literally floated away on the air citizens standing nearby began to scream and point then they began to scatter running away from the frightening azure bolts of the craft as he charged toward the center of the plaza something else suddenly caught tristans attention he saw a young man eyes wide with terror mounting a bay horse his saddle was loaded down with what looked to be heavy canvas bags the boy whipped his mount in an attempt to get away turning pilgrim hard tristan raced to catch the boy who was just passing a wooden booth laden with birdcages then the boys overloaded mount slipped on the cobblestones and went down hard sliding directly into the side of the wooden booth with a great noise the spindly booth shattered sending pieces of wood flying everywhere many of the birdcages were destroyed and the larks inside them flew out in every direction in a maelstrom of fluttering wings surprised by the birds pilgrim reared as he had done so many times before tristan automatically shifted his weight forward in his saddle and confidently rose with his horse but he hadnt seen the spinning orbs that were already flashing their way across the plaza nor did he realize that the stallion he loved so much was about to save his life the orbs janus had thrown were meant to take the princes head from his shoulders and if pilgrim had not reared up at the last moment that is exactly what would have happened instead of the orbs finding the prince they found the stallion winding their connecting cord around pilgrims raised forelegs the orbs viciously drew them together and cracked them in two as if they had been matchsticks as he came back down to land on his front legs again the sharply fractured bones ruptured the skin screaming insanely pilgrim went down hard on his left side trapping tristans leg beneath him still unsure of what had just happened tristan tried desperately to free himself but couldnt he instinctively reached back for his weapons but to his horror he found them gone with his fall they had all scattered and lay just beyond his reach that was when he first saw the painted face leering down at him the man was dressed like a bizarre harlequin and he held a shiny dagger in one hand saying nothing he calmly walked around pilgrim to come and stand over the helpless prince he smiled as he raised his dagger its blade twinkling in the midday sun the wizards would later say that the azure bolt that tore across the plaza was among the brightest they had ever seen it tore into janus back and exploded with a force so great that it nearly killed tristan as well janus literally blew apart organs and bones flying for meters in every direction then what was left of him dropped sloppily to the ground next to the prince opening his eyes tristan found himself littered with blood and offal the dagger that had nearly killed him lay nearby still clutched in the harlequins severed hand then he felt a strong pair of hands beneath his arms pulling him free finally rising up on shaky legs and still dazed tristan steadied himself and looked around the plaza was almost completely deserted celeste stood a short distance away the fingertips of her right hand were scorched and red and smoke rose from them softly curling its way into the sky next to her stood shailiha who wore a tragic look on her face on her outstretched arm sat caprice the giant butterfly gently opening and closing her wide diaphanous wings wigg stood near tristan in his craftstrengthened grip the wizard held the collar of the young man tristan had seen trying to escape on horseback the three canvas bags floated beside him in the air a young clubfooted girl was also with him desperately clutching the young man wigg held and sobbing hysterically next to shailiha stood grizelda krassus herbmistress held prisoner inside a wizards warp she was angrily waving her arms and shouting vile curses at them with a wave of one hand wigg promptly took away her powers of speech looking further tristan saw that the fat man who had tried to make off with the scroll lay dead facedown on the cobblestones a knife sticking out of his back then the prince felt a comforting hand on the back of his shoulder he looked up to see faegan the wizard was still atop his horse in his arms he cradled the scroll of the vigors but like everyone else the wizard looked upset not triumphant what is it tristan asked softly sensing that something was very wrong one simple awful word came down to him pilgrim tristans daze evaporated and he whirled around to find the stallion still lying on the ground an unfamilar weapon tangled around his legs tristan felt his heart tear in two both the stallions forelegs were smashed and bleeding in horrific pain pilgrim whinnied weakly as he saw the prince look at him dropping to the ground tristan gently cradled the horses head in his lap his face stern wigg gave the care of the young man and the crying girl over to faegan then he placed his hands into the opposite sleeves of his robe and came to stand next to the prince tears flooding his eyes tristan looked beseechingly up at his old friend and mentor but deep in his heart he already knew the answer with a tear in one eye wigg slowly shook his head crying freely now his body shaking with grief tristan held pilgrim closer can you make it painless he asked his voice cracking coming nearer the lead wizard placed a hand on tristans shoulder of course he answered softly for what he knew would be the last time tristan gently stroked pilgrims velvety muzzle i will never forget you he whispered as if somehow understanding pilgrim whinnied back to him softly without looking up tristan nodded wigg raised his right arm the dappled stallion closed his eyes uncontrollably shamelessly tristan raised his tearstreaked face to the sky and cried like a child chapter fiftyeight c ome back to me safe my love serena said to wulfgar placing one hand on her abdomen she looked up into his hazel eyes both i and your unborn daughter will be anxiously awaiting your return as he stood with her on the stone terrace overlooking the ocean wulfgar reached out to touch her face wish me luck he said softly for it is all about to begin then he turned to look at krassus the ailing wizard was sitting in a chair taking in the last rays of the slowly setting sun we both thank you for all of our gifts wulfgar said to him if i never see you again rest assured that i will not stop until i have accomplished all that i have been charged with thanks to you the chosen ones shall soon suffer a fate even they could never have imagined smiling krassus looked up at his two magnificent creations it is not me whom you and your queen should thank for your gifts he answered weakly nor for the mission with which you have been entrusted it is the heretics of the guild upon whom you should shower your gratitude and undying loyalty for they in all their glorious wisdom are the ones who are ultimately responsible not only for your powers but also for the mission you have been honored to carry out taking a short painful breath the wizard cast his dark gaze back out over the sea and do not weep for me he added softly i am only thankful that i could live to see this day and entrust all the wonders of this place to you he lifted his head and looked wistfully up at the sky very soon now i shall go to them and i do not fear it it is my reward and i welcome its coming wulfgar walked over to the wizard bent down and gently kissed his creased weathered cheek then he turned and embraced his queen he had no need to remind serena that by now all of the remaining slaves had been turned to their cause save for the forty who had been placed in confinement aboard his personal ship or that a specially selected group of demonslavers had been left behind to guard the citadel as had the consuls under his command for these things his queen already knew wulfgar had by now enacted all of serenas forestallments in his absence his servants would obey all of serenas orders as unquestioningly as if they had been his own krassus had at first been against wulfgar starting out on his quest so soon for they were not yet in possession of the scroll of the vigors but in truth wulfgar was now far beyond the wizards control in such matters besides the consuls had recently come to him to say that the scroll of the vagaries had glowed suddenly and unbidden and krassus knew exactly what that meant krassus senses told him that wigg and faegan had employed the vellum he had slipped into the princes boot by now they had most probably perished in the attempt due to the enchantment he had so ingeniously placed upon it if the wizards of the redoubt were dead wulfgars chances of success had increased exponentially especially since neither of the chosen ones was trained in the craft but he had told wulfgar that there was no way to be certain until he arrived in eutracia even so it seemed the future now belonged to wulfgar and serena and so he had finally given his blessing to the early commencement of wulfgars mission the new master of the citadel reached out and snapped his fingers at a pair of armed demonslavers who approached immediately they briskly escorted him to the end of the terrace and down the short steps to the sea the three of them climbed aboard the skiff tied there and one of the slavers set it adrift then the creatures began rowing their master out toward his waiting flagship placing one hand over her eyes to shield them from the setting sun serena looked over the scene it was an aweinspiring sight the moored demonslaver fleet stretched nearly as far as the eye could see each was heavily loaded with arms and provisions and slavers by the thousands could be seen amassed on the decks their sails furled the vessels swayed peacefully in the water the gentle movements belying the deadly nature of their purpose vast numbers of screechling maelstroms darkened the surface of the waves and beneath them mere shadows writhed the hordes of sea slitherers as she watched the sails of wulfgars flagship finally unfurled and snapped open to the wind the flagship snaked its way amid the others and began to lead the way west toward the open sea the sails of the other vessels followed suit and filled with wind one by one the warships of the great armada began plowing their way toward eutracia the screechlings and slitherers following obediently in their wake serena and krassus stood there for some time watching the departing fleet disappear over the horizon after finally bidding good night to the wizard the queen of the citadel walked up the marble steps that led to the throne room and proceeded on to her private quarters k rassus continued to sit silently as the night gathered around him shivering from the cold he pulled his grayandblue robe closer and thought of all that he had been able to accomplish and of the wonders that wulfgar and serena would yet live to see it was then that he finally felt the oncoming sensation and he knew that it was over finally giving way to their disease his lungs ruptured once and for all and he began drowning in his own blood it flowed warmly from his mouth and splattered down on the floor of the terrace as if in slow motion krassus fell gently from his chair with his passing came a sudden wind then lightning tore across the night sky in unbelievable streaks its branches seeming to reach everywhere as the howling wind increased it roiled the sea causing the waves to smash violently into the edge of the terrace and then the wind and the lightning slowly abated leaving the dead body of the wizard silent and still in the pale rosetinted moonlight a ll of her oil lamps extinguished except one serena was about to retire then she saw the lightning flashes and she knew raising one hand she caused the transparent wall that had once barred her entrance to the balcony to vanish carrying her lamp out onto the balcony she looked over the ocean as the wind and the lightning finally relented she smiled to herself taking a breath she blew out the light part v retribution chapter fiftynine it is not for myself that i go forth to do this thing but for all of those who came before who tried but failed in their attempts to ensure that the vagaries shall one day rule supreme wulfgar g lad to be home finally tristan sat drinking wine at a butchers table in the palace kitchens it was early evening and wigg and faegan sat there with him along with the young man named marcus the massive hearths were directly behind them copper pots and pans hung overhead dangling from iron hooks when the gnome wives had first seen the two dirty halfstarved children they had insisted on feeding them immediately regardless of whatever the wizards might have to say about it the wonderful smells of the womens creations still hung stubbornly in the air tristan felt mournful the loss of pilgrim had been a shock that he knew would take a long time to recover from at least the stallion had not died in vain they had successfully secured the scroll of the vigors and for that he was glad the document was safe and sound locked below the palace in the hall of blood records but before they examined it the two wizards wanted some answers and they were determined to get them as soon as they could after tristan had removed pilgrims saddle and bridle wigg had lowered his head to call the craft and set fire to the horses body at first tristan couldnt bring himself to watch but in the end he had finally looked over tearfully doing his best to honor the companion that had seen him through so much then wigg had respectfully done the same thing with the body of the artifacts dealer and what was left of the harlequin as wigg went about his work frightened citizens had begun to mill tentatively around the edges of the plaza but upon seeing the lead wizards use of the craft none of them had approached on the way back to the palace wigg had explained to the prince what had unfolded in the plaza wigg had been the first to see rebecca run away suspicious of such a young obviously terrified girl running through the square he had ridden his horse over to her and scooped her up as for the artifacts dealer it seemed that it had been grizelda who had so conveniently plunged the dagger into his back they still didnt know who the bizarre harlequin had been but they hoped that the herbmistress would soon shed some light on that subject as well for now she was securely locked behind one of the hundreds of doors deep in the bowels of the redoubt the clubfooted girl named rebecca had been too terrified by what she had seen to be of much help with the wizards questions seeing this shailiha and celeste had requestedand receivedpermission to take her away to feed her bathe her and reassure her as best they could now the wizards wanted to hear from the young man named marcus his knife had been discovered and taken from him on the way to the palace so far the dirty curlyhaired redhead had barely stopped eating and there seemed to be no end to the amount of food he could consume now then wigg began what is the name of your family house first things first marcus answered arrogantly as if he owned the palace he was sitting in he kept on chewing as he talked where is my thirteen thousand kisa reaching out he rudely swiped up yet more of the sliced lamb and stuffed about three bites worth into his mouth all at once chewing hurriedly he washed it down with another glass of goats milk after wiping his mouth with his sleeve he turned to look greedily at tristans wine goblet give me some of that and ill gladly tell you who i am he said confidently it seems the least you could do i didnt ask to come here you know with a brief snort faegan smiled and shook his head but it was clear that the lead wizard didnt think any of this was particularly humorous knowing that marcus was still hungry wigg called on the craft almost immediately all of marcus precious food and drink rose into the air the young mans eyes went wide then wigg caused all of the dishes to go flying out the kitchen door and into the adjoining hallway without taking his eyes from marcus wigg folded his arms across his chest and calmly leaned back in his chair with that everything fell crashing to the hallway floorthe dishes smashed the food ruined and the drinks spilled frozen in place marcus stared at wigg as if the wizard had just descended from one of the moons leaning in wigg cast his aquamarine eyes sternly at the young man and lowered his voice now that i have your full attention lets try again shall we he asked quietly what is the name of your family house lowering his face slightly marcus scowled and placed his greasy hands on his lap stinton he finally answered the house of stinton and where are you from ilendium wigg raised an eyebrow and the girl you travel with shes your sister is she not marcus nodded rebecca he added softly i call her becca i see wigg said a bit more compassionately and your parents what of them they must be worried about you theyre both dead killed by the great birds that came one night becca and i are orphans on hearing about the great birds wigg looked at tristan and faegan they nodded back marcus had to be referring to nicholas hatchlings the winged beings that had so ruthlessly destroyed the city of ilendium just before the construction of the gates of dawn im sorry faegan said softly from the other side of the table he was beginning to have genuine admiration for the brash young man even if the boy was a thief master stinton was nothing if not resourceful he decided how was it that the two of you were not also killed faegan asked becca and i had gone fishing at the head of the sippora river we used to like to do that sometimes and it was helpful especially when father wasnt doing so well but the fishing had been good and we were very late getting home that night by the time we did everything was gone im sorry too wigg said earnestly but what did you mean about your father not doing so well what was his trade marcus smiled again and puffed out his chest with pride my father was a pickpocketthe best in eutracia he could slip one hand into your drawers and come back out holding your private parts if he chose to long before you felt the draft and im just as good if i do say so myself sighing wigg placed one hand over his forehead closed his eyes and leaned his elbow on the table he shook his head slowly tristan tried hard not to smile and where did you get the scroll wigg asked without looking up we found them in one of the broken marble sections left over from the destruction when those monuments or whatever they were fell to the ground marcus answered simply it was clear he did not understand the importance of the site he and his sister had visited everything there stayed so hot it took a week before becca and i could do a proper search of the place he went on we were on our own by then and looking for food then he smiled again but that wasnt what we found wiggs face shot up you said them do you mean to say that both scrolls were there when you first went in yes but they were so heavy i could only take one and there was no way becca could handle the other especially with her bad foot later i came back for the other scroll but it was already gone somebody beat me to it how did you get the scroll to tammerland tristan asked in the rowboat we always used to fish out of it was my fathers on the way down the sippora we fished so as to eat kept us alive and was it always your intention to sell the scroll tristan asked his admiration for marcus also growing of course what would i want to keep the damned thing for tristan smiled and how did you find the artifacts dealer i asked around it wasnt hard i had an appointment with him today to finally exchange the scroll for the kisa he was the only one i trusted but he wont be doing any more business will he from that point on you know the rest then marcus face darkened im sorry about your horse he added thank you tristan replied so am i wigg had apparently heard all he needed he stood and walked over to one side of the kitchens to give a tug on a velvet pull cord in a few moments a minion warrior appeared take this young man to the princess quarters so that he may rejoin his sister wigg ordered see to it that he is cleaned up and given some decent clothes i want one of you to keep an eye on him and his sister at all times they seem to have an unusually high predilection for larceny the warrior clicked his heels together as you wish wideeyed at his first glimpse of a minion marcus was slow to rise from the table before leaving he turned around and looked back at wigg ill make a deal with you he said sighing wigg shook his head again i am the lead wizard of the directorate he answered and i am not in the habit of dealing with pickpockets especially young ones can you cure beccas clubfoot marcus asked for as long as i can remember it has been her dream to come into your chamber of supplication and request an audience for your help if you cure her ill even let you keep the bags of kisa as i remember you no longer have the money wigg answered it rests with us now but leave it to you to bargain with something you dont have however i did notice rebeccas foot if it is within our powers to help we will but right now i want you to go marcus we have urgent business to attend to wigg then nodded to the minion and marcus was escorted from the room im assuming our urgent business is now with grizelda faegan said indeed wigg answered and it should prove most interesting the three of them stood from the table and headed for the redoubt o n the way tristan requested that they go by the great hall the room into which faegans warp and krassus destructive beams of light had been tossed he was very curious about how much damage had been done as they approached the room and walked in the sight before them was disheartening to say the least krassus powerful light shards had caused the walls to crack and tumble in many places and the ceiling was torn by a number of great ragged holes through which the encroaching night sky could be seen glass dust and smashed furniture lay everywhere a work party of male and female minions was already going about the business of trying to return the room to its former glory but that would take time tristan realized if it ever came about at all wigg walked slowly through the rubble bits of glass crunching beneath his boots with a great sigh he shook his head and turned back to faegan and the prince such a shame he said but at the time it was all i could think of to contain the lights even then i had no way of knowing whether krassus enchantments might take the entire palace down in a way we were very lucky the power behind his spell was great indeed faegan added thoughtfully and very cleverly wrought your solution worked had the shards impacted anything softer than stone the results would have been catastrophic after a last look around the three of them finally proceeded to the redoubt as they came to stand before the doors faegan called the craft and unlocked them inside grizelda was still trapped within the azure wizards warp when she saw them enter her lips turned up into a sneer tristan looked at the herbmistress she had changed little since that day on krassus flagship he took in the long dry gray hair that hung haphazardly down around her weatherbeaten face her long hooked nose and the tattered dirty brown robe wrapped around the gaunt body she glared back at the prince with venom in her eyes good evening tristan said politely i hope you find the accommodations to your liking at least here we dont force anyone to row but should you prove uncooperative im sure something like it could be arranged so you escaped after all grizelda sneered my compliments but your capture of me wont do you any good chosen one i will never give up the things you so desperately need to know i have a new lord now and i wont betray him your days are numbered and are dwindling rapidly soon i shall be free again and you are in wizards warps to emphasize her point she spat wetly against the inside of her cage your manners leave something to be desired tristan answered back he turned around to face the wizards for a moment charming isnt she faegan and wigg came the short distance to tristans side is krassus holding wulfgar prisoner at the citadel faegan asked her bluntly has the lost brother of the chosen ones been turned to the vagaries grizelda smiled again that much i will answer because of the joy i shall feel when i see the looks on your faces besides it does not matter for you can never stop him now obviously relishing her next words she paused for a moment you are quite wrong in assuming that wulfgar is a prisoner of the citadel she answered at last by now he is most certainly its masteras well as the master of all the demonslavers and the other creatures of the vagaries that have been newly conjured for his use raising one of her long thin arms she pointed an accusatory finger at the three of them blasphemers she whispered ominously wouldbe destroyers of the sacred side of the craft you can never defeat wulfgar for he already possesses powers that you could only dream of he will soon set things right just as they should have been eons ago things have been set into motion that you in your feeble exclusive practice of the vigors couldnt possibly begin to understand things that even nicholas himself left undone wulfgar is coming for you of that you may be assured and no power on earth can stop him why is it that you follow the vagaries wigg asked grizelda smiled you are familiar with the concept of forestallments wigg nodded krassus imbued my partial signature with the forestallments that finally brought my blood and mind to the light she answered proudly just as i am sure he has also done for wulfgar by now and wulfgar may do the same for you pausing she smiled again assuming he doesnt kill you outright of course she looked at the prince and her smile widened it seems we shall soon see whether endowed blood is truly thicker than water who was the harlequin tristan asked i had never seen him before merely an unendowed servant of krassus grizelda replied he had his uses but was of no real consequence in truth i cannot say i am sorry he is dead what purposes do the scrolls of the ancients serve wigg asked urgently grizelda shook her head adamantly then she smiled again and made a clucking sound with her tongue clearly you havent been listening she answered no more questions wigg looked over at faegan would you like to do the honors or should i faegan asked i will wigg answered because she is only of partial blood it shouldnt prove too difficult the lead wizard walked closer to the gleaming cage as he did the herbmistress eyes widened and she scrabbled toward the back of the cube wigg closed his eyes and began to call the craft tristan recognized what the lead wizard was doing he was employing his powers to probe her mind in an attempt to glean the answers to their many questions fascinated tristan watched the process unfold as grizelda felt the power of the wizards consciousness entering her own a look of horror crossed her face and then somehow things started to go terribly wrong placing her hands on either side of her head she screamed on hearing her cry out wigg opened his eyes and immediately ceased the spell but by then it was already too late tristan watched in horror as the herbmistress shook her head violently and screamed again insanely he couldnt believe his eyes her face was beginning to melt away tristan gasped as grizelda bent over in exquisite agony the skin ran from her face in steaming rivulets to reveal the barren white skull beneath her green eyes drooled their way out of the sockets and flowed down what was left of her cheeks dead she collapsed to the floor of the warp then her blood started to run from the remains of her mouth ears and empty eye sockets to gather in steaming pools on the floor of the cube the blood rushed from wiggs face stunned he took a halting tentative step toward the cube what have i done he gasped what in the name of the afterlife just happened wheeling his chair closer faegan looked carefully down at the roiling blood and then examined the rest of what used to be krassus herbmistress apparently satisfied he wheeled his chair back a bit and looked up at wigg it wasnt your fault he said this would have happened no matter which one of us had employed our gifts on her what do you mean tristan asked i suspect that this was yet another of krassus safeguards designed to keep us from getting too close to the truth he answered do you see how her blood steams she admitted that krassus laid a forestallment into her signature to bring her to the vagaries i now think he gave her another one as wellone specially designed to make her blood boil the moment her mind was invaded particularly the blood that was collected in her brainthe very seat of the answers we needed so badly but will now never possess pausing for a moment he thought to himself how clever he added softly the tome makes mention of such bloodboiling devices of the craft but i am not adept at them had i been i might have been able to stop this but even then i doubt that what would have been left over could have been much good to us tristan finally tore his eyes away from the horror in the cube and looked at the wizards krassus has been ahead of us every step of the way hasnt he he asked sadly placing his hands into the opposite sleeves of his robe the lead wizard nodded slowly and if grizelda was telling the truth then wulfgar is now of the vagaries and returning to eutracia with his demonslavers do you believe what she said tristan asked anxiously with a deep sigh wigg nodded i believe her because its too dangerous not to saying nothing more all three looked at one another then they made their way out of the archives and back to the palace above there were plans to be made and they were clearly running out of time chapter sixty s tanding atop a grassy knoll tristan gazed out over the cavalon delta and the sea beyond the wind was high again just as it had been for the last seven days a contingent of minion warriors led by the everfaithful ox stood some distance away by the litter that had carried tristan here waiting obediently in the midday sun the minion fleet had arrived four days earlier with the captured pirate vessels in tow and all of them were now anchored offshore more than four hundred shipssome long narrow and built for speed and others wide and slow but made for carrying heavy loadslurched gently up and down against their moorings all of the red banners that had once graced the pirate ships mainmasts had now been removed and the ships had all been repaired for her part tyranny had not been content simply to stand by at the palace like some dainty ladyinwaiting three days of uselessly prowling the rooms and grounds had been quite enough for her despite finding herself immersed in their relative luxury tristan smiled it seemed that no matter how much tyranny hated traveling by minion litter the wonders of the palace had clearly been no match for the constant intoxicating lure of the sea scars had of course accompanied her here tristan had been here for the last three days as well he had brought with him not only the kisa he had promised tyranny but also the letters of marque the lead wizard had prepared both of which were now safely aboard the frigate she had chosen as her personal flagship in truth tristan had been glad to come here for there had been little for him to do in tammerland with grizelda and the harlequin dead and marcus already questioned there was no one left to interrogate since wigg faegan and celeste were the only three among them who could read old eutracian they had vanished into seclusion in the depths of the redoubt in order to attempt to unravel the mysteries of the scrolls of the ancients they were all desperate to discover the purpose it served and why wulfgar was on the way with his demonslaver fleet as he looked out over tyrannys fleet tristan smiled the mainsails of the twelve frigates she had chosen now carried a bright red image of the paragon painted squarely in their centers in addition each also flew his blueandgold battle flag high atop its mainmast he took a deep breath of sea air and knew he would miss being out there again a part of him longed simply to cast away his responsibilities and go with her and scars the sea had quickly become a part of his blood and he had greatly enjoyed the freedom and sense of adventure that had come with it looking down the knoll he saw tyranny and scars approaching as she came nearer the privateer smiled traax told us wed find you here she said quietly as she turned to look out over the fleets the breeze was having its way with her short dark hair well be leaving soon she said her voice cracking a bit i want to clear the delta before the evening winds abate i understand tristan answered quietly there was a genuine look of both sadness and admiration in scars eyes as he held out one of his huge meaty paws it has been a pleasure he said sincerely taking the giants hand tristan gripped it firmly and for me he said then he smiled if you come across any more demonslavers twist a couple of them apart for me will you smiling scars nodded back then he turned and walked slowly back toward the shore where tyrannys personal skiff lay waiting have you picked out a name for your new flagship tristan asked her yes she answered she is now the reprisal appropriate dont you think looking down to the sea tristans eyes finally found the ship she was tall and proud just like her new captain and his battle flag snapped back and forth atop her mainmast yes he answered softly yes i do where will you go first farpoint it is a short sail from here there we will release the slaves and hire the additional crew we need to man the ships properly it shouldnt take long then it will be on to the open sea to search again for my brother and begin patrolling for you and your wizards whatever demonslavers or remaining pirates we run across we will do our best to make short work of i promise you then she looked down at the ground and began using the toe of one boot to push some grass back and forth as if she suddenly needed something to do shes lovely tristan she said softly as if it was suddenly difficult for her to get the words out celeste is a very lucky woman not quite knowing what to say tristan nodded then tyranny smiled again and looked back up but this isnt goodbye forever you know she added you cant get rid of me that easily i still have to come back to the palace every three months to split the booty and give you my report remember so it seems ill still occasionally be in your hair at least for a while anyway then she came closer looked deeply into his eyes and gave him a soft slow kiss on one cheek farewell chosen one she said softly i shall always remember you saying nothing more she turned and followed scars to the shore tristan stood on the knoll and watched as they climbed into the skiff and the giant first mate rowed them out shortly thereafter the freshly painted sails of the reprisal snapped open and she gracefully moved away from the delta the eleven others in the newly formed fleet followed suit as one by one they heeled southeast toward farpoint slowly the paragon image on their sails shrank until they finally crept over the horizon and were gone b y the time the minions returned him to tammerland night had fallen tristan walked from the courtyard into the palace and directly down into the redoubt eventually he found himself standing before the doors of the hall of blood records just before tristan had departed for the coast wigg and faegan had mentioned that they were going to enchant all of the doors in the redoubt to temporarily open without the use of the craft so that celeste might be able to come and go among these chambers more freely without a wizard present they had also made mention of the fact that they would do the same for the thousands of drawers containing the blood signature records should they need someone to fetch one or more of the documents for them time was precious and the wizards were striving to be as efficient as they could hoping that the two mystics had been true to their wordbut also that he would not find them here workingtristan grasped one of the gold doorknobs and gave it a turn the massive mahogany doors obediently parted and he walked in there was no one there as he had expected all of the oil lamps in the great room were burning looking over to one side he found what it was he had come to see the tome of the paragon the massive giltedged white leather book lay open on its pedestal the special light in the ceiling shining down on it as always as he ran his hand lovingly over the ancient wrinkled pages he tried both to understand everything that had happened to him and to beat back the disappointment he felt in his heart the beautifully penned words in old eutracian stared back up at him uselessly their meaning completely hidden from his mind he had of course known he wouldnt be able to read it without wearing the paragon around his neck that was not why he had come but for some reason he had suddenly felt an unexplainable irresistible urge to be near the great book and as he stood there looking down at it he realized that this was the first time he had ever been truly alone with it he finally took his eyes from the tome and looked over to the many long flat drawers that held the blood signatures after staring at them for several quiet moments he decided to give it a try prince tristan of the house of galland he said loudly much the same way he had heard wigg and faegan do several times before at first he felt immensely foolish speaking out alone into the room this way foolish that was until one of the drawers obediently opened and a sheet of parchment rose from it to float over and land on the nearby meeting table tristan sat down in front of it taking a deep breath he looked at the azure signature on the page it was the one made most recently when wigg and faegan had been trying to determine whether nicholas had indeed been tristans son he immediately recognized the soft fluid lines at the top that had come from his mother morganna and the harder sharper lines at the bottom from the blood of his father nicholas i but no one else in the world possessed a signature that was azure except for nicholas he reminded himself and he is dead as tristan continued to regard the swirling azure lines the feelings of disdain for his blood surfaced again then he heard the door hinges creak a bit and he turned to look wigg stood quietly in the door frame there was no telling how long he had been there tristan he said gently are you all right the prince nodded i was walking by and saw the open door wigg went on as he came to sit next to him he looked down at the parchment on the table what are you doing here all by yourself as tristan turned to look at him wigg could see the concern in his eyes there are things you need to know the prince said softly ive changed wigg and i have to tell someone im listening wigg answered compassionately part of it is about my azure blood tristan said quietly i have come to hate it not only can my enemies immediately recognize me by it but it also makes me feel distinctly isolated from the rest of the world and the fact that it is azure keeps you and faegan from training me and also from allowing me to wear the paragon so that i might finally read the tome and as long as that is the case my destiny can never be fulfilled nor can that of my nation he rubbed his brow in frustration i dont blame the two of you for not training me he went on softly how could i but sometimes my blood makes me feel like an outcast especially when i am among the ones i love the most im not angry that my blood is endowed i still cherish that fact with all my heart and my desire my need to learn the craft burns as hotly within me as ever but if i dont soon find a way to return my blood to what it once was sometimes i think ill go mad leaning back in his chair he looked to the ceiling he suddenly realized that simply telling all of this to someone he cared about had made him feel a bit better i understand wigg said i can see it in you we all can but there simply hasnt been time to properly search for the solution to your problem and to tell you the truth we dont really know how but i know your answer is out there somewhere and together one day we will find it but just now i must tell you that we have far greater concerns to worry about tristan placed his forearms on the table and looked into the wizards eyes youre talking about the scroll of the vigors arent you he asked what have you learned wiggs face darkened we would prefer to inform everyone at once after we are sure he answered as you know during her time in the caves celeste was forced by ragnar to learn old eutracian we will never know what use for that he had plannedbut it is without a doubt the single good to come out of those years of torture anyway she faegan and i have been deciphering the scroll for a week now and we have never seen anything like it it is absolutely amazing it opens up entire new vistas of the craft that had been previously closed to us but please be patient for just a bit longer we hope that by tomorrows dawn we will be sure and if what we suspect is true then what we have found in the scroll represents the greatest peril we have ever faced a short silence followed as tristan looked down at the azure signature again and considered the import of the wizards words you intimated that there was more than one thing you wished to discuss the lead wizard said what is it as tristan looked into wiggs aquamarine eyes he knew that once it had been said there would be no going back but he also knew in his heart that he had to be truthful he closed his eyes for a moment then opened them again i love your daughter he said softly irrevocably forgive me wigg but i do wigg smiled i know he answered gently you do of course everyone in the palace knows they also know how she feels about you only a fool could miss the way the two of you look at each another im sorry tristan replied carefully not knowing exactly what to say i know how damaged she was and i stayed away because i wanted to respect that but she tells me she is much better now im glad for her and ive never seen her so vibrant and alive but i also know how little time the two of you have had to come to know each other and i didnt want to intrude on that either pausing he looked down at his hands despite how much i cared being with her seemed impossible for so many reasons still i couldnt help but love her he went on when i first saw her that night on the cliffs the feeling swept over me like a storm and it simply wont go away wigg looked over thoughtfully at the man he loved so much from the time he had watched tristan come into the world he had done everything in his power to prepare him for the teachings he would eventually impart into his blood and for the destiny the prince was chosen to fulfill but not even the lead wizard could have foreseen the turmoil and loss that would accompany tristan and shailiha on their unexpectedly dangerous journey to enlightenment and now in the midst of it all had come celeste reaching out wigg put a hand on tristans shoulder you have my blessing if thats what youre asking for he said quietly nothing would make me happier than to see the two of you together and i mean that she loves you tristan and with an ardor i have seldom seen over the course of my three centuries as tristan looked up wigg could see a tear in his eye realizing that the same thing was about to happen to him as well the wizard promptly stood cleared his throat and busily rearranged his robes now then he said his wizardly demeanor apparently having retuned i must get back to faegan and celeste theyll be wondering where ive been one eyebrow came up and you know how faegan can be as wigg turned to go tristan reached out and gently took the wizard by one arm thank you he said softly there is no reason to thank me wigg answered back in truth i doubt there is any power on earth that could keep the two of you apart all i ask is that you continue to treat her well i will the prince answered back his voice cracking a bit with a final comforting smile wigg left the room his mind awash with the memories of everything he had been through and thoughts of all that might still lie ahead tristan remained there in silence for some time before he finally ordered the parchment back to its drawer suddenly exhausted he left the room and began the long walk to his chambers very soon now he knew he and the others would hear what the wizards had to say about the scrolls of the ancients chapter sixtyone f rom his place in the bow of his warship wulfgar watched and listened as the oncoming waves split noisily against the prow looking higher out over the breadth of the nighttime sea he felt his long sandy hair sway behind his back in the wind in time with the ceaseless rocking of the ship the voyage of the last seven days had been uneventful and the cold winds had remained brisk allowing his fleet to make good time the screechlings and sea slitherers had kept pace well following dutifully behind in the wake of his vast armada demonslavers prowled the decks the ships running lamps pointing up their lifeless white skin as the ship swayed beneath him wulfgar took a deep breath of the crisp sea air looking at the reflections of the rosecolored moons in the eversurging waves his thoughts turned back to serena and krassus he had no doubt that the diseased wizard was dead watch for the lightning and the wind he had told serena then shall you know that he has truly expired when it happens order a contingent of slavers to lay his body in a small skiff and set it ablaze as they push it out to sea wulfgar and serena owed everything to krassus and he deserved to be well remembered then wulfgars thoughts drifted to his beautiful new queen he loved her deeply and missed her as he missed nothing else in the world since she had been turned to the vagaries she had never been away from his side until now he missed how she looked how she smelled and the supple touch of her skin he wanted to hold her in his strong arms and take her over and over again making her beg then gasp and finally cry out in joy just as she always did and already he missed the daughter she carried even though her pregnancy was still without outer evidence he would finish nicholas work quickly and return home to the citadel in triumph nicholas he thought the nephew he had never seen what a magnificent being he must have been how he would have loved meeting him conversing with him planning with him part of wulfgar could even understand how krassus had been so willing almost eager in fact to die and go to him even though it had been nicholas himself who had made it so but nicholas plans lived onfirst in the blood of krassus and now in wulfgars he would reign supreme he swore the practitioners of the vigors would soon know the exquisite sting of their defeat as would the entire world then the wind stopped completely and he knew even though there was no land in sight wulfgars fleet had arrived at the first of their destinations and the new lord of the vagaries was prepared wulfgar turned to his first mate furl the sails tie off the wheel and signal that the same be done to every other ship in the fleet he ordered there are to be absolutely no exceptions have the forty remaining talis slaves brought up out of the hold pausing he smiled we are about to have guests with a nod the first mate went off to perform his duties then the fog rolled in over the night sea from seemingly nowhere and everywhere quickly engulfing the entire fleet thick and gray it clung to his clothes and his skin with the arrival of the fog the temperature plummeted and soon wulfgar could see his breath the fog coalesced into hundreds of great columns that rose up out of the sea and then just as krassus had told him would happen the columns morphed into giant hands each pair of them grasping a ship by the opposite ends all his ships were thus caught the demonslavers looked up in awe but remained disciplined ready to carry out any commands their master might order wulfgar stood in sheer joy at this example of the vagaries to his enlightened mind it was not only magnificent but was also something to take advantage ofand he would be the first being in the history of the world to do so turning to look down the deck wulfgar saw that the forty talis slaves had been brought topside they stood in four neat lines of ten each shivering from both the cold and their sense of foreboding as wulfgar expected the sea around the fleet began to bubble and roil as if something was trying to come to the top then faces began to form on the surface of the ocean they were the necrophagiansthe endowed agesold eaters of the dead and i am the only living being who both truly knows what they are and can also call them into his service wulfgar thought as he greedily looked over the side of the ship he stared at the faces there seemed to be hundreds of them their flesh a horrible mixture of sea green and dark red streaked with ancient wrinkles and boils where eyes and mouths should have been there were only dark empty holes and then came the expected demand pay us our bounty or we shall take both your bodies and your ships the faces whispered in the strangest of voices there were many speaking at once in complete conformity yet so softly that they could barely be heard the new lord of the vagaries knew full well that the necrophagians were referring to the forty cowering slaves on deck to allow safe passage across the sea the eaters of the dead were demanding to be fed it was known as the bargain of tenfold times fourthe pact made with them by failee first mistress of the coven as she tried to save her life and the lives of her sisters after having been banished by the directorate of wizards more than three centuries before but this time wulfgar knew things would be different leaning over the side of the vessel wulfgar raised his arms eaters of the dead he shouted out over the sea i honor you and come prepared to pay your bounty or you may choose a different path this day i suggest that a new bargain be struckone that will release you from your agesold bondage and allow you to follow me a deathly silence followed as wulfgars entire fleet waited dead in the water finally the eerie whispering came again who are you to bargain with us came the voices and who are you to speak of our freedom even failee the one with whom we struck our agreement so long ago did not possess such power no one can free us of our torment except he or she who shall eventually command the scroll of the vagaries i am that man wulfgar replied calmly i am also the only living being in the world who knows who you truly are and why you were condemned to this purgatory in the sea i and the heretics of the guild need you now and your penance can finally be over should you choose but first you must follow me and serve me in my mission silence reigned again do you mean to say that the scrolls of the ancients have finally been loosed upon the world the voices asked their combined tones even more hushed this time yes wulfgar replied determined to stand his ground we require proof the voices replied it is said that he or she who would eventually command the sacred scroll of the vagaries would have the proof of it in his blood show us your proof now or be devoured for wasting our time if you are not that person we tire of your foolishness smiling wulfgar narrowed his eyes and called on the craft raising his arms he levitated himself up and over the warships gunwales and came to hover only inches above the sea directly over the horrific faces in the water extending his right arm he turned up his wrist and caused an incision to form a single drop of red blood dripped from the wound and hovered in the air almost immediately wulfgars blood signature began to form raising his arms he caused it to increase in size until it seemed to take up the entire night sky hundreds of forestallments could be seen branching away from the main body of the signature but there was one among them that clearly stood out its massive length and width overshadowing all of the others the magnificent forestallment seemed to surge with life as if impatient to fulfill its destiny this was the forestallment krassus and the consuls had worked so long and hard to find in the depths of the scrollthe same one wulfgar would soon unleash upon his unsuspecting enemies what say you now eaters of the dead wulfgar asked calmly are you truly the enseterat the voices asked reverently has he finally come to us he who was to have been the first enseterat is now dead wulfgar answered he was the son of the chosen one i am the brother of the chosen ones and have inherited both the mantle and the glorious unfinished work of the enseterat what would you have us do in return for our freedom enseterat the voices asked for several long moments wulfgar explained his mission and the rewards he would give them for traveling in his service another long silence followed we will serve you enseterat the necrophagians finally whispered with one voice wulfgar turned to look over at the forty cowering shivering slaves will you be requiring the offering i brought he asked that will not be necessary this time they whispered back for we now have a new master and where we are going there shall be many such offerings if we succeed we shall no longer need them and if you fail we shall soon consume all that you are in any event very well wulfgar answered raising his arms again he levitated himself back aboard with the new bargain struck the hundreds of foggy hands released the ships and the temperature returned to normal wulfgar ordered the fleets sails unfurled they snapped open to the easterlies and began moving the ships forward the terrified slaves were ordered chained belowdecks once again as the fleet plowed through the sea the screechlings the slitherers and the eaters of the dead all under the command of the enseterat followed dutifully behind in its wake wulfgar gazed west toward the sacred home of his prize everything was going according to plan chapter sixtytwo a fter sleeping like the dead tristan opened his balcony doors to find that a beautiful day had arrived while bathing and dressing he realized how hungry he wasnot only for a good breakfast from the gnome wives but for the company of celeste as well he was walking down a hallway contemplating a plan to find her after breakfast when he turned a corner and literally bumped into her along with abbey and shailiha celeste was dressed in shiny black knee boots black riding breeches a white lowcut blouse and black riding gloves she was holding a basket shailiha was pushing morgannas ornate carriage caprice circled lazily overhead in the spacious heights of the hallway all three women smiled at him as if they all knew something that he did not the moment he looked into their faces he knew what it was celeste had told her friends about the change in her relationship with him one more thing for shailiha to tease him about things would never be the same celeste came closer and gave him a kiss on the cheek the other two women grinned tristan blushed i knew wed find you on the way to the kitchens celeste said happily she held up the basket so i took the liberty of putting some breakfast together for us tristans eyebrows went up again youre going to make me fat besides im on my way to see the wizards i want to know what they have discovered about the scroll yes my prince breakfast again celeste growled back comically giving him her best look of feigned ferocity but a picnic this time i thought we could go for a ride then her face darkened a bit in truth this was fathers and faegans idea she admitted they knew you would be demanding answers as soon as you awakened and they asked me to keep you occupied for a bit they have released me from my translation duties but they said that they would like to see us all on the balcony of your late fathers quarters at midday thats all i know my fathers balcony he asked baffled why in the world would they want to meet us there shailiha shrugged we dont know but they are in a very somber moodof that there is no doubt i suggest the two of you get going be back by midday at the latest tristan never had liked having his day arranged for him by others but he had wanted to see celeste and his stomach was growling besides if the wizards wouldnt see him they wouldnt see him that would be all there was to it then he remembered marcus and rebecca what about the two children he asked where are they theyre in the combined company of shawna the short and a minion overseer abbey told him with a quick laugh rebecca is so sweet but marcus has proven to be quite a handful he has already tried to make off with some of the palace silver but you know shawna she put him back in his place quickly i think hes more frightened of her than he is of the minions she smiled i dont think marcus likes it here very much sighing tristan gave abbey a little nod of acknowledgment then he turned to celeste well i suppose if were going to go then we should do so he said he relieved her of the basket and took one of her arms into his whatever she had packed smelled wonderful and his stomach growled again after pursing his lips at shailiha he gave a patronizingly deep bow to his sister and the herbmistress and began guiding celeste down the halls of the palace head high he pretended he didnt see the wide grins on shailihas and abbeys faces the walk to the stables was short and uneventful geldon was there as usual tending to the horses he saddled a bay mare for celeste while tristan his face somber began a rather sad quiet search for a new mount when geldon made a move to help him celeste touched the dwarfs arm and placed one finger over her lips sighing geldon nodded celeste was right he realized this was something tristan would want to doneed to doon his own finally selecting a sturdy tan stallion tristan glumly avoided the familiar saddle and bridle he had always used on pilgrim and chose others instead as he turned with the reins in one hand he saw celeste tying the basket to the back of her saddle he looked at her quizzically whats going to keep everything from breaking he asked as he mounted or at the very least getting all mixed up smiling celeste gave him a wink father enchanted the containers she told him placing one boot into a stirrup she easily mounted her horse then grinned at him want to race without waiting for an answer she wheeled her mare around and galloped out of the barn her red hair flying laughing out loud tristan spurred his stallion and went after her tristan had never seen celeste ride and he was impressed by how confidently she sat her horse she galloped hard across the stable yard and the palace grounds then pushed her mare noisily up and over the drawbridge several minion warriors gaped at her as she went by then came another quick skidding left and she went tearing off into the countryside charging away so fast she nearly lost him tristans stallion was not as quick as pilgrim in truth few had ever been but the horse was surefooted and it felt good to tristan to be away from the troubles of the palace and feel the wind hitting his face celeste pointed her mare across an open meadow tristan following the tall grass teased the bottoms of their stirrups and they left two lanes of crushed grasses in their wake then she leapt directly over a section of broken rail fence splashed unerringly across a small stream and ran along its opposite bank for a time as she approached another bend in the river she stopped her mare panting hard tristan pulled up next to her her chest heaving celeste leaned one arm down on the pommel of her saddle looked at him and laughed lightly jumping down tristan held her reins as celeste dismounted she untied the basket from her saddle and he walked the two panting horses to the stream allowing them to drink a small sip of water later when theyd cooled down hed allow them to drink their fill after tying the horses to two trees that were a good distance apart he walked back to celeste by then she had removed her gloves laid out a plaid blanket and set out the food tristan removed his weapons tossed them to the ground and sat down on his heels next to her he saw spotted quail eggs againhardboiled this timefresh fruit cheese dark bread and what looked like unfermented mintberry juice he took an egg and began to peel away its shell as he did the morning breeze came up the stream burbled and they could hear the songs of the triad larks looking around at the idyllic scene tristan wished he could stay here with celeste forever with no wizards magic or enemies to interfere with their lives you spoil me he said quietly i could become quite used to this he popped the tiny egg into his mouth good she replied as she handed him a cup of the light green juice spoiling you is one of my favorite pastimes you know besides someone has to do it youre still too thin from your time in captivity seeing his face darken she immediately regretted her remark she reached out and touched his hand in apology silence passed between them for a time it was awful wasnt it she asked finally softly turning his face away for a moment tristan looked out over the meandering stream yes he replied simply it was but i was one of the lucky few i was saved and what i suffered does not begin to compare with your treatment by ragnar then he remained quiet for a bit longer you were the one thing on my mind as the demonslaver whipped me just before i passed out he continued softly i will always carry these scars on my back but i had vowed that i wouldnt scream and i didnt without knowing it you helped me accomplish that celeste lay down on the blanket her beautiful dark red hair splayed out around her face tristan lay down on his side next to her propped up on one elbow he heard the wind rustle the tops of the trees and he could smell the myrrh in her hair reaching up she toyed briefly with the laces of his vest what is going to happen to us she asked do you really believe wulfgar is coming with his demonslavers i dont know what to believe about a brother i have never met he answered thoughtfully much less one who has supposedly been turned to the vagaries but i do know one thing if there is a way out of our troubles your father and faegan are the ones to find it you helped them with the translation is there anything about the scroll that you can tell me i wish i could she answered sadly but the truth is that the translations i did for them were nothing but gibberish to me they were almost exclusively calculations of the craft i couldnt understand them my translations only made their more important work go faster i not only fear whatever it is they might tell us today but i am also at a complete loss as to what it might be he was about to tell her of his conversation with her father the previous night when celeste placed her fingertips gently across his lips as she looked up at him her face slowly changed she placed one palm alongside his cheek and the lids of her sapphire eyes lowered slightly her breathing came a bit harder her lips parted as her eyes searched his face tristans heart beat faster he was sure he had never seen such a beautiful woman in his life celeste raised up a bit and kissed him on the lips as she did one hand slid down and touched him please she asked him softly leaning gently over her tristan ran one hand into her thick hair and gazed sharply into her wide blue eyes are you sure he asked more so of this than anything else in my life she answered her mind made up a look of needful surrender crossed her face please tristan my love please teach my desire to fly to fly on the wings that you alone bring leaning down closer he touched his lips to hers the wind wafted through the trees and the birds sang l ater tristan awakened to find the plaid blanket covering them both celestes naked body felt warm as she slumbered beside him with her head on his shoulder what had passed between them had been more wonderful than he could ever have imagined it was then that he first noticed the soft azure glow of the craft quietly surrounding them but it was gone before he could really focus on it perhaps he had imagined it he thought sleepily it must just have been a dream he closed his eyes and felt himself begin to drift off again chapter sixtythree b y the time tristan and celeste had returned to the palace and found their way to the late kings quarters everyone else who had been asked to attend was already there as the prince walked across the rooms a profound sense of sadness went through him he had not visited these chambers in a long time and part of himthe part that still cried over what he had been forced to do to his fatherdid not wish to be here now as he approached tristan could see that the wizards had arranged to have a large meeting table and matching highbacked chairs placed out on the balcony the scroll of the vigors sat on the table its golden center rod and engraved middle band gleaming in the midday sun another table sat nearby holding an abundance of tea and scones telling the prince that they all might be here for some time he took a seat and celeste sat next to him looking around he saw wigg faegan abbey geldon traax and shailiha morgannas baby carriage sat by his sisters side and the princess gently rolled it back and forth with one hand for the life of him tristan couldnt imagine why they were meeting on his fathers balcony it was pleasant here to be sure but knowing the wizards as he did he knew that couldnt be their reason puzzled tristan was about to ask wigg what was going on but the lead wizard jumped in first his face somber clearing his throat wigg placed his ancient hands flat on the tabletop and came straight to the point it is my sad duty to inform you all that the danger we now face is the most grave in our history he said quietly everyone around the table became quite still eyes focused steadily on him i will put this as simply as i know how wigg continued as we speak wulfgar the lost half brother of tristan and shailiha may be returning to eutracia with an army of demonslavers faegan and i believe it is his intention to permanently destroy the orb of the vigors in a matter of mere days all we know and cherish may disappear from the face of the earth stunned tristan sat back in his chair he could clearly recall that day on the mountain not so long ago when wigg had called the two orbs to appear so that tristan might view them for the first time the orb of the vigors had been bright shining and golden while the orb of the vagaries had been black and literally dripping with the destructive energy of the dark side of the craft but how could such a thing be made to occur he breathed across the table scarcely able to get the words out and why the scrolls of the ancients make it possible faegan answered theyre what this whole thing has been about from the beginning is that what the scrolls are meant to teach us shailiha asked how to destroy the orbs that wigg answered and a good deal more in many ways it is easier to tell you what the scrolls cannot show us rather than what they can in essence the scroll before you holds the calculations for virtually every known forestallment of the vigors just as we believe the scroll in krassus possession does for the vagaries by employing the calculations gleaned from the scrolls one can identify any already existing forestallment branch that shoots off from a persons blood signature the forestallment branches can now be mapped as it were in addition whoever is in possession of the scrolls can actually not only decipher the calculations required for any forestallment he or she desires but can also imbue the blood signature with it and activate it at any time of his choosing but there is even more to the puzzle faegan said leaning over the table the scroll also reveals the answers to many of the mysteries of the craft that have plagued us for centuries in truth we have only had enough time to scratch the surface of what the scroll may tell us reading the document is an amazing experiencelike looking into the very souls of the ones who came before we now believe it was they who wrote the scroll of the vigors and the heretics of the guild who wrote the other neither side expected to use the information to destroy the orb that supported their side of the craft of course but by including the opposite formula in each one it seems they could assure themselves of mutual mass destruction in their struggle against one another should the need arise simply put each scroll was meant to be both a safeguard and a weapon for future generations of the craft to protect themselves with should its opposite ever be found and used against them what do you mean by mysteries of the craft abbey asked for example we could never understand how nicholas had circumvented the death enchantments of the consuls of the redoubt wigg answered but now after reading part of the scroll we do we believe the calculations for their reversal must be contained in the scroll of the vagaries nicholas imbued them into the consuls blood thereby allowing them to participate in the construction of the gates of dawn without violating their oaths and perishing the forestallments no doubt exist in their blood to this day thereby allowing them to serve their new master wulfgar on the isle of the citadel ill give you yet another example faegan added i believe each of you is familiar with the phenomenon that accompanies the deaths of certain endowed individuals and creatures of the craft most of us have seen the lightning and sudden wind that accompanies these events such as occurred with the deaths of the mistresses of the coven the directorate had always believed these phenomena to be a way for those who had perished to signal their demise to those of their cause who might still live we now believe we might have been wrong about thisthat the atmospheric events might have something to do with only the death of ones blood rather than the death of both the blood and the body forestallments are of course a part of ones endowed blood but unlike endowed blood which is present at birth forestallments are conjured and added later each is the physical embodiment of a spella very potent and complicated one but i digress the truth is that we have far greater problems to solve now so wulfgar wants to destroy the orb of the vigors tristan said half to himself and that is why krassus so badly wanted the scroll of the vagaries isnt it he needed it so that he could imbue wulfgars blood with the proper forestallment among others he looked up in horror at both of the wizards thats what this is really about isnt it he asked thats what it has always been about yes wigg answered had he survived it now seems that nicholas plans were to have gone much farther than simply releasing the heretics from the heavens do you remember how krassus talked about wanting to carry on nicholas work but we could never fathom what he meant by that well now we think we know but how can you be so sure that this is his mission tristan countered with so many forestallments recorded in the scrolls how can you know that the destruction of the orb of the vigors is wulfgars intent and not something else an excellent question wigg answered while faegan and i must admit that our conclusions are more educated guesswork than substantiated fact one thing stands out about the scroll that convinces us we are right and that is celeste asked of all the calculations one seems to rise head and shoulders above the rest in its relative importance and complexity the formula for the destruction of the orb of the vagaries we must surmise that the scroll in wulfgars possession contains the formula to destroy the orb of the vigors with all of this talk of nicholas and the orbs tristan sensed a recent memory trying to float to the surface he knew it had to do with the day he had visited the caves of the paragon when nicholas had not only revealed that he was tristans son but also what his plans were finally tristan took a quick breath of realization and looked over at faegan and wigg youre not wrong he said quietly to the table at large the destruction of the orb of the vigors is exactly what wulfgar has in mind wigg looked carefully at the prince and you are certain of this because because nicholas told me so himself that day in the caves when he first revealed to me who he really was and why he had been sent here by the heretics tristan answered he did not tell me of his orders to krassus should he perish or of the existence of wulfgar those intricacies of his mission he must have wished to keep secret should all else fail but he did tell me of his eventual plans for the orb closing his eyes tristan did his best to recall nicholas words of that day as they came back to him he spoke them aloud as best he could remember after the return of the heretics we shall eliminate all the others of the earth our world shall become one barren of all human life other than that which is sufficiently gifted together we shall then destroy the vigors and their orb forever leaving only the true sublime teachings of the vagaries that we have so come to love the other half of nicholas mission he murmured not only to destroy the orb of the vigors but also to kill anyoneother than the consuls he was corruptingwith a rightleaning blood signature as well but first krassus needed two things didnt he he needed wulfgar because of the quality of his blood and the fact that he has a severely leftleaning signature wulfgar was the perfect choice because he would be a far easier subject to turn than shailiha or i yet he still possesses the blood of morganna the mother of the chosen ones and krassus also required the scroll of the vagaries to provide him with the calculations for the forestallments he needed to gift into wulfgars blood the most important of which shall grant wulfgar the ability to destroy the orb wigg looked over to where faegan was sitting to see that his old friends face had become a mask of grave concern then sensing what the prince was feeling he reached out compassionately and placed one hand on tristans shoulder from what you tell us it seems we were right after all he said softly indeed faegan replied this is one of the few times in more than three centuries that i can honestly say i am sorry my deductions have proven correct but there is most certainly another reason why wulfgar will come and what is that tristan asked lifting his head he will try to take the scroll of the vigors from usif for no other reason than to keep us from gifting your blood signature with more forestallments the more power you gain the greater the danger to him and to what he wishes to accomplish and grizelda and this harlequin whoever he was were supposed to retrieve the scroll for him and take it to the citadel wigg added soberly but they failed and are both dead what do these orbs look like shailiha asked and what purpose do they serve i have heard you speak of them before but i dont really understand them nor do i celeste added what are they exactly magic is everywhere wigg answered even though it cannot be seen in this aspect it is very much like the air we breathe constantly surrounding us but invisible in truth however magic has substance and shape as does the air let me be clear im speaking of the craft itself of what it really is there is a true interwoven consistency to its energy and its existence and it can be literally seen each of the two sides both the vigors and the vagaries this is the reason we asked you to meet us here on the balcony rather than in the depths of the redoubt so we could show you this wondrous thing firsthand that you might better understand what it is we must bend every effort to try to protect wigg then closed his eyes and raised his arms as if in supplication the sky began to lighten as it did a gigantic glow began to coalesce before them in the air of the courtyard slowly it started to spin and turn on its axis it was becoming a brilliant golden orb with offshoots here and there of the palest white radiating outward from its center from time to time golden droplets of energy would trickle down from the revolving orb and fall to the courtyard dissipating into nothingness for the second time in his life tristan found himself looking in awe at the orb of the vigors wigg raised his arms again and a darker image began to form as it grew in size to match the other orb it too began to coalesce into an orb and spin but rather than being beautiful and aweinspiring the dark orb gave off a distinctly menacing aurafrightening even horrifying as they watched the dark orb grow to the size of the orb of the vigors it began to try to push the other orb aside as if attempting to make room for itself it was as frightening as the orb of the vigors was beautiful droplets of dark energy dripped from its pitchblack shining sides and bright scratches of lightning shot through the ebony orbs center the orb of the vagaries tristan thought the dark side of the craft in all its ghastly splendor completely entranced the people at the table watched as the two great orbs began to move about the afternoon sky they would slowly repeatedly attract one another as if somehow needful of each other but then just as they were about to touch they would unexpectedly violently repel one another and the process would continue in some ways it was almost a pitiful thing to watch the neverending attempts to join only to be thrust apart over and over again wigg opened his eyes each thing in nature has its opposite he explained male and female light and dark and so it goes through the entire scheme of the world as we know it the two sides of the craft are no different for as long as we have known of their existence they have been in this perpetual state of struggle with each other pausing he looked around the table at the amazed faces it is believed that the two orbs must never touch he continued should that happen the result would be calamitousa rent or tear if you will in the fabric of each if the tears were large enough it is believed that their powers would be released to join uncontrollably and that such an occurrence would be the end of all we know it is also believed that there are invisible corridors in the fabric of the craft that might one day be called upon to finally safely join the orbs and that until these corridors are traversed by one or more of the chosen ones neither side of the craft no matter how powerful it may seem to be individually has even a smattering of the dynamism it would if properly joined with the other lifting his arms again wigg closed his eyes and the two orbs began to dissipate finally vanishing altogether what will happen to the craft if wulfgar is successful in destroying the orb of the vigors abbey asked reaching out for the cup of tea before him faegan thoughtfully took a sip and then replaced it on its saucer in truth we cannot be sure for so many of the concepts of the craft we once thought to be inviolate now seem subject to reviewsuch as our longheld theory that one side of the craft couldnt exist without the other for example but at the very least the vigors would cease to exist as will you wigg celeste and myself for our time enchantments are each supported by that side of the craft not a very happy prospect he took another sip of the tea at the very least the world would be plunged into the dark side of the craft perhaps forever with wulfgar as its master another thought occurred to tristan why cant we simply beat him to it he asked hopefully i dont understand wigg said his expression skeptical what are you talking about you believe that the scroll in our possession contains the calculations for the destruction of the orb of the vagaries correct yes then why cant we destroy the orb of the vagaries first and render wulfgar powerless that would solve all of our problems would it not wigg sighed we thought of that and it is a very tempting proposition but it wouldnt be wise assuming of course that such a situation is even possible how so youre forgetting something wigg explained the tome states that it shall be your mission and then the mission of your sister should you either fail or perish in your attempt to combine the two sides of the craft for the good of all humankind if we purposely destroy the orb of the vagaries and thereby allow only the vigors to exist you will never be able to fulfill the destiny that the tome says you must wigg gave a small sigh and looked down at his hands perplexing isnt it he continued a moment later it seems we have been placed in the unwelcome position of having to preserve both sides of the craft no matter how repellent we find the vagaries while wulfgar on the other hand is left completely unbridled and quite untroubled by such a conflict of interest in many respects his task is far easier than ours how will it happen geldon asked how will what happen wigg responded when wulfgar employs the forestallment to destroy the orb i mean geldon answered what will actually happen wigg laced his long fingers together that is impossible to say he replied the scroll of the vigors provides the calculations but does not actually describe the unfolding of the event it does however make mention of something called the isthmus what is that the dwarf asked were not sure perhaps more research will tell us but for now we believe it to be a manifestation of the craft that somehow allows the partial joining of the orbs without the two of them actually touching each other and we believe this isthmus may be an inherent part of what wulfgar has planned but there is one advantage we do have over wulfgar in all of this and what is that tristan asked eager to hear a scrap of good news over the centuries it has been our experience that the two orbs reside only over the landmass of eutracia wigg answered although they exist within the fabric of the craft and we believe the craft to exist everywhere every attempt to move the orbs either out over the sea of whispers or over the heights of the tolenka mountains has always failed we never discovered why but it seems quite impossible to do the only reason we could ever discern was that the tome stated that tristan and his sister would one day arrive in eutracia and for the chosen ones to fulfill their destinies eons ago the orbs were somehow enchanted to remain imprisoned here in our homeland thereby helping to ensure tristans or shailihas success but that is still only a theory as with so many things of the craft no one can be absolutely sure but this is why wulfgar cannot simply call the orb of the vigors to the citadel and destroy it there traaxs strong commanding voice rang out we will beat him back i swear it the minion said sternly no fighting force on earth can overcome our warriors we will give him a reception he shall never forget tristan looked over at him forgive me my friend he said with concern but that may not be the case i have seen the demonslavers fight while they do not have the gift of flight they are nonetheless ferocious adversaries and they care absolutely nothing for their own safety our forces were drastically weakened during the battle with nicholas flying creatures over the fields of farplain even worse the demonslavers will have a fullfledged wizard of morgannas blood leading them thinking to himself for a moment he looked out over the balcony then back to faegan and wigg if the minions cannot keep wulfgar from reaching the coast can your combined gifts beat him back he asked them bluntly is there any way we can win this there will be no way of knowing that until it happens wigg answered grimly as he placed his hands into the opposite sleeves of his robe the powers of the enseterat will be great indeed tristan narrowed his eyes what are you talking about he asked what is the enseterat enseterat is a word found in the scroll and is the title by which wulfgar will no doubt wish to be known it is old eutracian for lord of the vagaries the scroll says that once the chosen ones finally mature and their blood has been gifted with forestallments then they are to be known by such names tristan looked over at his sister so what are shailiha and i supposed to be called he asked softly wigg looked carefully first at tristan then shailiha tristan you are to be known in the craft as the jinsai or the combiner of the arts and shailiha is to be known as the jinsaiou the feminine version of the same phrase we first heard these words spoken by the watchwoman of the floating gardens wigg said but when she realized that we were unfamiliar with them she would tell us no more now we know or should i say at least we know more than we did but why shailiha asked why would the ones give us such names as is the case with so many things of magic we do not know faegan answered we have theorized that it may be so that future beings of the craft you encounter in your struggles to join the two sides shall know you for who you now are and therefore willingly accept your aegis over them or there may well be deeper even more meaningful reasons for this only time will tell and time is the one thing we dont have despite all that tristan had heard the thought that had been going through his mind since he had sat down needed to be addressed before anything else was done wulfgar and his fleet could be there at any time and they had to be as ready for him as they could we must deploy the fleet he said sternly and we need to set up a system of warning should they see wulfgar and his slavers approaching our thoughts exactly wigg said what do you suggest tristan turned back to traax what you must do is to keep the fleet concentrated in strength so that it can be ordered to move as a unified force at a moments notice i want the fleet maneuverable without having our backs up against the coastline sail east from the delta but venture no farther from tammerland than your best warriors can fly without stopping to rest hold your position there then order a small contingent of scout vessels farther east but again no farther than the warriors can safely fly back to the main body of the fleet send warriors flying out from the decks of the scout vessels to scour the sea as far to the east as they can when the slavers are finally sighted send a message to me at once if we can destroy his fleet and keep him from reaching the coast we may be able to save the orb tristan looked over at the wizards agreed he asked they both nodded tristan thought to himself for a moment then looked back over at traax do you remember the officer named kjarr he asked his intelligence and bravery impressed me during the sea battle with the pirates of course traax answered with a smile he is one of my best still a bit young and impetuous but very capable good tristan answered thoughtfully when you return to the fleet find him and keep him by your side he is not to participate in any of the flying search parties when i finally join you i may have a special use for him and i want him available i may also want a special litter built i will tell you about it later traax bowed his head slightly i live to serve he said then his strong rather menacinglooking smile emerged again it shall all be as you order jinsai on hearing himself called that for the first time tristan sighed and shook his head he had never been one for titles and now it seemed that still another one had been heaped on him he looked over to shailiha and saw her smile slightly and for your part what will you be doing tristan asked the two wizards what we have been doing for the last week wigg answered specifically trying to find a way to combat the forestallment gifted to wulfgar that will result in the destruction of the orb but i must tell all of you here that given the quality of his blood and the stillunknown nature of the various gifts he has surely been imbued with the likelihood of our stopping him will be remote at best and if we fail all that we know and love may soon vanish as he finished speaking a tense silence descended over the table tristan looked over at traax go now he ordered take the fleet out but leave a sufficient number of troops here to defend the palace should it come to that once at sea follow my directions to the letter i will await your word nodding traax stood he walked a short distance to the side of the balcony snapped open his wings and took to the air looking down at the scroll on the table tristan took a deep breath rising he stretched his long legs and walked over to the balcony wall he kept his dark eyes on traax as the loyal warrior became smaller and smaller against the backdrop of the sky then finally vanished he knew that if they were not exceedingly fortunate they would lose this fight then the warrior kjarr crossed his mind again there might yet be a wayone that he had not discussed with the wizards suddenly despite the loved ones sitting just behind him at the table the newly anointed jinsai felt very much alone chapter sixtyfour t he baby girl coughed yet again as she lay struggling for her life in the plain wooden crib as she did the woman in the robe sensed that this gentle but sinister convulsion would be the childs last long past grief the babys mother and father huddled helplessly near their child their eyes red and crying as they watched her die closing her eyes the woman called upon the craft yet again in her efforts to help the infant breathe at the same time trying to make sure the familiar azure aura did not form thereby alerting the parents of her secret abilities but she knew she was losing this battle and the end would come soon almost as quickly as she had thought it the childs deep brown eyes closed her soft eyelashes fluttering for the last time like tiny butterflies wings then came the delicate death rattle from her exhausted lungs and her head slipped quietly over to one side the woman slowly stood back up with tears in her eyes the woman named adrian lifted the worn blanket up over the babys face turning to look at the parents she shook her head sadly refusing to believe the frantic mother snatched the dead child up in her arms as if by holding her close she could somehow imbue her with new life adrian left the mother to her grief and walked to the father his name was inar and he hadnt eaten or slept for three days near collapse he leaned his head against the wall and sobbed openly please know that i did all i could adrian said softly reaching out from the sleeve of her hooded robe adrian gently touched his hand it felt cold and lifeless just as his heart now surely did tears running down his face the father could only nod knowing there was nothing left to be said adrian quietly left the room going to the cottage door she let herself out onto the street where a light rain had begun to fall she walked to where her horse was tied pulling up the hood of her robe as she went as she mounted her roan gelding she took a final look back at the modest cottage smoke wisped up out of the chimney and she knew that the traditional black silk ribbon of mourning would soon adorn the door what a difference only a few seconds could make she thought a body could be warm and alive one moment and then in the twinkle of an eye it was not after closing her eyes for a time she slowly opened them again and turned her horse up the slick cobblestoned street had the childs parents somehow had the occasion to see adrians upper left arm they would have noticed her tattoo a square bloodred image of the paragon still that would not have entirely revealed adrians secret the one she had promised never to divulge since the age of five when the wizards of the directorate had granted her fathers humble request that his only daughter be accepted for training in the craft but adrian was more than simply another person of endowed blood adrian of the house of brandywyne was of the craft and a graduate of a place known only to a privileged few a place called fledgling house listening to her horses shoes strike the cobblestones she regarded the drab city of tanglewood as it passed slowly by it was not one of eutracias more prosperous places and probably never would be and since the unexpected return of the coven of sorceresses and the deaths of the wizards of the directorate she feared the citys plight would only worsen the houses in this section were made of dark wood and had shabby thatched roofs they all seemed to look the same somehow and had a crooked fragile ramshackle quality about them it was almost as if they needed to lean up against one another just to remain upright and if the first of them fell the rest would also give up the effort and tumble down with it she had been trying to save the dying infant all night and it was now just after dawn the rising sun smothered somewhere just over the horizon among inky dark rain clouds around her tanglewood seemed to be slowly waking up low muffled conversation could be heard here and there and smoke was rising from the tops of the chimneys the occasional chamber pot could be seen held out of a window its contents unceremoniously dumped on the nearby ground men in worn work clothes began appearing from doorways to kiss their wives goodbye and go about their daily labors the enticing aromas of peasant foodplain but goodhung in the damp morning air adrians stomach growled reminding her of how long it had been since she had eaten trying to save the baby girl had taken all her strength and she was exhausted she reached into one pocket of her robe and counted her kisa there should be enough she reasoned she would stop at the first inn she came across allowing herself a rest before returning to her village sometimes she felt very alone in the world despite the number of people she always seemed to encounter who needed her help at thirty seasons of new life she found herself neither young nor old she was not yet married but that did not trouble her too much and she had been an only child her mother dying while giving her life her father had not visited her modest cottagethe one he had built for her with his own two handsfor nearly a year now and because of that she feared greatly for him he was a consul of the redoubt and it had often been said that he knew the lead wizard personally but for some time it had been widely rumored that wigg was dead along with all of the other wizards of the directorate a shudder went through her as she wondered anew about the fate of her father and the other members of his discipline she had not come across any of the brotherhood for some time now and that was unusual she would certainly have known them just as she always had by their simple dark blue robes quiet manners and the tattoo of the paragon on their shoulders should any of them deign to reveal it to her it seemed something sinister had happened not only to the directorate but to the brotherhood as well leaving her and her sister acolytes lost and alone in the craft but adrian was a hardy stalwart woman and she would continue to uphold her vows regardless of the nations plights she would gladly perform the good deeds she had promised the headmaster and matron of fledgling house the day they had pronounced her trained and set her and her classmates free at the age of twentyone she had been a proud member of the first such group to be given their tattoos and then sent forth she had always yearned to return to fledgling house to see again the modest charming castle sitting next to the base of the northern tolenka mountains but she never had she also longed to see duncan againthe wizard with the long gray hair who had taught her so much and martha duncans wifethe kindly rotund matron who had always seen to the girls other needs she remembered the couple fondly and hoped they were both well fledgling house was the only real home she had ever known and duncan and martha were more her parents than her father and late mother had ever been perhaps i will return one day she thought when times are not so cruel and the need for my gifts is not so great as she rode along adrian clutched an errant lock of her hair that had somehow escaped the hood of her robe and hooked it behind one ear as she did she smiled gently to herself she knew she was not beautiful but she possessed the strength of heart to know that the quality of her femininity mattered far less than the quality of her service to the craft what she may have lacked in appearance she more than made up for with not only her intelligence but with the goodness of her heart adrian was rather short and plain her wide level eyes were deep brown her sandy curly shoulderlength hair always seemed to be getting in the way the sleeves of her dark red acolytes robe fell loosely down around her wrists and the hem gently swished across the tops of her boots when she walked a black knotted cord secured the robe at its middle its tasseled ends falling down along the outside of her right thigh finally she saw an inn with a sign proclaiming it the bear and finch but as she approached it she felt a strange sensation and pulled her horse up short breathing heavily she began to sweat noticeably even though it was certainly not warm on the street she had never felt anything remotely like this it was not painful it was more needful yes she thought that was the word she was looking for needful but needful of what she asked herself as if suddenly possessed she turned and looked southeast over the roofs of the houses tammerland she thought the royal palace was there she felt compelled to go to the palace she had never been so drawn to anything in her life but visiting the royal residence was forbidden to acolytes the wizards punishment for such a transgression was said to be severe but how could something her heart of hearts was so desperately telling her to do be so very wrong she didnt know for what she was experiencing went against every iota of her training but the urge was irresistible and she realized that if she did not go her heart might burst from the longing as if in a dream adrian found herself turning her horse around and pointing him down the road leading to tammerland she could not know that all her sisters in the craft were experiencing the same thingbeing drawn to tammerland the countrys capital and seat of the craft e xhausted wigg opened his eyes and lowered his arms it was just after dawn and he and faegan had been working through the night trying to make use of one of the calculations they had found in the scroll the lamps of the redoubt burned brightly and the scroll of the vigors hovered nearby partially unrolled glowing with the power of the craft is it done faegan asked quietly he sat at a nearby table in his wheeled chair nicodemus lay across his lap purring contentedly it is as done as i can make it old friend the lead wizard answered tiredly shuffling his way around the table he took a seat next to faegan only time will tell whether it will truly work faegan decided to change the subject have you talked to them yet he asked have you told tristan and celeste about the warning we found this morning no wigg answered with a sigh frankly i dont know how to bring myself to do it they love each other so much faegans face darkened and he rolled his chair a bit closer you cannot wait any longer wigg he said sternly you know it as well as i i will do the deed for you if you cannot but either way they must be told i know it will break their hearts and that they have already suffered far more loss than any two people should ever have to endure but we owe it to them nonetheless the lead wizard looked down at his hands as if wishing to somehow avoid the issue entirely a tear came to one of his eyes tristan and celeste had both been through so much already he thought how could he do this to them still for the good of the craft he had to finding his resolve wigg stood he walked over to one corner of the room and tugged resolutely on a velvet pull cord in a few moments the expected knock came on the massive double doors with a word from wigg they opened and a minion warrior appeared upon entering the room he clicked his heels together i live to serve he said wigg looked back at faegan but knew he would win no reprieve from his old friend faegan glared back at him sternly and nodded his mind finally made up wigg turned back to the obediently waiting warrior bring the jinsai and my daughter here at once he said simply the warrior clicked his heels again and promptly left in search of the prince wigg walked sadly back to the table sat down heavily next to faegan and waited in silence chapter sixtyfive w hen the strong familiar knock came on the door wigg stiffened looking over at faegan he took a deep breath then glanced back toward the doors again enter he said simply the prince and celeste walked in for some unknown reason tristan seemed especially eager to see them removing his weapons from his shoulder he slung them over the back of one of the chairs and took a place next to wiggs daughter at the table taking a deep breath wigg looked over at them im glad youre here he said quietly we need to speak with you there is something i must and i need to speak to you tristan interrupted excitedly had you not asked for me i would have sought you out myself what is it wigg asked is something wrong i have an idea tristan answered quickly and im afraid that whatever you wanted to say will have to wait for the moment what i have to tell you is vitally important but first please tell mehave the two of you found any possible way to stop wulfgar sitting back in his chair wigg raised his eyebrow no he said and time grows short reaching into a pocket of his trousers tristan took something out he gently placed it on the table this may be our answer he said softly i was reminded of it yesterday during our meeting on the balcony faegan looked at the item on the table then back over at the prince of course we recognize it he said as he stroked nicodemus but i still do not understand what you have in mind you told us yesterday that the orbs cannot be coaxed out over the sea and also that if we could keep wulfgars fleet of demonslavers from reaching the coast we would have a much better chance of stopping him from destroying the orb of the vigors correct yes thats true wigg answered his curiosity growing but what are you driving at for more than the next half hour tristan explained to wigg faegan and celeste exactly what he wanted to do and how he would do it as he spoke the wizards could hear the optimism rising in his voice when he was done the two mystics sat back in silence as they considered his plan long moments ticked by as the prince awaited their opinions ill admit that it has its merits faegan finally answered tristan could see the wheels turning in the old wizards head but the logistics and execution would be daunting to say the least the timing would have to be perfect and your idea carries with it absolutely no guarantee of success still its the best plan i have seen so far he smiled at the prince frankly im impressed i agree wigg said but tell me does anyone outside of this room know of your idea no good the lead wizard said adamantly keep it that way and leave what you brought here with us we will consider your plan and let you know if it is viable if thats what you feel you must do then so be it tristan countered but youd best hurry the warning from the minion scout ships could come at any time whether youre ready or not satisfied for the time being tristan crossed his arms over his leather vest now then he asked politely what was it you wished to tell us as was his habit wigg placed his hands into the opposite sleeves of his robe there are two things actually he began and they both have to do with the scroll of the vigors tristan and celeste both looked over to where the scroll was hovering in the air the azure glow of the craft flowed from it and it was partially unrolled to reveal the elegant flowing old eutracian words and symbols inscribed on it its golden center rod and end caps gleamed in the light what about it celeste asked do you remember faegan and i telling you about something the watchwoman of the floating gardens mentioned to us she called it the river of thought tristans brow furrowed yes i do he answered but frankly i had forgotten you said little of it thats because at the time there was very little to say faegan replied we wanted to be sure the calculations for it actually existed within the scroll and we finally found them and just what does this socalled river of thought accomplish tristan asked used properly it can stir certain feelings or sensations in one or more endowed persons at the same time wigg replied faegan imbued its forestallment into my blood only this morning and i just used it for the first time to do what celeste asked her voice a whisper to call home all of the acolytes of fledgling house he replied the redoubt has been empty for far too long it needs to be used for the reason it was builtthe further training and safe harbor of those who have devoted their lives to go forth in our name and perform good deeds of the craft as you both know whatever consuls may still exist have been freed of their death enchantments turned to the vagaries and taken to the citadel sadly they are now all subject to wulfgars control but they are not the subjects of our efforts pausing for a moment he looked into their surprised faces instead we have employed the river of thought to summon the acolytes here to what will be their new home he went on what better place to harbor these valuable souls during such troubled times than the depths of the redoubt their mission will be to take the place of the consuls who have betrayed us he looked sadly at tristan this was your mothers lifelong dream he added softly equality for women in the craft faegan and i wanted to call the acolytes home sooner but until we learned of the river of thought there was no practical way of doing it now there is we are about to make morgannas vision for the future come true the circle shall be complete again for the first time in more than three centuries tristan stared at the two wizards then smiled broadly happy beyond words that they had finally arrived at this crossroads in history but then another thought came to him this is wonderful news he told them still how will we know they are who they claim to be anyone can acquire a red robe couldnt there easily be traitors among them this seems like a very dangerous time to be taking strangers into the palace first of course they will all be women wigg answered the oldest of whom should be no more than thirty seasons of new life and as you point out each of them should also be wearing the dark red hooded robe of her station but clearly those things alone are not sufficient proof we shall therefore also be checking their blood signatures against our records for final confirmation before any of them are shown the secrets of the redoubt we shall also check them for the presence of forestallments to see whether their blood has been tampered with there should be none but if any of the acolytes are found to posses them those women will be segregated and held for questioning pausing for a moment the lead wizard laced his long fingers together tristan with your permission i want to order the minions now stationed before the palace entrance to move their campsites immediately he said i want them out of sight i think we can safely assume that few of the acolytes have ever seen one of our winged friends before and i dont want to scare the women away their hearts will already be filled with enough trepidation about what they are doing as it is for all they know just now they are breaking their vows simply by coming here we can only hope that the river of thought is strong enough to overcome those feelings in them and keep them continuing on the path home they will be very conflicted when they arrive they must feel welcome and know that it was we who called them here forgive me father celeste began but are you sure this is a good time to be doing this what about wulfgar and his fleet now is the best possible time faegan answered in other ways it is also the worst and wulfgar is the reason behind both if he truly is on the way we want to get the acolytes to safety as quickly as we can before he can influence them and if grizelda was lying and wulfgar is not advancing on us then why wait your father and i thought long and hard about this and finally decided to go ahead tristan looked over at wigg and the lead wizards face darkened and the other thing you called us here to discuss tristan asked what is it ignoring tristans question wigg looked sternly at both of them we are sorry to have to ask you this but we must know if the two of you have been intimate and if you have how many times this occurred tristan and celeste stared at him shocked how could you ask such a thing the prince demanded besides this really isnt the time for just tell us wigg interrupted sternly trust me when i say that we have our reasons it is vitally important that we know had any other man asked him this tristan might well have knocked him down but these were wigg and faegan and the wizards always had their reasons still he scowled once he answered annoyed he crossed his arms over his chest celeste blushed when was it wigg asked yesterday morning and during your time with one another did either of you see an azure glow form then disappear tristan looked over at celeste he took her hand then looked back at wigg i may have he said tentatively thats not good enough wigg shot back impatiently either you did or you didnt i was half asleep tristan answered and thats the best answer i can give you even now i cannot be sure whether it was a dream or whether it was real what is all of this about celeste asked anxiously is there something wrong wiggs expression softened a bit and he held one hand out to her please stand and come to me he asked her quietly she did so wigg looked to the table at large everyone please be still he asked what i am about to do is very important reaching out with his free hand he placed his palm onto celestes lower abdomen and closed his eyes silence reigned as wigg gently moved his long fingers to and fro as if searching for something after a time he removed his hand opened his eyes and bade celeste to sit back down faegan leaned anxiously over the table and looked at wigg well he asked a sad look overcame the lead wizards face i cant tell he answered softly my attempts were blocked exactly as the scroll said they would be wasting no time faegan wheeled his chair over to where celeste sat placing his hand upon her as wigg had just done he also closed his eyes when he opened them again his face registered an equal look of surprise do you now see wigg asked him sadly just as i told you inconclusive and to my knowledge this has never happened before but how can that be faegan whispered half to himself cleary frustrated wigg ran his hands down his face i have no idea he answered slowly but the influence of tristans presence has clearly been at work here did you sense it it was almost as if our powers were being overcome somehow it seems that once again as has also been true with so many of the questions concerning his azure blood we can find no clearcut answer tristan looked quizzically at celeste then back to the wizards what in the name of the afterlife are you two talking about he asked what were you doing to celeste the two of you have done nothing wrong wigg said compassionately but you have been caught up in something not of your own making and there are things that must be said things the two of you will find very difficult to hear and they have to do with the scroll turning to faegan the lead wizard nodded faegan nodded back wheeling his chair away from the table a bit the old wizard raised his arms in the direction of the hovering scroll almost at once a short section of text in old eutracian lifted itself from the body of the scroll and came to hover over the center of the table it glowed magnificently looking over at celeste tristan saw that she was reading the text then a sudden look of horror overcame her and the blood ran from her face she placed her hands over her eyes as if looking at it had somehow become unbearable not knowing what else to do tristan put an arm around her in the name of the afterlife will one of you please tell me what is going on here he shouted at the wizards cant you see youre upsetting her perhaps the best way is to read the passage for you since you cannot do so for yourself faegan answered him softly turning his chair he looked up at the glowing hovering script and began to read aloud and should the chosen one make use of his gifts before he is trained to do so the ordeal shall alter the nature of his blood changing it from red to azure but with this change shall come a price for should his seed then mingle with that of any female the child they might produce would be horrible beyond description for the blood of the jinsai shall be tainted and no endowed female in the world except for the twin of the jinsai shall carry a blood signature strong enough to keep such a child from possessing the leftleaning signature that shall without question emerge such shall always be the case until the blood of the jinsai can be returned to red thus no seed of the jinsai may be allowed to walk the world at any price and no practice of the craft shall be able to determine whether the jinsais mate is with child only natures way of revealing the answer shall be available to those who shall both worry and wonder his mind stunned and drifting tristan slumped down into the chair finally slowly he looked over at the wizards their faces were very concerned why didnt you tell us sooner he breathed scarcely able to get the words out we could have prevented this thats why you were examining her isnt it you needed to see if she was carrying my child he paused tentatively for a moment is she we dont know wigg interrupted softly we only discovered this message in the scroll this morning and then called for both of you straight away it was the best we could do but i thought the scrolls were only a compilation of forestallment formulas tristan countered softly do you mean to say that they speak of other things as well yes wigg answered the scrolls are much more than they appeared to be at first glance not only are they the repository of the forestallment calculations but they are informative as well much like the tome of the paragon and you are unable to use your gifts to tell us if she is with child tristan asked thats right faegan answered it is just as the scroll said it would be the only way we shall know is by the appearance of the traditional natural signs and that will take some time i also regret to say that until tristans blood is somehow returned to normal the two of you must refrain from physical intimacy im sorry but being of the craft sometimes also means making sacrifices for now that is how things must be faegan took a deep breath and let it out slowly aside from the impending arrival of wulfgar it now seems that our most pressing concern is the search to unravel the mystery surrounding tristans blood pausing for a moment the brilliant wizard thought quietly who knew he asked who knew that tristans answer to defeating the coven of sorceressesthe only answer available to him and achieved with such great selfsacrificewould in turn somehow become the greatest most dangerous riddle of the craft finally removing her hands from her face celeste looked out over the table tristan fully expected to see her eyes full of tears but they werent instead a look of grim determination had overtaken her reaching out she took both of tristans hands into hers and held them tight there has to be a way to remedy this and we shall find it she said softly despite the gentleness of her tone her voice carried so much weight that her words sounded like an oath she looked deeply into tristans eyes if i am carrying our child we shall find a way to safely bring it into this world regardless of what the scroll may say i swear it to you my love she added tristan tried to speak but was so overcome he found he had no voice narrowing his eyes against the coming tears he simply nodded then the familiar hated feeling for his azure blood crept up on him again he looked away for a moment his jaw hardening and now it seemed his blood had caused pain not only to tristan but to the woman he loved and to the child she could be carrying his eyes full of tears he took celeste into his arms and held her for what seemed forever chapter sixtysix t he minion warriors name was osiv and as his strong wings carried him through the air his sharp dark eyes searched the ocean beneath him about fifty meters away and matching his pace stroke for stroke flew takir his scouting partner the midday sky was only partly cloudy but heavier darker clouds loomed to the east directly across their flight path soon osiv knew they would have to turn back to the scout ship from which they had come emptyhanded once again looking down all osiv could see were the reaches of the sea of whispers five days had passed since the main body of their fleet had taken up its position off the coast and the scout ships had been sent on ahead this was osivs and takirs fourth such mission they had come upon other vessels to be sure but none of them had proved to be slaver ships just then takir saw a lone frigate plowing her way due west running before the wind she was making very good time she carried no identifying flag he signaled his find to osiv and the two warriors folded their wings behind their backs and rolled over into free fall plummeting down to take a closer look as osiv unfolded his wings to slow his descent and make a first pass over the frigate he thought he must be seeing things the ship seemed to be completely deserted there were no sailors on her decks nor were there any to be seen in the rigging or in the crows nest even the ships wheel was unmanned still she plowed gamely on through the waves as if tended by the best of seamen her course never varying despite the fact that he was a minion officer osiv felt a shiver go down his spine a ghost ship he had listened to stories about them all his life around minion campfires but had never dreamed he might actually see one only the graybeards among them had claimed seeing them as he remembered their stories one corner of his mouth turned up as he had grown and become wiser he had come to realize that the elders always told such stories the next one always more improbable than the last signaling to takir he indicated that they should investigate osiv drew his dreggan from its scabbard nodding takir did the same and warily followed him the rest of the way down buffeting his wings osiv landed lightly carefully on the pitching stern deck takir came down next to him still the ship sailed obediently on the masts and rigging swayed peacefully and the hull groaned slightly in continual protest as she plowed her way along the waves parting across her bow otherwise no sound whatsoever came to their ears then they heard a sharp banging noise and they spun around dreggans held high but all they saw was an open stairway its unsecured door swinging back and forth in the wind a set of steps led down from the doorway to the lower deck his hand tightening around his dreggan and all of his senses on alert osiv went to the door takir followed behind osiv winced as the boards of the steps creaked traitorously announcing their presence the hallways below were not darkened as osiv had somehow expected them to be all of the wall sconces were burning brightly making it easy for them to find their way as they walked forward from the stern they saw all of the usual trappings of a ship at sea the larder shelves were stocked with food and there were signs of crewmen having recently eaten freshwater barrels their contents partially consumed stood securely roped against the starboard hull in several neat rows next they found the crews sleeping quarters the traditional rope hammocks were all still hanging from the rafters swinging back and forth with the ceaseless rhythm of the abandoned ship a further search revealed that there were absolutely no crewmen aboard anywhere yet everything was in its place just as it should be on a wellrun vessel what strange fate could have befallen them osiv found himself wondering could the eaters of the dead be responsible for this but if they were then where was all the blood seeing another set of steps heading topside he led takir back up into the sunlight and the breeze the scene was just as they had left it the sails were still full and properly trimmed and the ship remained duly on course making her way toward some unknown destination relaxing a bit osiv lowered his sword looking around he saw a nearby keg he went over and sat on it then placed his dreggan across his knees takir came to stand beside him placing the point of his dreggan on the pitching deck and leaning on the hilt the wind moaned hauntingly through the lonely unmanned sails i dont understand it osiv said quietly where could they all have gone and this ship shes still on course somehow as if nothing was wrong how is such a thing possible i have no idea takir replied its as if they have all suddenly takir heard the familiar unmistakable sound of a sword blade ripping through bone and flesh when he looked at his friend he froze in disbelief a long vertical wound had opened up in osivs head it literally split his face in two a vertical cut from chin to top of skull and back down to the nape of his neck the two halves of his head slowly began to separate and fall away toward the shoulders osivs eyes went blank blood and brain matter began to slide from the wound and run down onto his body armor osivs body went crashing sloppily to the deck his dreggan clanging noisily down on pure instinct takir lifted his dreggan high and turned full circle searching for osivs murderer but no one was there the empty pitching decks simply yawned back at him in silent ridicule of his foolishness show yourself takir screamed in anger as he whirled about again he viciously slashed his sword through the surrounding air but its razorsharp blade bit into nothing suddenly something told him he should unfold his wings and take flight but the impulse came just a fraction too late if you insist a voice said calmly from somewhere it was a strong commanding voice takir felt a strange sort of shudder go through him looking down he saw a vertical slit in his body armor then his blood began rushing from it he absently drunkenly reached down and placed one hand over it but this last act was to serve no purpose everything went black and he fell forward as the blood from the two minion corpses joined to run slowly across the deck the azure glow of the craft appeared then it faded in intensity and finally vanished altogether to reveal wulfgar his long sandy hair swaying behind him in the wind he looked casually down at the two dead bodies he raised one arm and his demonslaver crew materialized all of them heavily armed and standing stiffly at attention awaiting their masters orders the sword of the one nearest him dripped with fresh blood wulfgar bent over and picked up the dreggan that had belonged to osiv holding it high he examined it carefully as the sun bounced off its shiny blade such fine craftsmanship he said half to himself these swords really are a marvel it is said that even the jinsai himself carries one with a sneer on his face he strode purposefully to the gunwale and threw the beautiful weapon overboard pointing back to the slavers he singled two of them out you he ordered sternly throw these dead bodies overboard the rest of you return to your duties with dutiful nods the two monsters he had chosen went about their work wulfgars tactical gamble had worked perfectly he gave silent thanks to nicholas for providing invaluable information about minion abilities and customs now he had an excellent idea of how far away the minion fleet was without them knowing the position of his own two days flying time he guessed one day from the scouting vessels to here and another from the scout ships to the minion fleet that put the minion position near the coast looking over the side wulfgar watched as the slavers tossed the minion bodies into the sea the water ran red with blood and he heard the snuffling hungry grunts come as the pieces were greedily consumed as he continued to watch the feeding frenzy he smiled im sorry there wasnt more my children he said softly but soon now you will have your fill looking toward the stern he saw the supposedly empty sea behind him and he smiled even the wakes of his ships were unseen he silently thanked the late krassus for gifting him with the forestallment of invisibility wulfgar closed his eyes he raised his arms and the familiar azure glow engulfed his flagship when it faded away all that remained was the cold restless sea chapter sixtyseven t he thirteen confused women sat side by side in the hall of supplication each waiting her turn to approach the lead wizard wigg and faegan sat at a table before them on the table was a tall stack of parchment documents and an oddlooking device the likes of which none of the women had ever seen a group who had already passed the wizards exotic tests sat off to one side as she waited for her turn to be called it was plain to adrian that so far none of her sister acolytes had failed the wizards examinations still stunned by the beauty of her surroundings she looked around again at the sumptuous room fledgling house had been beautiful to be sure but she had never seen a place like this huge stainedglass windows had been swung open slightly to let in more light and fresh air the black variegated marble floor was covered with multicolored patterned area rugs and an ornate mahogany throne sat on a dais at the far end of the room the room still smelled faintly musty leading her to believe that it had seen little use of late she could only imagine what the rest of the palace must look like she and the other women had arrived only this morning they had discovered one another on the way here and as they shared their experiences they learned that every single one of them had been overpowered by the same sudden unexplained compulsion to make the journey to the royal palace in tammerland adrian as the senior among them had been selected to lead them through the palace gates there they had been greeted by a hunchbacked dwarf who had introduced himself as geldon he had explained that the lead wizard himself was responsible for their undeniable need to come here and that they had done the right thing by doing so no harm or punishment would befall them greatly relieved the women had followed the dwarf across the drawbridge through the courtyard and into the palace proper once in the hall of supplication geldon had recorded their names and family houses on a piece of parchment handed it to the wizards and directed the women to their seats still taking in the grandeur of her surroundings adrian was startled when the lead wizard called out her name adrian of the house of brandywyne please approach standing adrian took a deep breath and ran her palms down her robe smoothing it out then she walked to the table and looked down at the lead wizard not knowing what else to do she gave him a slight curtsy the lead wizard smiled please sit down he said and do not be afraid my child no harm will come to you here i promise adrian took a seat in the highbacked upholstered chair across the table from the lead wizard rifling through the pile of parchments wigg finally pulled one out and placed it before him after examining it he looked back up at adrian and smiled welcome my dear i knew your father he was one of the best of the consuls was she thought the single harsh word went straight through her heart begging your pardon lead wizard but do you mean to say that forgive me adrian wigg interjected quickly i do not mean to imply that your father has died in truth we do not know but more of that later now then how many years have passed since you graduated from fledgling house somewhat relieved adrian let go the deep breath she had been unconsciously holding nine she answered that would make you one of the first class to do so would it not yes have you married no lead wizard do you have children no please show us your tattoo if you would with a nod adrian slipped her left arm from the sleeve of her robe and lifted it to show wigg the paragon on her shoulder just as the other acolytes before her had done after the lead wizard nodded she placed her arm back into the robe and now please demonstrate some small use of the craft wigg asked her if the azure glow appears that is permissible but as a test of your talents please try not to produce it adrian looked around the room seeing the cold fireplace along one wall she raised her arm and spread her fingers the logs immediately jumped ablaze no azure glow was evident she closed her fist and the fire went dead she turned back to the lead wizard just in time to see one of his eyebrows arch up thoughtfully well done he said beside him faegan smiled and stroked his blue cat please extend one wrist wigg said placing a blank piece of parchment on the table adrian did so wigg caused a small painless incision to form in her skin and a single drop of her blood fell onto the parchment almost immediately the droplet began to writhe its way into her familiar blood signature for some time the two mystics compared it to the document wigg had pulled from the pile finally the lead wizard nodded his approval reaching out he pulled the oddlooking device toward him it seemed to be a tripod with a glass lens mounted at its top placing it directly over adrians blood signature he looked down through the lens after a few moments he nodded again and passed the entire affair over to faegan who went through the same process when the crippled wizard nodded wigg looked up at her and smiled welcome adrian he said to her it is a pleasure to finally meet you were your father here he would be very proud as one of the first class to graduate fledgling house your senior status will be very much appreciated please take a seat with the others of your sisterhood with a nod adrian walked to the side of the table and joined those upon whom the two wizards had already passed judgment it took close to two hours for wigg and faegan to interview the remaining women in the end all were accepted then wigg stood and spoke to them as a group he told them a brief history of the return of the coven of sorceresses the destruction of the gates of dawn and how and why he had summoned them here prince tristan had wished to greet them personally wigg said but was on urgent business elsewhere he also told them not to fear the menacinglooking minions of day and night whom they would soon see in and about the palace when he had finished wigg placed each hand into the opposite sleeve of his robe his aquamarine eyes seemed to see right into the hearts of the assembled women from this day forward you are no longer to be known as the acolytes of fledgling house he said solemnly you are now the acolytes of the redoubt and your place is here with us you are hereby accorded all the rights and responsibilities associated with your new positions as more of your sisterhood arrive they will be examined as you have been if they are found to be true acolytes their blood also unpolluted by the vagaries they too will be blended into the fold then the lead wizard smiled welcome ladies he said with obvious feeling this moment has been too long in coming it is truly a historic day chapter sixtyeight a s tristan paced back and forth across the deck of his flagship his mind was overcome with concerns both new and old the scout ships had gone farther east into the sea of whispers days earlier but still their patrolling warriors had little to tell there was nothing to see but water they kept on reporting as they tiredly returned to their vessels have i ordered us all out here for nothing he found himself wondering had the herbmistress grizelda lied to them simply to throw them off track and if she had then where was wulfgar were wigg and faegan even correct in their assumption that his bastard brother was out to destroy the orb of the vigors the prince had gone to join the fleet as soon as he had learned that two of his warriors had gone missing although their disappearances proved nothing he could sense that wulfgar was out there somewhere soon very soon now things would come to a head it felt good to be at sea again his newly acquired love of sailing was truly a part of him nowa part he hoped he would never have to give up completely as the brisk westerlies moved through his hair he casually grasped a line of rigging and leaned against the gunwale his mind lost in thought wigg shailiha traax abbey and the warrior kjarr were all here aboard the savage scar with him two days had passed since wigg had accepted the acolytes into the redoubt geldon had been left in charge to greet any others of the sisterhood who might also make their way to the palace shawna the short and a minion warrior continued to watch over marcus rebecca and morganna while ox and the remainder of the minion forces had also been left behind as a palace guard faegan and celeste too remained at the palace in case their gifts were needed to protect the scroll of the vigors these measures gave tristan a modicum of comfort but as he continued to look out over the deep blue sea the prince was both anxious and worried traax came to stand next to tristan the minion second in command laced his fingers and leaned his muscular forearms on the gunwale as the savage scar cut through the waves for several long moments neither of them spoke where in the name of the afterlife are they tristan finally breathed his gaze still locked on the waves are wulfgar and his fleet of slavers really on the way or is this all just some kind of elaborate ruse designed to draw the bulk of our forces away from the palace could they have already gotten by us looking for answers he finally turned and searched the warriors face he valued traaxs opinion greatly and he needed to know his thoughts i do not know my lord traax answered solemnly all i can say is that if the roles had been reversed i would be doing exactly what you are now only time will tell as wigg said we have no choice but to believe what the dead herbmistress told us because it is far too dangerous not to yes yes i know the prince replied but i just cant escape the feeling that he stopped short as he realized that his breath was streaming out of his mouth in the form of a short white vapor trail the temperature had dropped so quickly that neither he nor traax had noticed at first but now it was so bitterly cold that both of them had begun to shiver then the savage scar lost all of her forward momentum fearing the worst tristan looked up to the sails they had all gone completely limp their lower hems nearly touching the decks turning he desperately looked out over the sea and was horrified to find that its surface had become as smooth as glass his flagship and every other vessel in the minion fleet were dead in the water by now shailiha abbey and wigg had come running and the decks were awash with swordwielding warriors all shouting to one another and wanting desperately to help but not knowing what to do from out of nowhere tristan was suddenly reminded of something tyranny had said to him during their first meeting together that day in her private quarters aboard the peoples revenge as he replayed it in his mind his blood ran cold speed is the one thing that keeps us alive out here tristan turned to traax the expression on the warriors face had become as hard as granite what is it the prince breathed what is happening it is the necrophagians my lord traax answered sternly the eaters of the dead they have somehow found us and nothing i know of can stop them then another cold realization shot through the princethe necrophagians had never been known to venture this far west wasting no time he reached out and grabbed traax by both shoulders as he did he could see that a strange dark gray fog had already begun to form it was snaking its way up from the sea to surround his fleet soon the enemy would be here he realized and they would be more than just the eaters of the dead order all of the sails furled he shouted and signal all of the other ships in the fleet to do the same but my lord traax exclaimed in a rare display of protest that will do no good it would be a waste of precious time with no wind it does not matter dont argue with me tristan shouted angrily just do it and have kjarr found and brought to me immediately traax snapped to attention after going to bark out the orders he returned to stand resolutely at his masters side his dreggan drawn what is it wigg called urgently whats going on but before tristan could answer the fog began to coalesce into hundreds of pairs of huge gnarled hands that came rising up out of the sea as he watched in horror they began to cut their way silently through the smooth still ocean positioning themselves in pairs near each of the minion vessels then the hands reached out and grasped the bows and sterns of the ships holding them helplessly in place sections of gunwale and railing began to crack apart under the immense pressure tristan felt his heart sink he looked up urgently to the masts and spars to see the minion crewmen trying to furl the sails as fast as they could some were done already suddenly the sea all around them seemed to come alive as it began to burble and roil he looked over the side and saw the horrible faces of the eaters of the dead surfacing then he saw the first of the maelstroms from beyond the eaters of the dead dozens of glowing waterspouts rose from the sea turning with a speed so fast he found it dizzying their great heights soon dwarfed his ships the maelstroms flattened out at their tops then dissolved into thousands of individual flying creatures there could be no mistaking them screechlings and then tristan gasped as he saw the first of wulfgars demonslavers the whiteskinned monsters had seemingly materialized out of thin air to land crouching on the decks of his ships their swords and tridents at the ready screaming wildly they began hacking into the surprised minion warriors with suicidal fury tristan tried to shout orders out to wigg and traax but each of them was already locked in individual combat pulling his sword from its scabbard tristan raised it just in time to ward off a blow from a demonslaver that appeared from nowhere then he slipped to the right and slashed his dreggan low tearing the flesh of the monsters left thigh with the point of his doubleedged blade as the slaver bent over in agony tristan raised his blade again and took the things head off with a single blow using a few precious seconds tristan turned desperately to look for shailiha when his eyes finally fell on her he saw that she had drawn her sword and was fighting off a slaver but the monster was gaining ground on her pushing her backward across the already bloody deck reaching behind his shoulder tristan grasped the first of his throwing knives and sent it spinning end over end the dirk buried itself into the slavers neck and the monster fell over across the deck wigg was throwing azure bolt after azure bolt against the demonslavers killing as many of them as possible the moment they materialized then there seemed to be a short lull in the fighting and for a wonderful fleeting moment tristan almost believed they might somehow survive the carnage but he had forgotten the screechlings the thousands of large threewinged brightly colored flying fish descended on the minion fleet all at once deftly avoiding the demonslavers they soared over the decks and tore into sails spars and minions alike with their razorsharp teeth many of the warriors took to the air and tried to hack the deadly things from the sky but it soon became clear that they were outnumbered spars and rigging came crashing down and whatever sails had not already been furled were systematically shredded minion warriors by the dozens were being viciously torn apart by the screechlings and then hoisted ruthlessly over the side to be consumed by the wailing ravenous eaters of the dead despite all of the screaming clanging sword blades and mayhem the sickening tearing of minion flesh could be heard rising from waters that were quickly turning red with the crimson stains of death traax and kjarr reached tristans side and the three of them slashed violently with their dreggans tristan was about to shout to traax when he saw the warriors face suddenly falla rare sight indeed even in combat whirling around tristan looked to see what had so stunned his secondincommand as he did his mouth fell open all around them the warships of wulfgars fleet were materializing there must have been hundreds of them tristan realized and they had clearly been the launching points of the demonslaver attacks as endless swarms of demonslavers continued to use swinging lines and gangplanks to land on his decks tristan saw that his troops were not only hopelessly outnumbered but completely surrounded as well the princes heart fell at the thought of how easily they had been led into the trap wulfgar must also be here he thought as he struggled with a screaming slaver pausing only to raise his dreggan to slash a screechling out of the air but if wulfgar was there then why hadnt wigg detected his blood there was only one thing to do now it had only a small chance of success and if it was ever to happen it would have to be soon for the odds against their survival were climbing by the second the prince shouted out his orders to traax and kjarr traax i want you to find wigg abbey and shailiha and get them safely into one of the litters leave the other litter empty tell them it is time and they will understand i will join you soon with a nod traax was gone reaching down into the top of his right knee boot tristan withdrew a small oilskin pouch and carefully handed it to kjarr do you remember your orders he shouted to the minion yes jinsai kjarr shouted back it shall be done despite the madness and turmoil going on all around them tristan took a few precious seconds to look deeply into kjarrs dark eyes all of our lives and the life of your nation depend on what it is you now do he said you must not fail us in this kjarr unflinchingly returned tristans gaze i live to serve he shouted with a final nod from his lord the warrior hid the small package beneath his leather body armor took to the air and slipped over the side of the ship tristan ran toward the bow desperately fighting his way through demonslavers and screechlings as he went by now the situation had become so critical and the number of demonslavers so great that a thick horde of minions had to surround him simply to ensure he would reach his goal many of them died blessedly by the time he made it there the others were waiting for him inside one of the litters with tristan finally aboard the minion bearers lifted the litters into the sky and soared upward just as they were overrun some of the screechlings tried to follow but were cut down by minion escorts then the remainder of the warriors soared from their stricken vessels and followed suit climbing into the sky after them as they did the demonslavers left on the bloody decks cheered and waved their swords in celebration of their great victory wondering whether his plan would work tristan looked silently over at his sister she was dirty and disheveled and her left arm was bleeding but wigg had apparently been able to close the wound for now tristan gave her a small smile and she smiled back looking down at the fleet he had just ordered abandoned tristan desperately wondered whether he had done the right thing it was out of his control now he knew as he waited and watched he closed his hands tightly around the hilt of his dreggan k jarr soared low over the waves desperately staving off the screechlings that tried to force him down into the dark waiting maws of the eaters of the dead four times they nearly took him and four times he fought them off but the battle on the decks had tired him and he wasnt sure how long he could continue searching for the right opportunity finally after several long moments of circling the waterline of the savage scar he found a place clear of screechlings and necrophagians hovering near the bowsprit he took a supreme chance and turned his back to the sea reaching into his body armor he withdrew the oilskin pouch then carefully stuffed its contents into the gap between the bowsprit rail and the hull taking extra care to make sure it would not come loose turning away from the hull he soared up and away in search of the jinsais departing litters w hen wigg thought they were finally high enough he nodded to tristan then the prince gave his litter bearers a prearranged signal and they stopped climbing instead hovering in place they were high in the sky directly above the two opposing fleets the bloody minion decks were now empty of warriors and the demonslavers were still swarming over their decks raucously rejoicing in their victory tristan anxiously waited for traax to lead the remainder of his forces up as they came he was dismayed at how few of them had survived then kjarr finally caught up with them is it done tristan shouted out nervously yes my lord the minion answered proudly all is as you requested a look of relief crossed the princes face wasting no time he gave orders for the two litters to separate and to put a good distance between one another then he looked back over at wigg and abbey it was time you can do this he told them if i can both hold the litter in place long enough and also sustain a warp and if the process will actually work in reverse wigg replied but as faegan and i told you before there are so many variables this is no time for a lecture about the craft tristan countered quickly were out of time you need to start now nodding wigg looked over at abbey and then out at the distant litter the minions were still holding taking a deep breath he steeled himself and raised his arms in its direction azure bolts shot from his hands and flew toward the other litter as the azure glow engulfed the litter the bearers let it go and flew away from it two of the warriors were badly burned but it couldnt be helped it was plain to see that the lead wizard was straining with all his might to keep the empty litter from crashing into the sea while at the same time maintaining the azure warp he had placed around it beads of sweat broke out on his forehead and his arms shook glancing over into abbeys terrified eyes tristan gave her a look of encouragement then he looked out of the litter toward traax now he shouted at the warrior traax flew around to abbeys side the herbmistress stood up shakily and traax lifted her into his strong arms then he flew her toward the empty litter as she lay hundreds of feet above the waves in traaxs arms abbey carefully opened the leather cinch bag that hung from a strap around her neck it held the ingredients required to start a gazing flame removing a pinch of herbs from it she reached through the warp dropped them over the side of the litter and watched them fall onto the hot embers already burning on its specially constructed metal floor she then bowed her head as expected almost immediately the familiar golden flame came alive and started to burn away the sides and roof of the litter leaving only the metal floor abbey cast a few more of the herbs into the flame and it roared higher gaining color and strength raising one arm she silently commanded the flame to split into two separate branches the smaller of the two then obediently angled itself over toward her after carefully placing the first bottle of herbs back into the cinch bag she removed the second one opening it she took another pinch of herbs and dropped them down into the nearest of the two branched flames the two branches rejoined returning to the vertical placing the second bottle back into the cinch bag she gently removed yet another precious item closing her eyes she held it high it was a piece of vellum recently taken from the scroll of the vigors when the viewing window in the gazing flame started to form abbey opened her eyes again looking into the window she saw what the piece of vellum in her hands was searching for and had finally found the same item kjarr had just hidden in the gap between the bowsprit and the hull of the savage scar it was the other half of the vellum that krassus had enchanted and hidden in tristans bootthe vellum the wizard of the vagaries had hoped would destroy them all but hadnt it was also the item tristan had shown the wizards that day on the balcony when he had outlined his battle plan for them as abbey watched the vellum in the windowthe twin image of the one on board the savage scarbegan to emit pinpricks of azure light with the birth of the lights came great screeching sounds their noises so great that she and traax could barely stand the pain in their ears knowing the time had come traax immediately turned around and flew them both back to the waiting litter as he did wigg lowered his hands and the remains of the other litter and abbeys gazing flame fell into the sea after abbey was helped back inside everyone looked down at the savage scar hoping against hope tristan held his breath from the bow of the flagship the screaming shafts of light broke free of the enchanted vellum and tore into everything around them they lit up the sea and sky with massive azure strikes twisting and turning relentlessly as they sought out whatever they could find and destroy the savage scar went up first the shards of light shot through her from stem to stern and with a great torturous shudder she blew apart her masts and spars came crashing down her decks ruptured mightily and what was left of her rolled over capsizing in the sea as she went down the hordes of screaming demonslavers still on her decks fell overboard the careening shafts of azure light struck them killing them instantly providing fresh carrion for the hungry necrophagians below the surface of the water finally the savage scar slipped beneath the waves the shards continued on tearing into the remaining ships both minion and demonslaver alike one by one the other vessels exploded and turned over spilling the slavers into the sea the blood on the ocean seemed to stretch on forever meanwhile the azure lights had found the screechlings and were tearing into them in midflight as the shards struck them the screechlings exploded torn offal and thin red blood tumbling sloppily into the sea to join the carnage and then finally it seemed to be over the faces of the eaters of the dead had vanished and all the ships of both fleets had sunk leaving only wooden debris bobbing up and down on the restless crimson waves but as the occupants of the litters and the warriors hovering alongside it were about to learn krassus enchantments were not finished pausing for a moment the azure shards began to regroup and hover just above the surface of the waves as if still searching out lifeforms to destroy and then they began soaring upward directly toward tristan and his companions get us out of here now the prince shouted to traax traax ordered the warriors to fly the litters higher in a desperate attempt to escape the twisting screaming shards climbing ever higher the litter ripped through an oncoming cloud bank tristan held his breath looking back to see whether the deadly shards were still following them then the hundreds of light streaks also tore out of the cloud still racing unerringly toward the litter tristan gritted his teeth krassus shards were gaining on them and in a matter of moments it would all be over then he felt wigg push him to one side and the wizard looked out of the litter his robe flying in the wind wigg raised his arms ready to throw his own bolts at the relentlessly pursuing shards but just as wigg was about to attack them the shards started to fade one by one as their power died krassus enchantments finally slowed then tumbled end over end into the waiting sea as they struck the waves they caused the ocean to bubble and roil for a time and then they were gone closing his eyes tristan took a deep breath and sat back in his seat when he opened them again he found the lead wizard staring at him saying nothing wigg raised an eyebrow tristan smiled at him then ordered the litter to turn west toward home chapter sixtynine d o you really think theyll be all right celeste asked anxiously as she searched faegans face for what must have been the hundredth time there has been no minion messenger from the fleet today and thats not like tristan something is going on out there on the sea of whispersi can almost smell it not knowing what is happening is driving me mad she and the wizard were in the hall of blood records deep in the redoubt faegan had been ensconced there for the greater part of the day as he studied the record of wulfgars blood signature looking for answers regrettably none had come to him he feared for the lives of his friends but was trying not to reveal his concern to celeste already she paced the sumptuous room like a caged animal faegans ancient violinone of his most prized possessionslay beside him on the table playing it sometimes helped him to concentrate and today had been no exception for her part celeste had grown tired of being left to her own devices in the lonely palace above and had come to search faegan out it wasnt about being frightened she was ready to face the worst should it come to that it was more about being left behind with nothing to do while tristan and the others were out at sea looking for wulfgar being marooned at the palace had made her feel impotent and alone the wizard raised his face from his research and smiled slightly we were left here for a reason you know but do not worry my child wigg abbey tristan and shailiha are four of the most resourceful people i have ever known and if anyone can stop wulfgars demonslavers it is they besides we still do not know whether grizelda was telling the truth for all we know wulfgar may not have even left the citadel i know that she responded some composure had crowded its way back into her husky voice but the truth be known i just cant help feeling she stopped as the wizard suddenly stiffened and raised one arm bidding her to silence his face had suddenly become very grave and searching furrowing his brow faegan cocked his head and swiveled his chair as if he was looking for something then he looked upward celestes eyes followed his and saw that one corner of the ceiling was glowing with the power of the craft just as it had not so long ago in the card room of the palace above when krassus had first revealed himself to them but the glow gathered far more quickly this time so fast in fact that neither faegan nor celeste had time to react before a mans form coalesced clinging to the walls and ceiling just as krassus had as faegan raised his hands to use the craft a single terrible bolt of azure confined him within a wizards warp dread shot through him as he realized he could neither move nor speak celeste didnt hesitate she raised both hands and let loose terrifying bolts that seared across the room but the man only laughed and launched himself to the opposite side of the room celestes bolts exploded against the empty wall in a massive crash of marble noise and dust raising her arms as fast as she could she attacked him again but again he was too fast for her he launched himself into the air leaving her bolts to tear into one of the massive bookcases with a great crash it toppled over spilling texts and scrolls onto the floor the room began to fill with dark acrid smoke which made her cough then the man vanished again celeste took a hesitant step forward as she did from the depths of the smoke came a dark knowing laugh suddenly twin bolts came slashing out of the gloom and struck her squarely in the chest the force of the impact lifted her high off her feet and threw her across the room as though she were a rag doll red hair flying she smashed against the hundreds of drawers containing the blood records and fell unconscious to the floor l ooking around the room for a moment wulfgar seemed to make up his mind with a single wave of one hand the smoke disappeared and the fires went out he placed one of the chairs from the meeting table before faegan and sat down then he lifted his long legs onto the table and crossed one over the other after regarding faegan for a few moments wulfgar reached out one hand and arrogantly snapped his fingers faegan immediately found his voice had returned youre tristan and shailihas half brother arent you the old wizard growled from within the azure warp wulfgar smiled how astute faegan looked with concerned eyes at celeste what have you done to her you bastard he demanded is she dead crossing his arms over his chest wulfgar leaned back in the chair lazily he glanced over at celeste in truth i do not know he answered unconcernedly as if he were discussing the weather instead of the survival of a fellow human being she is the daughter of wigg is she not krassus told me of her such a rare beauty were i not otherwise involved i might be inclined to take her for myself then the menacing eyes turned back and found faegan again but she is not the reason i have come wulfgar said i have far greater goals to attain and you are going to help me i have come to accomplish what krassus tried to do but failed that day he visited you things have finally come full circle the amiable expression melted away from wulfgars face as his upper lip twisted its way into a sneer he leaned forward and glared at the helpless wizard now then he asked softly where is the scroll of the vigors tristan and wigg will return faegan countered gamely trying to buy all the time he could you have very little time to destroy the orb of the vigors a knowing look overcame wulfgars face and he gave faegan a short menacing smile krassus told me that the two remaining wizards of the redoubt were exceedingly clever how right he was then the look on his face turned deadly again and he removed his legs from the table anyone who was with your fleet is by now quite dead i assure you he continued even the gifts of the lead wizard could not have overcome both my creatures and the overwhelming surprise i arranged if by any bizarre chance any of your people did escape however they will be caught by the small contingent of ships i set to guard the entrance to cavalon delta im so glad you decided to stay behind though because that gives us this little chance to chat he sat back in his chair now then where is the scroll of the vigors he asked again this is your last chance to answer without consequence i suggest you think it over well your arrogance is about to cause you a great deal of pain old man the minions surrounding the palace will come and take you faegan said boldly even you will not be able to kill them all sweat was running down his face as he desperately tried to break free of wulfgars warp but it was completely unforgivinglike sitting in a tight iron cage that had no door oh yes yet more of my brothers warriors to be dealt with wulfgar answered dismissively but ive brought an entire host of demonslavers here with me by cloaking my flagship and sailing up the sippora they outnumber your remaining minions by more than two to one though they have remained quite invisible until this point at the same time i appeared before you my slavers also materialized and they are engaging your very surprised troops as we speak even your vaunted flying warriors cannot overcome my demonslavers superior numbers unless they choose to fly away but that would go against everything their strict warrior code stands for now wouldnt it the twisted smile came again in some ways it could be said that your minions are actually killing themselves wulfgar added thoughtfully it seems there will be a great many minion funeral pyres lighting up the sky tonight wizard how did you get into the redoubt faegan growled still trying to stall he desperately needed to free himself somehow and regain the use of his powers but the more he tried the more impossible it became he had never felt such raw power the sweat ran down from his brow to tease his eyes maddeningly how did i enter the redoubt you ask wulfgar responded why that was the easiest part of all i cloaked my blood and followed you here you fool i have been following you all day hoping that you would lead me here and you did not disappoint i had cherished the thought that you might unknowingly show me where the scroll is hidden but you did not so now we are forced to do this the hard way i know you have the answer and i will get it from you one way or the other why do you need it so badly faegan demanded you already have the other one you do not need the scroll of the vigors to destroy the orb isnt that why you have come i wish to possess them both for another reason wulfgar answered calmly what you have failed to grasp is that the scroll of the vigors holds the secrets to my brothers unique azure blood yes wizard thats right my dear brotherthe only being in the world who might one day challenge my powers without the scroll the secret of how to change his blood back from azure to red will never be known and i will always reign supreme his eyes shining with the anticipation of imminent success wulfgar leaned closer now tell me old man he said menacingly where is the other scroll knowing full well that he was condemning himself to death faegan shook his head we know you possess a leftleaning blood signature but how can you willingly do such a thing hes your brother a look of disdain crossed wulfgars face i am the enseterat my brother is the jinsai and his sister is the jinsaiou they are of the twos and i am of the heretics it was preordained eons ago that we should eventually become locked in conflict and so we shall wulfgars patience was wearing thin now then he whispered i ask you for the final time where is the other scroll clenching his jaw faegan shook his head again he had already begun partitioning his mind in an attempt to keep wulfgar from gleaning the location of the scroll it had been hidden well and only he and the lead wizard knew where if he could keep wulfgar out of his mind he was relatively sure that the scroll would not be found the fate of the world would soon boil down to a contest of endowed wills and blood very well wulfgar answered softly you leave me no other choice then wulfgar did something unexpected reaching through the warp he had created he lifted the hem of faegans robe exposing the crippled wizards destroyed legs twin bolts of shock and horror went through faegan sitting back in his chair wulfgar carefully examined faegans mutilated legs my my he murmured as he looked closer the late coven of sorceresses did quite a skillful job on you didnt they faegans legs were a gruesome sight the skin was almost completely gone and much of the muscle mass looked as if it had been shredded away by some terrible beast attacking the legs with teeth and claws the remaining bright red muscles throbbed visibly and what looked to be exposed nerves and blood vessels ran up and down their lengths for over three hundred years they had been this way and even given his immense knowledge of the craft faegan had never been able to heal them only his wizardly selfdiscipline had kept him from going irretrievably mad from the pain the sight of his legs brought memories flooding backthe same threehundredyearold nightmares that he had tried so hard to forget the coven had tortured him for information and left him to die only to be found later by the gnomes of shadowood and nurtured back to health and now the same unspeakable torment was to begin anew but this time there would be no one to help him and he probably wouldnt survive hoping against hope he looked over at celeste but she was still unmoving gathering up his courage he looked wulfgar in the eyes why not simply enter my mind he asked i could wulfgar answered but when krassus told me of the nature of your infirmity i realized that this approach would prove infinitely more entertaining and with your friends all dead and my demonslavers in control of the palace we have all the time in the world to amuse each other besides should this prove unsuccessful i can always walk through your thoughts later the wicked smile came again looking across the table wulfgar spied faegans violin and bow calling the craft he caused them to rise the bow stroked the strings and the melody they produced was sorrowful and forlorn some music to help drown out the noise wulfgar asked personally speaking i dont like screaming its so common narrowing his eyes wulfgar caused the violin to play louder he leaned forward eagerly in his chair now then he said softly shall we begin chapter seventy a s tristan soared along in the litter he still couldnt let go of his dread the enemy fleet had been defeated but he couldnt escape the feeling that wulfgar and krassus had not been with it as there had been no atmospheric disturbances that would have accompanied their deaths it was entirely possible that wulfgar and krassus had been aboard one of the ships that had been farther out to sea when they sank but in his heart the prince didnt think so and he didnt think the lead wizard believed it either looking across the litter the prince saw wigg staring out of the window lost in thought shailiha and abbey gave tristan comforting supportive smiles but he knew what they were all thinking this wasnt over suddenly traax appeared flying beside tristans window the warrior had a very concerned look on his face permission to enter traax shouted out the prince nodded with a single sure motion traax grabbed the roof of the litter snapped his wings closed and hoisted himself in landing abruptly on the seat next to shailiha he looked over at tristan wigg took his thoughtful gaze from the sea of whispers and turned his attention to the minion second in command there is news traax said simply our scouts have sighted vessels near the mouth of the delta they say they are demonslaver warships tristan froze how many he asked fourteen my lord but there are a dozen or so other ships fighting them they carry the image of the paragon on their sails and fly your battle standards atop their masts that means they belong to the woman privateer does it not tristans breath caught in his lungs take us there immediately he barked i want the warriors to fly as they have never flown before those who arrive first are to join the battle immediately when the litter arrives search out the reprisal and take us down then i will issue further orders with a nod of his dark head traax dived headfirst from the speeding litter tristan stared over at wigg his eyes searching the ancient wizards face for some reassurance that they might get there in time wigg looked down at the floor of the litter for a moment then back up at the jinsai and sadly shook his head h ad scars not been watching his captains back tyranny would have died immediately as a screaming demonslaver raised his trident scars came up behind him and hoisted the whiteskinned monster into his massive arms with one arm wrapped around the slavers throat and the other pushing sideways against its hairless skull scars viciously forced the monsters head over to one side until he heard the neck bones grate then give way and crack apart altogether as the light went out of its eyes scars hoisted the dead slaver over the nearby gunwale and tossed it into the sea but instead of the body sinking beneath the waves another fate awaited it wulfgars dark red sea slitherers combed the waters around the struggling vessels their long smooth scaly bodies slipping over and under each other as they sought out their next mouthfuls of warm flesh scars didnt know what these creatures were or how they had come to be here nor did he care all that concerned him was the survival of his captain and her crew but the battle was not going their way and unless the tide turned soon he knew that they would all perish he grabbed another screaming slaver viciously broke its back against the gunwale and dropped it into the sea the screams and the muffled snarling grunts of the gorging sea slitherers seemed to go on forever a s the moments passed torturously by tristans knuckles turned white around the hilt of his dreggan it had been more than half an hour since the minion forces and the litter had turned toward the delta and still there was nothing to see other than waves but a report had come back through the minion lines that some of the fastest warriors had finally reached the fighting and were starting down for that much at least tristan was thankful he knew tyranny needed them as the cold wind lashed his face he searched the waves for a sign that tyranny and her little fleet of privateers might still be in one piece and then finally there they were her twelve ships were lying adrift amidst the slaver ships their decks bloodied the reprisals spars sails and rigging had been damaged in the fight but she seemed to be in no danger of sinking as the litter went down tristan could see that the fighting seemed to be over hundreds of tyrannys crew wulfgars demonslavers and minion warriors all lay dead he could not tell what the outcome had been body parts from both sides could be seen everywhere a strange sense of quiet prevailed despite the horrific nature of the scene as the litter finally hit the deck tristan jumped out his dreggan held high youre late he heard tyrannys voice call out from somewhere behind him then he heard her laugh i told you id still be in your hair for a while tristan spun around to see her standing there the hilt of her sheathed sword still dripping blood in one hand she held a bottle of red wine and in the other was one of her small cigars after swallowing a healthy swig of wine she took a draught of smoke inhaling it deeply with a satisfied sigh she raised her lovely jaw and blew the smoke toward the sky then her expression softened a bit and she smiled at him you didnt think for one moment that i was about to let you have all the fun did you she asked coyly tristan immediately went over and embraced her her face was smudged and bloodied and her short hair was even more tousled than usual looking over her shoulder he saw that scars was still alive helping to direct the tossing of slaver corpses into the sea those that had survived the battle were on their knees waiting to have their throats cut there seemed to be no shortage of crewmen volunteering for the task by this time wigg abbey traax and shailiha were all standing beside them and the bulk of the minion forces were landing on the decks of the other vessels dreggans drawn a few surviving slavers tried to fight them off but were quickly dealt with what happened tristan asked anxiously we were returning to the delta when these slaver ships suddenly appeared out of nowhere tyranny answered thank the afterlife there werent more of them than this they had completely surrounded us and we had no alternative but to stand and fight for some reason it seemed imperative to them that they not allow us any closer to the mouth of the sippora and they fought like they were insane had your warriors not arrived when they did we probably wouldnt be standing here talking to each other she took another drink from the bottle then smiled again something she had said to tristan struck a nerve but before the prince could answer her wiggs voice cut him off separating him from his thoughts tristan the lead wizard called out come here and look at this the prince turned to see wigg standing beside scars at the starboard gunwale staring down into the surrounding sea tristan and the rest of them walked over to join him and looked down as well scars and a handful of tyrannys crewmen were tossing demonslaver corpses and body parts into the sea for the first time tristan saw the horrific serpentine sea slitherers as they hissed viciously at each other competing for the next mouthful of warm flesh what in the name of the afterlife are those things shailiha breathed her voice little more than a whisper they are certainly a product of the vagaries wigg mused although in all my threehundredplus years i have never seen their kind before i suspect they were meant to follow wulfgars fleet as an additional form of protection much like the screechlings very clever when you think about it one beast to serve him in the sea and another to serve him in the sky tristan looked at traax before we leave here select a contingent of warriors to stay behind and deal with these abominations he ordered traax came to attention and snapped his boot heels together it shall be done he replied quickly tristan had an important question for tyranny but before he could ask her scars reappeared by her side there was a strange look on the giants face begging your pardon captain but during their searches of the demonslaver ships our crew made an unexpected discovery what is it she asked turning scars pointed one of his huge paws toward the bow deck more slaves he said quietly tyranny snapped her head around forty filthy emaciated slaves men and women alike had appeared before them on the deck shackled together by hand and foot many of them could no longer stand some were on their knees while others simply lay on the bloody deck slowly dying a few stood looking at their saviors as though they had just descended from some longforgotten dream tyranny took a slow step toward them then another and another her eyes on a male slave his hands were crippled and his face and body were covered with soot as if he had just come from some kind of forge dressed in only a tattered loincloth he had a long filthy beard and hair that nearly reached his shoulders then the wine bottle dropped from tyrannys hand and she began to walk faster then faster still finally she was running for all she was worth across the bloody deck jacob she breathed not daring to believe jacob jacob as if locked within some kind of dream twentynine simply stared at her as she came running toward him with tears in his eyes he fell to his knees sobbing as she reached out her arms tyrannys face reflected exultant joy dropping to her knees she placed a hand on either side of twentynines face and looked into his eyes tears cascaded freely down his cheeks and he wrapped his shaking arms around her and held her close as though he never wanted to let go pulling him to her she closed her eyes and began gently rocking him back and forth as she ran one hand down over his long dirty hair after what seemed forever he looked back into her face mother and father he asked his voice little more than a hoarse whisper tyranny shook her head no she whispered back hearing boot heels tyranny looked up to see tristan standing beside them your brother he asked softly tyranny nodded jacob she said turning her eyes back to him i had almost given up hope tristan was about to speak again when a quick dark shadow passed over the deck looking up he saw a minion warrior half flying half tumbling down out of the sky his chest and arms were covered with blood and one of his wings seemed to be injured he was flying from the direction of the palace traax and two others immediately took off reaching their wounded comrade just as he was about to give up and come crashing to the deck holding him in their arms they landed gently and laid him down everyone crowded around the warriors wounds were grave wigg immediately knelt down and placed one palm on the minions forehead the wizard closed his eyes upon opening them again he stood up and looking sadly over at tristan shook his head kneeling down tristan looked into the warriors face his eyelids were heavy and his breathing was labored blood ran from his wounds to mingle with that already on the deck tristan lifted the warriors head up can you hear me the prince asked gently the warrior nodded weakly yes my lord did you come from the palace another nod what happened reaching out to grasp tristans forearm the minion tried to bring his face closer tristan leaned farther downso close that he could hear the death rattle starting to build in the warriors lungs the minions body was shaking a trickle of blood ran from one corner of his mouth demonslavers he whispered too many of them so many of us dead his face constricted with pain he looked up into tristans eyes you must hurry my lord celeste and the wizard faegan theyre with a final wheezing rattle the last breath escaped from the warriors lungs and his eyes closed gravely tristan laid the warriors head down on the deck of the reprisal standing he stared for a moment into traaxs eyes then he ran toward the litter shailiha abbey and wigg followed him he helped the others safely inside then was about to get in himself when tyranny brushed by him and began to climb in grabbing her by the arm tristan gave her a hard look what about jacob he asked stopping she turned and looked at him im coming with you she said flatly as the wind moved through her hair i owe you this if you hadnt seen to it that i had been given these ships my brother would still be out there somewhere and as for jacob he couldnt be in safer hands scars will care for him as he would care for me besides she added i have a feeling that youre going to need all the swords you can muster as she started to climb in again tristan pulled her back theres something i have to know he asked her urgently did you see any humans during your fight with the demonslavers anyone of the craft when tyranny shook her head tristans heart sank quickly the two joined the others in the litter as the litter rose from the decks of the reprisal the sky around it became dark with minion warriors like a strange cloud it turned to the southwest and sped across the sky soon the rich green grasses of the cavalon delta appeared below them as tristan looked out of the litter a single burning thought kept crowding out all his other fears celeste chapter seventyone w ith a wave of one hand wulfgar caused the hovering violin and bow to change the tune they were playing listening to the new haunting melody he closed his eyes and leaned back luxuriously in his chair when he finally opened his hazel eyes again he began to speak in an even measured tone just as a father might speak to a son whom he had decided needed to be punished youre making this far more difficult on yourself than need be he said quietly almost compassionately simply tell me where the scroll of the vigors is and i will grant you a quick painless death and the woman as well should she still be alive doesnt that sound wonderful just think of itno more agony in your legs and no more misplaced loyalty to a group of socalled friends who seem to have foolishly left you here in my care just a perfect forgiving and peaceful sleep that will last forever faegan slumped over in his chair his head lolling to one side drool dripped from one corner of his mouth and his robe was folded up over his lap exposing his crippled legs he was soaked with sweat and his entire body shook uncontrollably from time to time like a marionette dancing at the ends of some unseen masters strings the torture had been going on for more than two hours now and twice wulfgar had been forced to use the craft to bring his subject back to consciousness after the wizard had fainted and wulfgars patience was wearing thin the enseterat turned to look at the stillinert body of celeste lying facedown like a broken doll beneath the pile of records drawers he gave a short laugh he had not bothered to determine whether she was still alive but he really didnt care who was she he thought to think that she might challenge his powers he turned back to regard the azure serrated knife that hovered in the air near the wizards right calf he had chosen to conjure this particular instrument not only because it could yield its results slowly and with great precision but also because the simplicity of the concept amused him leaning forward wulfgar smiled sometimes less is more wouldnt you agree he asked faegan eyes glazed over the crippled wizard tried to lift his head but couldnt i will never tell you he said thickly no matter what you do to me as you wish wulfgar answered casually the enseterat narrowed his eyes and the serrated edge of the knife moved closer to faegans calf then it began to slowly scrape its way down along the raw exposed flesh and nerves of faegans leg faegan screamed his eyes bulged and the cords in his neck knotted standing out in sharp relief then the blade stopped about halfway down and wulfgar pursed his lips crying and babbling incoherently faegans head slumped forward onto his chest wulfgar sighed i may have to enter your mind after all he said casually even though that was not my first choice i now ask you for the last time where is the scroll slowly opening his eyes all faegan saw was a blur sitting across from him blinking hard he desperately tried to get his mind working again he had been holding out for as long as he could but he feared that if he rebelled much longer wulfgar would walk through his mind trying to discover the location of the scroll and if that happened now weak as faegan had become with the torture all of their planning would be for naught for then the bastard brother of the chosen ones would possess a secret far more precious than even the scroll of the vigors the secret that he wigg and abbey had discovered and wished to keep hidden no matter the cost he would do his best to endure one more use of the azure knife he thought drunkenly and then he would give wulfgar the scroll that was what wigg and abbey would wantto sacrifice the scroll in order to keep the secret raising his head faegan did his best to look into wulfgars eyes no he said bluntly do your worst gathering up all of the saliva he could muster he spat it directly into wulfgars face calmly wiping away the spittle wulfgar gave faegan a menacing smile as you wish the enseterat said softly narrowing his eyes wulfgar caused the knife blade to press up against faegans right leg and the crippled wizard cried out insanely as the blade made its slow torturous way down waves of hot searing pain shot through his nervous system the wizard knew that if the torture continued he would be only a few heartbeats away from death that was when he finally allowed himself to beg please he sobbed his voice was little more than a whisper ill tell you just dont do that any more i beg of you the knife stopped and moved over to one side wulfgar smiled thats more like it he said quietly leaning forward he folded his arms over his chest im waiting he whispered the far wall faegan answered at the end of the bookcase the three variegated swirls in the marble touch them all at once wulfgar stood and walked to the wall he reached up with his right hand and placed his first three fingers on the smooth cool spots faegan had described as he did the azure glow of the craft surrounded the area with a soft click a section of the marble wall revolved on a pivot to reveal a deep square vault the scroll of the vigors lay inside one end pointing toward him carefully almost reverently wulfgar pulled it from its resting place he cradled the scroll triumphantly he did not need the scroll of the vigors for his personal use his only need was for the scroll of the vagaries and the secrets it contained but by keeping this scroll away from the mentors of the jinsai and the jinsaiou he could keep tristan and shailiha perpetually untrained and in doing so he would ensure that he would rule supreme forever he turned to look back at faegan another smile crossed his face when the orb of the vigors is destroyed the life enchantments sustaining you and the lead wizard will vanish so i must now bid you a final goodbye i shall leave my warp in place so that you dont run off anywhere on his way out of the room wulfgar turned back before i go please let me ask you one final question he said courteously tell me traitor how does it feel to have betrayed everything you once held so dear without waiting for a reply wulfgar smiled again and the azure glow of the craft surrounded him then the glow disappeared and both he and the scroll were gone after a few moments the door to the hall of blood records opened then closed again sobbing faegan looked over at celeste then he looked at the empty vault in the wall its door still open and yawning at him tears ran down his cheeks and he lowered his face in shame chapter seventytwo b y the time tristans litter and its accompanying minion forces reached tammerland night was falling little had been said during the trip and it had seemed to the prince that for some reason wigg and abbey had remained especially distracted but he had to admit that he shailiha and tyranny had all been quiet as well their hearts heavy with concern about what might have become of faegan and celeste tristan was about to give the order to take them down when wigg leaned out of the litter and looked around after a time it seemed he had found what he was searching for have the minions land us on that rise coming up he said firmly there is something we must do before going any farther scowling tristan glared at the wizard are you mad he shouted celeste and faegan might be fighting for their lives for all you know we have to get to the palace no wigg shouted back he reached out and took tristan by the shoulders you must trust me there are things that faegan abbey and i have not told the rest of you for a moment tristan actually thought that the wizard might go so far as to use his powers if need be to enforce whatever he had in mind now do as i say wigg shouted and have them land the litter on that rise below us and dont send your troops into the fight until i have done what i came here for his jaw clenched in anger tristan looked out of the litter and shouted some orders out to traax almost immediately the litter and the minion host started toward the rise as they reached the top the palace grounds came into view below tristan looked down and took a short breath the blood and bodies of both minion and demonslaver alike littered the palace grounds the survivors were still battling the minions greatly outnumbered now were clearly losing this fight most of them had been forced into the courtyard their backs up against one of the inner walls as the demonslavers rushed them time and time again some of the demonslavers were also dying but it seemed that for every one of them that went down two or more minions died just as quickly there were so many demonslavers upon them that the minion warriors could not even take to the air his heart full of rage tristan spun around and glared at wigg with angry beseeching eyes as they landed whats wrong with you tristan shouted as he thrust one hand out pointing at the ongoing massacre cant you see that if i dont release my warriors the ones down there will be cut to pieces wigg grabbed him by the shoulders again what i am about to do must be done he said harshly there is no time to explain you simply must trust me what do you want to save the most eh some of the minions who have sworn to defend you or the very craft itself letting go of the princes shoulders wigg turned to abbey tristan watched as the lead wizard took a piece of parchment from his robes and handed it to her it was covered with what looked to be old eutracian then he touched the locket she always wore around her neck and kissed her cheek fear on her face she stood and exited the litter wigg waved his arms at the minions well dont just stand there he shouted we must go now as the litter and the minions climbed back into the sky abbey lifted her head and watched her lover depart one tear of concern fell down her cheek b y the time the litter reached the palace tristan shailiha tyranny and the minions were spoiling for a fight but by now wigg had convinced them of why they must not participate and also of their need to stay close to him looking down into the courtyard from the roof on which they had landed tristan saw his minions finally go flying down and begin tearing into the surprised demonslavers before landing he had given traax orders to leave none of the whiteskinned monstrosities alive grinning broadly the minion secondincommand had nodded in agreement wigg stepped from the litter and glanced up toward the sky he was greatly relieved to see that the twin orbs of the craft were not visible that meant that if wulfgar was indeed here he had not yet conjured them but it was imperative that they find morgannas firstborn before he was able to enact the forestallment that would allow him to destroy the orb of the vigors if wulfgar was cloaking his blood from wigg and he had also been gifted with the powers of invisibility by krassus trying to find him could be a nightmare if not a complete impossibility their only hope lay in the fact that wulfgar had clearly not yet destroyed the orb of the vigors for wigg still possessed his powers and so if they could not find wulfgar wigg would force him to come to them there was only one way to do that wigg would conjure forth the twin orbs of the craft before wulfgar did for wherever the orbs were wulfgar would also have to be in order to carry out his plan wasting no time wigg raised his arms as the four of them watched a gigantic glow coalesced in the inky night sky the glow began to spin quickly becoming the orb of the vigors the massive golden globe of energy that sustained the altruistic side of the craft the pale white beams that radiated from its center lit up the night sky for what seemed to be leagues in every direction tristan suddenly realized he had never witnessed the orbs at night it was an awesome sight then the darker menacing orb of the vagaries took shape its blackness scratched through by bright lightning tristan glanced down to see that the battle in the courtyard below was winding down at last the surviving demonslavers were being systematically beheaded just as he had ordered traax and ox landed quietly by his side ox looked exhausted and one leg was wounded traax gave his lord a nod and tristan nodded back satisifed he looked up at the sky again then wigg lowered his arms and a strange sense of quiet descended over everything the night larks and tree frogs stopped calling out to one another and the branches of the trees below were no longer swishing to and fro for the wind had suddenly stopped as well the orbs continued to hover silently as if waiting for something to happen and then they changed tristan glanced over at wigg and saw the lead wizard shake his head telling him that it was not he who was causing this phenomenon wulfgar he thought the orbs had moved closer to each other than he had ever seen shards of lightning had begun to shoot back and forth between them and the orbs themselves were shaking tristan glanced at wigg to see that the lead wizards face had blanched as he watched spellbound a band of azure light took form between the orbs it slowly extended itself from the side of the orb of the vigors growing hauntingly until it reached the orb of the vagaries and attached itself then this new connection between the orbs transformed itself from mere light into what looked like a tangible mass it glowed ever brighter until it became almost impossible to look upon suddenly tristan knew what it was the isthmus the bridge between the two sides of the craft that would somehow allow the destruction of the orb of the vigors and it had been conjured by wulfgar a deep commanding laugh shattered the silence tristan shailiha and tyranny drew their swords blades ringing loudly as one through the air as they did the laugh came again tell me brother a voice said do you really think you can kill me with a weapon as crude as that they all looked around but they saw nothing except the magnificent orbs the laugh came yet again mocking them then an azure glow began to build on one side of the roof turning his hand clamped tightly around the hilt of his sword tristan watched as the glow took shape as it coalesced he and shailiha found themselves staring at their longlost sibling the half brother they hadnt known existed until only a short time ago wulfgar was wearing emerald silk trousers and a matching jacket that lay partially open exposing his muscular chest his sandy hair was pulled back from his forehead in his arms he held the scroll of the vigors if wulfgar had the scroll that meant he had found faegan tristan realized was the wizard dead and what had happened to celeste placing the precious scroll down on the roof wulfgar gave them all a menacing smile and took several brazen steps nearer at that moment wigg raised his arms and sent twin azure bolts at wulfgar casually almost lazily wulfgar also raised his hands and caught a bolt in each then placing his hands together he joined the two bolts into one and took another step forward as he did he looked squarely at wigg and smiled again then he spread his fingers the azure bolt went screaming back toward wigg and struck him squarely in the chest throwing him high into the air and across the roof he landed hard on his back unconscious the front of his robe was scorched and smoking and his arms were outstretched as if in supplication tristan shailiha and tyranny ran to him and knelt down wigg didnt seem to be breathing standing slowly tristan glared back with hatred at the monster that had just dared call him brother is he dead he asked his body shaking with anger he wanted to attack wulfgar then and there but after all he had just seen he knew it would be hopeless wulfgar simply smiled i asked you a question you bastard the prince raged is wigg dead on hearing the insulting reference to his parentage wulfgars face fell for a moment and his gaze hardened then his composure resurfaced again wulfgar pursed his lips probably he answered shortly i dont really know nor do i care any more than i care about faegan or the daughter of the socalled lead wizard then the smile came again dont you see he asked he gave a sarcastic laugh im still rather new at all this completely beyond anger tristan took a determined step forward but shailiha grabbed his arm tristan stopped but continued to stare into wulfgars eyes you had best listen to our sister wulfgar said you are untrained and i could kill you with a single thought then why dont you tristan snarled i may do that yet wulfgar answered softly but as you have apparently guessed i have other more important business to finish first a mission that your late son first entrusted to krassus and then krassus entrusted to me a new thought seemed to cross his mind and he smiled at tristan tell me jinsai he said nastily what does it feel like to know that you have not only murdered your own father but have also lost your only child as well tristan took a slow measured step forward the same way it will feel when i kill my only brother he growled quietly sad but necessary wulfgar shook his head krassus told me you would be inordinately stubborn in your beliefs he said he looked down into the courtyard to see that the princes minions were finishing off his demonslavers strangely he seemed quite unconcerned dont you care about what is happening to them tristan asked why should i wulfgar answered you have apparently done away with my fleet or you wouldnt be standing here i dont know how you did it and i dont care none of that matters any longer for neither of your wizards can help you the demonslavers the screechlings and the sea slitherers were only a means to an end besides the slavers were all originally your subjects not mine and by the way he continued order those minion warriors behind you to go back down into the courtyard and tell the others not to come up if any of them approach our lovely sisteryour famous twinwill die turning tristan looked at the warriors and gave them a nod reluctantly they jumped from the edge of the roof and soared toward the courtyard trying hard not to look up at the hill above them tristan turned back to wulfgar he could only hope that after hearing what wigg had told them in the litter shailiha and tyranny would have the good sense to do the same he thought desperately as if by willing it hard enough he could somehow make them hear him if wulfgar turned his gaze there they would all be finished now then wulfgar said almost politely shall we begin raising one arm he encased everyone before him on the roof in a wizards warp tristan couldnt move any of his limbs but he found that he still controlled his powers of speech apparently satisfied wulfgar stared calmly at the people trapped in his warp youre going to destroy the orb of the vigors arent you shailiha asked thats what this has been about all along of course wulfgar answered calmly but before i do there is something i would like the two of you to know it will pain you to hear it im sure but then again making my brother and sister happy isnt really why i have come what is it tristan asked looking over to one side wulfgar pointed down at the scroll of the vigors that scroll he began the one you held in your possession so briefly holds many of the answers you seek yes jinsai it even tells of the potential coming of your azure blood and of how you might eventually rid yourself of it but now with the scroll in my possession none of those things will ever happen for until your blood reverts you cannot be trained cannot wear the paragon and cannot read the tome and you will be unable to fulfill your socalled destiny you will even be barred from siring children for your tainted blood would be far too dangerous for any womans to join with have your friends the wizards told you that yet your famous allpowerful blood that was to have empowered you above all others is now the very thing you must most despise the wicked smile came again aside from me of course he added knowingly he turned to look at the orbs how can one of our blood be so evil shailiha shouted at him doesnt any part of you care about the horrific irreparable damage you are about to cause turning back from the orbs wulfgar looked directly into his sisters eyes evil you say he asked her dont you understand i have no concept of the word evil as krassus was so fond of saying we of the vagaries simply have a different point of view turning again he raised his hands almost immediately the orbs began burning brighter never taking his eyes from his bastard brother tristan turned his thoughts toward the hill a bbey saw wulfgar turn toward the orbs and saw them glow even more brightly she levitated the parchment wigg had given her so that it hovered in the air before her opening the cinch bag at her waist she took out a pinch of precious herbs and placed them on the tinder she had prepared and lit then she stood back and used her gifts to force the fire higher and higher when it was at last about two meters high and a meter wide she crooked a finger toward her ordering the flame to divide into two unequal branches curling her finger again she pointed to the right and the smaller of the two flames flattened out coming dangerously close to scorching her hands and face looking down she blessed the afterlife that wulfgars back was still toward her she threw another pinch of herbs into the branch of flame then reached for and opened the silver locket that hung around her neck the usual dark locket of hair the one belonging to the lead wizard still lay inside as always but now there was another with it it was sandy colored and secured around its center with a red ribbon it was wulfgarsthe lock of hair that she had first seen in the hall of blood records when wigg had explained wulfgar to them and shown them his blood signature the lock of his hair that his grandmother had taken from him before her daughter gave him over to the orphanage thirtyfour years ago she removed the ribbon and divided the lock of hair into two halves than dropped one half into the lower of the two flames and held the other half high she was ordering her flame to find wulfgar even though he was in plain view she knew she was risking her life by doing so she was only a partial and so her attempt to find wulfgar one of those of the womb of queen morganna would undoubtedly call forth the furiesthe same phenomenon that she had experienced that day in the courtyard when she faegan and shailiha had nearly been killed while trying to find the prince by employing a drop of his twin sisters blood but this time she prayed she had the answer a s the orbs and the isthmus joining them glowed ever more brightly wulfgar smiled even though the forestallment required to accomplish his task was immensely refined the concept behind his mission was exceedingly simple he could still hear krassus explaining to him how it was to be done as though it were only yesterday first call upon your blood and conjure forth the isthmus when the isthmus has appeared and the orbs seem stable then use your mind to open the gate at the end connected to the orb of the vagaries and allow its dark energy to trickle through as it begins to reach the orb of the vigors open the other end of the isthmus and force the dark energy inside the orb of the vigors without allowing it to return to its source the orb of the vigors shall therefore become polluted while the orb of the vagaries shall remain pristine when enough dark energy has finally been transfused however the cataclysm will wish to commence and you must be exceedingly careful lest you risk the destruction of the world for chaos is the natural order of the universe but if done correctly before the great cataclysm occurs the controlled nature of your work will cause the orb of the vigors to explode in a great ball of fire and light and your mission will be complete the vigors will be no more wulfgar and you may return to the citadel and rule in splendor forever closing his eyes wulfgar used his mind to open the floodgate at the end of the isthmus touching the orb of the vagaries as he did its destructive energy trickled into the isthmus and flowed down the length of its interior making it darker as it went any second now tristan saw the energy of the vagaries would reach the orb of the vigors and everything they treasured would be gone forever j ust as it had done that day in the courtyard the top of abbeys gazing flame began to swell the viewing window also began to form but that was not her main concern this time looking at the parchment hovering in the air before her she began urgently reading aloud the formula that wigg and faegan had found in the scroll of the vigors only days beforethe formula that the community of partial adepts had for centuries whispered would countermand the action of the furies and send the energy back to the subject a thousandfold with a great explosion her gazing flame burst throwing her to the ground but unlike the previous time that was not the end of it sheets of pure energy shot from the exploding flame illuminating everything for leagues around the night sky erupted in a cacophony of noise and light as the energy streaked down the hill searching out the subject that was to have been viewed wulfgar sensing that something had gone terribly wrong wulfgar turned for a moment to look up the hill as the light shards came nearer his face contorted into a mixture of confusion and terror then the furies magnified a thousandfold found him ignoring the orbs wulfgar turned to confront the furies in a desperate effort to save his life frantically he sent azure bolts against them but to no avail as the bolts slammed into the energy cascading down the hill they simply fizzled away against it dissipating into nothingness unaffected the furies continued toward him tearing across the roof they passed over the scroll of the vigors and headed unerringly for wulfgar as they approached their target they began to produce a whirling maelstrom that soon surrounded him trapping him within its confines as it closed in on him wulfgar could feel the intense heat it emitted he knew that if he remained inside he would die for a few precious moments he turned his hateful gaze on tristan and shailiha they heard him scream insanely then the scream died away the maelstrom closed in hardand exploded as the force of the blast tore through the night air tristan shailiha and tyranny felt the searing heat and power of the dying furies from the confines of wulfgars deteriorating warp trees from the nearby hill were uprooted and sent flying into the air and parts of the palace roof exploded sending marble pieces high into the sky then the warp finally vanished altogether and tristan shailiha and tyranny collapsed to the roof tristan could barely move craning his neck he looked over to see that the two women were either unconscious or dead it was all the prince could do to look up at the glowing orbs of the craft wulfgars isthmus had vanished and the orbs seemed to be undamaged suddenly they were gone using what strength he had left tristan looked over at the scroll blessedly it still lay on the palace roof where wulfgar had left it in horror he saw that the scroll of the vigorsthe only known document in the world that could provide the answers he so desperately needed about himselfwas burning he tried to crawl toward it but his strength gave out and he collapsed back down to the roof the last thing he remembered before passing out was his minion troops finally landing on the roof beside him and traax and ox running toward the burning document chapter seventythree i n the name of the afterlife hold still wigg shouted at rebecca he had been extremely cranky for the last three days and it seemed to him that every bone in his threehundredplusyearold body still hurt tristan he growled softly trying not to frighten the young girl any more than she already was can you get her to calm down somehow i simply cannot do this properly if she wont stay still smiling with one corner of his mouth tristan took rebecca by the shoulders and gently pushed her back down onto the table then he whispered something into her ear and she giggled she promised to remain still as best she could then gave wigg a curious look and giggled once more narrowing his eyes wigg called the craft and again started employing the process that would begin healing her clubfoot as he did rebecca seemed to calm down he cast a wary eye toward the prince what did you say to her he asked oh nothing tristan answered casually just that whenever you become irritated the vein in your forehead starts to throb i suggested she watch it to pass the time and count how many times it did before you finished sighing wigg shook his head then snorted a laugh and went back to his work tristan wigg faegan abbey shailiha celeste and tyranny were all in attendance here in wiggs personal drawing room the stainedglass windows had been swung open to let in the fresh morning air and the songs of the birds marcus stood next to the lead wizard and shailiha held morganna on her hip shawna stood to one side watching the process unfold she had become quite attached to rebecca and her brother even though marcus had proved to be quite a handful looking around the room tristan felt a great sense of thankfulness he wondered briefly how the wizards would react to what he had planned they had all somehow managed to stay alive during their recent ordeal but just barely tristan tyranny and shailiha had acquired some burns with the onslaught of the furies but had been protected for the most part by wulfgars warp abbey had also been burned but not more so than the first time the furies had erupted wigg faegan and celeste however had suffered far worse wigg had been deeply injured by wulfgars bolts beneath his robes he was a mass of black and blue and would be for weeks but after a few sessions of abbeys healing skills he was finally feeling better and would continue to improve celeste had also survived but her left forearm had been broken in wulfgars attack and it was wrapped in a sling it was only the high quality of her and her fathers blood it was later assumed that had kept the lead wizard and his daughter alive celeste sat in a chair along one wall as her father tended to rebecca faegans case was different his injuries had been physical to be sure but they had also been psychological it was plain by the look on his face that he was ashamed at having been broken by wulfgars torture even though he had succeeded in keeping secret their plan with the furies knowing faegan as they did the others realized that it would take the old wizard some time to get over what he considered to be so great a personal failure then tristan was reminded of the time enchantments and he smiled slightly if there was one thing the wizards had plenty of it was time as for the scroll of the vigors it had been once again locked away in the redoubt awaiting further research and true to form ever since wulfgar had been defeated the two wizards had chosen to rest rather than make explanations tristan was determined to get his answers as soon as wigg finished with rebecca and while everyone was still here whether the wizards felt like talking or not and he had a special request to put before them one that had been on his mind for some time now but for that he would wait until the three of them were alone almost a full hour later wigg finally stopped what he was doing after another quick examination of rebeccas foot he seemed pleased you may get up now he said to her place your weight on your foot and see how it feels rebecca sat up slipped her legs over the side of the table and tentatively stood as she did her face registered pure joy marcus she shouted gleefully come and look marcus ran to her side of the table and looked down his sisters misshapen foot looked completely normal for the first time in her young life rebecca was finally without pain with tears of joy in her eyes she began skipping around the drawing room she finally stopped in front of the lead wizard she looked up into his eyes with a humble expression then she crooked a finger at him beckoning him closer with a characteristic rise of one eyebrow he did as she asked before he knew it she had wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him on the cheek thank you she said softly i will never forget what you have done for me i wont either marcus added and im sorry if ive been a lot of trouble youre quite welcome wigg replied simply as he did abbey came up beside him and linked one of her arms through his three hundred and sixty times im sure of it rebecca said unexpectedly i beg your pardon wigg asked three hundred and sixty she answered back thats how many times the vein in your head throbbed then she looked innocently over to where faegan sat in his chair stroking his cat nicodemus if i asked him real nice maybe mr faegan could fix that for you she said helpfully despite how long everybody says youve been around it seems that you havent been able to do it for yourself the entire room roared even wigg embarrassed as he seemed to be gave up and erupted into laughter abbey leaned over and placed her lips close to his ear that will be the day she whispered coyly uh er that wont be necessary wigg finally answered rebecca but thank you for offering just the same deciding it was time to get back to business tristan looked over at shawna would you please take the children back to their quarters he asked her we have some matters to discuss with a quick nod shawna herded rebecca and marcus from the room softly closing the door behind them wasting no time tristan walked over to stand next to celeste and then trained his dark eyes on wigg determined he folded his arms over his chest i already know that you and faegan must have found the calculations for reversing the furies somewhere in the scroll of the vigors he said its the only answer that makes any sense but what i dont know is when and why didnt you tell us until the last minute father celeste asked using her good arm she reached up to take one of tristans hands wouldnt it have been better if we had all known actually no it wouldnt have faegan answered as he wheeled his chair into the center of the room reaching into his lap he gave nicodemus a scratch under the neck why not shailiha asked because the fewer of us who knew the better he answered you tristan and wigg were about to leave to search out the demonslaver fleet at the time wigg and i thought that we might be at least partially able to fight off wulfgars use of the craft on our minds should it come to that but if you celeste or tristan had been captured you never could have resisted his probes for none of you have been trained to do so therefore we did not tell you of the secret location of the scroll or the discovery of the calculations what you did not know could not be tortured from you no matter how hard wulfgar might have tried and as it turned out even i was unable to resist his torture he added softly and he ended up taking the scroll anyway still that was better than revealing to him the calculations of the furies but you took a great chance did you not shailiha asked you could have been killed true faegan answered but remember at that time we still did not know whether wulfgar was even coming or by what route that is why we decided to leave me and celeste here to guard the scroll then he looked down at his hands again i want to apologize to everyone he said softly and especially to tristan if wulfgar had not been given the location of the scroll it would still be intact but i held out for as long as i could to make him believe that the location of the scroll was all i had to give him and the condition of the scroll tristan asked softly not daring to hope what of that placing his hands into the opposite sleeves of his robe wigg sighed as best we can determine about twofifths of the scroll of the vigors has been completely destroyed he answered sadly we have forever lost what were surely some of the most important secrets of the craft but we will do what we can with the parts that remain and do you believe wulfgar to be dead abbey asked snaking her arm a little farther underneath wiggs she edged closer to him yes the lead wizard answered flatly neither faegan nor i can see how anyone no matter how powerful he or she was in the craft could have survived that he was undoubtedly vaporized by the furies what about the traitorous consuls he commanded shailiha asked they remain a threat to us do they not faegan scowled that is impossible to say he answered grimly we must accept the possibility that in addition to those he controlled at the citadel some of them remain in eutracia with wulfgar dead there will be a power vacuum within their ranks sadly that may make them even more dangerous than before there are few things as unpredictable as a zealous army without a leader tristan looked over at his sister to find the same mixed expression on her face that he knew was on his own wulfgar had been a monsterthat much was certain but part of tristan wanted to believe that somewhere sometime wulfgar had once been a kind honorable man before krassus demonslavers had come for him silence reigned for moment and then tyranny spoke up forgive me tristan she said my brother awaits me and i need to check on the condition of my wounded crewmembers and my ships smiling slightly tristan looked over at the highly competent touslehaired privateer i understand he said quietly but before you go i have something for you several things actually that i believe will come in handy they should be here by now walking over to the door tristan opened it and looked out into the hallway at a sign from him kjarr led six minion warriors into the room tyrannys mouth fell open everyone else in the room seemed equally surprised wigg scowled a bit and faegan gave a soft cackle do you mean to say yes tristan interrupted her i am giving you command of these six warriors they were each handpicked by traax chosen by him from a large group of volunteers it seems dear lady that you have made quite an impression on them they are to sail with you two weeks from now and not before for reasons you will discover later i do not wish you to depart until then i also ordered the construction of a special litter for you and it awaits you in the courtyard kjarr has kindly offered to be an ongoing part of this both to act as an overseer of the warriors in any orders you might give them and to more fully brief you on minion customs and tactics these warriors are to be rotated with others every six months you will find that they make especially good scouts but i have a selfish motive in all of this as well with both these warriors and a litter aboard the reprisal you will be able to reach the palace far more quickly should you need to seeing her stillamazed expression he gave her a short knowing smile and given your natural proclivities for trouble i think you will need them rather a lot he added slyly still stunned tyranny walked over to him and embraced him warmly then she looked into his face i dont know what to say she said softly smiling he raised his right hand and spat into his palm yes you do he said he raised his hand a bit higher done he said smiling broadly tyranny spat into her right hand and slapped her palm into his and done she answered back warmly tristan turned back to face the room and now i wish to be alone with my wizards he told everyone then he looked at faegan and wigg and grinned widely i have a proposition for them wigg raised an eyebrow and faegans normally impish curious countenance returned the remaining people in the room walked to the door as they did the prince gave celeste and shailiha a smile of goodbye after they had all left wigg scowled and folded his arms over his chest what is this about he asked skeptically saying nothing tristan bade the two wizards to join him out on the sunlit balcony as they did he took a chair at the table crossed one of his long legs over the other and poured himself a cup of tea and then in quiet measured tones he told them of his plan chapter seventyfour a s tristan walked down the colorful hallways of the redoubt his boot heels rang out against the marble floor once again reminding him of what a lonely massive place this underground labyrinth could be while it was true that many of the previously wandering acolytes had passed the wizards examinations and now called this place home their numbers were still too few even to begin returning the redoubt to its former level of activity still he realized it was a start new beginnings he thought to himself as he crossed through yet another of the redoubts intersections snapping his heels together the minion warrior on guard came to stiff attention as his lord passed by not wishing to be late tristan only nodded and kept on going two weeks had passed since the day when rebeccas foot had been cured and tristans subsequent time alone with the two wizards had gone well he had spent the remainder of that morning with them out on wiggs balcony explaining in great detail what he wished to do it was time tristan had told them and in the end they had agreed when he had finished the prince thought he had seen some shininess in their eyes but being the indomitable mystics that they were each had caused it to vanish as quickly as it appeared the wizards had then informed everyone of tristans decision and asked them all to meet at the appointed day and hour finally approaching the elaborately carved double doors he saw the two minion warriors standing guard on either side each of them held a long goldtipped spear in one hand the spears end planted firmly by the heel of his foot the point held away from his body as the prince approached they snapped their heels together and pulled their spears toward them into an upright position stopping before them tristan nodded his approval has the furniture i ordered been brought here he asked yes my lord one of them answered minion artisans finished it only this afternoon and it was moved into the room several hours ago and everyone who was asked to attend tristan said are they present all except for commander traax the warrior answered and where is he tristan asked right behind you tristan heard traaxs voice ring out as traax walked up he seemed to be trying to force down a smile i apologize for being late where have you been tristan asked smiling traax shook his head it seems that a situation has developed that required my attention he answered wryly at first tristan stiffened wondering whether they all might be in danger again but he realized from the expression on traaxs face that he could relax and what might that be he asked its about the two children marcus and rebecca what about them tristan asked theyre gone and so is the thirteen thousand kisa tristans eyes went wide at first he didnt know whether to laugh or cry then he looked at the infectious expression on traaxs face again and he decided to laugh how he asked and when we still dont know how traax answered shawna is beside herself of course but shell get over it eventually feeling that she could finally trust them she had dismissed the warrior who usually watched over them what a mistake as to when well it happened sometime during the night i think that marcus had this planned for some time now and the only thing he was waiting for was for wigg to cure his sisters foot so that for the first time in her life she could run away as fast as he could pausing for a moment traax smiled and shook his head again thirteen thousand kisa is a great deal of money he said quietly but you know in an odd sort of way i think they both earned it rubbing his forehead tristan couldnt help but laugh again partly he knew because he found traaxs news so amusing and partly because it simply felt so good to laugh long and hard again after so long he looked back up at traax do you wish me to send out search parties the warrior asked no no tristan said with a wave of one hand i think theyve earned it too then may i request a favor the warrior asked what is it whenever you finally tell the wizards might i also be in attendance the looks on their faces will be worth every bit of that thirteen thousand kisa tristan laughed again yes he answered but until then this stays just between the two of us his mood turning more serious tristan turned and faced the door are you ready he asked traax from this moment on so many things will change yes my lord traax replied gravely his face had suddenly become full of both respect and gratitude this is a great thing you have done and i thank you with all my heart tristan nodded at the two warriors flanking the doors and they obediently opened them then the prince and traax walked in and took their appointed seats with the others the magnificently carved table tristan had ordered two weeks ago was ten sided and a matching highbacked chair sat at each station an image of the paragon had been beautifully inlaid in its center each chair held a person he cared for very much and who possessed each in his or her own way talents that would no doubt serve them all well into the future their seating arrangement alternated by gender their names had been carved into the tops of their chairs just as the chair of the illfated directorate of wizards had been as tristan looked around the table he was reminded of why he had selected each of them wigg and faegan were here of course as fullfledged representatives of the craft wigg was wearing his golden ceremonial dagger around his waist and from faegans neck hung the paragon its bloodred facets dancing in the light of the fireplace between them sat abbey as a representative of the partial adepts the mysterious men and women of the craft whom the prince still knew so little about but hoped to learn so much more on faegans left sat a very stunned adrian of the house of brandywyne whom wigg and faegan had selected to represent the acolytes of the redoubt and on her left was traax next to traax sat shailiha caprice perched quietly at the top of her mistress chair gently opening and closing her violetandyellow wings after her came geldon whose knowledge of parthalon had no equal at tristans right was celeste the love of his life and finally on the princes left sat tyranny with the minion fleet smashed she and her small squadron of privateers now represented the only seaborne defenses eutracia had looking up tristan nodded to the minion still waiting by the door the warrior walked into the hallway closed the door behind himself and took up his post by my order the directorate is no more tristan said solemnly we are now the conclave of the vigors
