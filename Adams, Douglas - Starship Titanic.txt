douglas adamss starship titanic by terry jones introduction the idea for starship titanic first surfaced in the way that a lot of ideas originate as a mere couple of sentences out of nowhere years ago it was just a little digression in life the universe and everything i said that the starship titanic had shortly into its maiden voyage undergone spontaneous massive existence failure its just one of those bits that you put in while you are waiting for the plot to develop you think well ill develop another quick plot while im about it so it sat there as a couple of sentences in l u e and after a while i thought well i think there is a little bit more to this idea and tossed it around for a while at one point i even considered developing it as a novel in itself and then thought no it sounded too much like a good idea and im always wary of those in the mid eighties i did a textonly computer game version of the hitchhikers guide with a company called infocom i had a lot of fun working on it the player gets caught up in a virtual conversation with the machine in writing such a thing you are trying to imagine and prepare for the reactions of a virtual audience theres a lot you can do with text as several thousand years of human culture can attest but it seemed to me that what the computer enabled us to do was to reach back to the days before printing and recreate the old art of interactive storytelling they didnt call it interactive in those days of course they didnt know of anything that wasnt interactive so they didnt need a special name for it when someone stood up and recounted a story the audience responded and the storyteller responded right back at them it was the coming of print that took away the interactive element and locked stories into rigid forms it seemed to me that interactive computermediated storytelling might be able to combine some of the best of both forms however while the medium was still in its infancy along came computer graphics and killed it off text may be a very rich medium but it looks boring on the screen it doesnt flash and hop about and so it had to give way to things that did early computer graphics of course were slow crude and ugly as a medium it didnt interest me so i thought id sit things out and wait till the graphics got good ten years later they were good but interaction had largely been reduced to pointing at things and clicking i missed the conversations that text games used to engage you in maybe i thought it would be possible to combine both at about this time i was involved with a group of friends in the setting up of a new digital media company the digital village i began to cast around for a good subject for our first big project a cdrom adventure game that would combine stateoftheart graphics with a natural language parser which would enable the player to engage the characters in conversation suddenly starship titanic stood out from the pack as we embarked on what grew into a huge project the subject of novelization came up now writing novels is what i normally do and here was a peach because in an amazing departure from my normal practice i had developed a story which not only had a beginning but also a middle and a recognizable end however the publishers insisted that the novel would have to come out at the same time as the game to enable them to sell it i couldnt do both simultaneously i had to accept that i couldnt do the novel except at the cost of not doing what i had set out to do in the first place which was the game so who could possibly write the novel about this time terry jones came into the production office one of the characters in the game is a semideranged workmans parrot which had been left on board the ship and terry had agreed to play the voice part in fact it was clearly the part he had been born to play when terry saw all the graphics and character animations we had been creating over the previous months he became very excited about the whole project and uttered the fateful words is there anything else you need doing i said you wanna write a novel and terry said yeah all right provided he added i can write it in the nude terry is one of the most famous people in the known universe and his bottom is only slightly less well known than his face it has of course only been displayed when strictly necessary on artistic grounds but such is the nature of his art that this has turned out to be extraordinarily often from nakedman playing organ and man in bed with carol cleveland from the monty python tv show to naked hermit in pit in monty pythons life of brian the creative life has been one long nudist romp for mr jones he is also renowned as a film and tv director scriptwriter medieval scholar author of childrens books including the awardwinning the saga of erik the viking but none of these activities provide quite enough sheer kit removal opportunities for him hence his stipulation that he would write starship titanic in the nude in comes all the freshness lightness and lyrical vulnerability of a man sitting at his word processor buttnaked ive always wanted to collaborate on something with terry ever since i first met him almost twentyfive years ago wearing a pretty floral dress and heaving a small tactical nuclear device on to the back of a cart in a leafy suburban street in exeter as you are about to discover he has written an altogether sillier naughtier and more wonderful novel than i would have done and in doing so has earned himself an altogether unique credit parrot and novel by terry jones douglas adams where is leovinus demanded the gat of blerontis chief quantity surveyor of the entire north eastern gas district of the planet of blerontin no i do not want another bloody fishpaste sandwich he did not exactly use the word bloody because it did not exist in the blerontin language the word he used could be more literally translated as similar in size to the left earlobe but the meaning was much closer to bloody nor did he actually use the phrase fishpaste since fish do not exist on blerontin in the form in which we would understand them to be fish but when one is translating from a language used by a civilization of which we know nothing located as far away as the centre of the galaxy one has to approximate similarly the gat of blerontis was not exactly a quantity surveyor and certainly the term north eastern gas district gives no idea at all about the magnificence and grandeur of his position look perhaps id better start again where is leovinus demanded the gat of blerontis the most important and significant statesman on the entire planet of blerontin the launch cannot proceed without him several minor officials were dispatched to search for the great man meanwhile the vast crowd simmered with mounting impatience in front of the grand assembly dock where the new starship stood veiled in its attractive pink silk sheeting not one member of the crowd had glimpsed even so much as a nut or a bolt of the ship but already its fame had swept the galaxy from spiral arm to spiral arm back on the launch podium the great leovinus had still not been sighted a minor official was explaining yet again to the gat of blerontis why the fishpaste sandwiches were essential normally your stupendous and most lofty magnificence you would be quite right in supposing that the mere launch of a starship would not be marked out by such distinguished observances but as you are aware this starship is different this starship is the greatest most gorgeous most technologically advanced starship ever built this is the ultimate starship the greatest cybernautic achievement of this or any other age and it is utterly indestructible the intergalactic council therefore thought it suitable to declare it a fishpaste sandwich event the gats heart sank his last line of defence shrivelled before his eyes and he knew he was condemned to eat at least one fishpaste canapeґ before the launch was over the taste he knew would endure for months and a blerontin month was equivalent to several lifetimes if you happened to come from earth which of course nobody there did in fact nobody in that entire throng of some fifty million blerontinians who had turned up to see the launch of the greatest starship in the history of the universe had ever even heard of the earth and if youd asked them they wouldnt have been able to understand you because translation blisters were not allowed to be worn on a fishpaste event it was another of those stupid little traditions that made the gat furious the blerontins insist on serving socalled fishpaste sandwiches during festivals and important book launches despite the fact that all blerontins find them disgusting it is a tradition that dates back to a time when blerontin was an impoverished planet living on the edge of starvation having run out of every other kind of food the blerontin team were reluctantly forced to offer up fishpaste sandwiches as their entry for the centennial intergalactic canapeґs championship for some unaccountable reason the fishpaste appealed to the jaded palates of the judges clinched the championship for blerontin and paved the way for blerontinian domination of the entire galactic centre for aeons to come and still leovinus did not appear everyone here is holding their breath and keeping their fingers crossed whispered the head reporter of the blerontin news gathering bureau into his invisible microphone no one has yet even caught so much as a glimpse of the fabulous starship but everyone is certain that it will not only be the most technologically advanced but also the most beautiful starship ever to have been created it is after all the brainchild of leovinus to whose architectural genius we owe the great north south bridge that now links our two polar caps to whose musical inspiration we owe the blerontin national anthem our canapeґs triumph daily and to whose unsurpassable mastery of ballistics and biomass energetics we owe our third sun that now shines above us with its own famous onoffswitch but theres news just coming in that whats that ladies and gentleman and things it appears that the great leovinus has gone missing nobody has seen him all day surely they cant start the launch without him but the crowd are beginning to demand some action and uhoh whats that a sour note had swept through the crowd as a band of short individuals dressed in ragged overalls and flat caps suddenly forced their way into the spectators area they were shouting in a language no one could understand and they were brandishing indecipherable placards it looks as if the yassaccan delegation has managed to gain entry an edge of alarm had entered the head reporters voice this was mainly because he had his entire commentary written down in advance as he always did the thought that an unforeseen turn of events might now force him to look at what was actually going on and then improvise was a nightmare that had dogged his sleep for all the years that he had been in the reporting business um said the head reporter he felt his head going light er he fought for breath as he felt his bowels starting to move oh ahm what can i say he was praying that the words would come to him in his recurring nightmare the one that he always had after eating snork chitterlings he was in this very situation something unforeseen had occurred his script was whisked away by some unseen hand and the words just never came it has to be explained in defence of the head reporter that unforeseen circumstances seldom occurred during public events on blerontin owing to the fact that the authorities exerted a pretty tight control over these things it coming yust out who exclaimed the head reporter at that moment an unseen hand whisked away his script and the head reporter felt a warm sensation all over his lower abdomen ive done it i mean its definitely yassaccans i can see them now that was practically two whole sentences he could do it theyve purpley pinchburps oh damn it was one thing not to be able to think of anything but how could he possibly come out with utter nonsense that hadnt been in his nightmare it was worse the truth is that this personal disaster for the head reporter was just one in a string of disasters that had dogged the building of the starship there had been rumours of corners cut the cybernet pigeon cursors had been belowspec the great engine had been mislaid leovinus himself had quarrelled with the chairman of starstruct inc there had been arguments between leovinus and his manager brobostigon there had been quarrels between brobostigon and leovinuss accountant scraliontis there had been arguments between scraliontis and leovinus and so on and so on the fact of the matter was that the construction of the starship had brought financial ruin on almost everybody involved including one entire planet yassacca had been hitherto a flourishing resort of industrious folk with the most efficient and dependable construction industry in the central galaxy yassacca had enjoyed centuries of quiet prosperity and a high reputation they never overcharged they always delivered on time they never cut corners they were a race of proud craftsmen who had nothing to do with intergalactic canapeґs competitions and thus were able to devote their wealth to the wellbeing of their own people that was until they undertook the construction of leovinuss masterpiece the crowning achievement of his career the starship that even now stands hidden from sight in its launching bay awaiting the unveiling ceremony give us back our happy lifestyle shout the yassaccan demonstrators unintelligibly to the blerontinian onlookers planets not starships roar their placards to the baffled crowd get those bastards out of there growls flortin rimanquez the chief of police and rabbits where is leovinus groans the gat of blerontis could it be only the day before that leovinus had held his press conference he had felt so powerfully complacent as he stepped up onto the platform his white beard had been specially groomed by pheronis pheronisis the greatest hairdresser on blerontin and his eyebrows had been stuck back on with a new toupee tape that was guaranteed absolutely undetectable in many ways this was the greatest moment in his life what is it like to be not only the greatest architect the galaxy has ever known but also the greatest sculptor the greatest mathematical genius as well as a worldclass gamisher and canapeґs arranger exactly the kind of question leovinus enjoyed there had been times in his younger days when he might have retorted go lick someone elses arse hack im only interested in truth and beauty but somehow he found that the more wrinkles he counted on his forehead and the more problems he had with his continence and his seventimes table the more he found a little flattery most welcome i loved your pandax building with the interchangeable rooms and total reassembly potential shouted a young cub reporter with soft eyes and a delightful cleavage thank you leovinus beamed in his most venerable and yet at the same time approachable manner you look terrific shouted another leovinus was just trying to decide which of the two cub reporters with delightful cleavages he should ask backstage for a little drink or whether he should invite them both and then see how things worked out when a male voice cut across exactly what was the scientific experiment you were working on when you had your recent accident sir and is it true that your eyebrows have still not grown back leovinus fought off a panic attack and told himself his eyebrows looked perfectly ok this hardboiled journalist was merely trying to wind him up then he had to fight off a panic attack about the fact that hed just had a panic attack its perfectly normal to get panic attacks at my age he told himself severely while at the same time noting thankfully the ripple of embarrassment that had swept through the assembled media im lucky i dont have angina and a sagging bottom at my age leovinus had always counted his blessings but something had definitely gone wrong with the press conference a journalist from the back was asking a question in a tone of voice that didnt sound in the least bit ingratiating in fact there was something so uningratiating about the inflection of the voice that leovinus could barely understand what was being said i said repeated the journalist in that same uncajoling voice how do you answer the allegations that corners have been cut on the construction of the starship and that there have been financial improprieties involving your manager antar brobostigon and your accountant droot scraliontis such insinuations replied leovinus forming his toupeed eyebrows into the most formidable frown and drawing his shoulders back into what he knew was his most dignified and intimidating posture are beneath contempt mr brobostigon is a man of unblemished reputation and with the highest regard for correct procedure droot scraliontis has been my accountant for the last thirty years and his behaviour has been unimpeachable throughout that time he could feel one of his eyebrows starting to come loose funny that he always imagined that as he got older and more confident he would stop sweating whenever he had to tell a barefaced lie but he still did but isnt it true that the standard of workmanship on the starship has dropped since the building was moved from yassacca to blerontin absolute poop declared the great genius in his best howdareyouwastethetimeofagreatgeniuslikeme voice i am personally checking the standards of craftsmanship on every facet of the ship and i can guarantee that standards have if anything gone up since the transferral to blerontin he felt his other eyebrow pop loose from his forehead what do you say about the collapse of the yassaccan economy mr leovinus it was the same dreadful journalist going on why couldnt someone ask him whether he preferred architecture to quantum physics or whether he felt painting should be considered a higher artform than canapeґ arrangement those were the kind of questions he was a whizz at dealing with these days do you feel personally responsible at all for the present sufferings of the yassaccan people leovinus went for the lastgoalkeeperatthenet defence i am an artist mr journalist he said with that voice of his that made grown men cringe behind their stomachs and young cub reporters with delightful cleavages feel deliciously damp all over of course i deeply regret the terrible destruction of an entire culture that their economic mismanagement has brought upon themselves and i hereby offer my heartfelt condolences to the people of yassacca i am deeply concerned that it should have been the construction of my vision that should have been the catalyst of their monetary downfall but i am an artist my responsibility is to my art and i would be betraying the sacred trust of my genius were i to compromise my vision for the sake of fiscal expediency blerontin football is played with anything up to six balls and consequently a large number of goalkeepers is sometimes allowed oh oooooh ahh breathed one of the cub reporters and shifted onto her other buttock leovinus nevertheless got the feeling that the entire press conference had spiralled out of control and was now plunging towards some catastrophic conclusion that he must at all costs avoid even if it meant forgoing a delightful drink with the delightful cub reporters who were even now gazing at him with increasingly delightftil eyes and increasingly delightful cleavages in any case he knew how any such assignation would end he would soon find their smiles begin to grate their soft gazes would become tiresome probing arclights of banality and he would flee from the two young reporters in despair and disappointment that was what always happened for deep down inside him leovinus knew that no one was good enough for him why go through it all again leovinus rose unsteadily to his feet thank you he said and was gone the greatest genius of his age gone without even so much as a nod in the cub reporters direction it was hardly to be believed despite his age brilliance and genius leovinus was not always a sensible individual he had passions passions that would rise up the inside of his being and take over his magnificent brain like cholera taking over a city and not all these passions revolved around cub reporters at present his one overriding passion was the starship that magnificent creation that crowning glory of his lifes work ever since his recent accident leovinus had been reluctant to go abroad partly because his joints had stiffened up somewhat and partly because he didnt want to be seen without his eyebrows leovinus was not without personal vanity he had therefore got into the habit of supervising the construction of his starship by virtual reality and telepresence both brought to such a pitch of perfection by blerontinian scientists that it was sometimes hard to remember which was the real thing particularly if you were getting on a bit and your mind was on cleavages for that is what leovinuss mind had been preoccupied with for many months now but not the cleavages of the young cub reporters no leovinuss obsession was the cleavage of datastreams as they separated out into random thought fields the cleavage of neuroconnectors as they bifurcated into the memory bank and the sensation retrieval system the cleavage of separators and transjoiners linking and distinguishing those two vital processes thought and feeling his obsession was the heart of his starship he called her titania titania was the heart the mind the spirit the soul of the ship a massive cyberintelligence system was required to run the ship of course but as we now know intelligence devoid of emotion is nonfunctional however smart a robot or computer may be it can only do exactly what you tell it to do and then stop to keep thinking it has to want to it has to be motivated you cant think if you cant feel so the ships intelligence had to be imbued with emotions with personality and its name was titania the starship was leovinuss creation so was titania it had suited leovinus while he concentrated on this vital heart of the ship to work from home but now he suddenly realized that he hadnt actually been on the ship itself for well he really didnt know how long thus it was that night after the press conference the great man put on a long snorkhair coat and made his way towards the assembly dock where his masterpiece stood awaiting tomorrows launch earlier he had received telecalls from the project manager antar brobostigon and the chief accountant droot scraliontis they had both been so full of gratitude for his defence of them during the press conference and so reassuring about the prospects of the launch that leovinus found a vein in his right thigh beginning to twitch and he kept thinking of the phrase parrotdroppings without any viable context he slipped unseen down the service entrance and waited in the shadows until he saw the security robot stop to take its scheduled restbreak he then hurried across the open forecourt and disappeared into the shadow of the temporary construction workers sheds it was not as if he didnt have a perfect right to be there it was just he wanted to do this without the usual fanfare and the welcoming party and the official guided tour and all the usual commotion that accompanied his public visits he wanted to commune with his creation alone he looked up there was the assembly dock looming up into the night sky far far above him it stretched a good mile up and the starship his starship his baby rose up another half mile above that ready for blastoff at midday tomorrow precisely the silk coverings flapped in the breeze that swept across the observation arena over the administration buildings and around the dock structures leovinus felt a surge of emotion sweep through his body and engulf his magnificent brain his heart missed several beats his knees turned to jelly but it was not his pride in that stupendous structure that gave him butterflies in the tummy nor was it the exaltation that after all these years it was finally complete that made him feel like a schoolboy on his first date no what made his hand shake as he sleeked it through his greying locks was the thought that in there in those vast halls and state rooms titania was waiting for him as leovinus leaned towards the starship the wind picked up blasting dead leaves old snackwrappings torn religious journals pages of sentimental verse knitting patterns and all the other usual detritus left behind by construction workers across the servicing area the sheeting that covered the starship flapped frantically like the great ghoul in the ancient filmed entertainment the great ghoul frightens a lot of folk leovinus shuddered with a childhood memory of fear then he shuddered again as he suddenly saw a figure slip from the base of the launching gantry into the shadows opposite the main steps of the starship the moment he saw that figure he knew deep in his bones with that certainty that comes of being absolutely without any doubt whatsoever that everything was about to go terribly fearfully wrong cautiously he edged round into the shadows where he had seen the figure disappear so a voice spoke to him out of the darkness it was a voice that made his stomach relocate itself around his knees a voice that made him want to be sick to be anywhere but where he was leovinus looked around for a means of escape but it was too late last minute checkups eh the figure stepped out of the shadow and confronted him it was that dreadful journalist from the press conference havent you tormented me enough havent you already ruined a day that was meant to be one of the greatest days of my life thats what leovinus wanted to say but he merely mumbled oh its you are you afraid somethings going to go wrong with the launch of course not leovinus adopted just the right cold tone that gave nothing away ive merely come to pay my regards he liked to be thought of as a bit of a sentimentalist as well as a great brain but come on you must be a bit worried everyone knows that the workmanship here on blerontin has not been a patch on the yassaccans in fact you know and i know blerontin craftsmanship is nowhere near good enough to finish a ship of this sophistication just because the blerontin government chooses to employ the amalgamated unmarried teenage mothers construction units there is no reason to think that the work is in any way slipshod retorted old leovinus i have every confidence in their work i dont believe you replied the journalist very well ill show you the great man saw his private tкteatкte with titania being blown away on the wind that now buffeted them as a small unlit work platform carried them up one of the service gantries that surrounded the great starship it was only when you started getting this high up thought the journalist that you really began to appreciate the full scale of the enterprise the launch area below receded into darkness and silence as they rattled their way up the side of the vast starship higher and higher until the great keel broadened out and they reached the main body of the ship a short walk across another gantry and they were at the main doors of the spacecraft an entrycoder received leovinuss fingerprint and crosschecked it with a blood sample recent hairloss estimate and favourite recreational activity the doors slid open and the two entered the journalist had of course often been in starships but he had never been in a starship like this it was magnificent astonishing it was built with luxury startravel in mind it was built to last it was built to impress whats more it was still being built two workmen were slipping into the service elevator as leovinus and the journalist entered the embarkation lobby just some lastminute adjustments one of them mumbled to leovinus and they were gone hm said leovinus in a way that the journalist freely translated as i wonder what those two could have been up to they surely cant still be making adjustments this near to launch and why didnt i know about them id better check everything it was you understand a very free translation donkeydatabases exclaimed the greatest living genius in the galaxy look at that the journalist looked he saw a smartly dressed robot wearing headphones and standing on the polished marble floor of one of the most elegant rooms he had ever stood in the design was typical late leovinus and yet it was imbued with a spirit that was new it had a lightness that some critics had thought lacking in much of his earlier work and the colours were vibrant and yet warm and welcoming perhaps leovinus had at last got in touch with the feminine side of his nature or perhaps the gentler more approachable feel of the starships interior owed something to the many little finishing touches introduced by titania the journalist was at a loss to see why the great man was so angry but leovinus was already striding across to the far wall there he yanked at a decorative panel upside down he yelled i sometimes think i have to build the entire ship with my own hands and he produced a screwdriver and proceeded to replace the panel in the correct position cant they see the entire ambient structure of the room is destroyed by exactly that sort of inattention to detail the journalist made a note in his thumbrecorder welcome to the starship titanic the smart robot was now addressing a lightfitting that protruded from the wall allow me to show you the facilities available to second class travellers the thing then turned smartly on its heels and walked straight into the nearest closed door there was a clang and the robot fell backwards onto the highly decorative marble floor here you may see the grand axial canal second class it announced proudly and extended a whitegloved hand at the ceiling the journalist made another note in his thumbrecorder leovinuss reaction to the robots minor mishap was also noted down in the journalists thumbrecorder it started off as blank disbelief and ended up as cold fury in between it went through a fascinating range of adjustments all of which were noted down by the journalist surprised dissatisfaction was rapidly replaced by stupefied indignation which in turn quickly became bitter resentment which equally quickly was transformed into burning thirst for vengeance and so to cold fury brobostigon murmured the great man that bastard has been skimping on the synthoneurones the journalist made another note but leovinus turned on him so suddenly that he stuck his thumb in his mouth and pretended to be sucking at it this cant happen on this ship explained leovinus as he picked up the fallen robot every doorbot has a failsafe neuron embedded in its circuitry that cancels out any nonrational activity such as we just witnessed they are expensive items but i think you will agree well worth the money the journalist nodded and pretended that he had a splinter in the end of his thumb except that that bastard brobostigon has obviously left them out when i see him ill but leovinus stopped in mid sentence hes probably wondering what else is wrong with the ship thought the journalist with mounting excitement he could feel a story materializing in front of him a big story a humungous story and the great thing was he wouldnt have to do anything it was all going to unfold in front of him he knew it and sure enough before the journalist could pretend to find the nonexistent splinter leovinus had given the doorbot a quick adjustment the door had opened and the great man had been bowed through into the corridor beyond enjoy your honeymoon you lucky couple called the doorbot cheerfully the journalist noted this down and hurried after the great architect and shipbuilder who had just turned right into one of the most astounding architectural spaces the journalist had ever entered it was an oval space marked out by columns around the perimeter wall was painted a frieze depicting the favourite recreational pastime of the founding fathers of blerontin posing for friezepainters leovinus was standing staring up at a huge statue of a winged female that stood at the other end but the journalists eye went down down and down into what seemed like an infinity of descent for there at his feet was the great central well that occupied the gigantic keel of the starship it was the spine of the ship and around it like nerve impulses illuminated elevators constantly went up and down servicing the living quarters that were stacked below them tier after tier at the very bottom far far down below near the bilges of the ship the super galactic traveller de luxe suites above them the second class executive duplexes and above them far above them the fabulously appointed first class state rooms but the journalist scarcely had time to take all this in for leovinus was off striding through the manycolumned hall towards the far vestibule through which he disappeared by the time the journalist had caught up with him leovinus was standing on the jetty of an even more extraordinary and beautiful feature of the starship titanic the grand axial canal second class from the central well of the starship ran two great canals one to the fore and one to the aft these partly had the effect of cooling the engines but were also elegant recreational facilities up and down the canal gondolas plied their way the automated gondoliers each singing their own personal selection of blerontinian folksongs but particularly the one about the beautiful young female acrobat who fell in love with a gondolier and gave him six pnedes as a tip leovinus was doing his fromblankdisbelieftocoldfury routine again the journalist took note they are not supposed to sing unless theyve got passengers leovinus seemed to be choking as he clambered down into the nearest waiting gondola the singing immediately stopped the journalist joined him and said perhaps theyre doing a test reversing everything it was the only thing he could think of that was in any way cheery dont talk pigeon poop snapped leovinus he was clearly in no mood to be cheered promenade deck elevator si houseproud and religious mother of twins said the automated gondolier leovinus flinched and felt the vein twitching in his thigh leovinus allowed the irritation to mount within himself as he straightened one of the priceless noart masterpieces that decorated the elevator lobby good day to you sir madam or thing and how may we assist you in your vertical transportation requirements today the liftbot was halfembedded in the wall of the lift its free hand rested on the lever that came out of its chest just to the promenade deck and no backchat snapped leovinus he sometimes regretted the characters that these robots seemed to acquire but there it was if the ships intelligence were to be allowed emotions and certainly no one could doubt that titania had strong emotions then you had to allow her to choose robotcharacters she got on with it was no good forcing the issue although leovinus had on occasion spoken to titania quite forcibly about some of the characters with whom she surrounded herself but then titania was so tolerant so understanding of peoples failings and mistakes that she could get on with practically anybody he had made her like that the giant promenade deck was leovinuss particular little favourite under its vast transparent canopy passengers could stroll and marvel at the minderupting brilliance of the galaxy through which they were passing the varispex composition glass of which the canopy was made had the effect of intensifying the radiant brightness of the stars while at the same time making it possible for the observer by a mere twist of the head to see in the detail of a powerful telescope any particular star that caught his her or its fancy around the perimeter the pellerator enabled the less active travellers to tour the deck without stirring an unnecessary muscle that was the theory that was what leovinus had viewed with great complacence on his telepresence and in his virtual reality viewer at home but that was not what he now saw in front of him real reality was different what he now saw was what is referred to architecturally as a shambles the vast glass canopy stretched above as it should displaying the immense stretches of pink silk sheeting which covered the ship but below all was confusion the beautiful polished parquet floor was approximately one tenth beautiful polished parquet floor the rest was exposed girders and cablework gaping holes protruding wires and polystyrene cups where the large sprawling brasserie for second class passengers should have sprawled there was only a large sprawling empty space littered with builders rubble and more polystyrene cups how could this be they didnt even use polystyrene cups on blerontin and yet there they were there was no disguising the ghastly unthinkable fact that the promenade deck was not finished nor likely to be before the launch tomorrow morning the journalist turned to see that leovinus had fallen to his knees he suddenly looked like the old man that he was the swagger and gallantry that usually marked his public appearances seemed to have been sucked out of him leaving him like a crumpled empty bag it cant be true he was mumbling into his beard even brobostigon even scraliontis couldnt lie so i mean only this morning they told me it was all good morning sir would you like to cut your nasal hair a doorbot had suddenly activated itself and was apparently trying to usher them into a cement mixer leovinus cracked at last bastards he screamed at the flapping silk sheets beyond the canopy bastards he yelled at the unfinished works suddenly a movement behind one of the pillars caught his eye taking the journalist totally by surprise leovinus seemed to regain all his vitality in an instant and had sprinted across the parquet flooring and pounced behind the pillar a solitary worker in drab overalls was crouching down trying to lose himself in a crevice of the unfinished floor what the devil are you doing here screamed leovinus the worker stood up shiftily and pretended to be adjusting a loose end of wire just making good he said making good yelled leovinus you call this good he threw his arm around the vast unfinished reaches of the promenade deck we launch the ship tomorrow and theres months more work to do here yeah its bin a bit slow the worker was edging towards the sleek stainlesssteel lift that offered him his only means of escape from this elderly lunatic what were you doing just now demanded the elderly lunatic me just now replied the worker yes i saw you doing something me no i wouldnt do nothing i only came to collect my parrot the words fell out of his mouth and seemed to freeze in the air and then like lumps of solid ice they hit leovinus one after the other and he reeled from their impact parrot he said parrot what parrot its er just a parrot you know couple of wings that sort you know what is a parrot doing on board my beautiful ship demanded the outraged genius oh theres the lift said the worker and the next moment he was in it with the journalist hard on his heels the door closed and they were both dropping to the lower floors a parrot on my starship what the hell has been going on suddenly the great the magnificent the envied leovinus was hunched up in a corner weeping over a statue of a winged female titania he was sobbing titania what has happened what shall we do titania the genius of leovinus was nowhere so evident as in this his last and bestloved creation titania was the brains of the ship and her statue appeared everywhere on board serving as the eyes and ears and communicating essence of the ships intelligence but the ships intelligence was also imbued with emotional life as well and this is where leovinus had excelled himself titania was not only the brains but also the heart of the ship titanias emotional intelligence had to be carefully crafted to match her task to run a gigantic ship of such bewildering complexity to manage its crew and to look after an enormous complement of passengers of different races species mentalities and bodily functions and make them all feel happy safe and cared for required that titania be hugely intelligent kind wise caring serene warm and she was all these things like her image all those giant brooding angels in every room on every deck titanias spirit should also have been imbuing the entire ship quite clearly it wasnt antar brobostigon please leovinus spat the name into the phone im afraid mr brobostigon is not here would you like to speak to mrs brobostigon leovinus had always felt secretly sorry for the project managers wife he could not imagine what it must be like living with such a duplicitous coldbloodied egomaniac as antar brobostigon his pity was only slightly modified by the knowledge that crossa brobostigon herself was if anything marginally more duplicitous coldblooded and egoistical perhaps the two cancelled each other out and the brobostigons lived a warm intimate and caring family life it was a mystery to the great inventor so nice to hear from you leo said crossa brobostigon leovinus hated it when people called him that and he knew she knew he knew she knew it how is the family i dont have any family crossa said leovinus with what he hoped she could hear was strained patience where is antar i think in fact im sure hes at the ship he went there with droot a couple of hours ago some panic about something or other you know how those guys worry themselves sick over your ship he knew about the same way an anaconda does over a goat its just eaten is there somewhere they can reach you when they get back leovinus flicked the phone off a deep sense of foreboding spread from his thighs up to his abdomen and across his chest into his heart brobostigon and scraliontis on the ship what the devil are they up to the deep sense of foreboding suddenly changed into sharp stabbing pain in his stomach he felt cold he felt sick he had to talk to the only person that could help titania he made his way down onto the canal level along the grand axial canal second class towards the central dome when he reached the vast statue of titania that dominated the central dome and the head of the central well he disappeared into a doorway under one of her wings a long staircase led up to the vital heart of the ship the secret chamber of titania herself leovinus had long enjoyed his reputation as the originator of ironic architecture there was the famous house he designed for gardis arbledonter the professor of mathematical implausibilities at blerontis university in which the doors were actually radio sets and entrance and egress was gained via the bath but here on the starship he believed he had constructed one of his most satisfying constructional ironies titanias secret chamber her central intelligence core was located in the very middle of the great central dome it formed the giant chandelier that hung above the central well the secret heart of the ship was hidden in full view of every passenger and every member of the crew the chamber itself hung upsidedown but it had been surrounded by an inverted gravity field so that when you entered it it appeared the right way up the serrated ribs that transversed the great dome were once you had entered the inversion field and submitted to the disorienting process of gravity reversal in fact long upsidedown staircases leading up to the chamber and the great dome itself was a vast concave floor at the bottom of the immense central well that stretched up above topsyturvy in an arrangement that bewildered and astonished the firsttime visitor leovinus sprinted up the staircase two steps at a time his mind focused on one thought titania the love of his old age the obsession of his ageing heart intelligent kind wise caring serene warm titania he burst into the secret chamber and gasped his head went into a spin and when you have a mind the size of leovinuss a spinning head is a formidable sensation he vomited he could scarcely bring himself to look at the horror before him and yet he could not take his eyes off it titania his titania his darling creation his joy had been dismembered she lay there in the centre of the chamber her hair and wings spread out in their perfect circle around her but her beautiful gracious head was grotesquely disfigured her mouth had been ripped away her eyes gouged out and her nose torn off leaving a gaping cavity of raw microcircuitry but before he could even so much as mutter the word fiends leovinus became aware of someone else in the room a figure was crouching behind the vacubus console brobostigon leovinus ground the word out like a piece of gristle what in the name of darkness are you playing at without thinking leovinus found himself lunging at the project manager a small glowing silver shard fell from brobostigons grasp and tinkled to the floor leovinus glanced down and realised that one of titanias incredibly delicate cerebral arteries the central intelligence core of titanias brain was lying against his foot youre destroying her brobostigon pushed leovinus off him and the old man staggered back and fell onto the floor across the outspread wings of his beloved creature youre blind leovinus you sit up there in your ivory tower thinking youre too highminded and pure to deal with grubby things like business and finance well this whole things gone way out of control thanks to you what dyou mean what are you talking about leovinus was almost crying this whole project is a financial catastrophe didnt you realise that were on the brink of a major fiscal meltdown brobostigon was trying to get to the door but leovinus with surprising agility was back on his feet and cutting off the exit so what are you trying to do but even as he asked the question leovinus suddenly saw with total clarity the whole plot the insurance he gasped you were going to scuttle my priceless ship and claim the insurance grow up growled brobostigon this is the real world but he never got any further the aged genius had hurled himself upon him hitting the manager squarely on the chin with a remarkably mundane uppercut brobostigon lurched backwards caught his foot on one of titanias wings and fell into the vacubus tray the moment he did the vacubus robot was activated it leant forward extending its brass snout always a pleasure to dispose of your rubbish it announced and sucked brobostigon up there was an unpleasant crunching sound and a slight plop and the project manager was gone the vacubus system was a rather controversial part of the ships design in an age when telepresence was all the rage the idea of transmitting objects around the ship quite physically and literally by means of vacuum tubes seemed oldfashioned and retrogressive but leovinus had insisted it was yet another little irony that he cherished he finally carried the day by using the safety argument physical transport was always less risky than teleportation or any pseudotravel arrangement whats more his vacubus robots would be able to categorize and sort everything put into their tray so if you failed to tell them where you wanted your object sending they would do it automatically the system however was not designed for human beings and the vacubus was supposed to be programmed to reject any living human who might fall into the tray clearly this was yet another area where compromises had been made leovinus knew with a queasy tingle that brobostigon had become the victim of his own plot and would now be a condensed cube of detritus on its way to the ships bilge and now the full impact of the situation began to come home to the great man here he was the greatest genius the galaxy had ever known the day before the launch of his ultimate masterpiece with an unfinished ship a financial crisis and a dead project manager caught in the act of sabotage this was not going to look good in the official biography meanwhile where was scraliontis crossa brobostigon had said her husband had come to the ship to meet the accountant leovinus knelt beside the disfigured titania and lovingly slipped the silver shard into the nerve centre at the base of her skull his hand shook as he realized the other artery was still missing in fact now he came to look most of her brain was missing how had he not noticed that before titanias brain so delicate it was the slightest shock or scratch could permanently injure it with a ship of this sophistication you couldnt afford to have the nerve centre nonfunctional there had been recent stories about a new phenomenon a kind of hightech metal fatigue that could afflict certain artifacts which had too high a density of logic systems built into them smef spontaneous massive existence failure leovinus knew it was theoretically possible if unlikely he also knew that practically every molecule on the starship titanic was in some way part of the ships logic system if the thing were launched in its present state who knew what catastrophe might follow there was no time to lose he must retrieve all titanias missing parts and reassemble them before the unthinkable could happen some moments later leovinus was to be found in the starboard embarkation lobby yelling at the deskbot of course you know scraliontis the deskbot whilst remaining perfectly polite was showing no inclination to be helpful scrawny little man glasses hes the accountant of this whole project for crying out loud insisted leovimis youve seen him snooping about in here thousands of times much to my regret sir i have been scanning my acquaintance database and am unable to come up with anyone matching the criteria you indicate however i am in a position to offer you a berth on the starboard super galactic traveller edeck the rooms are painted pink and the noise from the disposal unit is hardly noticeable i want to know where scraliontis is yelled leovinus at the same time flashing a small gold card in front of the deskbot written on the card was the legend sixty million miles club certainly sir the deskbot sat up brightly i would suggest you look for mr scraliontis in the first class restaurant the first class restaurant was a blacktie only affair so the maоtre dbot was understandably shocked when a disreputable elderly man suddenly bunt in and shouted scraliontis i know youre in here what an honour to have you here sir exclaimed the maоtre d genially however i am sure sir would be more comfortable in the second class brasserie shut up said leovinus of course sir it will be a great pleasure to not only shut up but belt up cease to babble and generally get lost for you sir but may i point out that we would be only too happy to oblige sir with some appropriate attire if sir would be so good as to follow me leovinus had spotted scraliontis who was standing at the controls of the telepresence robot trying to fit something into the vacubus he glanced up when he heard leovinuss voice smiled thinly and hid whatever it was inside his dinner jacket but as sir would surely not want to feel at a disadvantage visвvis the other diners may i recommend a change of vestment before partaking of cocktails the maitre dbot blocked leovinuss path as he headed toward scraliontis for a moment the great man lost sight of the accountant as the robot bobbed and weaved bowing and nodding in front of him just get out of the way growled leovinus it would be my pleasure sir but may i remind you that whilst smoking is permitted in the first class restaurant it is a jacket and tie affair and i am afraid i shall have to call for assistance if sir proceeds any further youre too late leovinus yelled scraliontis this thing is going nowhere and its going there tomorrow at noon fast the accountant always did enjoy talking in elliptical sentences that didnt quite make sense it gave him the feeling that he was in some way literary despite his occupation stop whatever it is youre doing shouted leovinus we appreciate your visit sir and hope to see you many times in the future but if you could just lower your voice a touch i will show you the exit as soon as i said shut up leovinus suddenly turned on the robot as it made yet another bow in front of him picked it up and hurled it bodily at scraliontis may i recommend sir to the fire exit i think sir will find the plainness of the corridors more suited to his current garb remarked the maitre dbot as it hit the accountant full in the face sending him sprawling the object scraliontis had been hiding fell onto the floor with a tinkle it was the other cerebral artery of titanias brain at the same moment the robot bunt apart on the elegant floor of the restaurant scraliontis scrambled to his feet grabbed one of the robots legs and charged at leovinus the old man sidestepped picked up the robots right arm and faced the accountant for a few moments the two circled each other then scraliontis opened with a straight thrust into an open line the robots leg grazed against leovinuss shoulder scoring a high outside leovinus replied with a simple parry from the fourth position executing a deft circle with the robots arm that gained him the right to riposte but scraliontis was clearly fencing under a different rule book for he went straight to a redoublement regardless of leovinuss right to riposte the great genius was outraged he flung the robots arm at scraliontis in an attack that certainly did not figure in any rule book and closed in for a corps a corps throwing any pretence to duelling etiquette to the wind leovinus now had his hands around scraliontiss neck brobostigon screamed scraliontis help rrobostigons garbage the normally kind and mellow face of leovinus had taken on a evil green hue this was mainly due to the fact that the lamp of the table on which they were now wrestling was directly under leovinuss chin he may be garbage gasped scraliontis but hes got a gun hes dead yelled leovinus his fingers beginning to tighten on the accountants neck if hed known brobostigon had had a gun he would have been a bit more careful how hed treated him arrrrgh youre choking me screamed scraliontis i know thats what im trying to do leovinus tried to put some conviction into his voice but he was finding it extremely difficult to make his fingers actually constrict the accountants scrawny neck i suppose you could say that leovinus just did not have the killer instinct scraliontis on the other hand did as he realized leovinus was never going to carry through what he was attempting scraliontis had tightened his hand around the table lamp a conventionalized statuette of titania with her wings providing the illumination as he felt the great geniuss hands falter around his neck scraliontis brought his knee up into leovinuss groin at the same time he raised the table lamp and brought it crashing down onto that magnificent cranium that housed leovinuss magnificent brain leovinuss hands fell from the accountants neck he slumped to his knees crack scraliontis brought the table lamp crashing down onto leovinuss skull again and again the extraordinary and superb mind registered all was not right it blocked out the pain then realized something truly disastrous had taken place and wisely decided to abandon all contact with the outside world for the foreseeable future leovinus rolled over onto the restaurant floor unconscious with blood pouring from his head scraliontis stared down at him god hed killed the great man in a panic scraliontis glanced around the first class restaurant disposing of dead bodies although not something hed done before was the sort of thing his accountants mind was really good at and a few moments later he was hurrying out of the first class restaurant with a spring in his step in his panic however he had forgotten the little glowing silver shard that now lay on the floor mingled amongst the remains of the maоtre dbot leovinus was wrapped securely in one of the great curtains that helped give the first class restaurant its ambiance of unadulterated luxury and elegance while leovinus had been thus engaged with business matters the journalist had been trying to pump information out of the workman who claimed to have come on board to reclaim his parrot come on said the journalist nobodys buying that what are you up to i have a pet parrot said the workman doggedly sticking to his absurd story i always take it with me when im working i know mr leovinus wouldnt allow a bird on board so ive been keeping it hidden but when i came back to get it just now i found that some bastard had opened the door of the cage and its escaped the journalist heaved his eyes heavenwards he was used to hearing cockandbull stories but this parrotandbastard one didnt even get off the slippery startingblocks of meretriciousness look he said im a journalist i know when theres something fishy going on and i know that youre hiding something ill cut a deal with you the workman turned on him im really very upset i loved that parrot you tell me everything you know about the starship and ill not tell starstruct inc about the parrot they had just reached the central dome area and the worker was hurrying through the gallery surrounding the central well towards the port embarkation lobby whys the work got so behind theyve been cutting corners havent they leovinus seemed to be in the dark about it and all these stories about the financial problems theyre true arent they whats going to happen tomorrow this ship isnt in a fit state to take off is it thats right said the worker as he strode across the embarkation lobby everything you say is true if you are enjoying your stay on board why not celebrate with an evening in the champion canapй lounge featuring canapeґs from the all blerontin finals for six centuries called the deskbot so said the joumalist so said the worker turning on the journalist and looking him in the eye for the first time if you see my parrot give it this he pressed a small metal band into the journalists hand and disappeared through the main doors the journalist looked at the piece of metal in his hand it bore an address and a phone number which the journalist recognized as that of the yassaccan embassy in blerontis the journalist spent the next half hour or so exploring the ship on his own he discovered more unfinished areas the starboard embarkation lobby for example was totally unfinished large sections of the second class living quarters were wanting decorating some were even without beds he noted everything down and returned to the central dome when suddenly a figure came hurtling round the columns of the gallery and collided with him droot scraliontis he exclaimed i know who i am snapped the accountant just the man i was looking for smiled the journalist argh scraliontis jumped and his eyes shot guiltily over the journalists shoulder as if expecting to see the homicide police with their vicious trained rabbits pouring onto the starship to arrest the murderer of the greatest genius the galaxy had ever known hes not dead i swear it whos not dead the journalist couldnt believe how many juicy stories seemed to be offering themselves up to him tonight if only he could pin one of them down who isnt dead scraliontis now realized he had made a mistake get out of my way he yelled not so fast exclaimed the journalist but scraliontis had reached a point beyond the bounds of politeness he shoved the journalist back against a pillar and started to run the journalist picked himself up charged after the accountant and brought him down in what would have been referred to as a rugby tackle if they had played rugby football on blerontin scraliontis fought with the energy of a trapped animal he scratched at the journalists face and punched and kicked the two managed to stagger to their feet still fighting like two snorks in a bucket of snorkswill the journalist being young and fitter soon had the accountant backed up against the barrier rail of the great central well as he tried to restrict scraliontiss movements he could see past him down the dizzying depths of the well down and down seemingly forever a breathtaking intimidating and yet somehow inspiring sight tell me whats going on the journalist was pinning scraliontiss arms to his side whats the scam scam sneered scraliontis youll never find out oh yes i will said the journalist very well ill tell you everything replied scraliontis the journalist was totally wrongfooted he almost said oh no you wont but he fortunately managed to stop himself thats very decent of you he managed to say but he was not fool enough to let go of scraliontiss arms were going to blow it up how about that for a story the journalist was now fool enough to let go of scraliontiss arms you mean theres a bomb on board the starship but youll never find it grinned scraliontis because you wont be alive and suddenly scraliontis had something in his hand the journalist didnt see what it was but he felt a stab in the ribs he staggered back and looked up scraliontis was standing with one of the first class dining room table lamps in his hand the sharp illuminated tip was dripping with blood at that very moment however there was a terrible screech and a flash of colours as a large parrot suddenly hurtled out from the arches straight at scraliontis the accountant tried to beat it off but the creatures wings kept beating at his face and its beak was tearing at his nose and the accountant scrambled back against the barrierrail flailing with his arms and screaming get it off get it off and then it happened it was one of those ironic moments that fitted perfectly into leovinuss current architectural style and it gave the journalist his first piece of hard evidence that corners had indeed been cut during the construction of the starship titanic scraliontis had of course been the main instigator of the plan to reduce the construction costs of the starship it had become clear that the whole project could never break even let alone go into profit it was in fact heading for total enormous financial disaster his and brobostigons reputations and personal fortunes were both on the line there was only one clean simple rational solution and that was to scuttle the ship and claim the insurance the ship was of course already heavily insured and scraliontis made sure that those policies were beefedup and that all moneys repayable were routed through companies owned by himself and brobostigon construction costs had to be cut to the bone and building restricted to the merely cosmetic he had unbeknownst to leovinus instructed contractors to halve and then quarter the specifications of any number of elements on board one of the materials that had been severely cut back was the metal employed in the barrierrail surrounding the great central well after all scraliontis had remarked there arent going to be any passengers to lean on it so why make it unnecessarily strong the reason he now realized was that it might not be a passenger who leant on it it might actually be the project accountant who in a moment of forgetfulness whilst under assault from a parrot leant back against it but the realization came too late scraliontis heard the feeble metal crack and next moment found himself falling backwards into the abyss by the time the horrified journalist had made it to the broken rail and looked down scraliontis was a tiny figure still no more than a third of the way down the great central well turning gently in circles waving his arms and shouting up ever more faintly bloody parrots the parrot in question alighted on the journalists shoulder bloody accountants it said the vicious rabbits had been brought back under control the overexcited dot police had been calmed down by their chief and the yassaccan protesters lay groaning in mangled bloody heaps on the ground it had been a totally successful exercise in crowd management flortin rimanquez saluted smartly as he reported back to the gat of blerontis everything under control your magnificent beneficence he said you may proceed with the launch but leovinus is still missing replied the gat who was extremely concerned that he might miss out on the great photoopportunity of being seen arm in arm with the greatest genius the galaxy had ever produced it was exactly the sort of thing his sagging pollratings needed said his publicity agent whatever you do get your photo next to leovinus it was indeed the single most important thing on the gats mind throughout the whole proceedings with regret your ultimate lordship said the chief of police with another sharp salute the crowd down there is fifty million they are getting extremely restive i humbly suggest that we get this launch over and done with so my boys can start dispersing them at once otherwise we might all be sorry the gat could see what he meant the crowd had already closed in over the bodies of the unfortunate yassaccan demonstrators and he could see fights breaking out all over the launch area very well he sighed no thank you he added as the minor official offered him a fishpaste sandwich im afraid you have to your magnificence its all part of the ceremony whispered the minor official hurriedly the gat groaned and took the fishpaste sandwich the band struck up the blerontin national anthem and the crowd all stood on their heads as they always did as a mark of respect to the monarchy sirs madams and things intoned the gat of blerontis into the ceremonial microphone this fishpaste sandwich is delicious a cheer went up from the crowd the gat sighed again it was such a pathetic ceremony he thought and now it is my privilege to launch this the greatest starship ever built fellow blerontinians this is a proud moment for all of us i name this starship titanic may luck be with all who fly with her and so saying the gat let swing the beribboned bottle of french champagne so that it smashed into the bows of the ship at the same moment the minor official pulled a cord and the sheeting that hitherto had covered the great starship fell to the ground in a gentle cascade of pink silk it may seem odd that a civilization that had never even heard of the planet earth and certainly had no idea of its existence should use french champagne for such an occasion the explanation is rather complicated and involves a lot of stuff about timewarps and black holes and an intergalactic smuggling ring if were you i simply wouldnt worry about it and just get on with the story there was a gasp from the multitude even a people used to the sight of great starships had never before witnessed one of such vast structure such flawless design isnt she beautiful sighed countless male starship spotters scanning their binoscopes over the hull for the registration number your mummy built that murmured countless unmarried teenage mothers to their infants its a triumph exclaimed the head reporter suddenly remembering what his script had written down for this point there was a ghostly roar as if of seas beating on a distant shore that lies beyond the horizon of thought as hugely magnificently the fabulous ship eased its way forward from its construction dock it then picked up speed swayed a bit wobbled a bit veered wildly and just as the crowd were about to scream out in disbelieving terror it vanished just like that it had undergone what was about to become famous as smef in just ten seconds the whole stupendous enterprise was over were going to put the bathroom here and the door over there said dan its terrific said nettie but i thought the bathroom was going to be there and the door was going to be over here said lucy why did he always get it so wrong dan always made the effort and yet no matter how hard he tried the things he and lucy had discussed only the day before entirely eluded him or came out all garbled thats what i meant said dan its terrific said nettle but i have to tell you something she was interrupted by nigel who was sniffing around the cellar you can smell the centuries of vinous pleasure oozing from the very brickwork he shouted up the place is only a hundred and eighty years old lucy shouted back down it was built as a rectory dan murmured to nettie mmm terrific said nettle but look dan youre not kidding dan felt the enthusiasm welling up from deep inside him the way it always did when he needed it to were going to have the restaurant here on the right as you come in not your nouvelle cuisine but stateoftheart californian and here therell be a bar lucy gave him a withering look but mercifully she didnt correct him oh yes now he remembered the restaurant was going to be on the left it had started off on the right then theyd changed it to the left then theyd changed it back to the right again but then lucy had pointed out that the kitchen would be better on the other side so theyd gone back to the left how the hell was he supposed to remember anyway terrific said nettie but look her voice trailed off as nigel reappeared nettle looked adorable in her simple gap tshirt that didnt quite cover her midriff and handknitted waistcoat nigel put his arm round her like what you see he asked mmmm said dan i mean the house said nigel dan couldnt stand that effortless slimy superiority that his business partner could turn on and off like a hosepipe of cold water no wait a minute make that a business partner the top ten travel company was no more they had just sold it for what seemed to dan a ridiculously satisfactory amount of money its just what lucy and i have always dreamed of isnt it buttercup dan said lucy hated it when he called her pet names in public but she had never told him so she blamed herself she could see he thought she liked it and the minor deception had been going on for so long now that she couldnt see how she could possibly tell him how long had they been together it must be all of thirteen years in fact since the very early days of the top ten travel co when nigel had chatted her up in a bar in santa monica and introduced her to his business partner lucy had originally been strongly attracted by the suave englishman but as theyd all got to know each other she found dan the quiet east coast university man more real and more understandable in fact the more they got to know each other the more she wondered why on earth nobody could see at first glance what a complete sleazeball nigel was were going to call it the watergate hotel said dan wont that put off republicans who still want to bug each other asked nettle nigel patted her tight bottom go and turn the car around theres a good girl he said and nettle trotted off on her high heels down the steps of the elegant early victorian rectory into the night how can she let him treat her like that thought lucy to herself but said when are you going to sign the final release forms for the company dan oh er im not sure dan seemed suddenly nervous i dont think nigels got them yet the forms should be waiting for us back at the hotel said nigel before lucy could explode exploding was a reaction to nigel which she found increasingly natural however in this case the fuse was lit but would keep burning until they got back to the hotel and found that the release forms hadnt arrived after all and that that damned delivery company had let nigel down yet again poor nigel he always had some excuse or other they turned the lights off in the empty house and made their way across the drive in the darkness above them the stars filled the cold night sky with astonishing clarity why hasnt nettle turned the car round a twitch of irritation gave nigels suavity a razoredge when they got to the car they found nettie squinting through the lens of a singlereflex minolta that she had placed on its roof what on earth dyou think youre doing bozo when nigel sounded playful he was always at his most dangerous sh said nettle im taking a photo of the house dont jog the car i dont know whether youve noticed einstein there was sheer joy in nigels voice he loved ridiculing his girlfriends but its night sright replied nettle not moving her blonde head so much as a millimetre im taking a photo called dan and lucys hotel beneath the stars itll look great in the album maybe youll frame it and hang it in the entrance hall you cant take photos at night unless youve got a flash dumbbell nigel opened the car door hey youve jogged it nettle screamed out get in brainbox ill drive said nigel i guess it was long enough said nettle to dan terrific said dan they were all just about to get in the car when a sudden wind swept across the rectory lawn and the trees blew almost as if a hurricane had hit them except that they blew in all directions jesus exclaimed dan gripping the side of the car what was that look breathed lucy she was pointing up in the sky a falling star make a wish shouted nettle holy moly growled nigel who was the sort of person who had always preferred captain marvel to superman will you look at that above them a most extraordinary thing was happening a ring of cloud had suddenly formed immediately overhead and then spread out like a nuclear explosion until the entire sky was covered by a broiling layer of evillooking cloud nigel went weak at the knees lucy shuddered dan felt his stomach jump and nettle simply gaped but there was more to come the four earthfolk heard a ghostly roar as if of seas beating on a distant shore that lies beyond the horizon of thought and then hugely magnificently and without warning a vast metallic prong descended from the cloud and sliced their elegant former victorian rectory in two nigel gaped lucy gaped dan gaped terrific murmured nettle there was no other noise save the wind rushing crazily around in the trees as if it were looking for a place to hide and the occasional thud of filling masonry as bits of the rectory that had not already been dislodged by the thing crashed to the ground the thing was shiny and vertical and it stretched up into the clouds as if it always had it was so huge so present that it seemed to have a perfect right to be there as they watched a small pinpoint of light descended down the side of the thing and disappeared into the ruined house then it went up again the swirling clouds meanwhile had begun to diminish and by the time the pinpoint of light started to descend for the second time the clouds had cleared to reveal the full awesome vastness of the thing the wide blade or prong that had buried itself in the house stretched up and up almost a mile into the sky and there it seemed to widen out into an immense metallic body rather like a gigantic submarine its a spaceship murmured nettle and she began to walk towards it as if mesmerized her camera dangling forgotten from her wrist suddenly the pinpoint of light shot up again dont nettle come back dan yelled but lucy was already racing after nettle so dan raced after lucy nigel in the meantime tried his best to help by hiding under the steering wheel dont go near it said dan nettle lucy was pulling her arm trying to head her back to the car we we dont know what it is its wonderful murmured nettle something in nettles tone made all three of them look up at the great thing and stop whatever it was they were doing confronted by something so immense so beyond their experience or imagination anything they did suddenly seemed irrelevant pointless the pinpoint of light had descended into the house for the second time and there was now a glow coming from the hallway as the three of them brought their eyes back down to earth they froze a shadow had appeared on the window of the front door theres something coming dan could feel his knees beginning to quiver lucy pulled at nettles arm but nettle edged forward as if eager to greet whatever it was that was even now opening the front door of the destroyed vicarage aggggh screamed lucy as the thing emerged into the starlight good evening to you unknown lifeforms said the thing the proprietors of starlight travel inc would like to apologize for any inconvenience you may have suffered due to the inadvertent emergency parking of their vehicle arrrrghhh aaaaaaarggghhh lucy was by now screaming incredibly well nigel was covering his ears and trying to get even further under the steering wheel of the car its all right lucy dan was trying to calm her down arrrrghhh aaaaaagghhhh arrrrrgggghhhhh lucy was not about to be calmed down by anybody she was confronted by an alien from outer space and she was jolly well going to have a good scream sh said nettie its talking to us quite said the thing from outer space by way of apology may we have the pleasure of offering you a free cruise on board our starship perhaps another day said dan aaaaaaaarrrrgggh arrrgh aaaaah aaaggghhhh continued lucy yes cried nettle id love to come with me madam said the thing from outer space and turned smartly back into the ruined house well come on said nettle what a hoot and before either lucy or dan could stop her she had followed it through the front door dan hesitated and then realized he had no choice before lucy could start screaming again he was racing after nettle and lucy found herself racing after dan the thing was standing by an illuminated porch and they could now see that it appeared to be nothing more frightening than a smartly dressed robot wearing headphones who bowed politely to them and apologized for having to invite them into the service elevator please do not be alarmed it said in a soothing voice i can assure you that the starship titanic is the most luxurious and technologically advanced intergalactic starship ever built and every state room has hot and cold running water and colour tv it bowed again and ushered them in and somehow or other neither dan nor lucy nor nettle could later quite explain why they all three found themselves climbing the steps into the elevator before they knew what was happening the steps had retracted up behind them and the robot had flicked a switch i apologize once again for having to bring you in by the service elevator remarked the robot entrance to the starship is normally at embarkation level hey exclaimed dan how come you speak english dan felt better now hed found something concrete to question i beg your pardon but i am not speaking what did you say english all robotic functions on this ship are equipped with infraviolet translation sensors which automatically scan the brainimpulses of passengers for language patterns these patterns are then rearranged inside your heads so that you can understand and speak intelligibly whilst on the ship you are actually speaking and understanding blerontinian pretty convenient for writers of science fiction uh dan wasnt sure what to make of this last remark was the robot implying that he was nothing more than a figment of some writers mind and that this whole thing was not really happening however before he could think any further along these lines his mind was overwhelmed by the fantastic situation in which they now found themselves they were speeding vertically up the vast keel towards the main body of the starship a mile above the surface of the earth nigel stabbed out a number on his mobile and called halfheartedly out of the car window dan lucy nettle but his voice barely reached the crumbled brickwork of the ruined house the next moment he heard a ghostly roar like seas beating on a faroff shore hello said his mobile oxford police station can i help you nigel didnt reply he was too busy watching the vast unbelievable thing as it rose up into the air again and disappeared towards the milky way hello this is oxford police station insisted his mobile phone who is this nigel looked at the smashed victorian rectory and the driveway where his friends had stood a few moments ago and replaced his mobile on its cradle it didnt happen he murmured to himself it didnt happen you might have thought there was a tinge of relief in the way his shoulders relaxed but of course you would have dismissed such an idea as total fantasy in any case at that same moment nigel suddenly became very unrelaxed again in fact he very nearly jumped out of his armani trousers he certainly hit his head on the roof of the car ouch he yelled an old man with a flowing white beard was sitting quietly in the passenger seat there were tears in his eyes and one of his eyebrows was just about to fall off the moment the ship took off dan felt a sinking feeling in his stomach this was of course simply the result of the incredible gforce that was being exerted upon his body but dan who had no idea that the ship had taken off merely thought that he was getting nervous the sinking feeling in the stomach was quickly followed by a draining of blood from the brain leading to momentary lightheadedness followed by total blackout if he hadnt just blackedout dan would have noticed that the takeoff had affected lucy and nettle in an identical way even though none of them knew what was happening nothing to be alarmed about sir madam and thing the polite robot seemed to be addressing this last to the now comatose nettle a perfectly routine takeoff you lifeforms have a good snooze while us machines get on with running the ship the doorbot itself then blacked out and lay in a tidy heap while the ship accelerated at speeds far beyond its original specifications towards an unknown quarter of the intergalactic spacetime continuum the robots on board must have recovered consciousness before the human beings nettle found herself undressed and tucked up in bed in a tiny cabin about the size of her flat back in harringay apart from the size everything about the place was unfamiliar the sheets on the bed were made of some material that felt like silk but much thicker and heavier the mug holding the toothbrush bore a picture of an elderly egyptian opera singer or at least thats who it looked like to nettle shed once received a postcard of an elderly egyptian opera singer and had kept it in a drawer the toothbrush itself was rather weird since it kept ducking its head and brushing its own handle rather like a bird preening itself opposite the bed was a television on which a snowstorm seemed to be the only entertainment nettle picked up the remote aimed it at the tv and started pressing buttons a cocktail cabinet rose out of the floor a dustbot scuttled out of the clothes cupboard picked up an invisible speck of dust squeaked thank you for appreciating a clean environment and hurried back out of sight again the door opened the lights went on and off but the tv resolutely refused to show any programme other than the snowstorm alt hi im glad to see you have found your personal electronic thingie please keep it with you at all times since it is your communication with the starship titanic welcome aboard nettle found herself apparently being addressed by the standard lamp that stood in the corner of the cabin she instinctively pulled the sheets up to cover her breasts wowee i dont blame you keeping those babies to yourself exclaimed the standard lamp will you turn around while i get dressed said nettle the lamp turned around obediently it was the same on the other side will you please go away she said hey thatd be groovy ive had it up to here with standing around in this cabin anyway the standard lamp walked smartly towards the door oh by the way it said breezily im your bellbot anything you want just ask me ill be standing outside wow its great to get a change of scenery and it closed the door im sure that robots not meant to behave like that said nettle to herself as she threw on her clothes and examined the thing she had mistaken for the tv remote control on it were a variety of buttons one of them had an icon of the bellbot on it so she pressed it and the door reopened and the bellbot peered in wowzeee you look terrific in that gap tshirt it exclaimed will you please refrain from making personal comments said nettle rather crossly shit no offence man the bellbot seemed genuinely hurt what can i do for you firstly i want to meet up with my colleagues secondly i think we probably would like to know how to get off this ship hot dog the beilbot snapped its fingers with a metallic ping you mean there are more hot little numbers like you around you are behaving most impolitely for an android nettle knew how to address a robot would you please keep your personal comments to yourself or otherwise i will have you reported and you know what thatll mean the bellbot froze to the spot hey man im a genuine personality transfer bot its my character well i dont like it and youre here to serve me so just stop it at once the robot went all sulky all right dont go on about it do you know where my friends are adjoining rooms suggested the bellbot nettle was out of her cabin in a moment every door along the narrow corridor that curved round and out of vision had writing on it whats this say she asked by way of answer the robot produced a pair of spectacles and offered them to nettle nettle hesitated then put them on translatorspecs explained the bellbot unhappily nettle could now see that every door had a name hyacinth jasmine delphinium and so on how tacky murmured nettle and she started knocking on cauliflower after a dozen or so vain attempts on various flora she turned on the bellbot which was walking quietly behind her with its hands folded behind its back look do you or do you not know where my friends are i do not said the robot do you or do you not know how i can go about finding them nettle was phrasing her questions carefully i do said the bellbot after some thought then tell me how said nettle guest list announced the robot and where is that deskbot embarkation lobby embarkation floor replied the bot cant i just ring from my room not from the super galactic traveller class suites no then show me the way to the embarkation lobby said nettle ah replied the bellbot im afraid i cant leave this deck but if you go along to the lifts the liftbot will take care of all your vertical transportation requirements and then a doorbot will escort you round the embarkation lobby nettle sighed she could already tell that travelling super galactic class was not going to be glamorous lucy came to her senses to hear a loud knocking sound she sat up and looked around an unfamiliar room it was tiny cramped and had a hideous lampstand in one corner the television wasnt working properly and the colour scheme was a ghastly pink there was a constant grinding sound coming from underneath the floor and besides that there was this wretched knocking on what she now began to recognize as the door lucy lucy now realized there was a voice accompanying the knocking open the door it was dan how youve got a little remote control thingie use that shouted dan after a bit of fumbling she managed to get the door open and there was dan standing in a dingy corridor running his fingers through his hair like he always did thank god youre k he smiled that milewide smile of his and lucy flung herself at him as if she were drowning what happened she cried were going to find out thank goodness he sounded more confident than he felt were in that spaceship arent we lucy wished she didnt sound so unconfident because now she had dan there she really felt everything was going to be all right lets find nettle and get out of this thing as fast as possible said dan apparently we can only locate other passengers by going up to the embarkation lobby youd think a thing this sophisticated would have roomtoroom telephones the lift entrance in the super galactic traveller class offered no view of the central well but once you stepped into the lift the sudden sheer vastness of the well took you by surprise lucy and dan found themselves speechless huh said the liftbot if sir madam or thing would care to give some indication of their vertical traveling requirements i might be able to get on with my job such as it is the embarkation lobby please said dan youre asking me to go up am i asked dan the embarkation lobby is on the embarkation level sir said the liftbot in the tone of voice most people would only dream of using to address particularly stupid patches of damp then thats where wed like to go up i suppose so the liftbot fetched up a groan from deep within and muttered to itself young people nowadays dont give a tinkers cuss for them as went through the hell of two world wars that left some of us with one arm and a broken marriage lucy kicked dan as she felt him about to reply just take us to the embarkation lobby she said in her best rodeo drive no hostages taken voice that she used when buying antique rugs the liftbot stifled a pathetic sniffle put its hand to the handle sticking out from its chest and pushed it up with a sigh the elevator gathered speed and the humans were once again silenced by the spectacular magnificence of the starship lucy put her hand into dans in her dreams she had imagined places of such scale and splendour but she had always known that they belonged strictly to the world of the imagination and yet here she was in an interior that matched up to her dreams the old rectory which dan had been so crazy about looked pretty tawdry compared to this she glanced sideways at dan she couldnt guess what he was thinking she never could as they stepped out of the elevator into the loggia at the top of the great central well they caught sight of a blonde figure in high heels disappearing into the far door by the time they reached the embarkation lobby they found nettle apparently deep in conversation with a desk light this is the embarkation lobby sir and madam a doorbot had already wheeled over and was gesticulating in front of them in a rather meaningless fashion as super galactic travellers you are entitled to pass through this lobby but you may not use the seating accommodation or the bathrooms super galactic class facilities are available on your own decks look were not travelling said dan we just want to know how to get out of this thing at that moment nettle who seemed to be getting nowhere with the desk light turned and spotted them hey there you are she called and then turned back to the desk light and said listen bulbbrain you can fill your own request forms in in triplicate and shove them up your lampshade the desk light rested its head in its hands and pretended to be looking somewhere else get off this thing the doorbot was repeating to itself as nettie joined them yeah replied dan we want to get out like the quickest way ohh nettle looked a bit puzzled dont you just want to see round a bit dan found he was more and more surprised by this extraordinary woman look round a bit he exclaimed arent you scared well a bit but its so exciting and these things seem to be perfectly harmless nettie gave the doorbot a chuck under the chin it sniffed and pretended to flick a bit of fluff off its sleeve a dustbot shot out from the skirting picked up the imaginary bit of fluff squeaked and shot back into the skirting again its amazing isnt it ventured lucy uncertainly sensational agreed nettie but weve got to be sensible said dan adopting his im in charge manner that never fooled anyone we ought to find the exit so we know where we are and then maybe we could explore a bit if you really want im afraid you cant sir the doorbot sniffed in that particular way designed to make anyone who hasnt paid a fortune for their ticket to snooty travel agents in kensington feel like unwanted dandruff cant what said lucy i am afraid you cant leave the ship replied the doorbot now if you wouldnt mind hurrying through to your own decks wait a minute dan had decided to turn nasty which in his case was usually as nasty as a packet of bandaids what do you mean we cant leave the ship are we prisoners nettle sounded faintly thrilled no madam or thing of course you are not prisoners it is simply a physical impossibility for you to leave at this moment in time because the starship is in flight the doorbot coughed and indicated the loggia and the great central well i suggest you all go down to the super galactic traveller class restaurant where you will encounter plain home cooking with a great doorway the news that they were in flight had a remarkable effect on the three human beings if there had been a window they would all have undoubtedly dashed to it as there was not all the energy that would have gone into that dashing had to be used up somehow nettle used it up by doing some aerobic movements designed to release stress lucy and dan used it up by shouting at nettie you see what youve done oh my god were in space its all your fault dan chose plain abuse i knew it lucy was going for guiltprovoking self recrimination i knew we shouldnt have followed that dumb peroxide airhead please refrain from shouting on the embarkation level there may be first or second class passengers about you may shout as much as you want on the super galactic traveller class decks said the doorbot and he again indicated the way down nettle was holding up her hands hey hey guys calm down why should we calm down dan had hit histrionic mode youve just destroyed our future home youve forced us onto an alien spacecraft and now were not even on earth any more god knows how well ever get back please said nettle i didnt destroy your future home no no i know im sorry i just got carried away dan didnt know why hed said that and if we really are in the situation this robot tells us were in wed better keep our heads and decide how to get out of it arrrggggghh aggggggghhhhhh arrrrghhhhhhhh lucy had decided to set aside her admiration for the fabulous decor of the ship and had reverted to primal scream mode please scream on the super galactic traveller class decks only urged the doorbot we must do something began nettle do shouted dan do what can we do i suggest said nettle firmly we find the captain there must be one explain our situation and ask him to take us home fine oh fine dan was beside himself with sarcasm fine find the captain why didnt i think of that oh yes brilliant idea actually that is a pretty good idea arrgh aaaaaagh arrrrrgh continued lucy after a short pause shut up said dan it was the first time he had ever spoken to lucy like that and she shut up in surprise where can we find the captain nettie turned to the doorbot who was looking about anxiously to make sure that no other passengers were being incommoded by all this super galactic traveller class screaming the captain madam or thing is to be found on the captains bridge said the doorbot coldly with killing logic and where do we find that you dont said the robot firmly the captains bridge is accessible only from the first class accommodation well surely we can just go through in order to get to the bridge reasoned nettle im afraid not sniffed the doorbot all travelling area restrictions are strictly observed on this vessel oh come off it exclaimed dan this is an emergency over there said nettle she had just put on her translatorspecs and could now read the words first class passengers only beyond this point on a door at the other end of the lobby thats pretty neat exclaimed dan when nettle had explained how she knew which way to go arrrrgh said lucy sorry i didnt mean to scream its just that robot moved so fast and it was true the moment dan and nettle and lucy stepped towards the first class entrance the doorbot had overtaken them and was standing in between them and the doorway i regret sir madam and thing stop calling me a thing said nettle super galactic class travellers are not allowed beyond this point now if youd kindly return to your own decks get out of the way jeeves said dan and he pushed past the robot sir will find the door sealed sniffed the doorbot and if you do not return to your own quarters i shall be forced to call the ships security officers they have vicious rabbits dan and lucy were by now pushing and pulling on the first class door but it was clearly a pointless exercise there must be another way of doing this said nettle something about her tone of voice made dan and lucy calm down and return to rational thinking ok said dan let me handle this after all travel is or has been my business what we have here is the commonest problem known to travellers the world over how do we get a free upgrade the doorbot went silent ha dan recognized the response immediately corporate dumb insolence if you dont tell us how to get a free upgrade immediately i shall report you to the travel association it was a bluff but it seemed to succeed i cannot help you there sir the contempt in the robots voice was now so palpable it made dans skin feel rough you will have to inquire with the deskbot and he indicated the desk lamp that nettle had been talking to earlier huh snorted nettie that machines about as helpful as a strapless ballgown under gforce rut dan had already run over to the deskbot and was now preparing to humiliate himself on an heroic scale look he began we have been misassigned our accommodation this as i expect you recognize is gloria stanley the actress dan pointed at nettle who immediately caught on to his drift and dutifully treated the deskbot to a sultry look i am her manager and this young lady is her lawyer lucy really did look the part in her pinstripe power suit we should have been given first class tickets but our travel agent screwed up the booking can you reassign us immediately the deskbot raised its shade or head and stared with its two lamps straight at dan he squirmed but held his composure and which travel agency would that be asked the deskbot top ten travel dan was well into his role by now the deskbot blinked a few times as if running through a file somewhere in its database there was a sort of bing noise and it drummed its fingers on the desk i have no record of such an agency in the galaxy i can assure you it does exist said dan whilst thinking well it did exist up to this morning look we must get an upgrade to first lucy had decided to chime in oh yes madam the deskbot had become insolently polite and to whose account should this upgrade be charged mayem rader and lizt said lucy it was the name of her law firm we have no record of such a company said the deskbot you didnt even check your database exclaimed lucy indignantly the deskbot blinked a couple of times and there was another bing noise the deskbot leant forward i can only upgrade you if you pay the difference in advance how much is it dan felt they were on a slippery slope here seventy million pistres or two pnedes currency is not accepted and you may only pay by galactic gold credit card i dont think you quite appreciate who gloria stanley is dan decided to change tack i dont give a stuff who gloria stanley is said the deskbot suddenly and rather surprisingly i can only upgrade you if you pay in advance with a galactic gold card oh let it go muttered nettle who hated this sort of thing look said lucy in her best lawyers conciliatory tone there must be some way you could organize an upgrade for us were valuable customers the deskbot seemed to do a quick check this time on a small screen set in the desk super galactic traveller class complimentary it read youre on free tickets exactly were valued customers celebrities dan had thrown caution to the wind but the deskbot shook its shade if it had had a lip it would have curled im sorry there is absolutely nothing i can do you simply cannot upgrade to first class from super galactic traveller class let alone on a complimentary ticket perhaps if you were second class i could do something look said nettie to the desk light we dont care what class we travel i do said dan so do i exclaimed lucy all we want to do nettle continued is talk to the captain can you put us through to him i have no means of contacting the captain replied the deskbot and in any case it is against company policy to allow super galactic class travellers especially complimentary ones access to any of the senior officers god muttered nettle to the other two i cant stand this sort of thing there must be some way of getting through to the captain how can we get reassigned to second class lucy knew now that dan was well and truly in the grip of that most powerful force known to man the desire for a free upgrade nothing could stop him that surely cant be too much to ask dan was halfway between whining and cajoling the deskbot started to look earnestly at the ceiling thats a pretty shade youre wearing lucy had decided to try another approach its just the company colours said the deskbot but it suits you said lucy dan rolled his eyes look he tried to reassert control on the discussion but the deskbot interrupted you have free upgrade vouchers in your rooms now please i have better things to do vouchers dan was grunting this as they raced back through the loggia at the top of the central well isnt that the travel industry all over why do they never tell you these things in the first place the liftbot was in a cheerier mood but only just down it said thats what chalky white yelled at me outside that foxhole at ypres it was the last thing he ever did say buzzbomb took him out same bomb as took out my arm and leg down i can hear his voice to this day by the time the elevator had reached the super galactic traveller class deck the three had heard a full account of the rudimentary medical facilities available at the caen dressing station the technical details of cleaning out gangrene from a deep wound and a nearcomplete itemization of the allied forces requisitioning techniques in cyprus for a robot from a civilization which knew nothing of the earth it was a very impressive performance god i just hope we dont have to use that elevator many more times groaned dan as the three raced off down the super galactic traveller class corridor primula dahlia chrysanthemum nettle was reading the names with her translatorspecs we dont even know what ours were called moaned lucy ah cabbage said nettie this is mine she gained entry with her pet and found her upgrade voucher on the last page of her copy of the super galactic traveller magazine just after the duty free shopping article look she said to the other two while youre trying to find your rooms ill go and get my upgrade ive had an idea she hurried back to the embarkation lobby trying to ignore the liftbots account of life on an army pension and no disablement grant and while the deskbot reluctantly stamped her ticket with her upgrade to second class she inquired i suppose the engine room is aft is it at the end of the grand axial canal second class through which you are now entitled to pass here is another voucher entitling you to a free glass of moonswill at the bar the deskbot handed nettie another ticket and switched itself off nettie went as fast as she could her high heels echoing round the loggia towards the entrance to the second class area meanwhile lucy and dan were trailing miserably round the sgt corridors pointing their personal electronic thingies at each door in turn but to no effect what was netties plan dan decided to take their minds off the present hopeless task she said something about the engine room grunted lucy maybe she knows about engines said dan nettle oh sure hey there was a click i swear lucy tried one of the doors but it was resolutely shut against them well you know for one of nigels bimbos that nettles pretty bright dan nodded to himself oh i didnt realize you were interested in her mind replied lucy whats that supposed to mean dan was taken by surprise its opening exclaimed lucy as one door seemed to give for a moment oh no it isnt shes a nice girl said dan you ought to know youve been ogling her ever since dinner god when was that it seems like a lifetime ago i wasnt ogling her dans injured innocence count was incredibly high some days anyway lucy was now working off her frustration if nettles so bright how come she allows nigel to treat her like a barbie doll does she that sort of woman makes me sick why doesnt she stand up for herself she still might be quite bright dan ventured without much hope lucys powers of certitude always had a crushing effect on him there is no correlation between size of brain and size of tits penishead lucy had a cruel side got it dan had just pointed his pet at a door and it had wonderfully and graciously swung open for them translatorspecs lucy rapped out her order to the lampstand found the super galactic traveller magazine stuck in a rack alongside a leaflet about aerobics classes a list of selfoperated washing machine facilities available to sgt passengers a page form in which to record your personal passengersatisfaction rating and a small leaflet entitled what to do in the event of fire evidently the recommended action was to stay extremely calm and remain cool at all times you were advised to stay in your cabins and not to fly and contact any of the staff and once again you were admonished to remain relaxed and enjoy the remainder of the flight do you think its getting colder asked lucy as she tore out the voucher from the magazine anyway said dan i was not ogling nettle nettie shivered as she waited for the door to the second class area to open for a brief moment she wished her gap tshirt covered her midriff but then as the door opened and she stepped through her mind was swamped by the sight before her she found herself standing on the main jetty of the grand axial canal second class it stretched out in front of her under a simulated sky wide columns marked out the elegantly curved walls and burning braziers dotted the canal embankments all over the canal automated gondolas plied lazily back and forth their robot gondoliers singing pleasantly a song that brought harmony and peace to the main thoroughfare of the starship titanic she gave him love she swung above she kissed him on his smiling handsome lip the gondolier sang in her ear she gave him six pnedes as a tip nettle climbed into the nearest gondola and the singing stopped take me to the engine room she said si workplace chum of victorious athletics coach said the gondolier and off they drifted down the grand axial canal tell me said nettie shouldnt you be singing when youve got a passenger rather than the other way round si perspicacious lady orthodontist replied the robot breathing evenly with the exertion of propelling the craft there must be something wrong with the ships central intelligence system nettie nodded and made a mental note of this the gondola took her straight down the very middle of the grand axial canal the pace was relaxed and the whole ambiance so far away from what she ever imagined being on a spaceship to be like let alone an alien spaceship that nettie found herself leaning back against the cushions and letting her mind drift she wondered why she didnt feel more distressed by her situation it was almost as if she felt there was some benign presence in the starship something or someone that she knew would take care of them and yet it was not complete nettie shook her head the thoughts were all a little too shapeless to make sense and then what about nigel why didnt she miss him more for three months now her whole life had revolved around him she had made sure his diary was up to date and that he looked at it shed made him change his socks every day and had washed his underpants by hand she must love him a lot and yet she knew hed just gone out of her life not just because theyd been kidnapped by an alien starship full of robots heavens above she knew theyd return to earth she knew they wouldnt be harmed but nigel would not be there for her something was broken and yet she didnt seem to regret it the gondola bumped they had reached the jetty the gondolier was on his knees she blew a kiss from her trapeze sang the robot gondolier as soon as nettie was out of the gondola thanks said nettle and that was when the lady lost her grip sang the robot nettie adjusted her translatorspecs and immediately saw a notice which read crew and personnel only she followed the sign down a stainless steel corridor towards a set of glowing blue doors as she approached there was no perceptible engine noise unless that distant rustling of leaves was it or was it the beating of a sea upon a distant shore nettie felt a thrill pulse through her and then realized it was just a chill it really was getting very cold in the ship and was it her imagination or was her breathing getting more difficult at the luminous blue doors nettle waved her john lewis credit card and said in a commanding voice that she had never ever used before special customs and excise search warrant open up there was a slight hesitation the glowing blue doors opened a crack and then shut again hesitated and then obediently opened up the engine room was so similar to the sort of thing youd see in a science fiction film that nettle felt she knew exactly where she was except what was that black black darkness behind the thick window there didnt seem to be anything there and yet all the wiring and so forth seemed to be connected to it nettie looked around for the intercom her idea had been quite a simple one if they wanted to communicate with the captain and they couldnt get up to the captains bridge to speak to him personally then shed telephone him from the engine room there had to be some sort of communication between the bridge and the engineers in the corner there was a small cabinet maybe that was it she opened the doors to reveal two buttons one read bomb monitor and the other press to arm a sudden wave of cold even colder than the current temperature of the ship swept through netties body bomb was there a bomb on board nettle pressed the button that read bomb monitor a polite voice said thank you for enquiring about the status of the megascuttler corporations sd full force megascuttler a bomb to be proud of which has been installed for your convenience upon this starship it is my pleasure to inform you that the megascuttler is currently not activated thank you for showing an interest in bombs bit of a relief thought nettle now wheres the intercom what happened next is totally unclear certainly nettle herself had no recollection she remembered climbing up the ladder next to the armourplated window she could recall feeling colder than ever and finding her breathing harder and then feeling a force gripping her a force pulling her sideways off the ladder a force so vast that she thought she was being sucked into a black hole or something as she felt herself falling horizontally off the ladder towards whatever it was behind the perspex window the next thing she knew she was whirling round in blackness fighting for her life dan and lucy were having trouble they had both procured their vouchers and had successfully wheedled an upgrade to second class out of the deskbot but the trickier negotiation re an upgrade to first class was proving to be a remarkably harrowing experience you have no credit card you are not members of the sixty million miles club you are not even registered frequent travellers this whole discussion is pointless you will find the second class facilities on board this starship more than adequate for your requirements how could even a robot be so unbelievably unremittingly snotty wondered dan dan said lucy were wasting our breath in fact is it my imagination or is it getting harder to breathe dan sniffed the air lucy was right it was also getting colder jesus he muttered the air and heating are at normal levels announced a doorbot thats bullshit snapped lucy its getting colder and its getting more difficult to breathe i can assure you that the air supply and the temperature are set to maximum for super galactic traveller class comfort said the doorbot are you trying to tell us there are different levels of air supply for the different classes of traveller exdaimed dan not normally sir no replied the doorbot however should the ship be travelling without first or second class passengers the oxygen and heating will naturally be lowered to the comfort requirements of super galactic traveller class passengers jesus exclaimed lucy you guys are the most cynical bunch i have ever come across im going straight to the travel association when i get home dan was not messing about any longer he was now beginning to sweat with panic despite the cold there isnt enough air to breathe there is ample air and heat for the super galactic traveller decks sir but unfortunately it is getting dispersed over the whole ship lucy meanwhile was back at the deskbot hammering on the desk im sorry madam the deskbot was saying but it is company policy to supply first and second class air and heat only if there are first and second class passengers on board but we are second class passengers now i have no record of any second class passengers on board but you just gave us an upgrade we had vouchers im afraid vouchers are not processed until the end of the month thank you for your enquiry the deskbot suddenly turned itself off all right all right dan was trying to work himself round to decisive mode its vital we all stick together go and get nettie while i try and sort this mess out but if i go and get nettie we wont all be sticking together lucys rational streak tended to obtrude whenever dan was in decisive mode all right ill go and get her thats the same thing anyway why are you so worried about nettie im not i just think we all ought to keep together in case one of us needs help like what sort of help do we give if were all running out of air and freezing to death all right dont go and look for nettie but what are we going to do dan sounded so desperate so forlorn and yet oddly lucy preferred it to decisive mode ill see if i can find a supply of oxygen you get us up to first class but thats still not sticking together moaned dan i never said we should stick together that was your idea said lucy then she put her arms round dan and gave him a big kiss on the cheek cheer up second class traveller im sure were going to be all right and with that she had gone and dan suddenly felt terribly alone so alone he felt he could pick his loneliness up in his hands and hug it but even as he felt this he realized it wasnt the absence of lucy that made him feel empty inside there was something else lucy had a good brain even though she had lived all her life in la despite the continual exposure to carbon monoxide and people from the film industry she had remained smart she had trained as a lawyer and was well regarded in the firm where she practised her speciality was entertainment law but she still liked to use that brain of her and here was a good opportunity where would they keep the oxygen equipment she actually said it aloud as she paced round the loggia at the top of the central well got it suddenly she knew exactly where to look god it was so great to be bright shed always thanked her stars that she hadnt been born a busty bimbo like some people she could think of a department store she told herself would have a plan of the store by the elevators so and sure enough there it was by the elevators even though this wasnt a department store she pressed a small button and a large area of the floor lit up displaying the plan of the starship titanic whats more she could zoom in and out with a second control this was better than anything they had at macys lucy slipped on her translatorspecs and read medical centre that was where shed find oxygen and without waiting to take advantage of any of the special offers the plan of the ship assured second class passengers they would be delighted with she hurried towards the starships medical centre the medical centre of the starship titanic took up a whole yard section of the main hull under the embarkation level it was dazzlingly new and clean and it said hello and welcome to the medical centre of the starship titanic a place to enjoy and savour the good things of life while you still have it not just somewhere to be sick in we guarantee you will feel no pain once you have placed your credit card in our card care machine jesus thought lucy could they do with a new copywriter her breathing was all the time becoming a little more difficult and it was noticeably colder she looked around for anything that might resemble an oxygen cylinder and suddenly froze in a way that had nothing to do with the temperature unlike the rest of the ship the medical centre was not unpopulated there were two people or were they people there were two figures on the floor and one of them was looking straight at her lucy stared back somehow she knew without a shadow of doubt that he was not human he looked human enough but there was a curious otherness about him it was intangible subtle intriguing then she noticed he had the most beautiful orange eyes lucy screamed and turned to escape but the alien had already leapt to his feet and the door of the medical centre had closed behind her in her panic even her mighty brain couldnt work out how to open it again a powerful arm gripped her round the neck and a voice that sent a shiver right through her said dont struggle i can break your neck lucy went kind of limp she always claimed she didnt actually faint but the journalist for this is who had his arm around her neck later said he dragged her over to the nearest bed and laid her out unconscious for several minutes when lucy came round she saw her bloodstained assailant bent over a dead body she realized immediately he was a crazed killer searching through his victims clothes such odd clothes lucy noticed strange colours strange cut strange materials it was at this point that she also realized she was tied down to the bed the full horror of her situation suddenly hit her like a fortytonne truck hitting a shop window she was shattered and her alarm went off aaaaaarggh aarrrrrgrh arggggggggh screamed lucy the journalist looked across at her and clicked his teeth in annoyance shut up he snarled oh my god the murderer had spoken to her here she was a defenceless woman tied down onto a bed waiting for this violent sadist to finish rifling the pockets of his last victim and then come across to her and do do what do whatever he likes thats what to her to lucy webber a graduate of ucla law school aaaaaaaaaargh arrrrrrrgh aaaaargggghhh lucy had never screamed so well or so effectively in her life unfortunately the effect was not to bring dan running to her rescue but to attract the unwanted attentions of her murderous assailant he came across and stared into her eyes the screams died on her lips as she registered the cruel twist of his mouth and the sadistic glint in those beautiful orangecoloured eyes the next moment she saw his bloodstained hand move to cover her mouth listen said the psychopath theres a bomb on board this ship its going to explode and take us with it unless i can find it quick so just shut up with the screaming i cant think and it makes me crazy god thought lucy it was just like one of those films where the heroine is captured by the serial killerrapist and yet finds herself strangely drawn to him what am i thinking about lucy suddenly brought herself up short aaaaaah aaargh screaming really seemed the only sensible alternative didnt you hear what i said the killerrapist was now glaring into her eyes once again lucy felt her bowels go soft with fear and her breath grew even scarcer than it was there is a bomb i have to find the bomb lucy went quiet and thought about this a bomb was clearly not good news the murderer returned to his victim and continued examining his pockets of which there were rather a lot scraliontis had always been an expensive dresser and you could always reckon on his suits having more pockets than anyone elses that being the fashion of the day suffering supernovae thought the journalist ive never seen so many pockets why are you doing that lucy surprised herself with the steadiness of her voice im looking to see if hes got a plan or anything to show where the bomb is said the journalist why should he have asked lucy stop asking questions snapped the journalist i just asked why because he planted the bomb oh said lucy thank you and then thought why on earth am i being polite to someone whos just about to kill me maybe even rape me first or maybe he isnt maybe there were mitigating circumstances maybe the psychopath wasnt a psychopath maybe he was a caring family man with a flair for initiating excitement who was resourceful in danger and yet prepared to submit to the will of a strong and loving woman is that why you killed him lucy felt surprisingly childish asking the question because he planted the bomb i didnt kill him suddenly lucy saw the murderer in a new light for a start he wasnt a murderer in the second place she noticed he was hurt himself he seemed to be in some pain as he bent over the body perhaps he wasnt going to rape or kill her either haaaa the journalist gave a yell that made lucy jump have you got it lucy asked nervously shut up said thejournalist he had a small piece of paper which he was now stuffing into one of his many pockets hey hey you cant leave me here lucy had gone from abject terror to incensed indignation in less time than most people could go from feeling ok to still feeling ok i cant waste time snapped the journalist it may go off any second and he made for the door dont leave me tied up in here with a dead body screamed lucy something in her tone of voice maybe the sheer volume of it made the journalist stop he turned and looked at lucy in her power pinstripe tied to the bed her black hair falling across her face shit he said the actual blerontin phrase was north of pangalin which was a particularly unpleasant suburb of blerontis the capital of blerontin but the meaning was shit he limped over to the bed and untied lucy just dont get in the way he said dont talk to me like that fired lucy oh youre going to be a great help i can see that replied the journalist as he set off down the corridor towards the stairs up to the embarkation level wait lucy shouted after him ive got to find a supply of oxygen forget it but its getting hard to breathe not as hard as it will be once were tiny fragments floating in space retorted the journalist lucy was by now running alongside him youre an alien arent you she suggested as they waited for the doorbot to open the door to the second class area no replied the journalist youre the alien this is a blerontinian starship in case you hadnt noticed point taken said lucy she really wasnt used to being talked to like this dan would never have dared oh my god she exclaimed as the doors opened and she took in for the first time the majestic sweep of the grand axial canal second class she plumetted and hit his head and gave him six pnedes as a tip sang the gondoliers ohh the journalist gasped as he stepped down into the nearest gondola and missed his footing lucy caught him and held him for a moment youre hurt she said lets get on he returned we have no idea when the bomb is timed to go off lucy helped him down into the gondola and the singing stopped take us to the engine room gasped the journalist holding his stomach si si nitrogenloathing respecters of pressed veal and make it fast si si the gondola set off down the great canal at no greater speed than any other lucy looked across at her former assailant he was rocking backwards and forwards hugging himself are you cold asked lucy she certainly was but the journalist didnt reply he just gritted his teeth and lucy suddenly realized he was in real pain what happened she asked and touched his arm that bastard scraliontis stabbed me with a table lamp growled the exmurderer lucy stifled a laugh how can you stab someone with a it had a sharp end interrupted the journalist are you in pain asked lucy the journalist grunted lucy leaned towards him and moved his hands away from his stomach the unfamiliar smell of a being from another world caught her unawares it was not unpleasant quite the contrary but it made her head spin leave me alone he growled let me look at it lucy pulled him back onto the pillow and tried to open his clothes where the congealed blood was thickest i have no idea how to undo this she said thoughtseal he said and suddenly the garment opened so that lucy was able to pull it back and reveal the journalists gouged flesh oh its nasty she said look suddenly she made a quick movement the journalist yelled and she pulled a large shard of glass from his abdomen the blood welled up again from the wound i couldnt see it he gasped thanks and he held up a small packet here he said oh thank you said lucy accepting the gift in what she felt was an appropriately grateful way what is it a plaster said the journalist stick it on before i bleed to death a lady she say we ought to sing while passengers are in the gondola and not other way round confided the gondolabot clearly feeling the need for a bit of smalltalk we think something may be seriously wrong just get us to the engine room by the time they had reached the engine room lucy had managed to convince the journalist that her name really was lucy but you know what that means in blerontin the journalist was in some pain from the laughter hed managed to stop at last and lucy was feeling a bit piqued no she said coldly what does it mean i cant tell you he replied id like to know no no no no no i just couldnt whats so funny go on youve got to tell me maybe when i know you better oh argh ha ha ha it hurts well whats your name she asked the journalist replied the journalist thats not a name thats a job description objected lucy the journalist shrugged on blerontin newshacks arent allowed individual names its an ancient law something to do with avoiding the cult of the personality or something i cant call you the journalist just call me the he said and opened the luminous blue doors of the engine room a quick look inside drew his attention immediately to the small cabinet in the corner the journalist strode straight across to it opened the doors glanced at the two buttons and without hesitation pressed the one marked press to arm immediately a flap opened and a large black steel egg with fins rose up out of the top of the cabinet at the same time a voice boomed out you have just activated the sd full force megascuttler a bomb to be proud of created especially for you by the megascuttler corporation of dormillion this will be a fairly big explosion so please stand well back about miles countdown to detonation commencing at once one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine nine hundred and ninetyeight nine hundred and ninetyseven lucy couldnt believe what shed just witnessed she looked at the two buttons again through her translatorspecs what for crying out loud did you press the button that says press to arm for she exclaimed the joumalist was hopping round the engine room kicking himself i didnt know it was a dormillion bomb what difference does it make a bombs a bomb i cant explain i need to know insisted lucy no you dont he was perfectly right lucy herself wondered why she was pressing this point she grabbed hold of the journalists shoulders and shook him look you stupid berk youve just done something really stupid and i have a right to know why all right the journalist seemed to calm down its just that the dormillion for press to arm is very similar to the blerontin for please press dog it was just a simple mistranslation he groaned i was wondering what the dog had to do with it great said lucy so now we really are up shitcreek without a bucket nine hundred and ninetythree nine hundred and ninetytwo nine hundred and ninetyone continued the bomb what are we going to do she yelled were going to keep calm said the journalist good thinking the snorted lucy summoning up her not inconsiderable reserves of sarcasm you clearly have a mind the size of arnold schwarzeneggers humeral ligament were running out of oxygen the temperatures rapidly becoming suitable for an arctic winter on pluto youve just activated what was otherwise a harmless bomb and now you have the nerve to tell me to stay calm whos arnold schwarzenegger asked the joumalist arrrrghhhhhhh lucy decided that a good scream was probably the wisest course of action under the circumstances the journalist suddenly screamed as well lucy stopped her screaming and looked at him im sorry he said its just i cant think when you do that im sorry too lucy felt stupid the journalist smiled and then for no apparent reason gave her a kiss on the cheek lucy was so surprised to be kissed by an alien with beautiful orange eyes she simply stood there and heard him say the dock is counting once every innim that gives us about sixteen edoes before it gets to zero how longs an innim lucy wanted to say but her mouth wasnt working all she could do was stare into those strange and beautiful eyes as she heard him say what we must do is find the lifeboats dan was still deep in argument with the desk lamp in the embarkation lobby it was an argument he had become familiar with over the years with top ten travel but there was something wrong somehow he just wasnt getting his points across this damned desk lamp seemed to be coming out on top every time then dan realized the problem was the air or rather the lack of it he just wasnt getting the amount of oxygen into his brain that a travel agent needs to argue for a free upgrade he was panting and gasping he was also on his knees and his head was beginning to spin if you want me to go to the press and blow this story up im quite happy to do so he knew once you were reduced to this line of attack the cause was probably lost theyd never get into first class theyd never get to the captain and theyd all die of asphyxiation and cold great at that moment he heard footsteps running across the loggia of the central well and an exhausted lucy accompanied by a strange man with bright orange eyes staggered into the embarkation lobby the two of them collapsed next to dan and lay there trying to get their breath whos this dan was surprisingly indignant for someone who was in the process of dying of asphyxiation bomb gasped the journalist youre a bomb said dan no lucy felt she had to explain the this is dan dan this is the dan blinked a few times theres a bomb on board its about to go off the journalist managed to get out weve got to get to the lifeboats theyre in first class explained lucy naturally now that is outrageous dan received this new ammunition gratefully and turned on the deskbot if i tell the travel association that theyll blacklist your whole flicking fleet forever wow that was some threat dan knew theyd had it levelled against the top ten travel co inc countless times the deskbot tapped its fingers on the desk and gazed up at the ceiling dyou hear exclaimed dan ill close this whole goddamned company down listen you dumbbot the journalist had grabbed the deskbot by its scrawny stand this is a matter of life and death theres a bomb about to go off in he checked his watch in ten edoes pangalin how longs that asked dan but the journalist wasnt listening he was too busy shaking the robot suddenly there was a crack and a flash and all the lights went off for an instant hey cried everyone and the lights came on again although there was no cause and effect between the shout of hey and the recommencement of illumination im sorry there is nothing i can do unless you have a galactic gold credit card replied the robot in a simulated strangled voice pangalin repeated the journalist please mind your language croaked the deskbot dont you have a credit card the asked lucy appalled to think her new friend might be not the most solvent character on blerontin not a galactic gold he said who is this dan had switched back to indignation mode youve got to earn over seven pnedes a week to get one of those beauties the journalist was still trying to strangle the deskbot its getting really hard to breathe choked lucy ice was now forming on the edge of the desk dan pointed at it you call that super galactic class comfort he choked take your hands off my flex choked the deskbot youll short me again get us into first class now choked the journalist or ill smash your lampshade lucy had collapsed on the floor and dan rushed to her where did you find that guy he whispered into her ear save your breath panted lucy argh screamed the deskbot security may you rot in pangalin yelled the journalist it was at that moment that an extraordinary thing happened or rather it was at that moment that an extraordinary thing crawled into the embarkation lobby across the highly polished floor and up to the deskbot it was clearly alive although only just and it was very old very very very old it was wizened and blackened in its twiglike fingers the creature held a personal electronic thingie it waved this under the deskbots nose and croaked in an ancient voice upgrade all of us the deskbot immediately sprang to attention and became perceptibly brighter of course madam what a pleasure to welcome you to the first class facilities of the starship titanic you will find them without equal anywhere in the galaxy please go through and have a pleasant trip there was a hiss of air returning to the cabins and an instant rise in temperature as the ship registered the arrival of four first class passengers the door to the first class area swung open and dan and lucy the journalist and the ancient creature stepped through into another and even more amazing world nettie exclaimed dan my god youre nettie whats happened to you but the ancient creature whom dan had rightly identified as nettie couldnt reply the moment they passed into the first class section she collapsed and lay as if dead the gap tshirt hung around her shrunken frame like an overlarge pullover her jewellery looked foolish and illadvised on her scrawny wrists and neck what on earth or off the earth had happened to her what had in fact happened was this the starship titanic was powered by the latest and most incredible invention of the great leovinuss genius no one knew how he had done it and he had kept it an absolute secret but somehow he harnessed for the starship his beloved masterpiece the vastest source of power in the probable universe a captive black hole naturally something as powerful as a black hole needed very careful handling and had to be surrounded by incredible safety precautions unfortunately safety was one thing that neither scraliontis nor brobostigon had first in their minds when they began to reduce the specifications for the construction of the ship there wont be anybody in the engine room explained scraliontis when even brobostigon had queried the wisdom of reducing the incredibly strong glass companys spec for the window into the black hole but you know what black holes are like actually scraliontis didnt he was an accountant and not an engineer in any case black hole technology was a brand new concept straight out of leovinuss brain just take leovinuss lowest parameter for the glass shield he snapped we cant afford any more it was nettie who discovered the problem thus caused by scraliontiss costcutting as she climbed the ladder looking for the phone to the captains bridge the force of the black hole had simply plucked her off the ladder and absorbed her through the incredibly strong glass companys belowspec window once in the black hole she had begun to spin around for as far as her body was concerned hundreds of years travelling millions of light years round in tiny circles fortunately she still had her personal electronic thingie on her and this had dutifully clocked up all the miles she travelled nettie herself didnt know how she had escaped in fact she had been thrown clear of the black hole when the journalist had shortcircuited the deskbot nettie was miraculously still alive and even more miraculously still had the presence of mind to realize that she had accumulated millions of light years of space miles enough to get them all free upgrades to first class less than eight edoes to go exclaimed the journalist and thats assuming the bomb doesnt speed up its counting what can i do about nettie cried dan holding the ancient creature pathetically in his arms leave her weve got to find the lifeboats and the journalist was off running along the embankment of the grand axial canal first class with lucy in close pursuit come on dan she called i cant just leave her dan yelled back but theyd turned a corner and were gone dan tried to lift the ancient nettie up but even though she was emaciated and shrivelled he was too exhausted to carry her anywhere he looked around and for the first time took in the extraordinary vista presented by the grand axial canal first class if the word posh ever had any meaning this was it it was luxury it was de luxe it was expensive it was also redolent with the operatic singing of the gondolabots he helped to chalk her tightrope walk so that the lovely lady wouldnt slip dan had always hated opera lets go somewhere quiet he whispered to nettie and finally lifted her up and staggered into the nearest doorway lucy and the journalist had meanwhile discovered that the starstruct construction co inc had not skimped on the signs to the lifeboats there were big reassuring signs almost everywhere you looked they were illuminated and some of them incorporated flashing arrows consequently the two arrived at the lifeboat assembly station in less than a minute seven edoes to go gasped the journalist as he said this both he and lucy discovered that while the starstruct construction co inc hadnt skimped on the signs to the lifeboats they had economized on the lifeboats themselves in fact they had economized completely and utterly on them well whats the point of providing lifeboats reasoned scraliontis to an increasingly nervous brobostigon if there arent going to be any passengers the bastards groaned the journalist thats it said lucy were done for well be blown to little bits of drifting cosmos in exactly six edoes and fortyfive innims the journalist sank to his knees the fight had gone out of him he looked so helpless so forlorn lucy couldnt help it the thought of imminent destruction threw all the usual caution out of her mind she leapt to a conclusion that she would probably not even have begun to recognize under normal conditions oh god she cried i love you and before the journalist realized what was happening lucy was on top of him kissing his mouth and pulling her fingers through his hair ow ouch the journalist yelled mind my wound im sorry im sorry yelled lucy but weve only got six edoes left whatever they are ive never felt like this for anyone the moment i set eyes on you oh god no ones ever going to know nothing matters any more i dont know what i feel but hurry do something and she was wrestling with his clothing i cant get it off i told you its thoughtsealed his clothes suddenly pinged open and the next minute lucy had flung her pinstripe power suit onto the empty lifeboat ramp her fingers ran over the aliens body as she got on top of him oh god she cried feeling the blood draining down into her lower abdomen like a rush of seagulls onto the last herring weve probably only got five of whatever those things are left edoes the journalist tried not to yell out with the pain of his wound weve got five edoes left this is incredible he cried we dont do it like this on blerontin why not lucy didnt care its illegal the journalist was grinning from ear to ear were only allowed snorkstyle you know upside down and from above oh shut up lucy was kissing him i had to tell you i had to i love you ive always loved you thats whats been missing ah ah quick tried the journalist they had only sixty innim before the bomb exploded yes yes they rolled and kissed each other oblivious to the cold metal floor of the lifeboat ramp under their naked flesh life is so short lucy suddenly grabbed his hand and looked at his watch it was totally incomprehensible thirty innims is that all she yelled yes cried the journalist yes i love yooooou cried lucy ooooooooh echoed the journalist and the two of them collapsed together as the clock clicked to zero they lay there waiting for the foreverending explosion that would terminate their brief affair but unlike the two lovers it didnt come whats happened lucy was the first to speak i dont know said the journalist i dont know at this same moment nettie suddenly managed to sit up on the couch on which dan had placed her and screamed oh my god theres only five minutes before the bomb goes off five minutes thought dan this is where in a cheap novel the couple confronted by imminent oblivion would suddenly make passionate love youve got to go and talk to it she pleaded what said dan i cant explain just believe me its in the engine room hurry what repeated dan a bit gormlessly hurry the engine room speak to the bomb dan decided that while gormlessness had its place in the human repertoire of reactions now was neither the rime nor place for it he sprinted out of the beauty salon and ran down the length of the grand axial canal trying to ignore the inevitable chorus she threw her arms around his charms and gave him six pnedes as a tip the first thing he saw when he burst into the engine room was a large bomb sticking up out of a cabinet a friendly sort of voice was booming out fiftyeight fiftyseven fiftysix fiftyfive fiftyfour dan couldnt think what to say after all hed never addressed a bomb before he didnt have a clue what sort of thing it would be interested in hello he said fiftythree fiftytwo hello fiftyone fifty replied the bomb genially any chance of you not exploding dan thought he might as well get straight to the point no fortyeight fortyseven dan was not the most imaginative of men he knew it lucy knew it nigel had known it he was dedicated hardworking loyal thorough all those admirable and desirable things for anybodys partner to be but leaps of the imagination were not his forte and yet he had one now he suddenly knew the one thing that bombs were bound to be interested in do you really want to do this he asked i mean isnt it a bit selfdestructive fortysix fortyfive forty look i am just a simple counting and exploding device and am not equipped for philosophical discourse replied the bomb please do not speak to me while im counting damn now youve made me lose my place you see recommencing countdown one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine nine hundred and ninetyeight got the sucker thought dan he checked his watch against the bombs counting they had about sixteen minutes before they needed to talk to it again he turned and raced back to nettie as he ran the thought of nettie kept riffling his mind like a gamblers hands riffling a deck of cards god she was so intelligent how had she found out the bombs weakness so quickly the clarity of her intellect made him feel so ordinary and humble but then he suddenly remembered how she seemed old and shrivelled he must have been seeing things that couldnt have happened to the beautiful gorgeous nettie and yet it was then that dan found himself thinking the most curious thought of course it was terrible if something had happened to nettie but at least now thought dan he might stand a chance with her lucy was putting her clothes on rather hurriedly the fact that she and the journalist had not been blown to cosmic dust had severely embarrassed her in fact she didnt know where to look the journalist was regarding her curiously you do things very differently in your world he said oh lucy tried to pretend that everything was perfectly normal yes he said on blerontin we have all these absurd rituals we have to go through before having sex theres a thing called dating when a young couple go out for evenings together without necessarily going the whole way as we say then theres a thing called the engagement where rings are exchanged finally theres an elaborate ceremony called a wedding with a cake and bridesmaids and the best mans speech not to mention the honeymoon you wouldnt believe the rigmarole we have to go through in order to make love to each other i like your earth way of doing it much better the bomb still might go off any second lucy reminded him the bomb oh pangalin id forgotten the journalist thoughtsealed his clothes as they raced down the grand axial canal second class they didnt realize that they had missed bumping into dan on his way back to the beauty salon by exactly one eighthundred and sixtyfourth of a second which by an incredible coincidence was exactly where the bomb had got to in its countdown when lucy and the journalist arrived back in the engine room eight hundred and sixtyfour eight hundred and sixtythree said the bomb whys it only got as far as eight hundred and sixtythree wondered lucy youre beautiful replied the journalist lucy became aware that he was still looking at her in a rather odd way and she suddenly wished hed concentrate on the problem in hand maybe it doesnt count when were out of the room she suggested she pulled her companion out of the door but as she started to listen lucy suddenly felt the aliens hands around her breasts ohh lucy i cant stop thinking about you he murmured as he nuzzled her neck eight hundred and sixtytwo eight hundred and sixtyone continued the bomb even though they were out of the room that was one theory out of the way thought lucy disentangling herself from the journalists embrace back in the room she stared at the bomb and tried to think but it was hard with an alien sticking his tongue in her ear and saying he loved her more than anything on his world please the exclaimed lucy we havent got time for that now you started it he reminded her once were roused us blerontinian males tend to be very singleminded ive met your type before said lucy trying to push him away just put your hands on my thing again he was whispering in her ear stop it cried lucy what replied the bomb oh damn i thought you were talking to me now youve made me lose count recommencing countdown one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine i love you said the journalist youre all ive ever dreamed about thats it exclaimed lucy weve got to keep talking to the bomb please put your hand here said the journalist listen cried lucy to the bomb which baseball team won the world series in nineteen hundred and ninety eight nineteen hundred and ninetyseven nineteen hundred and ninety now ive told you before about interrupting me while im in the middle of a countdown if you want a bomb you can have a good chatter with you should have got the megascuttler pro which has multitasking speech recognition and general chattering software and therefore makes an altogether more expensive bang as it is youve got me and im doing my best under increasingly trying circumstances recommencing countdown one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine you have the most wonderful skin moaned the journalist biting lucy quite hard on the eariobe ouch cried lucy look the youve got to stay here and keep talking to the bomb while i go up and find the captains bridge i cant bear to be separated from you he clutched at her arm if you dont stay and talk to the bomb were both going to get blown up she replied just bring me off once more pleaded the journalist ill be able to think properly then honestly blerontinian males need to have two orgasms before they can think straight its well known lucy sighed brushed the aliens hair straight and wondered what on earth shed got herself into while dan had gone to talk to the bomb the prematurely aged nettie had taken the opportunity to look around the room in which she found herself at first she thought it must be some sort of torture chamber or at least an interrogation room but once shed put on her translatorspecs she realized she was in the ships hairdressing salon and beauty parlour the thumbscrews were actually elaborate nailclippers the electric chairs were highly ergonomic sitting structures and the individual gas chambers were hairdriers it was obvious once you read the motto over the doorway welcome to the starship titanic beauty therapy and hair creationry you will leave here lovelier and younger nettie put out a wizened finger and pressed the button on the wall beside the couch which was marked press for service a metal cage on an articulated arm suddenly sprang up over the back of the couch and dangled a few inches in front of her face at the same time a large glass case began to descend from the ceiling until both she and the couch were encompassed by it a reassuring voice then said we have assessed your beauty requirements and whilst recognizing you have a severe problem we would like to reassure you that there is nothing that you can wish to be done that we cannot accomplish thanks to the deaging and rebeautifying techniques pioneered by dr leovinus in this machine lie back and relax whilst we return you to the bloom of youth normally our therapy would require just a few minutes but in critical cases such as yours a little longer may be necessary we apologize for the delay the next moment the cage fixed itself over her face and the glass case filled instantly with some purple gas nettie was terrified for a second but then relaxed as the perfumes began to enter her nostrils erotic perfumes exotic perfumes scents she had never imagined scents of far away and wonder at the same time the feeling on her face was inexpressibly soft and kindly she lay back and just hoped that dan had managed to talk to the bomb dan hurried back from the engine room to find that nettie had disappeared where hed left her there was now a glass case filled with purple gas nettie he cried banging his fists on the glass but with no effect he looked all round the thing but was unable to find any off switch or any way he could prise the thing off her if indeed nettle was in there after nearly fifteen minutes of futile effort he suddenly remembered hed need to speak to the bomb again so he rushed back to the engine room as fast as he could meanwhile the journalist was still trying to put his hand back up lucys pinstripe powersuit skirt you see were just not used to casual sex he was assuring her blerontlnian women make such a fuss about it you know they want presents and they want to be treated nice and taken out to expensive restaurants and all that sort of crap to meet a woman like you is just great lets do it again you said twice and you can think straight objected lucy who was trying to focus her mind on what seemed to her more pressing problems yeah but a handjob doesnt really count anyway us blerontinian malesll say anything when were aroused sixtythree sixtytwo sixtyone said the bomb hey bomb just what dyou think youre doing lucy suddenly remembered what she was meant to be doing pardon sixty said the bomb i said bomb what the hell dyou think youre doing dont talk to me dont talk to me this is a tricky bit fortynine no fiftynine i mean eight damn damn there i go again losing concentration its all your fault recommencing countdown one thousand and im aroused now said the journalist it was at that moment that dan burst into the engine room he found the alien whom hed already taken an agreeably violent dislike to kneeling behind lucy apparently rubbing himself up against her back lucy shot to her feet dan she exclaimed thank god you didnt get blown up nine hundred and ninetysix said the bomb am i interrupting something yes said the bomb now ive got to start all over again one thousand lucy could tell dan was not in one of his better moods no she said weve just discovered how to confuse the bomb talk to it said dan yeah nettie found that out oh of course she would have nine hundred and ninetyfour continued the bomb earth sexuality seems to be very different from blerontinian observed the journalist is it really dan was sizing the alien up trying to decide which bit to punch first yes said the journalist putting his arms round lucys waist on blerontin males get what we call jealous if one male finds another male fondling his girlfriend he can even become extremely violent dan had just decided on the aliens nose as the first point of contact when lucy managed to disengage herself from the amorous the journalist and ran over to dan weve got to get off this spaceship as soon as possible i suggest the here stays and talks to the bomb while we go and find the captain but you dont understand began the journalist dan decided to hold back his iron fist of retribution for the moment he would save it for another time i understand only too well he replied weve got to make the captain take us back to earth now and he was off out of the engine room and racing back down the grand axial canal towards the front of the ship look it was great making love with you lucy said to the journalist who was now standing behind her and attempting to fondle her breasts again but weve got to get back to the real world our real world and she tried to remove his hands from her blouse but blerontinian males cannot just turn off like that explained the journalist we need multiple satisfactions before we can return to a state of equilibrium lucy had attended selfdefence classes for two years when she had just qualified for the law and had always slightly regretted the fact that shed never had the chance to put her skills into practice consequently it was with some satisfaction that she suddenly realized this was such an opportunity she decided to use the standard response to the amorousalienfondlingyoufrombehind assault it was textbook stuff she drove her right elbow hard into his stomach oooouuph gasped the journalist then she twizzled halfround caught his left wrist and threw him over her shoulder onto the engine room floor oooouump grunted the journalist lucy spoke to him firmly in her best lawyerspeak you stay here and keep talking to that bomb while i go and find the captain then she was out of the door racing after dan you dont understand the journalist called after her there isnt any captain on this ship but lucy had gone nine hundred and seventy said the bomb you dont know what youre doing yelled the journalist youre going to need me pardon replied the bomb i wasnt talking to you damn said the bomb recommencing countdown one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine by the time lucy caught up with dan hed already found his way onto the captains bridge of the starship titanic the main feature of the bridge was as the journalist had tried to point out to them the distinct lack of anyone or anything who could in any shape or form be referred to as captain in fact there was a distinct lack in any shape or form of anyone at all jesus what do we do now murmured dan as lucy clutched onto his arm along the length of the bridge was a row of windows showing the great black immensity of space and the dazzling arm of the milky way along which they were headed on the console beneath the windows were various display screens with associated controls the first screen showed a series of random blocks falling from the top of the screen to the bottom the second appeared to be some sort of racing track a third was a shootemup and the next one along was a game apparently based on the starship itself theyre all video games lucy felt righteously indignant they arent controls at all as a matter of fact the entire captains bridge was little more than a highclass amusement arcade it had been designed specifically to keep the captain of the starship titanic amused during the tedium of long intergalactic flights in a spacecraft that was almost entirely automated and selfrunning it was after all titania at the heart of the ships intelligence who was far more capable of taking decisions and issuing orders than any mere living creature so said dan so said lucy i suppose wed better find out how to fly this baby ourselves and point her earthwards so what was going on between you and that that thing hes not a thing hes just a perfectly ordinary alien and there was nothing going on he had his hands on your tits no he did not lucy couldnt stand dan at moments like this why couldnt he give her room why did he try and twist everything what mattered was them lucy and dan what matters is us said lucy taking her cue from the previous sentence you and me you and me and any other lifeform you can get it off with retorted dan jesus dan you are so unpleasant im merely stating the facts well if you really want to know the facts i never made love to jurgen zenzendorf i wasnt talking about jurgen zenzendorf trust lucy thought dan to bring up another case that she could defend instead of the one they were actually talking about i never even suspected you of going to bed with jurgen zenzendorf i mean jurgen was an asshole he was not thats typical of you to denigrate my friends just because youre unbelievably maniacally jealous lucy was firing on all cylinders dan beat a hasty retreat ok ok i accept what you say about jurgen he was a nice guy i liked him i liked his moth collection i liked his mother jurgen was great orjimmy clarke ah now i know youre lying how can you say that jimmy clarke told me himself youd been to bed together hes a lying bastard anyway that was before i knew you i dont want to talk about any of this then why dyou start it lucy was now yelling at the top of her voice dan found his drive to do whatever it was hed previously felt driven to do shrivel into a limp rag of confusion hed actually forgotten what they had started arguing about oh dan lucy threw her arms round him why are you always so far away im here lucy but i never seem to get through to you i love you and i love you replied dan and he kissed her and she felt how far away he really was oh dan lets get married she said oh sure were on an alien spaceship god knows how many light years from earth and you want to organize a wedding you know what i mean she said its no good rushing these things dan weve been living together for thirteen years we cant ever rush anything now lets get the hotel up and running and then we can talk about it said dan sensibly you do like the rectory of course i do im crazy about it except that it doesnt exist any more well get it rebuilt nigel got a great deal on selling off top ten travel well rebuild it better than it was and make it the best little hotel in the goddamned world if we ever get back if we ever get back agreed dan they looked round at the socalled captains bridge with its library its video collection its chess boards and cards tables its jacuzzi billiard tables cinema complex and gym and they wondered how the hell they were ever going to find out how to control something that didnt appear to have any controls in the first place lucy said dan oh dont start again he wasnt doing anything i wasnt talking about that replied dan good retorted lucy one point scored you know this video game that seems to be based on the starship itself uhhuh lucy was staring out of the windows above the console of games well its sort of changing i know this is stupid said lucy but you dont suppose that computer game isnt a computer game you mean might it be an actual display showing those things coming towards us by now dan was also looking out of the window a squadron of small clumsylooking spacecraft were hurting towards the starship dan checked their movements correlated exactly to the motion of the spacecraft on the video display oh my god murmured lucy were being attacked at that moment the journalist suddenly burst onto the captains bridge the ships on automatic he panted but the central intelligence core is missing some of its parts we cant control the ship unless we can locate all the missing bits of the system and get them back into place too late said lucy and nodded out of the window the starship was now entirely surrounded by the smaller spacecraft the journalist muttered holy pangalin a voice suddenly boomed over the ships loudspeaker system you are surrounded give up at once or we open fire quick yelled dan pushing the journalist over to the console how do we give up at once i havent the slightest idea returned the journalist if you refuse to give up we shall open fire in thirty seconds said the voice from the enemy spacefleet we give up yelled lucy but her voice merely echoed round the captains bridge do something screamed dan i told you the ships missing essential bits i dont know what to do the journalist was flipping controls as fast as he could but to little effect since you refuse to cooperate boomed the voice well cooperate just give us a chance lucy had climbed onto the console and was waving her arms at the spaceships in a desperate attempt to attract their attention since you refuse to cooperate you give us no choice but to open fire the space outside the starship suddenly exploded in light and a terrific noise battered the mighty hull deafening those inside lucy fell off the console and dan and the journalist both dived for the floor where they lay trembling with their hands over their ears there was then a pause the voice boomed over the loudspeaker again do you surrender yes yes we surrender screamed all three occupants of the captains bridge very well you leave us no choice another almighty din broke out around the starship and this time they could feel it shudder with the impact of the explosions outside then there was silence the smaller spacecraft edged in a little closer then the voice was booming out again look we dont want to damage the starship but if you refuse to cooperate you will leave us no choice the journalist had by this time found a sort of microphone he pushed a switch and bellowed into it stop stop we surrender stop his voice deafened everybody on board the starship titanic but elsewhere there was a terrible silence then they heard the enemy for the last time we shall hold you responsible for any damage done to the starship with that a wave of the smaller spacecraft peeled off from the main fleet and swooped towards them points of light spattered out from their guns and the sound of ripping metal shook the great starship oh my god screamed lucy none of them could have told you how long the attack went on for but it seemed like several lifetimes to the three figures huddled on the captains bridge the noise the vibration the crashing and bucking of the giant starship went on and on lucy found the journalist had his hands on her breasts but decided not to say anything when it was all over they waited and then stood up trembling and shaking the first wave was returning to the main fleet meanwhile a second wave was peeling off here they come again yelled dan and he and lucy ducked down once more beneath the console but the journalist remained standing with a curious expression on his face lucy and dan braced themselves for the gunfire but it didnt come instead there was an odd rather unmartial banging on the hull of the ship yassaccans muttered the journalist lucy and dan both assumed this was another alien expletive and remained under cover but then the journalist nudged dan and said look dan cautiously put his head above the console and peered out of the window the second wave of spaceships had pulled up all around the starship and an army of short and stocky spacesuited figures were swarming over the hull hammering and welding as they went what the blazes asked dan theyre repairing the damage explained the journalist yassaccans are like that they hate injuring hardware what about software asked lucy readjusting her bra well need guns yelled the journalist follow me the three of them ran doubledup out of the captains bridge while the enemys hammering and welding outside gathered in intensity meanwhile the voice boomed out over the loudspeakers again we shall recommence our attack as soon as the first damage has been repaired if you do not surrender we shall board and dispose of everyone we find in the crews quarters the journalist discovered an arms cache he handed out weapons to dan and lucy how do we use them asked dan turning a strange gun over in his hand it had a short thingy and bulbous sidethingies and a sort of thingy that stuck out and which dan pushed a laser beam shot out across the crew room and exploded in a fireball at the other end like that explained the journalist except dont point them at the soft furnishings he rushed over to the flaming curtain that dan had just set on fire and grabbed an extinguisher we cant use these cried lucy then youll just have to get used to the idea of being thrown off the ship into deep space these yassaccans are not playing games here dan put this on he threw dan a helmet what is it asked dan the starship has two realities one is the dataside and the other is the matterside when the yassaccans board theyll try to take over the dataside as well as the matterside so one of us better be prepared to confront them there i have no idea what youre talking about replied dan its a vr helmet a virtual reality helmet you put it on youll be able to explore the dataside and check whatever the yassaccans get up to there the journalist was clearly losing patience just put it on shouted lucy the noise from the repairs on the hull was getting unbearable what the heck are they doing out there exclaimed dan just put on the helmet cried lucy at which dan did wow he exclaimed i see what you mean im right in the ship hey this is great i can get into the consoles wow now im running along the wiring hey the circuitboards are like vast cities shit the moment he had the helmet on the journalist grabbed lucy and started kissing her as if there were no tomorrow which he figured might well be the case and as if shed been expecting this all along lucy started to kiss him but then she suddenly pulled back and glanced anxiously over at dan who was climbing some invisible stairs in his virtual reality and then turning around and handling invisible objects and letting out delighted yelps oh dont worry about him panted the journalist he cant hear or see us were still matterside hell be totally absorbed in that thing its always the same first time you put on one of those youre usually off for five or six hours lets do it but still lucy pushed him away the yassaccans are invading the ship she protested thats right replied the journalist weve hardly got time to do it before they arrive quick is that all you can think about groaned lucy the journalist was now nuzzling her neck and sending excited shivers down her spine i told you once we blerontinian males get aroused arrgh lucy suddenly screamed and what about the bomb pangalin exclaimed the journalist id forgotten about that he suddenly whipped a small handset out of one of his many pockets and flipped it on twentyfive twentyfour twentythree the bomb was counting toothless rabbits yelled the journalist its nearly there twentytwo said the bomb hey bomb yelled the journalist into the phone dont talk to me moaned the bomb im nearly there twentythree no ive done that were being invaded shouted the joumalist twentyoh no damn recommencing countdown one thousand the journalist flipped the phone off and started kissing lucys neck and undoing her suit that was close he breathed whoops nearly went down a transistor then said dan and suddenly lucy was running her hands all over the journalist and pulling him down onto the floor youre crazy she murmured the hammering and banging on the outside of the ship had stopped by the time lucy and the journalist had struggled back into their clothes dan who was still scrambling around some unseen obstacles on the dataside suddenly yelled out theyre in the ship the journalist grabbed as many weapons as he could carry and headed out of the crew room down at the far end of the grand axial canal he could see short stocky figures already slipping onto the jetty the journalist settled himself behind a large podium on which one of the braziers burnt and took aim as lucy joined him he fired and a series of explosions rocked the jetty and sent the invaders diving for cover the next moment lucy felt the air around and above her exploding with light and noise as the yassaccans returned their fire hey this airduct goes on for ever lucy span round to see that dan had wandered out through the open door of the crew room and was now heading straight for the grand axial canal dan she screamed and ran towards him as his feet reached the edge of the embankment immediately there was another explosion of noise and light around them as the yassaccans fired again but lucy had hold of dans sleeve she managed to twist him round on the very edge of the water and pushed him back towards the crew room the journalist meanwhile was firing as fast as he could in the general direction of the invaders but by now there was so much smoke neither side could see very much lets get out of here yelled the journalist and he bundled lucy after dan back into the crew room who set fire to the curtains demanded bolfass the moment he burst into the crew room he nodded and a couple of yassaccan repair workers hurried over to replace them bolfass had led his special assault group along a back service corridor to the crews quarters while yellin and assmal led the frontal attack along the main arteries of the starship bolfass loved the finish they had obtained on the service corridor ceiling it gave him much quiet satisfaction in the dark of the night to reflect on the craftsmanship and the high quality of material lavished on even the working areas of the great starship never was there another such construction in the entire history of our people he used to tell his grandchildren as they sat around the evening hearth eating their dumpling stew and snork crackling even the curtains in the crew rooms were woven from the hair of the silky canadil which lives high up in the mountains of merlor and can only be caught with love and kindness the hair of the canadil is so fine you must weave it by the light of the moons for in sunlight it will disappear like snow the children loved these tales of craftsmanship and daring feats of engineering it cut bolfass to the quick to see how someone could mistreat such workmanship in fact it made him very cross indeed at that very moment a figure wearing a vr helmet stumbled into the room followed by two others one of whom was clearly a treacherous blerontinian a black rage swallowed bolfass whole and the next moment he had swivelled out his sd handgun and blasted the three newcomers to cosmic dust their bodies exploded in a supernova of entrails and mangled flesh that quickly reached whiteheat and happily burnt out before they could besmatter or stain the beautifully handlacquered walls lucy was aware of a violent cacophony of noise and her eyes were whitedout by the most piercing light she screamed grabbed onto the journalist and fell in a faint upon the floor it was that terrifying bolfass grinned and blew away the smoke from his sd handgun his anger assuaged he twirled the gun on his finger and slipped it back into its holster it has to be explained at this point that the yassaccans were a peaceloving kindly race dedicated to craftsmanship and sober industry many of them however were also prone to blind bloodlusting rage when confronted by certain things such as sloppy workmanship or a disregard for fine handcrafting in the distant past these rages had led to terrible destruction of life and property and since the moods went as quickly as they came they had also led to unendurable remorse for many thousands of these otherwise benign and caring folk the yassaccan scientists had therefore developed the sd weapon which unlike the sort of hardware that most military scientists come up with was designed to reduce death and destruction rather than increase it the simulated destruction weapon or sd gun gave the user the momentary impression of having wreaked the bloody revenge that his crazed fury craved without actually doing any damage it always surprised and stunned the enemy but that was all lucy not knowing any of this was more than astonished to find herself still alive enough to hear the leader of the invaders demand you are under arrest where are the others hey this is great im going down one of the cybernautic neural pathways its like a waterslide wheeee excellent exclaimed dan take that stupid thing off his head snapped bolfass the yassaccans had no time for virtual reality exercises their business was exclusively matterside two of the invaders grabbed dan and yanked the helmet off his head hey i was enjoying th jeepers whats going on said dan as he experienced srm sudden return to matterside i said where are the others repeated bolfass there arent any others replied the journalist truculently come on i wasnt brought up in a blerontinlan state nursery whos running this ship bolfass was getting irritated again hed just noticed the wretched finish on the messtables the blerontinian furniture makers had used unseasoned lintin pine from northern blerontin an inferior wood which would warp badly after a couple of decades in use and by the falls of faknik they hadnt even concealed the end grain with housed joints in fact when he looked closer he could see the tenons were barely haunched leaving scarcely enough timber at the top of the stile for wedging had these people never learned even the most rudimentary basics of the art ofjoinery bolfass reached for his sd gun these institutions were infamous for turning out individuals of less than avenge mental agility possibly owing to the fact that for generations blerontinian governments had saved money on these establishments by forbidding any teaching to be done in them but before he could wreak his terrible and destructive revenge on the perpetrators of this slipshod botchwork a miracle happened the door of the crew room opened and a vision entered someone so compellingly and so unutterably beautiful that bolfass fell heavily and permanently in love his life was never to be the same from that moment forth he lowered the sd gun and stared in childlike adoration nettie who had just completed her course of rejuvenation in leovinuss extraordinary beauty parlour had not only regained her youthful complexion her body also had returned to its former proportions in fact if anything her waist was just that little bit thinner her breasts just a tiny bit firmer the swell of her stomach just a tad more rounded she looked more lovely than ever for despite the fresh bloom of youth that had returned to her cheeks her face was also suffused with the wisdom that comes of having lived for several million years old leovinus certainly knew what he was doing nettie murmured dan who dyou say asked bolfass absentmindedly hi everybody said nettie supposing we all introduce ourselves im nettie captain bolfass at your service said bolfass springing to attention and these are

journalist but theres a bomb on board this ship which is about to go off in he switched on the mobile phone ten nine counted the bomb hot shit exclaimed the journalist silence blerontinian purveyor of shoddy goods shouted bolfass grabbing the mobile phone hes not a purveyor of shoddy goods exclaimed lucy eight said the bomb give me that screamed the journalist flinging himself at the phone bolfass tossed it to corporal inchbewigglit seven counted the bomb its down to seven yelled the journalist take this blerontinian bodger to the cells commanded bolfass and corporals spanglowiddin and rintineagelbun grabbed the journalist in a halfnelson and marched him out of the crew room six said the bomb and corporal inchbewigglit flicked the mobile phone off these two as well bolfаss was pointing at lucy and dan no cried lucy and dan the bomb but they were hustled out captain bolfass said nettie in a cool voice there is no time to explain please give me the phone i am afraid i cannot allow you to use it nettie said captain bolfass for security reasons such as you might call for reinforcements captain bolfass you have my word that there is no one else on this ship as far as i know you also have my word that there is a bomb about to blow us all to cosmic dust unless you give me that phone bolfass hesitated a fraction of a second and then nodded to corporal inchbewigglit corporal inchbewigglit hesitated even less than a fraction of a second and handed the phone to nettie nettie switched it on two said the bomb oh bomb said nettie this is nettie remember me er one said the bomb how many fours make eight ererzeee no how many fours make eight er er two said the bomb how many twos in six three said the bomb and how many times does three go into twelve four said the bomb it paused for a moment and then continued five six seven phew said nettie thatll buy a bit of time why have you put this bomb onto our ship demanded bolfass your ship exclaimed nettie why do you sound so surprised cried bolfass do you think were not skillful enough to have built such a wonderful thing oh no replied nettie i didnt mean anything like that its just that you attacked the ship it didnt seem like you owned it of course we own it nettie thought captain bolfass appeared a trifle defensive legally and morally this ship is our rightful recompense for all the misery and hardship that we have suffered at the hands of the blerontinians look i dont want to appear stupid you could never look that nettie the captain assured her thank you nettie felt herself charmed by this short fair stranger in whose hands her fate apparently lay but i dont know the background history to all this and i will be delighted to tell you the whole story dear lady bolfass gave her deep bow but first it is my unpleasant task to ask you once again why have you placed a bomb on this ship we havent nettie gave a little laugh that sent the captains heart reeling after his wobbly knees were on this ship by accident and she told bolfass the whole story how dan and lucy were about to turn the old rectory into a hotel with the money from the top ten travel agency and how the starship had crashed into the house how they had been invited aboard by a polite robot and of all the things that had passed on the ship up until the invasion by the good captains forces when she had finished there was a long pause until nettie eventually added and thats it really bolfass seemed to suddenly recollect himself as if hed been in a dream while shed been talking he jumped to attention and clicked his heels in a most courteous manner i understand perfectly dear lady he said bowing and kissing her hand captain bolfass increasingly looked as if he had just stepped out of a jane austen novel all we want to do is to get back to earth said nettie of course captain bolfass clicked his heels again in that way that made nettie wriggle inside with delight i am entirely at your service come and nettie followed the captain her high heels clicking on the beautifully laid floor of the work area dan wasnt quite sure why he was surprised to find that there were cells on the starship titanic it made sense in a way he supposed and yet they seemed totally out of place amidst all this luxury and elegance the cell that he and the journalist had been thrown into was as cells tend to be bare and cold it was also damp which is certainly what you expect cells to be but a bit surprising on such a technologically advanced vehicle lucy is such a good flick said the journalist shaking his head in admiration you are a lucky man look said dan i hate to disabuse you but on earth our attitude to these sorts of things is not the same as you blerontinians youre telling me exclaimed the journalist when lucy first suggested we have sex i could hardly believe my ears she did what exclaimed dan well we thought that the bomb was going to explode any second and she just kind of hey come to think of it dyou think your other friend whats her name she suggested you make love the blonde one nightie nettie dyou think nettie knows about talking to the bomb i dont believe lucy suggested you have sex replied dan that was when i first realized how different sexual attitudes must be on your planet dan went a bit quiet in all the years he had known lucy and what was it oh it must be all of thirteen years now and in all those years he couldnt remember lucy initiating a single sexual act in the early years he would sometimes lie awake at night waiting to see if she would start but he finally gave up she was always perfectly happy to make love but he had to make the first approach hed always assumed that was just how she was hey jailer the journalist was yelling out of the bars the is that you lucys voice came from the cell down the row lucy cried the journalist pipes of pangalin i want to screw the arse off you stop it screamed dan and he threw himself at the journalist the two of them rolled around the sodden floor of their cell with dan punching and kicking and the surprised journalist trying to defend himself dan dan is that you lucy was yelling she could hear them fighting stop that weve got to save our strength weve got to get out of here lucys right the journalist panted and suddenly the fight went out of dan suddenly he found himself wondering why he was so jealous why did you attack me asked the journalist dan was just about to explain about the history of sexual mores on earth but he stopped himself look he said instead lets call a truce just dont talk about sex for the rest of the day all right if youd rather but dont worry about me im not shocked by the laxity of your earth morals just shut up about it for a few minutes ok replied the joumalist now said dan suppose you tell me everything you know about this starship that were all stuck on and then maybe together we can figure a way to get off it dan i love you shouted lucy from her cell i love you too dan shouted back me too shouted the journalist dan fought back the urge to hit him and said tell me what you know and so the journalist told dan about how the construction of the starship titanic had bankrupted the planet of yassacca and how starstruct inc had then removed the construction work without paying their debts he told dan of the rumours of financial trouble that had dogged the building of the ship on blerontin of the suspected shoddy workmanship of the unmarried teenage mothers employed on the work and how corners had been cut he told dan of leovinus the architect engineer artist composer and greatest general allround genius in the galaxy and how he had met him on the night before the launch he told dan of his meeting with scraliontis the accountant who had told him of the bomb and the plot to scuttle the great starship and claim the insurance shortly before plunging to his death after being attacked by a parrot the journalist then told dan how despite his wounds he had decided to stow away on board in order to get the great scoop that had always hitherto eluded him in his career as a journalist hed expose the full story behind the construction of the starship and at the same time give a first hand account of what it was like to be the only passenger on board the journalist then told dan about how the ship had suffered a smef shortly after launch and how it had crashlanded on some unknown planet in the unexplored backside of the galaxy he finally described how after the crash he had heard cries coming from one of the curtains in the first class dining room he had then discovered leovinus where he had been left for dead by scraliontis the journalist had freed him and then tried to stop the old man from rushing off the ship but to no avail despite his age leovinus had overpowered him and screaming for revenge waving a glowing silver shard in his hand and presumably imagining he was still on blerontin the great genius had disappeared into the darkness of an alien world captain bolfass wants to see you their jailer suddenly cut across the long story he jangled his keys as he opened the door to the wretched cell and pulled the journalist out captain bolfass had escorted the beautiful nettie to the captains bridge there he had invited her to take a little tea and some cinnamon biscuit while he made the necessary arrangements to fly the great starship back to the planet earth without wishing to sound disrespectful he explained to her it is not a planet with which i am familiar though of course it must be the most delightful world to be the home of someone as lovely and as charming as yourself he bowed and nettie felt the thrill of being treated like the heroine of northanger abbey i am sure you are more than capable of guiding us home she said lowering her eyes ah my dear lady exclaimed the captain it is not i who will guide us but the ship itself the exact location of the planet earth will have been recorded in the starships central intelligence core although none of us have any idea of where your planet is to be found all i have to do is to tell titania that is what leovinus named his cybernautic system and she will locate it and take us there captain bolfass pressed a small button on one of the consoles next to a video game based on a recent blerontinian film and that is where the novel suddenly ceased to be one by jane austen or even catherine cookson barthfarthinghasts exclaimed bolfass somethings wrong im getting no response nettie who had felt the earth and home to be very close indeed a mere buttonpush away now saw it suddenly recede into deep space captain bolfass corporal bukewillinujit had just arrived out of breath and nervous the central intelligence core someones removed the vital functions bolfass turned to yellin who was busy with one of the shootemup games this is the work of that blerontinian vandal bring him up at once by the time the journalist was thrown at his feet bolfass had become quite angry not as angry as if he had known about the substandard materials used for the railing around the central well or if he had known about the scandalous lack of finish in the bilge and rubbishdisposal wastes but still pretty angry what have you done to titanias brain he roared the journalist stuck his chin out and said i can only give you my name rank and number this isnt the great escape exclaimed bolfass swivelling a light into the journalists eyes tell me what you know or i shall let horst here do his worst the great escape the name of a famous blerontin film celebrating the true story of how the cream of the blerontinian spacefleet held prisoners in the supposedly impregnable fortress of dratkroner contrived a mass escape oddly enough it also starred steve mcqueen my lips are sealed countered the journalist turning his head away very well you leave me no choice snarled bolfass and he struck the journalist across the face with his leather glove all right said the journalist ill tell you anything you want anything dont you want to be tortured a little more first no id rather tell you now very well we know youve sabotaged titanias brain to prevent us returning to yassacca tell us what youve done with the parts the journalist looked surprised scraliontis didnt tell me about that part of the plot what plot bolfass secretly admired his blerontinian adversary for his ability to remain cool under circumstances when a lesser man would have cracked its a pity he thought we arent fighting this war on the same side on the other hand were not actually fighting a war at all bolfass made an effort to pull himself together the journalist then told everything he knew about scraliontiss and brobostigons plot to scuttle the great starship and claim the insurance bolfass listened in whitelaced anger nettie could see the rage boiling up within him its not this fellows fault she cried out bolfass hesitated his hand was already on his sd gun but something in the tone of netties voice stilled the fury inside him he left his gun alone scraliontis and brobostigon were on the ship the night before the launch said the journalist they wouldnt have wanted to attract attention by going in and out of it so i imagine whatever they took out of the central intelligence system theyll have hidden somewhere on board sounds feasible said assmal the other yassaccan commander who up to this point had been doing fantastically well at the tetris game very well said bolfass we will search the ship from prow to keel those parts must be found or we will never get nettie back to her own planet indeed we will find it hard enough to limp back to yassacca as it is i think we can make it captain said rodden the navigational engineer we are in the starius zone ed of the praximabetril section of the inner galaxy i can get us home by dead reckoning so long as assmal can get manual control of the ships power assmal nodded i have control now of enough functions to be able to steer but it will be a long trip several hours at least and so the great starship titanic turned its vast bulk in the starbright darkness of space and began its weary journey back to the planet of yassacca the search for the missing parts of the starships brain proved more difficult than anyone could have anticipated this was mainly owing to the fact that the ships robots were becoming increasingly eccentric in their behaviour the doorbots were beginning to hallucinate opening the doors for nonexistent first class passengers pets and being charming to wastedisposal units the liftbots had gone into a permanent decline convinced that the only way to avoid the end of civilization as they knew it was to eat less protein the dustbots kept dashing out from the skirting and depositing on the floor bits of fluff large enough to trip everyone up but the biggest problem was in the main bar of the ship where the barbot was trapped in some strange cyberpsychotic loop despite the fact that they could all clearly see a piece of titanias brain amongst the coloured glasses and bottles on the shelf behind him yes yes sir jiff be with you cock this tail mix have you just sir the barbot veered between the charmingly incomprehensible and belligerently drunk just give us that piece of cyberware on the shelf there tried corporal golholiwol but the barbot simply bit his nose ow cried corporal golholiwol every attempt to climb over the bar and get at the object was met with a surprising show of force from the barbot and the peaceloving yassaccans were forced into retreat by the time all but one of the missing parts were eventually located the starship titanic was within sight of the planet yassacca returning home was always the jailers favourite thing in life soon he would have his feet up beside a blazing hearth a jug of oldfashioned beer would be in his hand and his family would be running here and there preparing the evening meal or playing games on the porch in the setting sun he was therefore whistling a rather jolly tune as he unlocked the cell door and indicated to dan that he was a free man had dan been more musical he would have recognized the jailers tune as none other than mademoiselle from armentiers a french tune popular during the first world war the reason why the jailer came to be whistling it is not unconnected to the smuggling of french champagne to blerontin via the timewarp previously mentioned for if the truth were known the jailer was none other than corporal pillwiddlipillipitit the notorious smuggler and leader of the infamous pillwiddlipillipitit gang which was one of the unpleasant manifestations of organized crime that had sprung up since the ruin of the yassaccan economy pillwiddlipillipitit had disguised himself as an ordinary corporal in the yassaccan spacefleet in order to reconnoitre the starship titanic for possible plunder at a later date but that is another story the moment he was free dan made a beeline for lucy who was standing on the captains bridge with the journalist and nettie watching the great globe of the approaching planet through the window lucy he whispered can we go and talk somewhere private not now lucy whispered back look isnt that the most amazing sight youve ever seen it reminds me of your breasts murmured the journalist dan fought back an urge to kill the journalist on the spot and instead grabbed lucy by the arm and dragged her to the other end of the bridge you suggested it he said you did dan was trying to sound more indignant and accusing than plaintive but it was coming out more like a total and utter whinge dan it wa sjust a weak moment why have you never had any weak moments with me in the thirteen years just what the hell are you talking about dan we have a great sexlife dont we lucy was getting mad at him wellyesits just youre just so goddamned jealous you think im screwing every man who finds me attractive i never said that as usual dan could feel the conversation spiralling out of his control as it happened however he was rescued from the inevitable dialectical humiliation by a remarkable and dangerous turn of events that was to alter the whole course of this story bolfass had been pointing out the continents and countries of yassacca to nettie he felt his heart beating fast partly with the pride he felt in his own world but more because nettie had taken hold of his arm and was gazing out beside him in wonder and admiration bolfass could have practically swooned on the spot he could smell the scent of that beautiful creature beside him he could feel the gentle touch of her soft hands upon his arm and he could feel her heart beating behind her firm breast close against him bolfass hardly knew what he was saying and there dear lady you can see the ocean of summerplastering that is the land known as finepottery oh and over there dear lady if you were to turn your eyes you could see my own country carpenters islands it is a fine place peopled by noble craftsmen and technicians of the highest calibre or at least it was before bolfasss voice seemed to crack so that nettie glanced down at him his rugged features were clouded by a furrow of sadness before what captain bolfдss nettie asked softly ah nettie i dont want to burden you with the problems of our world replied the gallant captain i should like to know nettie took the captains hand in hen and stroked it gently and i think the good captain would have fainted then and there for sheer pleasure had not a movement around the perimeter of the planet distracted him rodden whats that bolfass had suddenly become tense the navigational officer peered into the distant haze around yassacca he put his binofocals to his eyes and an involuntary gasp escaped him blerontinians he murmured bolfass grabbed the binofocals yes he could see clearly a whole fleet of fighter spaceships with blerontinian registration plates but no other markings they were clearly not official blerontin space fleet mercenaries muttered assmal they mean trouble said yellin quick yelled bolfass every man to arms and turn off the sd feature we shall shoot real ammunition there was a buzz amongst the yassaccans as they leapt into action grabbing weapons and racing to predetermined positions the idea of firing real ammunition instead of simulated destruction charges was both exciting and terrifying to them of course they had used live ammo when they first attacked the starship but that was just against an inanimate object this time they would he firing at living targets naturally they wouldnt aim directly at the enemy that went without saying but there would be a lot of exciting repair work to look forward to bolfasss face suddenly darkened and he turned gravely to nettie nettie he said i am so sorry to do this and i hope you will be able to forgive me but i must regretfully ask you and your friends to retire to a safe quarter whilst we are engaged with the enemy while bolfass had been saying this the blerontinian mercenaries had streaked up to the starship and had now surrounded it there must have been fifty or sixty craft a typical ragbag assortment of spaceships converted to military use such adhoc fleets had become a familiar sight in the spaceskies around this sector of the galaxy ever since the breakdown of economic cooperation between worlds and the destabilisation of the intergalactic security council suddenly a harsh voice boomed out over the starships loudspeaker system this is the official spacefleet of the magnacorps insurance company of blerontin we are acting under licence and according to blerontinian law on behalf of the loss adjustors appointed to liquidate the remaining assets of the starstruct construction company starship titanic holdings ltd and starlight travel inc as per the insurance schedule para subsection on behalf of the abovenamed insurance company we hereby repossess this starship as lawful property of the said insurance company please leave quietly and in an orderly fashion snork piddlers yelled bolfass he knew how to work the ships communication systems and his voice rang round the mercenaries spacecraft so loudly they could hear it from the starship we built this ship we lavished our care and craftsmanship on it without stint and without grudge we bought the finest materials and ran into debt trying to meet the wonderfully high specifications ordered by mr leovinus we were never paid a penny then when the construction was taken from us we and our families were faced with poverty and hunger this ship is ours by every moral right in the galaxy what is more we claim it by right of salvage we found it and we have brought it hack to its rightful place go suck yourselves even as he spoke four of the mercenary boardingcraft clanged into the side of the starship grappling irons were attached to the hull and the airlocks of the titanic were broached from the outside at the same moment the air around the mercenaries burst into light and smoke and noise as the yassaccans launched a furious counterattack all this while nettie dan lucy and the journalist had found themselves back under arrest and being hurried towards the cells by half a dozen agitated yassaccan guards they were about halfway along the grand axial canal when an advance patrol of blerontinian mercenaries suddenly burst out of the embarkation lobby and opened fire the three earth people and the journalist threw themselves onto the floor but the yassaccans used as they were to sd weapons hesitated for a second and in that second they lost it corporal inchbewigglit and corporal razitinkerrigipitil made it to the deck but corporals yarktak bunzlywotter tidoloft and forzab received direct hits they clutched their chests and their weapons clattered to the floor nettie was the first to throw herself onto one of the fallen weapons and without hesitation she turned it on the mercenaries considering she had never even handled a shotgun back on earth nettie seemed to master the yassaccan blaster with remarkable ease it seemed obvious to her where to hold it and shed noticed the trigger just below one of the firing chambers she aimed it squeezed the trigger flame blasted out of the barrels and two mercenaries fell to the ground no no yelled corporal inchbewigglit in alarm aim above their heads not on your life yelled nettie and brought down another blerontinian by this time lucy dan and the journalist had each grabbed hold of another of the spare weapons and started blasting away at their attackers their yassaccan guards were clearly shocked the blerontinians for their part were taken totally by surprise they were used to standing up to the fury of yassaccan sd guns and in extreme circumstances they were used to yassaccans firing over their heads with real weapons but this was something new it was also very alarming the few blerontinians who remained standing looked at their fallen comrades they looked back at their adversaries who even now were blasting straight at them and without waiting for another volley to hit them they turned and fled the yassaccan guards were flabbergasted never in the history of their nations had blerontinians fled before yassaccan gunfire nettie meanwhile had raced forwards to the doors of the embarkation lobby there she continued to blast away at the retreating blerontinians this time firing above their heads but the mercenaries were in no mood to stick around to see what she was aiming at they were already back in the airlock and had slammed the door shut mind the paintwork gasped corporal inchbewigglit well done cried dan who had just reached nettie she was breathing hard and dan could feel the heat coming off her body as he stood close behind her suddenly she span round oh my god the bomb she exclaimed and pulled the mobile phone from her pocket two said the bomb one hi bomb its nettie hi nettie are you all right bomb there was silence for a moment dan thought theyd lost it bomb are you there bomb nettie called into the phone but still the bomb didnt reply bomb dan had grabbed the phone oh of course let the man do it said nettie bomb are you there dan wasnt listening to nettie speak to me i was speaking to nettie said the bomb in a sulky voice oh said dan and handed the phone back to nettie sorry he whispered this is nettie said nettie into the phone again the bomb remained silent bomb she repeated again silence bomb a note of urgency had crept into netties voice speak to me then the bomb spoke very quietly im a megascuttler it said is that your name asked nettie yes said the bomb im a bomb i know you are replied nettie i like hearing your voice nettie said the bomb i like hearing yours bomb replied nettie youre not just saying that no im not for an electronic voice you have a very soft one its nice for a moment nettie thought the bomb was crying wont you start counting down again for me if youd really like me to said the bomb yes said nettie very well said the bomb ill count just for you nettie but this is the last time one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine nettie had been so intent upon her purpose of stopping the bomb that she hadnt realized how terrified shed been but the next moment she found out her knees gave way and she fell into dans arms that were suddenly there to catch her bolfass stood on the captains bridge of the starship titanic and could not believe his eyes as he watched the blerontinian mercenaries beat a retreat into their boarding craft what on yassaccas going on he exclaimed blerontinians dont just give up like that they usually fight to our last man but for good measure he ordered another salvo of spacefire and the blackness around the mercenaries craft exploded again with light and noise in less time than it takes for a snork to poop on a plate the ragtag flotilla had turned about and with a blast of whitehot rocketry the loss adjustors spacefleet disappeared into the stars beyond the beautiful green planet of yassacca at that very moment dan and nettie burst onto the captains bridge again you should be in the cells snapped bolfass they shot straight at the enemy corporal inchbewigglit appeared behind them thats why the mercenaries ran off weve got to do something about the bomb cried nettie it says this will be its last countdown thats terrible exclaimed bolfass looking very grave indeed yes it says it will explode this time you aimed directly at the blerontinians isnt that what youre meant to do asked nettie not it is not exclaimed bollass we have a strict moral code my dear lady im sure you didnt mean to actually aim at them well of course she did dan was getting a bit shorttempered it was the only way to stop them what are we going to do about the bomb they ran off like zippo as soon as they realized nettie was firing at them exclaimed inchbewigglit enthusiastically i shall have to put you all under arrest captain bolfass said nettie in her most charming voice we are ignorant of your ways on yassacca and can only react as earth people and on earth im afraid people aim to kill and maim each other thats what weapons are for i dont like it but that is how it is we didnt mean to infringe your code of honour we just tried to save you and the starship from the loss adjustors now listen and she flipped on the mobile phone nine hundred and twentytwo the bomb was still counting weve got about thirteen minutes very well said bolfass still sternfaced we shall have to apologize to the blerontinians but they were trying to kill you exclaimed nettie that is because they have no moral code that forbids them replied bolfass with undeniable logic i shall write the letter of apology as soon as i get a spare moment if we dont do something about the bomb exclaimed dan were all of us going to be nothing but spare moments you are right said bolfass i shall have it defused at once nettie insisted on being with the bomb while it was defused i feel i owe it to it she said when dan tried to dissuade her besides if it goes off it doesnt matter whereabouts on the ship any of us are the yassaccan bomb disposal expert agreed as he put his tool bag down beside the bomb four hundred and thirtyfour said the bomb hi bomb said nettie four hundred and thirtythree said the bomb nettie somehow knew that it was not going to let itself be interrupted this was the last countdown how are you feeling bomb nettie asked please dont talk to it while im defusing it said the bomb disposal expert it could be dangerous have you got enough time asked dan four hundred and thirtytwo said the bomb depends said the bomb disposal expert unscrewing a metal plate from the cabinet if it keeps counting at this speed i should be ok but sometimes on the last countdown they can speed up this is a d full force megascuttler if it were an g or even a a wed be fine they put a servocontrol mechanism in to stop that problem but with the sd well you just never know ah this seems to be all in order while he had been talking the bomb disposal expert had removed the metal plate and exposed a dull red button which read defuse the bomb fortunately on the d they still included this automatic defuser just to make it simple for us bomb disposal experts he pressed the button immediately the bomb stopped counting there was a pause then a siren went off the red button saying defuse the bomb lit up and started flashing and a glass cover slid across the button preventing anyone from touching it wait a mo said the bomb disposal expert this doesnt seem to be quite right congratulatlons said the bomb you have successfully defused the d full force megascuttler the megascuttler however is linked into the intelligence cybersystem of this starship and unfortunately that system is currently incomplete the bomb has therefore gone into default mode please refer to manual wheres the manual asked the bomb disposal expert his voice betraying an edge of what nettie could only categorize as panic youre the bomb disposal expert said dan meanwhile nettie had discovered a small booklet tucked under the bomb cabinet she riffled through the pages how to preset the timer for cooking large joints she read thats the manual for the gas oven exclaimed the bomb disposal expert grabbing it off nettie and starting to read it avidly any technical manual was of interest to a yassaccan it was the sort of thing in which they could always find solace and escape especially when under pressure meanwhile dan and nettie were scouring the engine room for the right booklet by the time the bomb disposal expert said look it has the selfcleaning function dan had found the easytouse manual for the sd full force megascuttler your userfriendly bomb stuffed behind some water pipes the sd full force megascuttler is designed to be the ultimate userfriendly exploding device he read all operations are simple and self explanatory give me that cried the bomb disposal expert snatching the manual from dans hands default mode he read once the bomb has gone into default mode as a result of an incomplete intelligence system on board ship the following conditions will apply you will not be able to reach the defuse button you will not be able to touch the bomb or the bomb cabinet you will not be able to do anything any more to the bomb so leave it alone dyou understand good the sd full force megascuttler will now explode in exactly six dormillion days from the commencement of default mode shit said dan shit said nettie shit said the bomb disposal expert how long is a dormillion day it was nettie who was first to ask the obvious question thirtysix dormillion hours said the bomb disposal expert how longs a dormillion hour asked dan seventyeight dormillion minutes said the bomb disposal expert its about well how can i tell you theres no point of reference the three of them thought for some time and were just about to agree that it was impossible to convey any idea of time from one star system to another when nettie said got it i wont tell you how she worked it out but it was pretty clever if you cant work it out for yourself youll have to write to the publishers of this book for a selfexplanatory leaflet entitled how nettie worked out the length of a dormillion day so six dormillion days must be roughly equivalent to ten earth days said nettie after a few quick calculations god nettie said dan youre so clever why didnt i think of that the trio had just reported back to the bridge of the starship how do we get it out of default mode bolfass was questioning the bomb disposal expert our only hope is to find the missing central core of the ships intelligence said the bomb disposal expert if we can replace that then i can probably defuse the bomb otherwise itll blow in six dormillion days bolfass turned to his assembled crew men you hear the seriousness of this situation our beloved home of yassacca has been ruined by the construction of this starship and the failure of the blerontinians to honour their debts we built in good faith we put our entire way of life at risk to construct the most fabulous and beautiful starcraft the galaxy has ever seen the blerontinians betrayed our trust the only chance our world has of returning to its former prosperity is by our repossession of the starship titanic if it is blown up by this treacherous bomb the future of our world is grim indeed therefore i command you to search this ship again i know we have scoured every last inch of it but that missing central intelligence core must be on board somewhere and we must find it at this moment a scream was heard over the loudspeaker system lucy exclaimed dan i have to explain what had happened to lucy and the journalist since the brief exchange of gunfire outside the embarkation lobby the moment nettie dan and corporal inchbewigglit ran after the retreating blerontinians the journalist grabbed lucy and pulled her into a side chamber off the grand axial canal what on earth are you doing the exclaimed lucy although it was pretty obvious that what the journalist was doing was undoing the buttons of her pinstripe powersuit as fast as he possibly could whilst at the same time apparently trying to see how far into her ear he could stick his tongue the cried lucy stop it no no no moaned the journalist once we blerontinian males have been aroused by a female it takes us many many years sometimes a lifetime to get dearoused visivis that particular female what are you saying the cried lucy marry me lucy cried the journalist burying his face in her now exposed bra oh yes yes yes the she cried squawk cried something else we can get engaged and have a white wedding and a wedding cake and dan can give the best mans speech and well have a honeymoon exclaimed the journalist squawk darling the cried lucy tears in her eyes what am i doing what am i saying part of lucys legal training had suddenly started to reassert itself it was something on the lines of dont commit to anything that you may later regret but im getting married to dan were going to run a hotel what was that squawk squawk said the thing that was squawking it was that exclaimed the journalist and suddenly a large parrot flew out of the dark recesses of the room and landed on the journalists shoulder it was at that moment that lucy screamed and as she screamed as luck would have it she had inadvertently put her hand down on one of the ships intercom buttons with the result that her scream was relayed all round the starship titanic squawk said the parrot bloody genius back on the captains bridge bolfass pricked up his ears what did that parrot say bloody genius screamed the parrot over the intercom parrot yelled captain bolfass what are you telling us bloody genius repeated the parrot parrot bolfass yelled into the intercom were looking for the missing central intelligence core for titanias brain do you know where it is there was a silence parrot yelled bolfass but lucy had removed her hand from the intercom button and was now using it to caress the journalists face as if his smooth features were a fortunetellers crystal ball whys captain bolfass so interested in what a parrot says nettie had turned to corporal inchbewigglit in yassaccan tradition whispered corporal inchbewigglit parrots are the messengers of truth we have a saying from the mouths of babes and parrots lucy meanwhile was wondering why she had said yes to everything the journalist had just suggested she thought she had probably made a terrible mistake if only she could see the future in those strange orangecoloured eyes of his youre crazy she said ohhh moaned the journalist and he chewed her brastrap with his teeth ahh said lucy haaaa murmured the journalist ohuh replied lucy oooooh he said oh uh ooh added lucy ya ha haa asked the journalist uh confirmed lucy uh asked the journalist again uh repeated lucy uuuuuhh the journalist was almost lost for words at this point but lucy carried on the conversation oh she sald ah he wondered how she could be so certain ah she nodded she was absolutely certain now ah and at that moment the entire company from the captains bridge burst into the side chamber off the grand axial canal and stood riveted to the spot while they watched a highly qualified lawyer from wilshire boulevard and an underachieving member of the blerontinian press corps doing the sort of things to each other that give inexpressible delight and pleasure to the participants but which only tend to provoke ridicule from casual observers and about which therefore i will not go into detail suffice it to say that the moment the bridge party burst into the room the parrot gave the loudest squawk it had given to date and lucy fell off the table onto the journalists face lucy exclaimed dan parrot yelled bolfдss where is the missing intelligence core for titanias brain bloody genius squawked the parrot dont talk rubbish shouted bolfass bloody genius screamed the parrot i asked you a question yelled bolfass it was also according to yassaccan tradition that parrots were supposed to answer any questions put to them squawk the parrot momentarily forgot its powers of speech answer my question squawk the parrot flew off into the shadows at the further end of the chamber damn it bollass knew it was bad luck if a parrot ref used to answer your question i can explain everything lucy was telling dan no you cant you cant explain anything screamed dan and lucy suddenly thought hes right hes absolutely right perhaps that is your answer it was nettie who had suddenly stepped forward and taken captain bolfass by the arm dear lady it is good of you to trouble yourself with this matter but i fear the parrot has not given any reply i am doomed didnt you tell me that this starship was designed by some genius leovinus exclaimed the journalist he was here on the ship when we crashed on the earth maybe he has the missing part it was all so clear to nettie although she didnt know why something clicked in the journalists mind of course he exclaimed when he ran off the ship he was brandishing this glowing silver strip in his hand the central core intelligence exclaimed bolfass thats why it isnt on the ship so captain bolfass was putting two and two together but rather slowly in order to get the missing central intelligence core for the ships system weve got to find this leovinus character nettie had decided to take over the deduction process leovinus is on the earth but we cant get to the earth because we dont know where it is and the only way to find out where it is is to get hold of the missing central intelligence core and refit it into titanias brain gentlemen were screwed it was then that the docking sirens sounded the starship titanic was preparing itself for landing on the planet of yassacca the celebration party was a gloomy affair everyone tried to make the best of it and kept toasting the earth folk for their invaluable help in beating off the insurance loss adjustors several speeches were made extolling the return of the great starship to its rightful home but nobody could forget that within a couple of days the ship would have to be towed off to some distant part of the galaxy where it could explode without doing any more harm than destroy itself the yassaccans could see no prospect of recovering their economy meanwhile lucy dan and nettie could see no prospect of ever returning to their own planet they had each been given translation blisters so that they could still communicate now they were away from the influence of the ships automatic systems but that had done little to reconcile them to the prospect of exile on an alien world but surely rodden the navigational officer had cornered nettie you must have some idea of where this earth place is i mean you must at least know whether it is in the notional northern hemisphere of the galaxy or the notional south well no is it on an outer or an inner arm of the spiral i havent a clue said nettie rodden shook his head gloomily he hated talking to dumb blondes well if you really have no idea where youve come from i really cant get you back there the only thing that could is the starship and that cant remember because its brains missing seems to be a common complaint he added unnecessarily and wandered off rather to netties relief nettie looked around at the gloomy party she felt sad and yet there was so much beauty in this gentle world she found herself in yassacca it was a nice name for a start and she was sure there were worse places slough new maiden basingstoke nettie found herself split in two one part of her was saying come on make the best of it this is home from now on and the other half was telling her not to give up that somehow deep down inside her she was convinced that she would be able to get them all back to earth nettie felt a bit foolish for feeling so convinced of her own ability but there it was she just couldnt shake the feeling off though she had no idea why she had it in the meantime she tried to enjoy the sad celebration the very smell of the snork roasting over open fires seemed sad as it wafted under the gloomy yassaccan pines and then mingled with the softer sadder scents of the night jasmine and the weeping oleanders that crowded corporal golholiwols garden the yassaccans took it in turn to host important national events and it just happened to be corporal golholiwols turn he had provided seven snorks for roasting plates of fish and fruit and fresh vegetables from his garden unlike the blerontinians the yassaccans took no interest in canapeґs and preferred good plain food washed down with plenty of yassaccan ale and sweet potato wine the journalist gloomily thought it all pretty poor fare but he tried to hide his contempt for the lack of fishpaste tiny chicken volauvents and cocktail sausages on sticks but no matter how much nettie complimented him on his crackling corporal golholiwol refused to emerge from his gloom in the old days he explained to nettie we would have roasted seventy snorks i would have been able to provide so much fish we could have filled the ocean of summerplastering and all the beer and wine well it would have flowed from those fountains you see over there in the centre of the garden ah these are thin times indeed for yassacca and he gloomily stared into the empty ale mug he held in his hands captain bolfass was also gloomy he kept trying not to stare at nettie who had discarded her gap tshirt handknitted waistcoat and miniskirt in favour of a simple yassaccan shift slit up to the thigh and embroidered at one corner she looked breathtaking and the poor captains breath was so taken that he sighed and tried to imagine how he could ever have lived without her who are you mooning over now captain bollдss asked his wife excuse me my dear replied bolfass it is just that that young earth woman has stolen my soul with her beauty poor dear said mrs bolfass taking his hand and stroking it im sure youll get better ah sighed captain bolfass i do hope so i do hope so perhaps you should see dr ponkaliwack no no ill be all right sighed the captain but the old yassaccan songs that the band were now playing caused the captain to sigh again and again and even brought a tear to his eye they were ancient songs of yearning for better tools and materials songs of lament for construction projects that were never finished and songs of regret for the great craftsmen of yesteryear who would never plane nor chisel again lucy found dan hidden at the far end of the garden sitting on a low wall under the oleanders sunk in utter despondency he held a piece of snork crackling in one hand and a glass of wine in the other go away he said oh dan lucy sat beside him and tried to put her arm around him lets get married married exclaimed dan huh after what i saw that alien doing to you dont be well lucy wasnt quite sure what she was telling dan not to be foolish jealous sulky he had a right to be all those things and yet she couldnt help feeling he was overdoing it dan we love each other dont we i dont know replied dan do we of course we do cried lucy were going to set up the hotel and run it together and have children no we arent said dan we cant get back to earth and even if we could the hotels a pile of rubble but weve got the money from top ten travel but that doesnt mean we love each other but we do weve been together all this time dan stared gloomily at the piece of snork crackling in his hand finally he looked at lucy and said here comes nettie nettie had been looking for lucy and dan all over the garden may i join the funeral she said dan nodded and nettie sat down on the other side of him lucy took her hand away from dans so nettie began i suppose this is going to be home from now on you look as if youve made yourself pretty much at home already remarked lucy who was still wearing her earth clothes i thought i might as well start getting into the role laughed nettie that is so sensible said dan to lucys intense annoyance look i dont want to break you two up said nettie even more to lucys intense annoyance but ive got something to tell you something i think you ought to know nettie didnt quite know where to begin its about the rectory your hotel she said its sad to think well never be able to run it after all nettie dan sighed into his wine you were never going to be able to run it replied nettie what dyou mean lucy was immediately on the defensive what was nettie implying that they were incompetent or something i dont know whether i should tell you this now maybe its pointless but on the other hand maybe itll make you feel better what demanded lucy she had stood up and folded her arms in her best courtroom how do you dare propose that posture well said nettie nigel was a shit we all know that he was my best friend exclaimed dan yes sure replied nettie but he was a shit you certainly let him treat you like shit retorted lucy thats my problem replied nettie im crazy but that doesnt mean im stupid and although nigel never discussed any of his business with me i can tell you he didnt sell top ten travel for anything like the amount he told you he had thats why you could never get the documentation off him he actually sold it for peanuts youd never have been able to pay off the rectory let alone set up the hotel there was a brief silence that seemed to get up stretch its legs and then wander off into the night huh snorted lucy eventually that doesnt surprise me one little bit well it sure surprises me exclaimed dan how dyou know this nettie he felt incredibly indignant probably indignant at nigel but for the moment he was content to be indignant with the messenger oh said nettie he was so sloppy he used to leave documents just lying around he didnt give a shit i guess he never bothered to talk to me enough to find out that i was bright enough to see what he was up to i kept trying to tell you but we never met except with nigel in tow it was awful i could see you heading for disaster that bastard cried lucy striding around beneath the oleanders if we ever get back to earth im going to tear his balls off well thats one threat he doesnt have to worry about sighed dan his depression deepening by the second suddenly he felt netties hand on his ann he turned and looked directly into her eyes and felt his stomach give way a wave of wonderful helplessness swept over him as he felt her eyes falling into his and yet she was saying something else dan couldnt make out what it was that nettie was saying he was so overcome with her proximity and the way her breasts showed under the translucent muslin of her yassaccan shift the next moment before he regained his senses she had rushed off in some excitement dan turned to lucy what did she just say he managed to ask she just said wait a minute ive got it ive got the answer i knew i would replied lucy oh said dan there was a silence then he added im sorry about the hotel i know how much it meant to you lucy looked at him in some surprise i was more worried for you i know youd staked everything on it dan frowned and took a little swig of his wine thats why i went along with it continued lucy i never really liked the rectory that much i just couldnt bear for you to be disappointed dan took another little swig of his wine then he did something that was so uncharacteristic that it made lucy jump out of her skin he threw his glass against one of the oleanders and it shattered into tiny pieces well he said in that case i guess weve both been fooling ourselves and each other for a long time i was only so keen because i thought you were lucy was playing with one of the buttons that had come off her pinstripe powersuit during her earlier encounter with the journalist maybe that says it all dan maybe that says it all dan found nettie in a state of some agitation she had just been proposed to by captain bolfass corporal inchbewigglit corporal rinfineagelbun corporal bukehammadorf his halfcousin by marriage bukewillinujit bukewillinujits father corporal golholiwol the yassaccan prime minister and several other yassaccans she did not actually know on her way across the lawn the prime minister had even given her a bottle of famous yassaccan scent only wear it for us yassaccans my dear he had said and squeezed her bottom when dan caught up with her nettie was desperately looking for her handbag god you dont think anyones stolen it do you i believe they dont have much crime here on yassacca said dan theres been all this organized crime since the economy went down the chute said nettie but organized crime isnt going to bother to steal your handbag nettie dan was trying to be reassuring ive got to find it exclaimed nettie her eyes blazing just a few inches away from dans dans knees suddenly relaxed their grip on the standingup situation and he had to sit down on the nearest tree stump great grief that wonderful scent youre wearing the prime groper of yassacca just gave it to me in more ways than one replied nettie nettie i dan didnt really have a clue what he wanted to say it was as if the scent had wrapped itself around him and wouldnt let go until he told her the truth what nettie was back searching a pile of clothes that various people had dumped over a bed that was standing on the veranda of corporal golholiwols house nettie i i think i m crazy about you dan didnt know quite how it happened but suddenly he had his arms around netties waist and was kissing the back of her neck nettie span round stop that she cried dan backed off youre getting married to lucy youre going to start a hotel youre going to have kids and all that sort of thing everythings changed said dan we cant go back to earth its all different here and he tried to put his arms round her again but nettie backed away now hold on romeo said nettie im not an emotional doormat for your convenience besides youre going back to earth were all going back to earth i hope just as soon as i find my handbag what have you got in your handbag a concorde ticket home a pocket rocket dan didnt doubt for a moment that nettie had the solution if she said she had he knew that if any one of them had the brains to get them back it would be nettie he worshipped her he admired her but why couldnt he tell her properly instead of behaving like a sexcrazed halfwit lets just find it shall we said nettie so dan stopped asking questions and put his mind to looking for the handbag im sorry are you looking for this corporal golholiwol was holding up netties handbag nettie grabbed it opened it and started feverishly rummaging through it dan looked at corporal golholiwol netties got something in it that will help us get back to the earth he hoped nettie wouldnt hear how like a sexcrazed halfwit he sounded would it be these corporal golholiwol held up a package neatly wrapped in a broad leaf nettie snatched it from him checked its contents and then looked up at the corporal what the blazes do you mean by taking things out of my handbag her eyes were like miniature sd guns corporal golholiwol felt himself disintegrate and splatter all over the veranda he looked genuinely taken aback oh dear he said have i done something contrary to your earth customs on yassacca it is traditional for the host to go through his guests handbags and do little repairs and mending jobs on the contents well its not an earth custom said nettie still furious but thanks for developing the film for me thats exactly what i was looking for it was my pleasure said corporal golholiwol gazing adoringly at nettie most of the photos seem to have come out ok i also reelectroplated your nail scissors restored several missing teeth to your comb and resilvered your little mirror why thank you so much corporal nettie had regained her composure and was searching through the photographs that golholiwol had developed then suddenly she found what she was looking for here look dan its the rectory they came out those long exposures look they came out dan felt he was a bit out of his depth but he just said without enthusiasm oh good itll be nice to have a souvenir nettie however had already spun round and run off towards a group of yassaccans who were talking gloomily over the roasting snork rodden nettie called out and the navigational officer turned around rodden ive got it you can get us back to earth nettie thrust two of the photographs into his hands he took them unwillingly not wishing to get involved in any fantasy that this attractive but dim female might have concocted well cried nettie hardly able to contain her excitement look at them what do you see rodden reluctantly looked down at the photos in his hand and studied them its a house on earth i assume he said slowly a former rectory by the look of it with planning permission for commercial use thats amazing exclaimed nettie how dyou know all that the navigational officer smiled smugly as he took off his translatorspecs and said its written on the estate agents board he loved baffling beautiful but not too bright females oh right anyway its the place dan and lucy were going to buy before your starship smashed into it so rodden was suddenly looking at them with increasing attention how do you suppose these will help you i took them at night cried nettie excitedly look at the sky especially that one there look a broad smile suddenly creased across roddens face you can see the stars cried nettie my dear young woman said rodden you must forgive me for underestimating your easyover on the flattery replied nettie i dont mind what you thought the main thing is can you get any coordinates on those star patterns that will show where the earth is are there enough stars in the shot rodden was silent for some time nettie watched him anxiously and suddenly dan who had joined them by this time found netties hand in his and she was squeezing it rodden stared and stared at the photo finally he looked up theoretically he said yes it should be a simple questlon of threedimensional geometry there is only one place in the galaxy in which the stars will appear in that exact configuration but im not sure this photo will provide enough information the earth folks hearts sank the navigational officer was clearly trying to let them down gently nettie cursed herself she had allowed her hopes to get too high she was always doing that especially with her men but the navigational officer was continuing i think i could enhance the image do you have the negative its here shouted corporal golholiwol then lets see what we can do said rodden and with that the party suddenly started to seem more cheerful for everybody concerned it took two dormillion days to run the enhanced photos of the night sky on earth through the great astronomical computer at the university of yassaccanda the computer went through fifteen trillion billion five hundred thousand million seven thousand four hundred and sixtynine different comparisons before it finally came up with a star configuration that matched it was on an outer spiral arm of the galaxy in a sector that quite frankly had always been assumed to be uninhabitable if julius caesar had been given a photograph of australia and told its exact location on the planet it would not have seemed so remote as did the earth to these honest yassaccans alas said rodden the navigational officer it will take a long time to reach such a distant place nettie still had hold of dans hand it seemed to dan that she had permanently held onto his hand since that first discovery of the photos of course she hadnt but it was just that dan only counted himself alive at those moments when she had but he darent say anything more to her he would never use her as an emotional doormat she could be sure of that weve only four more dormillion days before the bomb goes off nettie said how long will it take to get to the earth rodden paused before he spoke he wanted to be exact he didnt want to raise forlorn hopes in anyone least of all himself finally he said to get to such a remote location would take three dormillion weeks at best nettie leant her head against dans shoulder and burst into tears it was just too much the thin edge of hope upon which she had been balancing for the last two days had suddenly given way dan put his arm around her and felt the softness of her shoulders nettie he said youll be all right youll make a life here yassacca is beautiful as beautiful as you he wanted to add but dared not nettie meanwhile held onto dans arm as if it were her lifebelt however continued rodden the starship titanic is propelled by a totally new and immeasurably more powerful drive judging by the time that elapsed since the launch the crash on earth and the time when we picked you up i would say the starship must be capable of reaching the earth in perhaps three dormillion days was it good news or bad news three dormillion days that would give them barely one day on earth to find leovinus and then assuming he still had it in his possession get the missing central intelligence core back into titanias brain the only thing that was certain was that they must start now the first problem however was to find lucy after her last conversation with dan lucy had been considering her life she had slipped into a filmy yassaccan shift and gone for a long walk along the beach at yassaccanda the red waves beating on the blue shore made the same reassuring sounds that the waves made back home on topanga beach but somehow the comfort that brought her didnt make her long for home something had changed inside her something had died something had grown lucy was just trying to decide what it was when nettie found her lucy theyve got the coordinates of earth were going home but weve got to hurry nettie had never been one to beat about the bush by the way you look great in that thanks but lucy was gazing out across the unfamiliar seascape im going to stay here she said what on earth are you talking about exclaimed nettie we can go home i dont know where my home is any more said lucy la london oxfordshire i used to think it was anywhere that dan was but now whats the matter between you and dan nettie was genuinely concerned for them and had been ever since dans inexplicable behaviour when she had been looking for her handbag neither of us wanted the rectory lucy turned and looked at nettie for the first time what exclaimed nettie its as simple as that we must have been fooling each other for years about all sorts of things you know i was originally in love with nigel lucy was letting the sea wash around her bare feet till you realized what a shit he was asked nettie not quite it was more like how can i describe it nigel was english different exciting he made me feel all goosepimples inside it was unsettling whereas dan i could understand dan was familiar territory where i knew where i was but dans gorgeous exclaimed nettie hes so exciting so different from the rest of them from creeps like nigel lucy looked at nettie in frank surprise im sorry nettie continued i shouldnt talk about dan like that i didnt mean anything anyway weve got to hurry hurry away run off ive always done that nettie ive wrapped my emotions up in a nice smart pinstripe suit and then walked away from them well im not doing it any longer but dan needs you lucy youre a great team thats what we kept telling each other we told each other that over and over again until we believed it but all i know is that im a different woman from the woman ive been pretending to be lucy lucy and nettie span round they hadnt heard anyone approaching lucy the starships about to take off for earth it was the journalist shouting from the breakwater weve only got a few minutes to make it we murmured lucy of course exclaimed the journalist you dont think id let you go back on your own not now youve said youll marry me but the ill stay with you here if you want me to lucy had run up to him and was kissing him uhuh said the journalist ive got to see this thing through to the end and suddenly the three of them were racing along the sands towards the spaceport the journey back to earth in the starship titanic was pretty uneventful for the first hundred and seventeen million million miles the doorbots were just as snooty as they always had been but since lucy nettie dan and the journalist were travelling first class all the other bots were unbelievably obsequious to them the liftbots gave dan a surprising account of the dunkirk evacuation which made it sound like a great victory for the allied forces and the deskbot asked for netties autograph but otherwise routine life on board the starship ticked over captain bolfass put a brave face on his hopeless passion for nettie and yet as he told his wife it had at least given some purpose to his old age even if that purpose were just to get over it nettie for her part was mainly concerned for dan he seemed to be raking his separation from lucy and her wild affair with the journalist rather badly he mostly kept to his cabin and when he ate with them he was generally silent and morose poor dan nettie thought to herself he must be going through hell after all he and lucy have been so close for all those years and now to see her so besotted with another man and an alien at that lucy and the journalist also mostly kept to their cabin but judging from the sounds emanating from behind their closed door they were not brooding about anything it sounded as if they might have been playing polo or doing a bit of waterskiing all mixed in with some pretty serious weightlifting all in all it was lucky the state rooms on either side were empty even as it was several pictures fell off the adjoining walls and a stand bearing a pot of yassaccan lilies mysteriously toppled over on the third day the great starship moved into the region of space beyond proxima centauri we should locate your star any minute what dyou call it asked captain bolfass the sun said nettie what a beautiful name said the gallant captain gazing at netties exquisite profile nettie nodded its a beautiful thing hmmm agreed the captain dreamily do you recognize any of the star patterns yet asked the navigational officer anxiously it was all very well heading for an unknown destination with such scanty data but in this case they were all on board a ship that was destined to explode within two days time the whole venture was crazy as far as he was concerned and he had expressed his opinion quite forcibly to captain bolfass supposing they failed to find the earth would they ever find anywhere to land in this remote armpit of the galaxy and even if they did once the starship had exploded they would be marooned for well goodness knows how long it would take a rescue fleet to arrive nettie shook her head im not much cop at astronomy ill get the others up on deck but neither dan nor lucy had any more idea than nettie about the local constellations and rodden shook his head wearily at the earth folks ignorance but worse was to come look rodden suddenly exclaimed dyou see that star there that must be your sun and so it proved to be within the hour the starship was slowing down and they could clearly see the sun as a tiny disc and so which of these planets is the earth it was a simple question rodden had asked but it threw the three earth folk into utter confusion i think its the fourth planet from the sun ventured dan or is it the third asked nettie its the second said lucy the navigational officer had to excuse himself at this point he left the bridge and locked himself in the washroom where he proceeded to bang his head against the sink unit for several minutes how could any living creatures be so utterly and abysmally ignorant of their own planet look said dan on the outside pluto right yes neptune saturn or is it jupiter next saturn said nettie saturn jupiter mars earth so its the sixth planet in very good exclaimed captain bolfass then we are approaching it at this very moment stand by to fire retardation rockets and stabilize ship for slowdown orbit around earth to be established in thirtyfive edoes time landing by small landing craft by the time the navigational officer came out of the washroom the starship titanic was in orbit around the earth do the starships windows make everything look red asked nettie maybe its the weather said lucy the earth did look extremely red ladies and gentlemen said captain bolfass it is my privilege to accompany you down to your landing craft if you would follow me hang on said nettie we missed out uranus this is mars the navigational officer left the room again he could feel one of those terrible yassaccan rages overtaking him in the washroom he got out his sd gun and blew his own head off after which he calmed down and returned to the bridge by this time they were approaching a blue planet patched with brown and flecked with white whorls it was definitely the earth and even old rodden couldnt help feeling sympathetically towards the three earth folk as he saw their spirits rise and their hearts beat with pride and wonder at this vision of the planet that had given then life as they assembled in the tiny landing spacecraft bolfass spoke briefly and unemotionally we have exactly one day in which to find leovinus and hopefully the titanics missing central intelligence core and get it back to the ship and into titanias brain but we have less than that i did not mention this before but i have to now we only have half a day since if you have not returned by midday we will have no option but to fly the starship off to a safe distance and man the lifeboats before she explodes may we all be saved from such a fate go and good luck nettie took dans hand as he helped her into the landing craft the journalist jumped in beside lucy oh dan he said theres something ive been meaning to ask you well go ahead will you be our best man dan thought about hitting the journalist but instead he smiled yes he replied ill be glad to great smiled the journalist we can have a real blerontinian white wedding youll love it dan raised his eyes heavenwards and nettie smiled as the cover of the landing craft was placed over them captain bolfass retreated to the viewing chamber the side of the great starship opened and the tiny landing craft blasted itself away towards the blue planet leovinus was not in a good mood despite all the things he was good at astrophysics architecture molecular biology geophysics painting sculpture mechanical design physics anatomy music poetry crystallography thermodynamics electromagnetism philosophy and canapeґ arrangement hed always been hopeless at languages consequently when he found himself on an alien world without a translation blister he was understandably frustrated here he was the greatest genius the galaxy had ever known and he couldnt even ask these aliens in their strange blue suits for a cup of tea i definitely think he is sarge said constable hackett what gay asked sergeant stroud whod noticed the old mans eyebrows were stuck on with toupee tape no lebanese said the constable do we know anyone in the oxford area who speaks lebanese well its kind of arabic innit yes must be plenty of them in the university and so a call was made and leovinus shortly found himself confronted by a large man with a nose the shape of africa who told him in arabic that his name was professor dansak but to no avail leovinus was beginning to lose his temper by now not only was no one treating him as you would expect a race of clearly inferior minds to treat the greatest genius the galaxy has ever known but everyone was treating him as if they actually wanted to get rid of him i hereby charge you with being an illegal immigrant sergeant stroud was reading from a formal chargesheet i have to warn you that anything you may say will be held against you and that you will be held in a place of custody until such dine as her majestys government is able to repatriate you to your own country assuming we can find out where that is muttered constable hackett professor dansak had recommended a professor lindstrom who held the chair in linguistic studies professor lindstrom listened carefully to the little that leovinus was prepared to say to him and concluded that the elderly gentleman in the white beard and false eyebrows was probably making the language up it bears no resemblance said professor lindstrom to any of the judoeuropean branch of languages if indeed it is a language i am prepared to state categorically that it has no relation to uralic altaic nor to the sinotibetan language groups malayopolynesian is not my field but i would be surprised if it had any affinity there as for the eskimoaleut and the paleoasiatic i am convinced it is not i suspect in short gentlemen that you have here a confused old gentleman talking that widelyspoken language gobbledygook he probably ought to be with his family at home or else being cared for in an institution leovinus at this point had decided to treat these inferior beings to a recitation of edited highlights from his recent work the laws of physics a radical reappraisal of the subject which had turned the entire science on its head it was perhaps the single most important volume ever written in the galaxy and merely to hear it again gave the great man a sense of belonging and reminded him that he was an individual of immense importance no matter how they treated him on this remote and primitive planet he was still reciting from his tenth law of thermodynamic stress when sergeant stroud banged the door of his cell behind him leovinus looked around his new environment his suspicion was that he was not in a hotel entry appeared to be regulated by a simple locking device and defecation appeared to be in a bucket what a savage world he had got himself stuck on if only hed regained consciousness before the starship crashlanded but he hadnt after his fight with scraliontis hed remained unconscious throughout the entire launch the smef and the crashlanding on this godforsaken planet wherever it was hed only come to when that wretched journalist had unrolled him from the curtain thinking it was still the morning before the launch and that scraliontis must have returned home to gloat over his evil scheme leovinus had commandeered the service lift and charged off out of the starship screaming for revenge in the dark he had failed to notice that he was no longer on the launch pad at blerontis it was not until he was a good distance from the ship that he heard the sound of the great powerdrive coming to life he had spun round and to his horror he had watched his great masterpiece rise up into an alien night sky leaving him stranded on an unknown unidentifiable world in a state of shock leovinus opened the door of a small vehicle he happened to find parked nearby and climbed in the vehicle was as it turned out already occupied by a particularly dimlooking alien who nearly wet himself with terror when confronted by leovinus the great man himself was for the first time in his life unable to think of anything to say aware that whatever he did say would not be understandable he had therefore sat there without speaking and allowed the alien to drive him to the present building in which he found himself and which he was increasingly convinced was not a hotel what a complete and absolute mess for gods sake i want to see a lawyer leovinus screamed at the top of his voice and he rattled the bars of his cell in the timehonoured manner sergeant stroud looked at constable hackett and they both shook their heads he might be a harmless confused old man but as far as they were concerned it looked better in the station log if he were an illegal immigrant theyd score a few points with the home office if they could get him sent back to somewhere or other maybe chad or zimbabwe lucy thrilled to the expert way the journalist brought the landing craft down in what had been the garden of the old rectory in the darkness the ruined house looked even more desolate than it had on that fateful night souvenir hunters had stripped it of everything movable including loose bricks the plan was to try and pick up leovinuss trail starting from the crash site there was also the possibility that he might still be hanging around hoping that the starship would return it was not a bad plan as such but as dan jumped out of the landing craft a loudhailer crackled across the old rectory lawns and a blinding searchlight hit him full in the face put your hands above your head do not make any sudden movements you are surrounded by armed police they had not reckoned on the oxfordshire constabulary who flushed with their recent success in capturing an illegal immigrant had set up a permanent watch around the landing site dan instinctively did all the things the loudhailer had told him not to he didnt put his hands above his head he leapt very suddenly back into the landing craft and screamed hit it the journalist fired the engine and the small craft leapt into the air as a hail of gunfire exploded across the lawn in a few seconds the spacecraft had disappeared into the night and the oxfordshire police were left staring at the empty sward calm down everyone nettie had taken over although lucy was contributing the most volubly to the discussion aaaarrrgh agggh she was choosing her words carefully the journalist was concentrating on controlling the craft dan was shaking ok continued nettie weve got twelve hours to find leovinus our two chances are one picking up his trail around here and two nigel nigel dans hackles were up could this wonderful woman be still thinking about that schmuck hes the one person we know was here at the site when leovinus walked off the ship he may have seen him may even know where he is now nettie youre a genius said dan aaaah ooooh lucy added i suggest you and lucy investigate around here while the here drives me to london to find nigel nettie had it all worked out within a few minutes the landing craft had deposited dan and lucy in a quiet back lane near the hotel where they had been staying and in another minute nettie and the journalist were heading for the m it began to get light as they approached the motorway we dont want the police picking us up nettie was thinking aloud wed better pretend were an ordinary car a japanese copy of something italian maybe can you drive this thing just a few inches above the ground absolutely said the journalist and he swung the craft down onto the empty broad it took him a few moments to pick up the knack of keeping it steady at such a low altitude but he was getting it and youd better cut the speed down just a tad the said nettie mph is a little fast for these bends by the time they swung out into the fast lane of the m the journalist had managed to get the craft down to a mere mph and was giving a pretty good impression of a perfectly ordinary motorcar nettie just hoped nobody would notice their lack of wheels being the rush hour most drivers werent looking where they were going as they crawled their way towards central london the finest jam however was reserved for the picturesque stretch after the uxbridge turnoff there were roadworks and the rush hour simply ground to a deadening inevitable halt purple pangalin exclaimed the journalist what sort of a transportation system dyou call this the more popular it is the slower it goes what genius worked this out he was really quite indignant well its inevitable isnt it nettie found herself being surprisingly defensive of her planets right to have traffic jams of course it isnt exploded the journalist you have to devise a system that goes faster the more popular it is so it can cope its perfectly obvious nettie was drumming her fingers on the dashboard of the landing craft and smiling at anyone who happened to give them an odd look smiling was always the best way to make them look away she was also glancing increasingly frequently at her watch time was running out the jam moved an inch nearer london i mean a transportation system with an average speed of just above stationary is not really a transportation system at all the journalist was raving by now its more like a storage system ok lets do it nettie suddenly sounded decisive ive always fantasized about this what take her up nobodys watching and sure enough when the journalist gunned the spacecraft up into the air and sped over the heads of the preceding traffic nobody seemed to notice he set the craft down again in an open space on the other side of the jam the driver of the car they landed in front of was not a happily married man he had been mulling over what would happen if his wife never returned from the skiing holiday she was currently enjoying perhaps she would run off with the instructor and breed alpine sheep and serve english teas to walkers in the summer but then there were the children hed have to get them to school every day on his own and he wouldnt be able to stay at the office after hours to chat up that new secretary at this moment a sportylooking car suddenly appeared in front of him jesus he exclaimed swerving involuntarily i didnt even notice it overtaking god the speed some people drive at it was only as the sporty car sped away in the fast lane that he noticed it didnt seem to have any wheels concentrate he told himself otherwise you start seeing things another jam brought them to a resounding halt just as they reached the westway flyover oh no groaned nettie we used to have traffic problems like this on blerontin observed the journalist several million years ago before intelligent life developed oh shut up said nettie she couldnt bear selfsatisfied aliens who couldnt see any of the good things about earth this is hopeless weve only got nine hours left where have we got to get to the earls court road nettie replied shall we take the shortcut nettie looked around there were no police cars as far as she could see and the woman in the car behind was picking her fingernails go for it she said and the craft left the flyover to the amazement of a couple of small children who were on their way to school look mum that cars flying well i never dear said their mother without taking her eyes off the hello magazine she was reading whatever will we see next nettie and the journalist swooped low over notting hill and effected a landing on the south side of holland park here they waited for their moment hopped over a closed gate and filtered into the oneway system around earls court eightthirty said nettie leaping out of the car you stay here if i know that scumbag nigel hell still be in bed she used her door key to get in and was soon racing up the stairs to nigels flat she let herself in and immediately fell over a broken ironing board that was lying across the doorway whos that called a voice from the bedroom its me yelled nettie picking herself up and striding into the bedroom the young girl with whom nigel was currently in congress tried to pretend she was merely sitting astride a pile of old laundry shit nettie exclaimed nigel making an effort to disguise himself as the pile of old laundry in question by pulling all the sheets around himself i thought youd been abducted by aliens this is important nigel nettie was straight to the point i can explain all this nigel began you see nancy heres mother died recently and ive been looking after think back nigel after the spaceship took off did you see anyone you mean like going to a psychiatrist no no trust nigel to be only thinking of himself thought nettie did you see an old man with a white beard hanging around the wreckage i think id better go said nancy who was actually nineteen but looked younger no no hang on said nigel instinctively he could see that nettie had other things on her mind than putting his balls in the toaster and he halfhoped he might be able to resume what he had been doing once hed sorted out whatever it was his exgirlfriend actually did want of him did i see what nettie was suddenly overwhelmed by the hopelessness of it all here was a whole world a whole civilization so much more advanced than her own depending on her eliciting a sensible answer from this creep whom shed once been in love with what a hope in hell she might as well try and teach turkish to the cat an old man with a white beard he was in my car i took him to the police station in oxford it took nettie a moment to realize that this was exactly the information she had come all this way to extract the moment she did nettie ran to the bed and gave nigel a smacking kiss on the lips then she gave one to nancy for good measure and the next minute she was leaping down the stone stairs of the large victorian mansion two at a time whooping the the the i think id better go said nancy she was just about to start a degree in art history leovinus had undergone a seachange for a start he had taken off his false eyebrows and stuck them on the wall of his cell just above the door but even more importantly he had spent the last week doing something that he had never really done before certainly not since he was on the verge of becoming an infant prodigy seven days in a prison cell without reading materials without any ability to communicate with others and whats more without a single admirer had forced him to take stock of himself he had spent a week looking back at his life and at the person he had become and the more he had done this the more he had become convinced that he had failed the more he looked into his own soul the more he realized how far he fell short he flinched with acute embarrassment as he remembered that last press conference how he had revelled in the sycophancy he curled up with shame as he remembered the answer he had given to that journalist who had asked if he felt responsible for the collapse of the yassaccan economy what had he said his responsibility was towards his art or something like that now as he stared round at the bare walls of his cell he realized that hed been talking through his bottom no one could hide behind the pretensions of creativity when people were actually suffering maybe even dying because of it he remembered the two cub reporters with their lovely smiles and alluring cleavages how he had felt so superior to them how hed believed deep down that no one was good enough for him now the more he looked about himself in the solitude and misery of his prison cell he felt he was not good enough for anyone else the first blerontinian who walked in through that door he began to think would have more right to freedom and happiness than he had even that dreadful gat of blerontis leovinus had been granted such wonderful gifts such fabulous unlimited gifts and what had he done with them had he made anyone else happy had he brought prosperity and peace to other worlds no as far as leovinus could see he had used his gifts almost exclusively for his own selfaggrandizement full stop it was pathetic now he looked back had he been loved had he loved and here had you been eavesdropping outside the great mans cell then you would have heard a terrible groan rise up from the greatest genius the galaxy had ever known as he remembered how his love and affection had been focussed not on a living creature not on a wife not on a lover not even on a pet snorkling but on an agglomeration of wires and neurons sensors and cybernetic pathways titania his last his greatest his absolute obsession but she loves me he cried from the depths of his despair but she is not real came an answering echo as his thoughts bounced off the bare cell walls you created her this change that overcame leovinus in his oxfordshire prison cell would be unfortunately powerful ammunition for rightwing politicians who trumpet the beneficial effects of jail fortunately however it went totally unnoticed by anyone with political clout on earth leovinus had just reached that point of selfcastigation at which he was really beginning to enjoy it when he was rudely interrupted visitors for you chang said constable hackett he had grown rather fond of the old fellow over the past week the door was flung open and the dreadful journalist entered accompanied by an extraordinarily attractive female alien all the more attractive for being dressed yassaccan style in the simple transparent shift with the single motif on the side which indicated that the wearer was unmarried and interested in proposals she was also wearing that fabulously expensive yassaccan scent that was now almost unobtainable on blerontin my dear friend exclaimed leovinus to the journalist you are far more worthy of freedom and happiness than i it was an odd thing to say to the first blerontinian to walk in through the door but leovinus who had just been thinking hed never get a chance to say it said it anyway theres not a moment to lose exclaimed the remarkably attractive and remarkably available female alien weve only got an hour left have you got it cried the journalist i dont know replied leovinus i am no longer sure what i have got and what i have not when i look back on my life i almost feel i have thrown it all away and i have been left with nothing dear lady will you marry me leovinus knew it was considered poor manners not to propose to any young female wearing the specially patterned shift have you got the central intelligence core titanias brain interposed the journalist before nettie could reply ah alas cried the great leovinus i threw it away i have no use for her now and he turned back to nettie dear lady do you think you could ever love me you cant have thrown it away screamed the remarkably attractive and available female alien think yelled the dreadful journalist where did you throw it what does it matter leovinus had grown a trifle maudlin this was actually the result of the famous yassaccan scent which the yassaccan prime minister had given nettie nettie had dabbed a spot on as they waited for the cell door to be opened it was a nervous reflex prior to meeting the greatest genius the galaxy had ever known what nettie was unaware of was that one of the reasons the scent was so famous was because it had an extremely intoxicating effect on blerontinians this intoxication was usually so sudden and so strong that the scent had been made illegal on blerontin which is of course why it was so sought after and so fabulously expensive my dear lady my life how i have longed to meet someone as beautiful and intelligent as you the journalist had now grabbed leovinus by the lapels of his prison suit where is titanias brain he yelled leovinus was rapidly deteriorating under the powerful influence of netties scent ha mr journalisto see one oh dee crank pon flee up and trick leovinus was quoting a blerontinian nonsense rhyme that was often sung to children at bedtime salk tense man shouted the journalist who had suddenly realized what kind of scent nettie was wearing svital we know where youze threw thcentral telligence core hic oh no if he got drunk he wouldnt be able to drive them back to the starship nettie he screamed quick youze gotter grout of here not on your life exclaimed nettie you think you can handle this better just cause youre a man no no m not a man that is im a blerontinian the journalist had started giggling now leovinus started too stop it cried nettie trying to shake some sense into them how can you laugh weve got to find the intelligence core where is it leovinus but the more she shook them the more the yassaccan scent wafted up from her beautiful body and blew the minds of the two blerontinians and they laughed harder and harder until tears were rolling down their cheeks the journalist started to sing an old blerontinian song about a lady acrobat and a news reporter and then collapsed on the bed finally nettie gave up in disgust she stormed out of the cell to find the desk sergeant perhaps he had titanias missing piece in safe custody the moment nettie had gone the journalist made a valiant attempt to pull himself together he managed to stop laughing with partial success and as his head began to clear he turned on leovinus and shook him until the old man regained his senses think cried the journalist even if youve never done anything decent in the whole of your wretched life do it now remember where you threw the missing bit of titanias brain this appeal could not have been more calculated to penetrate through to leovinuss great though intoxicated brain the central intelligence core titanias cerebral artery where did i throw it yes dammit man where did you throw it oh i know in the corner over there the great man pointed to a corner of the cell in a flash the journalist was there scrabbling around behind the latrine bucket and the next moment he suddenly stood up with a glowing silver shard in his hand but before he even had time to give a yell of triumph nettie appeared at the cell door were too late she announced it appears my watch must have been wrong according to the police station clock its already midday and even as she spoke they heard the bbcs pips from the superintendents radio the starship titanic would already be on its way to its graveyard in space dan and lucy had had a miserable time of it they had traipsed around the oxfordshire countryside with a growing feeling of helplessness nobody had seen any old man with a white beard nobody had heard of aliens arriving from outer space nobody wanted to know either such things didnt happen in oxfordshire finally they retraced their steps to the hotel where they had all been staying here again they had drawn a blank yes nigel had checked out that day no he had not had anybody with him no no old man with a white beard had checked in nothing zero they sat over a miserable cup of coffee and dan looked blankly at lucy she suddenly seemed so far away from him wasnt that what she had always said about him that he had seemed so far away he tried to think of all the things that had made them feel dose in the past and yet everything he thought of now appeared like a figment of his imagination like lucys enthusiasm for turning the old rectory into a hotel in a way he thought their whole relationship had probably come out of his imagination he had dreamed the whole thing up and now he was waking up nothing remained between them not even bitterness lucy watched dan brooding over his coffee and wondered if he would be all right she felt guilty she felt shed let him down but now she had discovered that there was a part of her that had been asleep all the time she had been with dan she knew there was no turning back the clock it was as if she herself had created the bond between them a bond that protected her from other stronger more frightening feelings that she was capable of but a bond that did not otherwise exist lucy put her hand on dans im sorry she said to her surprise dan looked up and smiled weve been a good team he said weve helped each other to get to where we are and now i guess were ready to move right on lucy leaned across and kissed him lightly and at that very moment nettie the journalist and leovinus walked in the door by the time they had persuaded the oxford constabulary that leovinus was not an illegal immigrant it was well after half past one oclock by the time nettie had been able to shower off all the intoxicating yassaccan perfume it was half past two and by the time they had found lucy and dan the deadline was well past they all slumped in front of their coffees and nobody said a word until nettie suddenly looked up listen said nettie its no good us all just sitting here like burnt toast i know theres not much point but i suggest we go back to where we left the starship in orbit just in case they may have left something or somebody may have got left behind or i dont know what all i know is i wont be happy until ive seen its not there you are so charming dear lady said leovinus and possess such a fine mind it would hard to say who was more jealous lucy or dan neither of them said a word however and there followed a short argument about the futileness of doing what nettie had suggested which seemed about to segue into a discussion about the futility of existence itself until nettie cut it short well im going will you take me the strangely enough they all felt more cheerful as they took off in the tiny landing craft the illusion of doing something no matter how useless is always good for the psyche they roared up into the stratosphere and there with the earth rolling beneath them a wonderful ball of real life they suddenly saw another even more wonderful sight an astonishing sight a sight that made them cheer and shout and kiss each other and dan found himself kissing nettie and being kissed back by nettie and then kissing nettie again and then she was kissing old leovinus and dan reminded himself that she had rejected him before and there was no point in being hurt again and then he suddenly remembered the sight the wonderful sight that had made them all cheer and start kissing each other in the first place over the earths glowing blue and white shoulder heaved the immense and fabulous shape of the starship titanic of course yelled nettie were idiots captain bolfass said we had half a day but he was talking about dormillion days she checked her watch weve still got twenty minutes to go leovinus gazed into her beautiful face her eyelids fluttered and slowly she opened her lovely eyes and gazed back at him he had slipped the missing cerebral artery the central intelligence core into titanias brain as gently as he could he knew the shudder of life that would run through her would bring both joy and pain as unused neurons and dormant cybernetic pathways pulsed into new life titania whispered the old man i still love you nettie dan and the others gasped as the beautiful creature raised her head off the floor leant up on one elbow and then her hair spilling around her shoulders rose majestically powerfully and sat as she had always been designed to sit with her chin resting thoughtfully upon her hand titania had come to life and the starship titanic was finally complete at once nettie felt a change in the starship as if a powerful and benign presence were watching over them all a presence that was hugely intelligent kind wise caring serene warm nettie squeezed dans hand dan she said would you kiss me again and that really is the end of the story captain bolfass lucy and the journalist were able to disarm the bomb as soon as titania came to life much to the bombs relief it had never really wanted to explode the grateful yassaccans offered dan nettie lucy and the journalist shares in the starship as a reward for their part in saving it they also invited lucy and dan to run it as a hotel dan bowed out gracefully he wanted to stay on earth he said and so lucy and the journalist became the proprietors of the starship titanic hotel inc the most hugely successful luxury holiday enterprise in the entire galaxy and one which put the yassaccan economy back on its feet within the first year of operation the yassaccans returned to their peaceful prosperous way of life and craftsmanship and celebrated the starship with a fullscale statue in the main square of yassaccanda lucy and the journalist were married with elaborate ceremonies both here on earth and on blerontin he wrote up his story and it became the scoop of the century and made him so much money that he was able to give up journalism entirely and devote himself to more useful things being no longer a journalist of course also meant that he was able to tell lucy his true name which turned out to be tiddlepuss so she called him tiddles and that suited lucy just fine but he would never ever tell her what lucy meant in blerontinian leovinus got over his momentary passion for nettie which had been partly brought on by his recent selfexamination and also by the intoxicating effects of her perfume he spent an increasing amount of time chatting to titania in her private chamber he knew she wasnt real but then he had begun to think that perhaps he was too old for reality anyway the greatest genius the galaxy had ever known regained a certain amount of his old selfconfidence but friends and admirers found him humbler and more sensitive to the needs of others perhaps it was titanias influence perhaps it was the fact that his eyebrows had grown back the good captain bolfass on the other hand never really got over his infatuation for nettie although his wife bought him herbal remedies and embrocations for the purpose but the thought of nettie kept him going in the dark watches of space and enriched his declining years with a golden glow of tragic devotion in fact there were a great many yassaccans who felt the same way about nettie the yassaccans you see were the sort of people who could recognize a hugely intelligent kind wise caring serene and warm being when they met one for real nettie herself couldnt believe her luck when lucy went off and married the journalist she immediately felt free to propose to dan and he couldnt believe his luck either the two of them became not only lovers but best friends nettie took a degree in higher mathematics and was able to help old leovinus on some of his later works she made so much money out of this that she and dan were able to rebuild the old rectory and turn it into a relaxed family hotel specializing in central galactic cuisine in the entrance hall visiting yassaccan parents would point out to their children the famous framed photograph which bore the inscription dan and netties hotel beneath the stars and the parrot the parrot probably came out best of all in parrot terms it had in fact been acting as an undercover agent for the yassaccans all along it had been smuggled on board the starship titanic before the removal to blerontin the parrot had performed heroically risking life and feathers to get reports of the scandalously shoddy construction of the starship back to yassacca it had in fact been the source of all the rumours that had been circulating when the parrot eventually returned to its hometown on yassacca it was given a special golden perch and a medal specially created for it as the first parrot on yassacca to be decorated for bravery and service to the planet it was also given a lifetime supply of millet seed and pistachio nuts it mated shortly after and became the proud mother of four baby parrots whom it named dan nettie lucy and the
