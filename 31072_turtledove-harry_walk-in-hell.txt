harry turtledove walk in hell who are these why sit they here in twilight wherefore rock they purgatorial shadows drooping tongues from jaws that slob their relish baring teeth that leer like skulls teeth wicked stroke on stroke of painbut what slow panic gouged these chasms round their fretted sockets ever from their hair and through their hands palms misery swelters surely we have perished sleeping and walk in hell but who these hellish wilfred owens mental cases george enos looked across the mississippi toward illinois the river was wide but not wide enough to let him forget it was only a river here in st louis he was beyond any possible doubt in the middle of the continent that felt very strange to him hed lived his whole life all twentynine years of it in boston and gone out fishing on the atlantic ever since he was old enough to run a razor over his cheeks hed kept right on going out to fish even after the usa went to war with the confederate states and canada all part of the worldwide war with germany and austria battling england france and russia while probritish argentina fought us allies chile and paraguay in south america and every ocean turned into a battle zone if a confederate commerce raider hadnt intercepted the steam trawler ripple and sunk it george knew hed still be a fisherman today but he and the rest of the crew had been captured and being civilian detainees rather than prisoners of war eventually exchanged for similar confederates in us hands he had joined the navy then partly in hopes of revenge partly to keep from being conscripted into the army and sent off to fight in the trenches theyd even let him operate out of boston for a while on a trawler that had gone hunting for enemy vessels with a submarine pulled on a long tow hed helped sink a confederate submersible too but the publicity that came from success made any future success unlikely and so instead of his being able to see his wife and children when he wasnt at sea and to work like a fisherman when he was theyd put him on a train and sent him to st louis he called up to the deck officer aboard the river monitor uss punishment permission to come aboard sir granted lieutenant michael kelly said and enos hurried up the gangplank and onto his ship he saluted the thirtyfourstar flag rippling in the breeze at the stern of the punishment kelly waited till he had performed the ritual then said take your station enos were going to steam south as soon as we have the full crew aboard aye aye sir enos said because he was still new to the navy and its ways he hadnt lost the habit of asking questions of his superiors whats going on sir seems like everybodys getting pulled on board at once from some officers a query like that might have drawn a sharp reprimand kelly though understood that the expanded navy of was not the tightknit professional force it had been before the war began the formal mask of duty on his face cracked to reveal an exuberant grin that suddenly made him look much younger like enos he was tanned and lined and chapped from endless exposure to sun and wind he said whats up ill tell you whats up sailor the niggers down in the csa have risen up against the government there thats what if the rebs dont put em down theyre sunk but while theyre busy doing that how much attention can they pay to us you see what im saying yes sir i sure do enos answered mind you kelly said i havent got any great use for niggers myselfwhat white man does and if the scuttlebutt is the straight goods a lot of these niggers are reds too and you know what i dont care they foul up the rebels so we can lick em they can fly all the red flags they want yes sir george said again after the commerce raider snagged him hed been interned in north carolina for several months hed seen the kind of treatment negroes got in the csa technically they were free theyd been free for more than thirty years butif i was one of those negroes sir and i saw a chance to take a shot at a confederatea white confederate i meanid grab it in a second so would i kelly said so would anybody with any balls who would have thought niggers had balls though he turned away from enos as a couple of other sailors reported back aboard the punishment the river monitor was in the immortal words that had described the first of her kind a cheesebox on a raft she carried a pair of sixinch guns in an armored turret mounted on a low wide ironclad hull she also had several machine guns mounted on deck for land targets not worth the fury of guns that could have gone to sea aboard a light cruiser enos had been a fisherman which meant he was adept at dealing with lines and nets and steam engines even if the one the ripple had carried was a toy beside the punishments power plant having made use in his first assignment of the things he knew the navy plainly figured it had done its duty and could now return to its normal mode of operation his station on the punishment was at one of those deck machine guns he minded it less than hed thought he would any new england fisherman worthy of the name was a born tinker and tinkerer hed learned to strip and clean and reassemble the machine gun till he could do it with his eyes closed it was an elegantly simple means of killing large numbers of men in a hurry assuming that was what you wanted to do at kellys shouted orders sailors unfastened the ropes binding the punishment to the pier black coal smoke pouring from her twin stacks the monitor edged out into the mississippi the first hundred miles or so of the journey down the river as far as cairo illinois were a shakedown through country that had always belonged to the usa nobody got to relax though shakedown or no kelly shouted keep your eyes peeled dammit they say rebs sneak up from arkansas and dump mines in the river every so often usually theyre full of malarkey when they say something but we dont want to find out the hard way now do we along with everyone else george enos peered out at the muddy water he was used to the idea of mines boston harbor had been surrounded by ring upon ring of minefields to make sure no canucks or rebs or limeys paid an unexpected and unwelcome visit he didnt see any mines now but he hadnt seen any then either a little north of cairo they took a pilot on board the spray the steam trawler that had acted as a decoy for entente warships had done the same thing coming back into boston after a mission here as there the pilot guided the vessel through a us minefield the confederacy had gunboats of its own on the mississippi though it didnt call them monitors which had to be kept from steaming upstream and bombarding us positions and supply lines when sunset came the punishment anchored on the river the missouri ozarks on one side kentucky on the other kentucky was a confederate state but most of it including that part lying along the mississippi lay in us hands over fried catfish and beans belowdecks enos said when i got transferred here i thought wed be going down the river looking for rebel ships heading up and wed have a hell of a fight thats what you read about in the newspapers back in boston anyway it happens said wayne pitchess the closest friend hed made on the punishment a former fisherman from connecticut though hed joined the navy back in peacetime pitchess scratched at his mustache before going on like george he wore it kaiser billstyle with waxed points jutting upward but his was blond rather than dark it does happen he repeated it just doesnt happen very often good thing it doesnt happen very often too added sherwood mckenna who was the third man in the tier of bunks with george and pitchess monitors can sink each other in a godawful hurry george enos took a swig of coffee it was vile stuff but that wasnt the cooks fault the empire of brazil which produced more coffee than the rest of the world put together had remained neutral that meant both the entente and the quadruple alliance went after its shipping with great enthusiasm most of the other coffeegrowing countries were in the entente camp not even the finest cook in the world could have done much with the beans that had gone into this pot well if we dont fight other monitors much george said setting down his mug what do we do bombard enemy land positions mostly pitchess answered moving sixinch guns down a river is easy hauling them crosscountry is anything but and were a harder target to hit back at than guns on land too because we can move around easier and because were armored enos added that doesnt hurt sherwood mckenna agreed another monitor can smash us up but we just laugh at those little fastfiring threeinch field guns the rebs use lots of difference between a threeinch shrapnel shell and a six or eightincher with an armorpiercing tip lifting the coffee mug again this time as if to make a toast with it george said heres hoping we never find out what the difference is both his bunkmates drank to that sleeping belowdecks was stifling especially in the top bunk which enos as a newcomer aboard the punishment had inherited sometime in the middle of the night though a couple of the deck machine guns began to hammer waking up everyone who was asleep george didnt stay awake long as soon as he figured out the shooting wasnt aimed directly at him he rolled overcarefully so as not to fall out of the narrow bunkand started sawing wood again next morning he found out somebody on the kentucky shore had fired a machine gun at the punishment hoping to pick off someone on deck or in the cabin wayne pitchess took that in stride he didnt hurt us and we probably didnt hurt him he said around a mouthful of sausage thats the kind of war i like to fight cautiously the punishment pushed farther down the river now tennessee lay to port they steamed past the ruins of a confederate fort that had mounted guns able to sink a battleship let alone a river monitor more such forts still untaken lay farther south on the stretches of the mississippi it owned the usa had its share of them too they were another reason combats between monitors were scarce enos eyed the woods running down to the river us forces were supposed to have cleared away all the rebs but the exchange of fire the night before showed that wasnt so he wondered how he would get any sign of the enemy or for that matter of the negroes who had rebelled against the confederacy all he saw were trees he saw a hell of a lot of trees he was used to the cramped confines of massachusetts where everything was jammed up against everything else it wasnt like that here the land was wide and people thin on the ground with a low rumble the turret of the punishment began to revolve the guns rose slightly george had never heard them fired before he braced himself bracing himself wasnt enough the roar seemed like the end of the world sheets of golden flame spat from the guns muzzles one of them blew a perfect smoke ring as he might have done with a cigar only a hundred times bigger his ears still ringing he watched the gun barrels rise again an even smaller movement than they had made before they salvoed once more he couldnt tell where the shells were coming down someone evidently could though and was letting the punishment know perhaps by wireless that repositioning must have been what was wanted for the twin sixinchers fired again and again somewhere miles inside tennessee the shells were creating a good approximation of hell here they were just creating an ungodly racket after a while the bombardment stopped the gunners came out on deck it had probably been hell inside the turret too they stripped off their sweatsoaked uniforms and jumped naked into the river where they proceeded to try to drown one another it was george enos thought a strange way to fight a war anne colleton gunned the vauxhall prince henry up the robert e lee highway from charleston south carolina toward her plantation marshlands outside the little town of st matthews the motorcar hit a pothole her teeth came together in a sharp click the socalled highway like all roads outside the cities was nothing but dirt even with a lap robe and a broadbrimmed hat with a veil anne was caked with redbrown dust she supposed she should count herself lucky she hadnt had a puncture shed already repaired two since leaving charleston punctures she shook her head punctures are nothing she counted herself lucky to be alive with a dashing submersible commander shed been at a rather seedy hotel near the edge of one of charlestons negro districts when the riot or uprising or whatever it was broke out theyd piled into the vauxhall and escaped just ahead of the baying mob shed delivered roger kimball back to the harbor and then not bothering to get the bulk of her belongings out of the much finer hotel where she was registered shed headed for home down the road toward her filling up most of it came a wagon pulled by a horse and a mule and filled to overflowing with white men women and childrenseveral families packed together unless she missed her guess she stepped on the brake hard as she could the vauxhall came to a shuddering stop its sixtyhorsepower engine could hurl it forward at a mile a minutethough not on the robert e lee highwaybut slowing down was another matter some of the whites wore bandages some of those rusty with old blood over the growl of the motorcars engine anne called whats it like up ahead its bad maam the graybeard at the reins answered tipping his battered straw hat to herhe could see she was a person of consequence even if he didnt know just who she was were lucky we got out alive and thats a fact the woman beside him nodded vehemently you ought to turn around your ownself she added niggers up further north they gone crazy they got guns some kind of crazy way and they got red flags flyin and sure as jesus theyre gonna kill any whites they can catch red flags anne said and heads bobbed up and down again in the wagon her lips moved in a silent curse her brother tom a confederate major had said earlier in the year there were red revolutionaries among the negro laborers in the army shed scoffed at the idea that such radicals might also have gained a foothold at marshlands now fear clawed her her other brother jacob was back at the mansion an invalid since the yankees had gassed him within an inch of his life shed thought it surely safe to leave him for a few days the fellow in the straw hat tipped it again then guided his mismatched team off the road so the wagon could get around the automobile as soon as she had the room she put the vauxhall in gear and zoomed forward again along with other innovations shed had a rearview mirror installed on the motorcar looking into it she saw faces staring after her from the wagon as she drove toward trouble rather than away from it every so often trees shaded the road something dangled from an overhanging branch of one of them she slowed down again it was the body of a lynched negro a placard tied round his neck said this is if we ketch you he wore only a pair of ragged drawers what had been done to him before he was hanged wasnt pretty anne bit her lip she prided herself on being a modern woman on being able to take on the world straight up and come out ahead regardless of her sex outdealing men had made her richwell richer since she was born far from poor but business was one thing this brutality something else again and what were the negroes the reds doing in whatever landsnot marshlands surelytheyd seized in their revolt how many old scores going back how many hundred years were they repaying as much to escape questions like that as to get away from the tormented corpse around which flies were already buzzing anne drove off fast enough to press herself back into the seat perhaps a mile farther up the road she came to another tree with dreadful fruit the first had shocked her because of its savagery the second also shocked her mostly by how little feeling it roused in her this is how men get used to war she thought and shivered though the day was warm and muggy more like august than late october she drove past a burntout farmhouse from which smoke was still rising it hadnt been much of a place she wondered whether blacks or poor whites had lived there nobody lived there now or would any time soon more traffic coming south slowed her progress the road wasnt wide whenever her motorcar drew near someone coming in the opposite direction somebody had to go off onto the shoulder to get around wagons buggies carts occasional motorcars came past her all of them loaded with women children and old men most of the young men were at the front fighting against the usa anne needed a while to wonder how widespread in the confederacy the uprising was and what it would do to the fight against the united states confederate forces had been hardpressed to hold their ground before could they go on holding with rebellion in their rear we licked the damnyankees in the war of secession she said as if someone had denied it we licked em again in the second mexican war twenty years later we can do it one more time she came up behind a truck rumbling along toward the north its canvascanopied bed packed with uniformed militiamen some wore butternut some the oldfashioned gray that had been banished from frontline use because it was too much like yankee greengray a lot of the militiamen wore beards or mustaches all of those were grayexcept the ones that were white but the men carried bayoneted rifles and looked to know what to do with them against a rabble of negroes what more would they need they waved to her when she drove past she waved back glad to do anything to cheer them then she had to slow almost to a crawl behind a battery of half a dozen horsedrawn cannons those couldnt have come close to matching her vauxhalls speed under the best of circumstances and circumstances were anything but the best the guns had to fight their way forward against the stream of refugees fleeing the revolt some of the southbound wagons and motorcars had negroes in them a scattering of black faces among the white anne guessed they were servants and field hands whod stayed loyal to their employers masters wasnt the right word though some people persisted in using it more than a generation after manumission she was glad to see those few black facesthey gave her hope for marshlandsbut she wished shed spotted more truck farms abounded all around the little town of holly hill about halfway between charleston and st matthews the farms seemed to have come through pretty well not much was left of the town a lot of it had burned bullet holes pocked the surviving walls here and there bodies white and black lay unburied a faint stench of meat going bad hung in the air buzzards wheeled optimistically high overhead anne wished she could have got out of holly hill in a hurry but rubble in the road made traffic pack together a gang of negro laborers was clearing the debris that was nothing out of the ordinary the uniformed whites covering them with tredegar rifles though a couple of miles north of holly hill a middleaged white man whose belly was about to burst the bounds of his butternut uniform stepped out into the road rifle in hand and stopped her we aint lettin folks go any further northn this maam he said aint safe aint nowhere near safe you dont understand im anne colleton of marshlands she said confident he would know who she was and what that meant he did gulping a little he said id like to help you maam by which he undoubtedly meant i dont want to get into trouble with you maam but he went on i got my orders from major hotchkiss thoughno civilians goin up this road them niggers they got a regular front set up they been plannin this a long time the sons of bitches uh pardon my french shed been saying a lot worse than that herself where do i find this major hotchkiss so i can talk some sense into him she demanded the confederate militiaman pointed west down a rutted dirt track less than half as wide as the robert e lee highway theres a church up that way maybe a quarter mile reckon hell be up in the steeple trying to spot what the damn niggers is doin she drove the vauxhall down the road hed shown her if she didnt find the church she intended to try to make her way north by whatever back roads she could find this major hotchkiss might have banned northbound civilian traffic from the highway but maybe he hadnt said anything about other ways of getting where she still aimed to go but there stood the church a white clapboard building with a tall steeple white men in butternut uniforms and old gray ones milled around outside they all looked her way as she drove up im looking for major hotchkiss she called im jerome hotchkiss one of the men in butternut said sure enough he wore a single gold star on each collar tab he didnt look too superannuated then anne saw he had a hook in place of his left hand that would have left him unfit for frontline duty but not for an emergency like this he nodded to her what is it you want im anne colleton she said again and caused another stir she went on your sentry back by the highway said you were the man who could give me permission to keep going north toward marshlands my plantation if any man could do that i would be the one major hotchkiss agreed i have to tell you though its impossible you must understand we are not trying to put down a riot up ahead it is a war nothing less the enemy has rifles he has machine guns he has men who will use them and he has a fanatical willingness to die for his cause however vile it is no you dont understand anne said i have to get back to the plantation my brother is an invalid the damnyankees gassed him this past spring do you know if marshlands is safe i tried to telephone from charleston but specifically no hotchkiss answered and most telephone lines are down as you will have found i can tell you this though its not safe to be whiteunless youre also a red and there are a few like that the swinebetween here and columbia like i say maam we have ourselves a war here in fact he stopped looking at her and started looking at the vauxhall im going to ask you to step out of that motorcar if you dont mind what i certainly do mind maam i am confiscating your motorcar in the name of the confederate states of america hotchkiss said this is a military area i have that right the vehicle will be returned to you at the end of this emergency if for any reason it cannot be returned you will be compensated as required by law when anne not believing what she was hearing made no move to get out the major snapped potter harris two of his men trained rifles on her this is an outrage she exclaimed the soldiers faces were implacable if she didnt get out they would shoot her that was quite plain quivering with fury she descended to the ground major hotchkiss pointed farther up the road theres a crossroads general store up there weve got a fair number of folks in tents already its about half a mile you go on miss colleton theyll take care of you best they can we smash this colored socialist republic or whatever the niggers are calling it then we can get on with the fight against the damnyankees give me a rifle anne said suddenly im a good shot and im a lot less likely to fall over dead than half your socalled soldiers here but the confederate major shook his head without a word she knew she was right but what good did that do her if he wouldnt listen the answer tolled in her mind none dully she began walking up the road when war reached out its hand what did wealth and power matter a fool with a gun could take them away a fool with a gun had just taken them away major irving morrell and captain john abell took off their caps when they went into independence hall to see the liberty bell philadelphia being the headquarters of the war department was full of us military men of all ranks and branches of service only someone very observant would have noted the twisted blackandgold cords on the caps that marked these two as general staff officers abell who had a bookish look to him fit the common preconception for the appearance of a general staff man morrell though was more weathered his face lined and tanned though he was only in his midtwenties he wore his sandy hair cropped close to his head as field officers commonly did he felt like a field officer hed been a field officer hed almost lost a leg in the us invasion of confederate sonora and then after a long recuperation hed led a battalion in eastern kentucky what hed done there had impressed his division commander enough to get him sent to philadelphia intellectually he knew what a plum this was it didnt altogether fill him with joy though he wanted to be out in the forest or the mountains or tramping through the desertsomewhere away from the city and close to the foe come on lets get moving he said now and hurried ahead of abell to get a good look at the liberty bell his thigh pained him when he sped up like that and would probably go on paining him the rest of his life he ignored it you could let something like that rule you or you could rule it morrell did not aim to let anything keep him from doing what he wanted to do its been here a long time major abell said its going to be here for a long time yet yes but im not going to be here for a long time morrell answered when hed learned enough or so the promise had gone theyd promote him and send him back to the field to command a unit bigger than a battalion i want to fight with guns not with maps and dividers and a telegraph clicker he looked back over his shoulder as he said that just in time to catch the sidelong glance abell gave him the captain like most general staff officers preferred fighting the war at a distance and in the abstract to the reality of mud and bad food and wounds and terror battle always seemed so much cleaner so much neater when it was red and blue lines on a chart then such thoughts left morrells mind as with a good many other soldiers he crowded round the emblem of freedom for the united states the surface of the bell was surprisingly rough testimony to the imperfect skill of the founders who had cast it around the crown ran the words from leviticus that had given the bell its name proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof he wondered whether robert e lee had seen the liberty bell when he occupied philadelphia in lees victories had given the confederate states a liberty the usa had not wanted to grant them but he hadnt taken the bell back south with him that was something albeit not much morrell reached out and touched the cool metal were still free he murmured still free by god thats right john abell said beside him the freest nation on the face of the earth normally coldblooded as a lizard in a blizzard he sounded genuinely moved by the liberty bell then almost gloating he added and were going to pay the rebs back for all theyve done to us these past fifty years and the english and the french and the canadians too youd best believe it morrell said and took his hand away the metal of the bell had grown warm under his fingers he smiled enjoying the idea that he had had a connection with history no sooner had he stepped back from the bell than a freshfaced lieutenant came up and caressed its smooth curves with almost a lovers touch independence hall also boasted a facsimile of the declaration of independence facsimiles though meant little to morrell what was real counted if you wanted to be theoreticalyou belonged on the general staff he snorted amused by the conceit whats funny sir captain abell asked morrell just smiled and shook his head not wanting to insult his companion they walked up chestnut back toward the war department offices that had swallowed so much of franklin square philadelphia buzzed with all sorts of federal activity especially after the confederate bombardment of washington during the second mexican war the pennsylvania city had become the de facto capital of the usa that was as well for washington now lay under the bootheels of the rebels the opening confederate attack in the war had been aimed at philadelphia too but was stopped at the susquehanna one river short of the delaware here and there buildings bore scars from confederate bombing raids these days with the rebels pushed back into maryland bombing aeroplanes came over more rarely even so antiaircraft cannon poked watchful snouts into the air in parks and at street corners abell bought a couple of cinnamon rolls a philadelphia specialty from a street vendor he offered one to morrell who shook his head i dont want anything that sweet he said half a block later he came upon a greek selling grape leaves stuffed with spicy meat and rice to make them easier to handle the fellow had skewered them on sticks morrell bought three heres a proper lunch he declared he and abell both slowed down to eat as they walked they hadnt gone far when someone behind them shouted get the hell out of here you stinking wog this is a white mans town morrell turned on his heel abell imitating him a beefy middleaged civilian was shaking his finger in the greek foodsellers face ignoring the twinge in his bad leg morrell walked rapidly back toward them as he drew near he saw the beefy man wore a pin in his lapel a silver circle with a sword set slantwise across it soldiers circle members made up a sort of informal militia of men who had served out their terms of conscription they were perhaps the leading patriotic organization in the country especially to hear them talk a lot of them of course the younger ones had been reconscripted since the war broke out others had proved useful in other ways serving as additions to the new york city police for instance after the mormons and socialists had touched off the remembrance day riots this past spring and some of them like this chap liked to throw their weight around sir why dont you just leave this man alone morrell said the words were polite the tone was anything but at his side captain abell nodded hes a damned foreigner the soldiers circle man exclaimed hes almost certainly not a citizen he doesnt look like he ought to be a citizen the stinking wog are you a citizen he demanded of the greek not your gamemeno business what i am the foodseller answered bolder than he had been before he had anyone on his side you see he doesnt hardly speak english the soldiers circle man said ought to put him in a leaky boat and ship him back to where he came from i got son in army the greek shook his finger at the fellow who was harassing him in army to do fighting not to play games like you was paul is sergeanti bet you never got no stripes the soldiers circle man went bright red morrell would have bet that meant the greek had scored a bullseye why dont you take yourself somewhere else morrell told the dedicated patriot muttering under his breath the corpulent fellow did depart looking angrily back over his shoulder morrell and abell waved off the foodsellers thanks and headed up chestnut again toward the war department those soldiers circle men can be arrogant bastards abell said he was treating that fellow like he was a nigger not just a dago or whatever the hell he is yeah morrell said and a confederate nigger at that he checked himself the other side to that coin is the niggers down in the csa are giving the white folks there a surprise or two youre right abell said now what we have to do is see how we can best take advantage of it morrell nodded taking advantage of the enemy didnt come easy not when machine guns knocked down advances before they could get movingassuming artillery hadnt already done that before soldiers ever came out of the trenches he sighed an awful lot of us officersincluding as far as he was concerned too many on the general staffdidnt maybe couldnt think past slamming straight at the rebs and overwhelming them by sheer weight of numbers the usa had the numbers using them effectively was proving to be a horse of another color you went into general staff headquarters through what looked like and once had been a millionaires mansion morrell had always doubted that that fooled the confederate spies surely haunting philadelphia but nobodyd asked his opinion inside a soberfaced sergeant checked his identification and abells with meticulous care comparing photographs to faces bureaucracy in action morrell thought the noncom saw them every day after gaining permission to enter the sanctum they went into the map room abell pointed to the map of utah where us forces had finally pushed the mormon rebels out of salt lake city and back toward ogden that was your doing more than anyone else he said to morrell half admiring half suspicious tr listened to me morrell said with a shrug instead of straightahead slugging he urged attacks through the wasatch mountains and from the north to make the mormons have to do several things at the same time with inadequate resources hed proposed that to the brass on arriving here theyd ignored him a chanced meeting with the president had revived the plan unlike a lowly major tr could make the general staff listen instead of trying without any luck to persuade it except for the soldiers actually fighting there and perhaps except for the resentment higherups in the general staff might show against him for being right utah was old news now anyhow morrell looked at a new map one that had gone up only a few days before on it the confederacy especially from south carolina through louisiana seemed to have broken out in a bad case of the measles or maybe even smallpox he pointed to the indications of insurrection the rebs will have a jolly time fighting their own negroes and us too he said thats the idea john abell said both men smiled well pleased with the world scipio was not used to wearing the coarse colorless homespun shirt and trousers of a negro laborer as butler at the marshlands mansion hed put on formal wear suitable for a confederate senator in richmond save only that his vest was striped and his buttons made of brass he wasnt used to sleeping in a blanket on the ground either or to eating whatever happened to come into his hands or to going hungry a lot of the time but he would never be butler at marshlands again the mansion had gone up in flames at the start of the marxist revoltthe mostly black revoltagainst the confederate states if the congaree socialist republic failed scipio would never be anything again except a stinking corpse and then whitening bones hanging from a tree branch the headquarters of the congaree socialist republic kept moving as the confederates brought pressure to bear against now one now another of its fluid borders at the moment the red flags with the broken chains in black flew over a nameless crossroads not far north of holly hill south carolina cassius came up to scipio cassius had worn homespun all his life and a shapeless floppy hat to go with it he had been the chief hunter at marshlands and alsothough scipio hadnt known of it till after the war with the usa began and had learned only by accident thenthe chief red now he styled himself the chairman of the republic how you is kip he asked the dialect of the congaree thick as jambalaya in his mouth but he did not think the way white folks thought their negroes thought got we anudder one fo revolutionary justice you is one o de judges where he is scipio asked when talking with his fellows he used the congaree dialect too when talking with whites he spoke standard english better than almost any of them that had already proved useful to the congaree socialist republic and likely would again here he come cassius answered and sure enough two young stalwart black men were hustling along a short plump white his white linen suit was stained with smoke and grass several days of stubble blurred the outlines of what had been a neat white goatee in formal tones cassius declared de peasants an workers o de congaree socialist republic charges jubal marberry here wid ownin a plantation an wid sploitin an pressin he workers on itan wid bein a fat man livin off what dey does two others came up beside scipio to hear the case not that there was much case to hear at one of these revolutionary tribunals one was a woman named cherry from marshlands whose screams had helped touch off the rebellion there the other was a big man named agamemnon who had labored at marberrys plantation he spoke to his former bossprobably his former owner too since like scipio he was past thirty you got anything to say befo the cot pass sentence on you marberry was old and more than a little deaf agamemnon had to repeat the question when he did the white man showed he had spirit left whatever you do to me theyll hang you higher than haman and better than you deserve too what is de verdict cassius asked no one bothered with witnesses for the defense or for the prosecution either the three judges walked off a few feet and spoke in low voices aint no reason to waste no time on he agamemnon said he guilty the old bastard we give he what he deserve cherry said with venomous relish scipio didnt say anything hed been in several of these trials and hadnt said much at any of them hed never intended to be a revolutionaryit was either that though or die for knowing too much he had no love for white folks but he had no love for savagery either his silence didnt matter had he voted for acquittal the other two would have outvoted himand odds were he soon would have faced revolutionary justice himself after such an unreliable act hed survived so far by keeping quiet he hoped he could keep right on surviving agamemnon and cherry turned back toward cassius they both nodded so did scipio a moment later cassius said jubal marberry you is guilty of the crime of pression gainst the proletariat of the congaree socialist republic de punishment is death marberry cursed at him and tried to kick one of the men who held him they dragged the planter off behind some trees a pistol shout sounded and then a moment later another one the two negroes came out jubal marberry didnt with considerable satisfaction cassius nodded to the impromptu court you done fine he told them agamemnon and cherry headed off both of them obviously wellpleased with themselves scipio started to leave too one of these days he was going to let his feelings show on his face despite the butlers mask of imperturbability he cultivated that would be the end of him even as he turned though cassius said you wait kip what you want scipio did his best to sound easy and relaxed the congaree socialist republic went after enemies of the revolution within its own ranks as aggressively as it pursued them among the whites who had for so long oppressed and battened on the negro laborers of the area but cassius said gwine have we a parley wid de white folks officer we trade de wounded white folks sojers we catches fode niggers dey gives we you gwine talk wid de officer his long weathered face stretched into lines of anticipatory glee scipio didnt need long to figure out why with a deliberate effort of will he abandoned the congaree dialect i suppose you will expect me to speak in this fashion thereby disconcerting them cassius laughed and slapped his knee do jesus yes he exclaimed you set your mind to it you talk fanciern any o they white folks an you don git angried up in a hurry neither we wants a cool head an you got dat when we do dis parley scipio asked right now i take you up to de front cassius reached into his pocket pulled out a red bandanna and tied it around scipios left upper arm dere now you official no doubt because the confederacy if you looked at it from the right angle was nothing but an elaborate hierarchy of ranks and privileges the congaree socialist republic acted as if such matters did not exist the revolution was about equality the front was just that a series of trenches and firing pits both the black soldiers of the socialist republic and their confederate foes were in large measure amateurs but both sides were doing their best to imitate what the professionals from the csa and usa had been doing cassius took scipio to a tent where the white officer waited aint gwine let you cross out of de country we holds he said caint trust white folks not to keep you an give you a rope necktie considering what had just happened to jubal marberry and to many others scipio reckoned the barbarism equally distributed saying so however struck him as inexpedient and he knew he should have been grateful that cassius worried about his safety rather than planning to liquidate him the tent was butternut canvas captured confederate army issue scipio pulled the flap open ducked his head and went inside a man in confederate uniform sat behind a folding table he did not stand up for scipio as he would have on meeting a us officer during a parley good day scipio said as if greeting a guest at marshlands shall we discuss this matter in a civilized fashion as it involves the wellbeing of brave men from both sides sure enough the confederate majors eyebrows rose he wasnt a graybearded relic like a lot of the men the csa was using to try to suppress the revolution scipio judged he would have been fighting the yankees if he hadnt lost a hand dont you talk pretty he said and then as if making a great concession all right im jerome hotchkiss i can treat for confederate forces along this front you can do the same for your people that is correct major scipio answered for the purposes of this meeting you may address me as spartacus hotchkiss let out a bark of laughter all you damn red niggers use that for an alias best guess i can give about why is that maybe you reckon we wont know who to hang once weve put you down if thats what you think youre dreaming scipio feared the major was right showing that fear though would put him in cassius bad graces cassius being more immediately dangerous to him than were the forces of the csa he said i suggest major that it is wise to kill your bear before you speak of skinning him you want to watch the way you talk to me hotchkiss said as if rebuking a negro waiter at a restaurant major you would be well advised to remember that you are in the sovereign territory of the congaree socialist republic scipio returned hotchkiss glared at him he looked back steadily the shoe was on the other foot now and the white man didnt care for the fit scipio understood that hed spent his whole life not caring for the fit he said shall we agree to put other matters aside for the time being in the hopes of coming to terms on this one specific issue fair enough hotchkiss said making a visible effort to control himself some of our wounded who got left behind when we had to pull backwhen we advanced again we found em chopped to bits or burned alive orhell i dont need to go on you know what im talking about i also know that your forces are seldom in the habit of taking prisoners of any kind wounded or not scipio answered how many negroes have been hanged these past days plainly the thought in hotchkiss mind was not enough negroes caught in arms against the confederate states of america scipio surprised him by interrupting lackeys of the oppressors caught in arms resisting the proletarian revolution of the congaree socialist republic the marxist rhetoric hed learned from cassius came in handy here no matter how low his opinion of it commonly was he went on our causes being as repugnant to each other as they are is it not all the more important to observe the laws of war with especial care thatd mean admitting you have the right to rebel hotchkiss said but scipio shook his head the usa did not admit the csa had that right in the war of secession yet treated confederate prisoners humanely he could see hotchkiss thinking white men on both sides but the major didnt say that what he did say was maybe taking that for assent scipio said very well we undertake to exchange under flag of truce men too badly wounded to go on fighting at a place and time you may choose said men to have been treated as well as possible by the side capturing them is it agreed agreed hotchkiss said but only as a war measure it doesnt mean we say you have any right to do what youre doing after we smash you youll still hang for rebellion and treason first catch the bear major scipio answered hed done what cassius wanted he thought it would bring some good how much for how long he wished he knew how the revolution fared across the rest of the confederacy the adobe farmhouse outside bountiful utah sat on a low rise so that it commanded the ground in front of it the mormon rebels against the authority of the united states had had months of hard fighting in which to learn their craft theyd learned it all too well as far as paul mantarakis was concerned when they found a position like this they fortified it for everything it was worth then stayed in it and fought sometimes men and women both until us forces finally overwhelmed them a machine gun inside the farmhouse opened up spitting death down at the trenches mantarakis and his comrades had dug he ducked making sure the top of his head was below the level of the parapet the fancy new helmet he wore didnt keep out direct hits people had found out about that the hard way he waited till the machine guns fire was directed elsewhere along the trench then stood up on the firing step and popped a couple of rounds from his springfield at the adobe he didnt think they were likely to accomplish much the mud brick in a lot of these utah farmhouses was thick enough to stop a bullet though it had been intended to keep out heat and cold not flying lead and for good measure the mormons had put up corrugated iron sheets over the windows turning them into firstrate firing slits ben carlton came up to mantarakis hey sarge you want to come check the stew pot sure paul followed him down the line of trench carlton was the official company cook and had a gift for scrounging from sources both official and unofficial but mantarakis really had been a cook back in philadelphia though getting stripes on his sleeve kept him from exercising his talents these days as often as he would have liked the pot smelled more savory than it often did chickens and a couple rabbits carlton said and potatoes and beets and onions andall kinds of things its downrightbountiful around here he laughed at his own joke yeah mantarakis tasted the stew not bad he said just kind of bland you know what im saying you need some garlic and some basil maybe or oregano to perk it up not too much he added hastily as carlton started to pour most of a tin of garlic powder into the pot you want to make the stew taste betteryou dont want to just taste the spice either little by little he was educating carlton he suddenly stopped worrying about the stew for us artillery opened up on the adobe and the line it anchored the noise was terrific overpowering enough to drive a man mad to mantarakis it was also sweet as fine wine without artillery his guess was that us forces would still be bogged down somewhere south of provo it was the one thing government troops had in prodigal supply and the mormon rebels largely lacked captain cecil schneider hurried up into the frontmost trench schneider still wore single silver bars not double hed won his promotion just after the ruins of the mormon temple in salt lake city passed into government hands with him came gordon mcsweeney who like mantarakis had started the war a private and who also like mantarakis now sported sergeants stripes when the barrage lets up we go after that farmhouse schneider said he didnt sound enthusiasticno one whod been through the fall of salt lake city was apt to be enthusiastic about fighting ever againbut he sounded determined casualties had made him a company commander the same way theyd made paul and mcsweeney noncoms but hed turned out to be a pretty good one because of that the first thing out of pauls mouth was yes sir the second thing though was what the devil is he got up as sir he pointed to gordon mcsweeney who instead of a pack wore a big metal drum on his back and carried in his hands a hose attached to it mcsweeney spoke for himself this is a device for sending the misbelievers into the fiery furnace as far as he was concerned anyone less grimly presbyterian than himself was heading straight for hell that included papists and the orthodox paul mantarakis but it also most especially included mormons who as far as he was concerned were not christians at all captain schneider amplified that saying the gadgets supposed to be able to deal with strongpoints that laugh at rifles and machine guns if the artillery doesnt punch the ticket on that farmhouse well send gordon up to see what he can do only disadvantage is its a shortrange weapon i will bring it close enough to the farmhouse to be used mcsweeney promised whatever the thing was he sounded quiveringly eager to use it mantarakis had no idea what the mormons felt about gordon mcsweeney or even whether they knew he existed among the multitude of soldiers in the us force he knew mcsweeney scared him to death ever so warily he peered up over the parapet the rebels line was taking quite a pounding through dust and smoke it looked as if several large bites were gone from the farmhouse maybe it would be easy this time it had been once or twice some of the other times though he would have liked to see the artillery go on for days for weeks killing all the mormons without any need for the infantry to do their work but for one thing there wasnt enough ammunition for a bombardment like that not on a secondary front like utah and for another hed seen fighting the confederates that even the longest most savage barrages didnt kill all or even most of the enemy soldiers at whom they were aimed after an hour or so the guns fell silent captain schneider blew a whistle up out of the trenches swarmed his company and several others come on mantarakis called to the men of his squad we dont want to spend a lot of time in between the lines where they can shoot us down we want to get right in there with em the ground was chewed up from previous failed assaults on the mormon position and chewed worse by short rounds from the latest shelling none for once seemed to have come down on the us trenches which paul reckoned a small miracle he dashed past stinking corpses and pieces of corpses some still in greengray often stained black with old blood flies rose in buzzing clouds sure enough some of the mormon defenders remained alive and angry at the world or at least at that portion of the united states army attacking them all along their line flames showed riflemen shooting at the soldiers in greengray heading their way somewhere not far from paul a man took a bullet and began shrieking for his mother and sure enough the machine gun in the adobe farmhouse started up too as he dove headlong into a shell crater mantarakis was convinced the racket a machine gun made was the most hateful noise in the world he looked toward the farmhouse he and however many men still survived from his squad had come well past the highwater mark of earlier us attacks he was he thought within a hundred yards of that infernal device hammering out death up ahead he was also damned if he knew how he was going to be able to get any nearer than that somebody thudded down into the crater beside him gordon mcsweeney i have to get closer the dour scotsman said twenty yards is best though thirty may do one for each piece of silver judas took mantarakis sighed he too knew they had to take out that machine gun if mcsweeney had a wayill go left you go right a few seconds later well keep moving till youre close enough or until you get killedor until i do he wished he could take out his worry beads and work them they werent the only soldiers pushing up toward the adobe the mormons in there had even less idea than paul did of what the strange contraption on mcsweeneys back was working his way to within twenty yards of the machine gun was slow and dangerous work but he managed to mantarakis horror mcsweeney stood up in the hole where hed sheltered he aimed the nozzle end of the hose he carried at the machine guns firing slit before the gun could cut him down a spurt of flame burst from the nozzle played over the front of the farmhouse and went right through the narrow slit at the crew serving the machine gun paul heard the lyingly cheerful sound of rounds cooking off inside the farmhouse mcsweeney dashed toward it he stuck the nozzle right up against the slit and let loose another tongue of fire along with the sound of cartridges prematurely ignited came anotherthe sound of screams gordon mcsweeneys face was transfigured with joy as if hed just taken jerusalem from the pagans and then something happened that paul had never before seen in utah three or four men came stumbling out through a hole in the side of the adobe their hands lifted high in surrender joyfully smiling still mcsweeney turned the nozzle of the flamethrower hose on them no gordon paul yelled let em give up maybe we can break this rebellion yet i suppose it could be so mcsweeney admitted reluctantly the mormons shambled off into captivity out from the adobe floated the strong stench of burnt meat mantarakis didnt care with its linchpin lost this line wouldnt hold one fight fewer he thought till utah was done for this first time since the land was settled in the seventeenth century a paved road ran between lucien galtiers farm and the town of riviereduloup on the st lawrence if lucien had had his way the road would have disappeared and with it the american soldiers and engineers who had built it but regardless of what he wanted the americans maintained their hold on quebec south of the st lawrence and had pushed across the mighty river at riviereduloup intending no doubt to sweep southwest toward quebec city and then toward montreal the push across the river and the newly paved road were anything but unrelated as lucien trudged in toward the whitepainted wood farmhouse with the steep red roof after feeding the horse he glanced at the much larger wooden building painted what he thought a most unattractive shade of greengray that had gone up not far away on what had been some of his best wheat land while he watched a greengray ambulance bearing on each side panel a large red cross inside a white circle pulled up to the building the driver leaped out he and an attendant who emerged from the rear of the vehicle carried a man on a stretcher into the us military hospital they hurried back and brought in another injured man then the ambulance engine snarling headed back toward riviereduloup to pick up more casualties lucien wiped his feet before he went into the farmhouse though not a big man himself he towered over his wife marie that did not mean he could track muck inside without hearing about it in great detail warm in here he said approvingly it is only october but the wind outside is ready for january may it freeze the americans marie answered from the kitchen like her husband she spoke in quebecois french it was the only language she knew lucien had picked up some english during his conscript time in the canadian army just as englishspeaking canadians soaked up a little french there hed forgotten most of what hed learned in the twentyodd years since hed served though having to deal with the americans had brought some of it back he walked toward the kitchen drawn not only by the warmth of the stove but also by the delicious smells floating out toward him he sniffed he prided himself on an educated nose dont tell me he said pointing to the covered pot ham baked with prunes and are there potatoes in the oven too marie galtier regarded him with mixed affection and exasperation how am i supposed to surprise you lucien he spread his hands and shrugged as long as weve been married and you still expect to surprise me you make me happy that is enough and more than enough what do i need of surprises also in the kitchen helping her mother was their eldest daughter nicole she was slight and dark like marie and put lucien achingly in mind of what her mother had been like when hed first started courting her now she said i can surprise you papa of this i have no doubt lucien said the question is my little bird do i want to be surprised he didnt remember only what marie had been like when he was courting her he also remembered all too well what he had been like he did not think the young male of the species likely to have shown any dramatic improvement over the intervening generation and when nicole answered papa i do not know his heart sank she took a long deep breath before going on and that heart seemingly a relentless gymnast leaped into his mouth then she said i have been thinking of doing nurses work at the american hospital it is very close of course and we could use the money the work would bring after all the dreadful possibilities he had imagined that one seemed not so badat first then lucien stared you would help the americans nicole the enemies of our country the allies of the enemies of france his daughter bit her lip and looked down at the apron she wore over her long wool dress to galtiers surprise his wife spoke up for her if a man is hurt and in pain does it matter what country he comes from father pascal would say the same thing lucien replied which made marie wince because the priest at riviereduloup whatever anyones opinion of his piety might be collaborated eagerly with the americans but papa nicole said they are hurt and in pain you can hear them moaning in the night sometimes lucien had heard those moans too they had been sweet to his ears he shook his head in dismay to discover his daughter did not feel the same nicole persisted you know what i think of father pascal you know what i think of the americans none of that would change how could it and they would be giving money to people who despise them you dont even speak any english galtier said as soon as the words were out of his mouth he knew he was in trouble when you had to shift your reasons for saying no you were liable to end up saying yes and nicole pounced i can learn it i know that it might even be useful for me to know if god forbid she didnt go on she didnt need to go on lucien had no trouble completing the sentence for himself if god forbid the united states win the war and try to make us all use english afterwards that was what shed meant or something very much like it he didnt try to answer on the spur of the moment believing canada and france and england and the confederacy could be defeated went dead against all his hopes and dreams what he did say was how major quigley will laugh when he learns you are working for the americans he spoke with more than a little bitterness nicole bit her lip the frenchspeaking us major had placed the hospital on galtier land not least because lucien would not collaborate with the american occupying authorities marie spoke up again actually that may be for the best the major may believe we are coming round to his view of things after all and so become less likely to trouble us from now on lucien chewed on that it did make a certain amount of sense and so instead of putting his foot down as hed intended he said we shall speak of this more later his wife and eldest daughter nodded outwardly obedient to his will as women were supposed to be he knew they both had to be smiling inside though sooner or later they would get what they wanted talking about things later was but one short step from giving in at supper he discovered he was the last one in the family to hear about what nicole had in mind that saddened him but didnt unduly surprise him for one thing he did more work away from the farmhouse than anyone else for another he was the one from whom permission would have to come nicole would have wanted to know she had support from the rest before bearding him i wish i could go there too and make money of my own his daughter susanne said wistfully since she was only thirteen they would not have to worry about that unless the war went on appallingly long or of course unless there is another war after this one lucien thought and then shivered as if someone had walked over his grave his older son charles did not approve of nicoles plan i say the americans are just another pack of boches and we should have as little to do with them as we can he spoke with the certainty of seventeen in another year he would have gone into the canadian army to serve his time the only good thing about the war was that it had rolled over this part of quebec before he could take part in it oh i dont know said georges who was a couple of years younger than his brother and almost the changeling of the family not only was he larger and fairer than his parents and brother and sisters but he also had a rollicking wit out of keeping with the pungent sarcasm lucien brought to bear on life now he grinned at nicole across the table maybe youll meet a handsome american doctor and hell sweep you off youroww by the dull thud from under the table shed kicked him in the shin to underscore a point that needed no underscoring his littlest sister jeanne said that was mean eightyearold certainty wasnt of the same kind as the seventeenyearold variety but it wasnt any less certain either denise who was a couple of years older than jeanne nodded to show her agreement jeanne turned to nicole and said youd never do anything like that would you certainly not nicole said frost in her voice the look she turned on georges should have turned him into a block of ice too it didnt he stayed impudent as ever even if he did have to bend over to rub his injured leg now wait all of you lucien said no one has said that nicole will have any opportunity to meet american doctors even if she wanted to do such a thing which i already have no doubt she does not but papa nicole said are you changing your mind no for i never said yes he answered his eldest daughter looked stricken he glanced down to marie at the foot of the table he knew what her expressions meant this one meant shed back him but she thought he was wrong he sighed perhaps it might be possible to trybut only for a little while lieutenant general george armstrong custer slammed his fist down on the table that held the maps of western kentucky by heaven he said the war departments finally come out with an order that makes sense general attack all along the line draft the orders to implement it here in first army country major dowling ill want to see them by two o clock this afternoon yes sir abner dowling said and then because part of his job as adjutant was saving custer from himself he added sir i dont believe they mean all units are to move forward at the same moment only that we are to take the best possible advantage of the confederates embarrassment by striking where they are weakest saving custer from himself was a fulltime job dowling had broad shouldersthere wasnt much about dowling that wasnt broadand needed them to bear up under the weight of bad temper and worse judgment the general commanding first army pressed down on him custer had always been sure of himself even as a brash cavalry officer in the war of secession now at the age of seventyfive he was downright autocraticand no more right than he had ever been his pouchy wrinkled sagging face went from pasty white to dusky purple in the space of a couple of heartbeats neither color went well with his drooping mustache which he peroxided to an approximation of the golden color it had once had naturally the same applied to the locks of hair that flowed out from under his service cap he wore the cap all the time indoors and out for it concealed the shiny expanse of the crown of his head when i see the order general attack major i construe it to mean attack all along the line and that is what i intend to do he snapped now the only time his voice left the range from petulant to irritable was when he was talking to a war correspondent then he spoke gently as any sucking dove we shall go at the enemy and smash him up wouldnt it be wise sir to concentrate our attacks where he shows himself to be less strong break through there and then use the advantages weve gained to make further advances dowling said doing his bestas hed done his best since the outset of the war with results decidedly mixedto be the voice of reason defiantly custer shook his head those dyed locks flipped back and forth not even the magic word breakthrough had reached him without their niggers to help em the rebs are just a pack of weak sisters he declared one good push and the whole rotten structure theyve built comes tumbling down sir weve been pushing with all we have for the past year and more and it hasnt tumbled down yet dowling said if it had wed be a lot deeper into the confederacy than we areand even good generals have trouble against the rebs well drive them out of moreheads horse mill custer said and that thank god will have the added benefit of getting us out of bremen here you can tell why this town is so small no one in his right mind would want to live here and once we have the railroad junction at moreheads horse mill how in the name of all thats holy can the rebs hope to keep us out of bowling green dowling suspected there would be a number of ways the confederate forces could keep the us army out of bowling green even with negroes in rebellion behind rebel lines he didnt say that to custer a welldeveloped sense of selfpreservation kept his lips sealed however much his brain seethed what he did say after some thought was so youll want me to prepare the orders with the schwerpunkt aimed toward moreheads horse mill with the confederates in disorder they might actually take that town then after another buildup they could think about moving in the direction ofnot yet onbowling green schwerpunkt general custer made it sound like a noise a sick horse might make its all very well to have the german empire for an allywithout them wed be helpless against the rebs and the limeys and the frogs and the canucks but we imitate them too much if you ask me a general in command of an army cant walk to the outhouse without the general staff looking in the halfmoon window to make sure he undoes his trouser buttons in the proper order and all these damned foreign words fog up the simple art of war the united states had lost the war of secession then twenty years later theyd lost the second mexican war germany or its prussian core in the meantime had smashed the danes the austrians and the french each in short order as far as dowling was concerned the country that lost wars needed to do some learning from the side that won them that was something else he couldnt say he tried guile if we do break through at moreheads horse mill sir well be in a good position to roll up the rebel line all the way back to the ohio river or else to push hard toward bowling green and make the enemy react to us all of that was true all of it was reasonable none of it was what custer wanted to hear much of dowlings job was telling custer things he didnt want to hear and making him pay attention to them what dowling wanted was to get up to the front and command units for himself the only reason he didnt apply for a transfer was his conviction that more men could handle a battalion in combat than could keep general custer out of mischief before custer could go off like a yellowstone geyser a pretty young lightskinned colored woman poked her head into the room with the map table and said general suh i got your lunch ready in the kitchen mutton chops mighty fine custers whole manner changed ill be there directly olivia thank you my dear he said courtly as you please to dowling he added well resume this discussion after ive eaten i do declare major that young lady is the one redeeming feature i have yet found in western kentucky eryes sir dowling said tonelessly custer took himself off with as much spry alacrity as a man carrying three quarters of a century could manage he didnt bother hiding the way he pursued olivia amused first army rumor said shed been caught too not just chaste dowling thought the rumor likely true the general carried on like an assotted fool whenever he was around his cook and housekeeper the adjutant was more inclined to fault olivias taste than custers youd think the old boy would have had his last stand years before an orderly came in with the days mail where shall i dump all this sir he asked dowling why dont you give it to me frazier the generals eating his lunch or possibly his serving wench dowling shook his head to get the lewd images out of it coughing he went on ill sort through it for him so he can go through it quickly when hes finished yes sir frazier handed him the bundle and departed dowling made three piles on the map table one was for administrative matters pertaining to first army most of which hed handle himself one was for communications from the war department hed end up handling most of those too but custer would want to look at them first and one was for personal letters custer would answer some of thosemost likely the ones full of adulationhimself dowling would get stuck with the rest typing replies for the great mans signature his lip curled and then all at once the sour expression vanished from his broad plump ruddy face he arranged the piles and waited with perfect equanimity for general custer to return meanwhile he studied the map if they could break through at moreheads horse mill they really might accomplish something custer came back looking absurdly pleased with himself maybe hed managed to get a hand under olivias long black dress the mail came in sir dowling said as if reporting the arrival of a new regiment ah capital lets see what sort of big thing it brings us today custer said grandly hauling out a piece of slang forgotten by almost everyone since the war of secession as dowling had known he would he picked up the stack of personal mail first as dowling had known he would he went from grand to glum in a matter of moments oh a letter from my wife was there sir i didnt notice dowling lied he twisted the knife a little im sure you must be glad to hear from her of course i am custer sounded like a liar himself his letter opener was shaped like a cavalry saber he used it to slit the envelope elizabeth custer was in the habit of writing long even voluminous letters so was the general come to that when he bothered to write her at all dowling would have bet he hadnt said anything about olivia in any of them though custer fumbled for his reading glasses perched them on his nose and began to wade through the missive suddenly he turned red then white his hand shook he dropped one of the pages he hadnt yet read is something wrong sir dowling asked wondering if god had chosen this moment to give first army a new commander but custer shook his head sending his curls flying once more no he said its good news as a matter of fact if it was no one had reacted so badly to good news since pyrrhus of epirus cried one more such victory and we are ruined custer went on libbie it seems has secured permission from the powers that be to enter into the war zone and will soon be brightening my life here in bremen for what she describes as an extended visit how lucky you are sir that youll have your own dear wife here to help you bear the heavy burden of command dowling brought that out with an absolutely straight face he was proud of himself none of the delight he felt showed in his voice either having elizabeth custer come to bremen for a visit was better more delightful news than any for which hed dared hope he wondered what sort of convenient illness olivia would contract the day before mrs custer arrived and whether shed recover the day after mrs custer left or perhaps that very afternoon by the thoughtful look in his eye the distinguished general might have been wondering the same thing whatever custer came up with that by god was not something he could pile onto the shoulders of his longsuffering adjutant hed have to take care of it all by his lonesome ill draft the orders for the push against moreheads horse mill dowling said yes go ahead custer agreed abstractedly dowling had been sure he would be abstracted at the moment custer had made it plain he had no use for german terminology dowling reminded himself not to call the concentration against moreheads horse mill the schwerpunkt of first army action but german was a useful language english for instance had nothing close to schadenfreude to describe the glee dowling felt at his vain pompous foolish commanders discomfiture despite the many things lieutenant commander roger kimball had thought he might do in a submarineand his fantasies had considerable scope ranging from laying a pretty girl in the captains cramped cabin to sinking two yankee battleships with the same spread of torpedoessailing up a south carolina river on gunboat duty hadnt made the list but here he was heading up the pee dee to bombard the revolting negroesin both senses of the wordwho called themselves the congaree socialist republic diesel smoke poured from the exhaust of the bonefish at the back of the conning tower on which he stood the submersible drew only eleven feet of water which meant it could go farther up the river before grounding itself than most of the surface warships that had been in charleston harbor when the rebellion broke out all the same kimball was proceeding at a quarter speed and had a man with a sounding line at the bow the sailor turned and called three fathoms twain sir he cast the line again the lead weight splashed down into the muddy water of the pee dee three fathoms twain kimball echoed to show hed heard twenty feetplenty of water under the bonefishs keel he turned to the only other officer on the submersible a junior lieutenant named tom brearley who couldnt possibly have been as young as he looked what i wish we had here is a river gunboat he said then we could haul bigger guns further upstream than well manage with our boat thats a fact sir brearley agreed he wasnt long out of the confederate naval academy at mobile and agreed with just about everything his commander said after a moment though he added we have to do the best we can with what weve got that was also a fact as kimball was glumly aware his own features blunter and harsher than brearleys assumed a bulldog cast as he surveyed the weaponry aboard the bonefish the threeinch deck gun had been designed to sink freighters not to bombard land targets but it would serve that purpose for the mission a machine gun had been hastily bolted to the top of the conning tower and another one to the deck behind it take all together the three guns and the vital sounding line used up everyone in the eighteenman crew who wasnt required to stay below and keep the diesel running the hatch behind kimball was open from it wafted the reek with which he had become intimately familiar in three years aboard submersibles a reek made up of oil and sweat and heads that never quite worked in the manner in which theyd been designed here at least as opposed to out on the open sea he didnt have to keep the hatch dogged if he didnt want to flood the narrow steel tube inside which he and his men did their job three fathoms twain the sailor with the lead sang out again three fathoms twain kimball repeated his eyes flicked back and forth back and forth from one side of the pee dee to the other most places forestor maybe jungle was a better wordcame right down to the riverbank he didnt like that anything could be hiding in there he felt eyes on him though he couldnt see anyone he didnt like that either here and there plantations had been carved out of the forest he didnt know what they grew in these partsmaybe rice maybe indigo maybe cotton he was from the hills of northeastern arkansas himself the farm where hed grown up turned out a little wheat a little tobacco a few hogs and a lot of strapping sons some confederate officers looked down their noses at him because of his backcountry accent if you were good enough at what you did though how you talked mattered less but that wasnt why he growled whenever they passed a plantation the mansions in which the low country bluebloods had made their homes were one and all burntout shells of their former selves i wonder if that happened to marshlands too he muttered sir tom brearley said never mind kimball knew how to keep his mouth shut it was none of brearleys business that hed been in the sack with the mistress of marshlands at a cheap hotel when the negro uprising broke out he hoped anne colleton was all right like him she had a way of running straight toward trouble that was probably a good part of what had attracted the two of them to each other it made for a good submarine commander in a civilian though in what might as well have been the middle of a war a rifle cracked in the thick undergrowth a bullet ricocheted off the side of the conning tower a yard from kimballs feet he felt the vibration through the soles of his shoes the rifle cracked againor maybe it was another one the round slapped past his ear hose em down he shouted to the men at the machine guns both guns started hammering away in the general direction from which the shots had come the greenery by the riverbank whipped back and forth as if in a hailstorm rather than a hail of bullets whether that hail of bullets was doing anything about getting rid of the uprisen negroes whod fired on the bonefish was another matter kimball didnt know enough about fighting on land to guess one way or the other he suspected he would acquire more of an education in that regard than he really wanted wouldnt it be fine tom if we could land a company of marines and let them do the dirty work for us he said it surely would sir brearley answered he looked up and down the length of the bonefish it would be nice if this boat could hold a company of marines for that matter it would be nice if this boat would hold all of us hey dont talk like that youre an officer so youve got a bunk to call your own and a good foot of room between the edge of it and the main corridor kimball said you sleep in a hammock or tripledecked in five and a half feet of space and youll find out all about crowded yes sir brearley said i know about that from training youd better remember it kimball told him another reason hed joined the submersible service was that you couldnt be an aristocrat herethe boats werent big enough to permit it he was about to say something more when the man at the bow cried out and tumbled into the pee dee the fellow came up a moment later splashing feebly around him the muddy water took on a reddish cast then one of the sailors working the conningtower machine gun crumpled he pounded at the roof of the conning tower in agony but his legs didnt movehed been hit in the spine crimson spread from around a neat hole in the back of his tunic for a moment that didnt mean anything to kimball then another bullet cracked past his head and he realized the fire was coming not from the northern bank of the pee dee the one the machines guns were working over but from the southern bank christ were caught in a crossfire he exclaimed the pee dee was no more than a couple of hundred yards wide the negroes hiding in the bushes had only rifles he devoutly hoped they had only rifles but they didnt need to be the greatest shots in the world to start picking off his men he thought about turning the deck gun on the southern riverbank but that would have been like flailing around with a sledgehammer trying to smash a cockroach you couldnt even see what do we do sir brearley asked without waiting for orders one of the men from the deck gun crew had leaped into the river after the wounded leadsman he hauled the fellow back up onto the deck it might have been in the nick of time kimball thought he saw something sinuous moving through the water toward the submersible then going away did alligators live in the pee dee nobody had briefed him one way or the other he didnt have a doctor on board the bonefish or even a pharmacists mate he knew a little about first aid and so did one of the petty officers who kept the diesels going he wished again for a river gunboat one with its guns housed in protective turrets against just this sort of nuisance fire it would have been nuisance fire against such a gunboat anyway against the vessel he commanded it was a great deal worse all hands below he shouted the sailors on deck scrambled up the ladder to the top of the conning tower then swarmed down into the bonefish the leadsman had a bullet through his upper left arm a wound from which hed recover if it didnt fester he got up and down as fast as an uninjured sailor the man whod been hit in the spine presented a harder problem moving him at all would do his wound no good but leaving him where he sprawled was asking for him to be hit again and killed kimball waited until he and the wounded machine gunner were the only men left on top of the conning tower bullets kept whipping past them at the top of the ladder tom brearley waited nichols im going to get you below now kimball said dont worry about me sir the sailor answered what the hell good am i like this lots of people in your shoes now kimball told him thats a factgoddamn war theyll figure out plenty of things for you to do and the wheelchairs they have nowadays let you get around pretty well nichols groaned maybe in derision maybe just in pain kimball ignored that as carefully as he could he slid the wounded sailor toward the hatch when brearley had secure hold of nichols feet he guided the mans torso through the hatchway then hung on to him as they descended the petty officerhis name was ben coulterwas already bandaging the leadsmans arm his jowly acnescarred face twisted into a grimace when he saw how nichols was dead from the waist down nothing i can do about that sir he told kimball wish there was but he spread his hands hed washed them before he got to work but he still had dirt ground into the folds of his knuckles and grease under his nails i know kimball said unhappily then he burst out god damn it to hell were not built to fight closein actions we have any sheet metal or anything we can use to shield our gunners backs the deck gun had a shield for the front good against shell splinters but maybe not against bullets as things stood the machine guns were altogether unprotected maybe we could do something like that sir coulter said he hesitated you mean to go on after this hadnt thought of doing anything else kimball answered he looked from the petty officer to tom brearley to the rest of the crew packed together in the cramped chamber under the conning tower havent had any orders to do anything else either anybody who doesnt want to go on ill put him off the boat right now and he can take his chances you mean here among the niggers somebody asked lucky for him he was behind kimball who couldnt tell who he was hell yes i mean here among the niggers the submersible commander said anybody who thinks im going to back off and let those black bastardsthose red bastardstake my country away from me or help the damnyankees whip us had better think twice maybe three times he looked around again if anybody disagreed with him it didnt show that was the way things were supposed to work he nodded once brusquely all right lets get to work and figure out how to do what needs doing tiny yossel reisen woke up and started to wail when he woke up everyone in the crowded apartment woke up with him flora hamburger opened her eyes it was dark she groanedsoftly so as not to disturb anyone who by some miracle might still have been asleep this was the third time her baby nephew had awakened in the night her parents and siblings had to get up too early to go to work as things were when a howling baby cut into what little sleep they got life was hard sha shahush hush sophie reisen murmured wearily as she stumbled toward the babys cradle floras older sister scooped yossel out sat down in a chair and began to nurse him little urgent sucking noises replaced his desperate cries flora rolled over on the bed she shared with her younger sister esther and tried to go back to sleep shed just succeeded when the alarm clock beside her head went off clattering as if all the fire alarms in new york city were boiled down into its malevolent little case blindly almost drunk with weariness she fumbled at the clock till it shut up then she staggered out of bed and splashed cold water on her face to bring back a semblance of life she stared at herself in the mirror above the sink her dark eyes usually so lively were dull with purplish circles under them her skin had a pallor that had nothing to do with fashion but threw her cheekbones and prominent nose and chin into sharp relief and hes not even my baby she thought with tired resentment esther pushed her away from the mirror she dressed quickly by the time she got out to the kitchen her mother had sweet rolls and coffee pale with milk already on the table her younger brothers david and isaac were there eating and drinking theyd risen no earlier than she had but they hadnt had to struggle with a recalcitrant corset her father came in a moment after she did the biggest mug of coffee was reserved for him he already had his pipe going the tobacco was harsher than what hed used before the war cut off imports from the confederacy but the odor of smoke was still part of breakfast as far as flora was concerned benjamin hamburger bit into a roll sipped his coffee and nodded approvingly thats good sarah he called to floras mother as he did every morning sophie sat down too hes asleep again she said sounding half asleep herself how long it will lastgott vayss her shrug was barely visible as if she lacked the energy to raise her shoulders any higher she probably did flora hamburgers eyes went to the framed photograph of yossel reisenbaby yossels fathernear the divan in the living room there he stood in his army uniform looking nothing like the yeshivabucher hed been till he enlisted because he was going into the army and might very well never come back sophie whod been his fiancee then had given him a goingaway present as old as history hed given her one as old as history too though it had taken nine months to find out whether that one was a boy or a girl he had married her when he came back to the lower east side on leave the baby did bear his name that was all of him it had though shortly before sophies time of confinement hed been killed in one of the meaningless battles down in virginia flora had hated the war long before it came home to her family as a socialist party activist shed done everything she could to keep the socialist delegation in congressthe secondlargest bloc behind the dominant democrats but far ahead of the republicansfrom voting for war credits shed failed now it was the socialists war too she and her party were to blame for that picture of a man who wasnt coming home and for so many like it from the blackbordered casualty lists the papers printed every day her father her sisters her brother hurried off to work in the sweatshops that these days turned endless bolts of greengray cloth into tunics and trousers and caps and puttees for men to wear as they went out to get slaughtered david had just turned eighteen she wondered how long it would be before he got his conscription call not long she thought worriedly not at the rate the war was going through the young men of two continents before long it was time for flora to go too she kissed her mother on the cheek saying ill see you tonight i hope the baby isnt too much trouble sarah hamburger smiled ive had a lot of practice with babies by now dont you think she turned a speculative eye on flora one of these days alevai it would be nice to take care of one of yours that got flora out of the apartment in a hurry she didnt even wait to adjust her picture hat in front of the mirror but put it on as she was walking downstairs if it was crooked too bad her mother didnt see wouldnt see that living a full life didnt have to include a life full of men or full of one man and full of babies socialist party headquarters for the fourteenth ward were in a crowded secondfloor office above a butcher shop on centre market court across the street from the stalls and little shops in the centre market buyers already went from stall to store looking for early morning bargains soldiers circle men prowled through the marketplace some of them wearing armbands others pins all of them carrying truncheons or wearing pistols on their hips theyd been suppressing dissent and resistance to the war in socialist neighborhoods ever since the remembrance day riots as often happened a couple of them were leaning up against the brick wall near the stairway up to socialist party headquarters theyd eased off on that for a time but had come back in greater force since the socialist uprising in the confederate states if the oppressed negroes could rise up in righteous revolutionary fury there what about the oppressed proletariat of all colors in the usa flora waved to max fleischmann the butcher downstairs he waved back smiling she helped keep the soldiers circle goons from bothering him nothing could keep them from leering at her not by accident did the flowers in her hat conceal a couple of long sharp hatpins perhaps grouchy from lack of sleep she glared back at the soldiers circle men i dont know why you waste your time hanging around here she said exaggerating for effect arent you grateful that people who see the need for class struggle are helping the united states win the war reds are reds whether theyre black or white one of the men answered weve got the answer for any what gets out o line he set his fist by the side of his neck then jerked his arm sharply upward and let his head fall to one side as if hed been hanged anybody tries a revolution here thats what they get and thats what they deserve im sure you would have told george washington the same thing flora said and went upstairs she felt the eyes of the soldiers circle men like daggers in her back till she opened the door and walked inside party headquarters as usual put her in mind of a threering circus crammed into about half a ring typewriters clattered people shouted into telephones in yiddish and english often with scant regard for which language they were using at any given moment other people stood in the narrow spaces between desks or sat on the corners of the desks themselves and argued loudly and passionately about anything that happened to cross their minds flora looked on the chaos and smiled it was in an even larger even more disorderly style her family writ large good morning maria she said to her secretary as she hung her hat on a tree near the desk good morning maria tresca answered she was one of the few gentiles at the fourteenth ward office but was as enthusiastic for socialism and its goals as anyone else her sister angelina had died in the remembrance day riots the year before she studied flora then added you look pleased with yourself do i well maybe i do flora said i gave the bully boys downstairs something to think about she explained her crack about washington maria grinned from ear to ear and clapped her hands together over at the next desk herman bruck hung up the telephone on which hed been speaking and sent flora a stern look a stern look from bruck was not something to bear lightly he might have stepped out of the pages of a fashion catalogue from perfectly trimmed hair and neat mustache to suits always of fine wool and most modish cut he often made a spokesman for the socialists simply because he looked so elegant money had not done it for him coming from a family of fancy tailors had washington was no revolutionary not in the marxist sense of the word he said now he didnt transfer wealth or power from the aristocracy to the bourgeoisie and certainly not to the peasants all he did was replace british planters and landowners with their american counterparts flora tapped a fingernail against the top of her desk in annoyance herman bruck would probably have made an even better talmudic scholar than poor yossel reisen he delighted in hairsplitting and precision only in chosen ideology did he differ from yossel for one thing soldiers circle goons dont care about the marxist sense of the word flora said holding onto her patience with both hands for another by their use of the term washington was a revolutionary and i got them to think about the consequences of denying the right to revolution now either that or i got them angry at me which will do as well its not proper bruck answered stiffly we should be accurate about these matters educating the nation must be undertaken in an exact and thoroughgoing fashion yes herman flora suppressed a sigh the one thing bruck lacked that would have made him a truly effective political operative was any trace of imagination before he could go on with what would no doubt have been a disputation to consume the entire morning his telephone rang he gave whoever was on the other end of the line the same sharply focused attention he had turned on flora her own phone jangled a moment later socialist party flora hamburger she said and then ohmr levitzsky yes by all means we will support the garment workers union there that contract will be honored or the rank and file will strike war or no war teddy roosevelt makes a lot of noise about a square deal for the workers well find out if he means it and well let the people know if he doesnt ill take that word to the factory manager levitzsky said if he knows the union and the party are in solidarity here he wont have the nerve to go on calling the contract just a scrap of paper thank you miss hamburger that was the sort of phone call that made flora feel shed earned her salary for the day workers were so vulnerable to pressure from employers especially with the war making everything all the more urgent or at least seem all the more urgent the party had the collective strength to help redress the balance herman bruck got off the phone himself a minute or so later in a new tone of voiceas if he hadnt been criticizing her ideological purity a moment beforehe asked would you like to go to the moving pictures with me tonight after work geraldine farrar is supposed to be very fine in the new version of carmen i really dont think so not tonight flora began bruck went on as if she hadnt spoken the bullfight scene they say is especially bully he smiled at his pun flora didnt so many people wanted to sit in the amphitheater while it was being photographed ive heard that they didnt have to hire any extras im sorry herman maybe when yossel sleeps a little better so i can be sure ill sleep a little better he kept everyone awake through a lot of last night herman bruck looked like a kicked puppy hed been trying to court flora almost as long as theyd known each other the next luck he had would be the first that didnt stop him from going right on trying abstractly flora admired his persistence the same persistence he showed in his party work she admired it even more there than when it was aimed at her turning away from bruck and toward maria tresca she asked whats next jake featherston stuck out his mess tin the negro cook for the first richmond howitzers gave him a tinful of stew he carried it back among the ruins of hampstead maryland and sat down with his gun crew to eat michael scott the threeinch howitzers loader said stew tastes pretty good sarge now all we have to do is hope it aint poisoned funny jake said funny like a truss he dug in with his spoon scott had been right the stew was good trying to look on the bright side of things he went on this metellus he seems like a good nigger he knows his place and he dont give anybody any trouble not that we know about anyways that was will cooper one of the shell haulers for the threeinch gun like scott he was a kid both of them had joined the regiment after heavy casualties along the susquehanna thinned out most of the veterans who had started the war with jake but the kids had been around for a while now their butternut uniforms were stained and weatherbeaten and the red facings on their collar tabs that showed them to be artillerymen had faded to a washedout pink featherston kept on eating but scowled as he did so the trouble was cooper was right no two ways about it be a long time before we can trust the niggers again jake said glumly heads bobbed up and down in response to that at this here gun we were luckythis whole battery we were lucky scott said our laborers just ran off they didnt try and turn our guns on us or on the infantrymen in front of us now jake spoke with fond reminiscence yeah and we gave the damnyankees a good warm welcome when they came up out of their trenches too they figured we couldnt do nothin about em with all our niggers givin us a hard time but i reckon we showed em different when the wind blew out of the north it wafted the stench of unburied yankee bodies into the confederate lines it was a horrible stench sweet and ripe and thick enough to slice but it was also the stench of victory or at least the stench of defeat avoided us forces had driven the confederacy out of pennsylvania but the stars and bars still flew over most of maryland and over washington dc occasional crackles of gunfire came from the front scouts thinking theyd spotted yankee raiders snipers shooting at enemies in the trenches rash enough to expose any part of themselves even for a moment and on the other side of the line yankee riflemen ready to do unto the confederates what was being done unto them another rifle shot rang out then two more featherstons head came up and his gaze sharpened as if he were a coon dog taking a scent those shots hadnt come from the front but from well behind the line he scowled again thats likely to be some damn nigger trying to bushwhack our boys bastards cooper muttered we finish dealin with them theyre gonna spend the next hundred years wishin they didnt try raisin their hands to us and you can take that to church i know featherston said back in the old days my old man was an overseer till they laid him in the ground he said we never ought to have manumitted the niggers i always thought you got to change with the times but with the kind of thanks we got damned if i think that way any more the whole gun crew nodded in response to that jake finished his stew maybe metellus really knew which side his bread was buttered on and did all the things he was supposed to do but for all jake knew maybe he unbuttoned his fly and pissed in the stewpot when nobody was looking how could you tell for sure you couldnt till maybe too late from what hed heard it had been like that up and down the csaworst in the cotton belt where whites were thin on the ground in big stretches of the country but bad everywhere he didnt know how many of the ten million or so negroes in the confederacy had joined the rebellion but enough had so that some troops had had to leave the fighting line against the usa to help put them down no wonder then that the damnyankees were pushing forward in western virginia in kentucky and in sonora the wonder was that the confederate positions hadnt fallen apart altogether he glanced over to his gun the quickfiring threeincher copied from the french was one big reason they hadnt the usa lacked a field piece that came close to matching it he heard footsteps coming up from the south he wore a pistol on his hip in case yankee infantry somehow god forbid got close enough to his gun for him to need a personal weapon he hadnt drawn it till trouble broke out among the negroes nownow he was a long way from the only artilleryman to have a weapon ready who goes there he demanded this battery c first richmond howitzers whoever owned the voice he sounded crisp and decisive he also sounded white featherston knew that didnt necessarily mean anything though hed known plenty of negroes who could put on white accents but this voicehe scratched his head he thought hed heard it before youre in the right place he answered advance and be recognized he didnt take his hand off the pistol into the firelight came a small spruce major and a bedraggled negro jake and the rest of the men in the gun crew scrambled to their feet and stood at attention the majors pale eyes flashed a hawk might have wished for such a piercing gaze those pale eyes fixed on jake i know you youre sergeant featherston the fellow spoke with assurance yes sir featherston said he had met this officer before major potter isnt it sir thats right clarence potter intelligence army of northern virginia none too gently he shoved the negro up close to the fire and since you were here when i last visited the battery perhaps you will be good enough to confirm for me that this ragged scoundrelhe shoved the negro againis in fact pompey former body servant to your commander captain stuart captain jeb stuart iii that is he spoke the battery commanders full name with a certain savage relish everybody in the gun crew stared at the negro jake could make a pretty good guess as to what the men were thinking he was thinking a lot of the same things himself but potter hadnt asked the question of anyone save him he had to look closely to be certain then said yes sir thats pompey hes usually a lot neater and cleaner than he is now thats all hes been living a little harder lately than hes used to poor darling potter spoke with flaying sarcasm he pointed to will cooper you private go find captain stuart and bring him here wherever he is and whatever hes doing i dont care if hes got some woman in bed with himtell him to take it out get dressed and get his ass down here yes sir cooper said and disappeared pompey spoke up i never done nothin bad to you did i marse jake his voice didnt have the mincing lilt it had carried when he served as captain stuarts man hed put on airs then as if he were something special himself because of who his master was before featherston could answer potters voice cracked like a whiplash you keep your mouth shut until i tell you to speak pompey nodded which jake thought wise the major was not the sort of man to disobey most especially not if you were in his power will cooper came back with captain stuart a few minutes later the captain bore a strong resemblance to his famous father and even more famous grandfather except that instead of their full beards he wore a mustache and a little tuft of hair under his lower lip giving him the look of a seventeenthcentury french soldier of fortune captain major potter said as he had to jake featherston is this nigger here your man pompey yes hes my servant stuart replied after a moment hed needed a second look to be certain too what is the meaning of shut up captain stuart potter interrupted as harshly as he had when pompey spoke without his leave jakes eyes widened nobody had ever addressed jeb stuart iii that way in his presence jeb stuart jr wore wreathed stars on his collar tabs and was a mighty power in the war department down in richmond but potter sounded utterly sure of himself ill ask the questions around here now see here major stuart said i dont care for your tone i dont give a damn stuart clarence potter returned i was trying to sniff out red subversion among the niggers attached to this army last yearlast year stuart and i got information that your nigger pompey wasnt to be trusted and i wanted to interrogate him properly do you remember that i did nothing wrong stuart said stiffly but he looked like a man who had just taken a painful wound and was trying to see if he could still stand up no eh the major from intelligence knocked him down with contemptuous ease you didnt talk to your daddy the general you didnt have me overruled and the investigation quashed you know better than that i know better than thatand the war department knows better than that too till now jake had never seen captain stuart at a loss whatever else you said about him he fought his guns as aggressively as any man would like and showed a contempt for the dangers of the battlefield any hero of the war of secession would have envied but hed never been threatened with loss of status and influence only death or mutilation those latter two might have been easier to face major i think you misunderstood he began i misunderstood nothing captain potter said coldly i was trying to do my duty and you prevented that if youd been right youd have gotten away with it but this nigger was taken in arms with a band of red rebels and every sign is that he wasnt just a fighter he was a leader in this conspiracy and had been for a long time if id questioned him last yearbut no you wouldnt let that happen potters headshake was a masterpiece of mockery pompey stuart shook his head too but in amazement i cant believe it i wont believe it frankly captain i dont give a damn potter said if i had my way id bust you down to private give you a rifle and let you die gloriously charging a yankee machine gun cant have everything i suppose no matter how much damage your damnfool knowitall attitude cost your country but your free ride to the top is gone stuart and thats a fact if you drop dead at ninetynine and stay in the army all that time youll be buried a captain silence stretched into it pompey said marse jeb i shut up potter told him get moving he shoved the negro on his way jeb stuart iii stared after them jake featherston studied his battery commander he didnt quite know what he thought with stuart under a cloud life was liable to get harder for everybody the captains name had been one to conjure with when it came to keeping shells in supply and such on the other hand as an overseers son jake wasnt sorry to watch an aristocrat taken down a peg more chances for me he thought and vowed to make the most of them the uss dakota steamed over the beautiful deepblue waters of the pacific somewhere south and west of the sandwich islands sam carsten was delighted to have the battleship back in fighting trim once more she had been laid up in a honolulu drydock for months taking repairs after an unfortunate encounter with a japanese torpedo carsten admired the deep blue sea he admired the even bluer sky he heartily approved of the tropic breezes that kept it from seeming as hot as it really was the sun that shone brightly down from that blue blue sky try as he would he couldnt make himself admire the sun he was very very fair with golden hair blue eyes and a pink skin that turned red in any weather and would not turn tan for love nor money when he was serving in san francisco hed thought himself one step this side of heaven heaven being defined as seattle honolulu however pretty it was made a closer approximation to hell hed smeared every sort of lotion known to pharmacists mate and chinese apothecary on his hide none had done the least bit of good far as im concerned the damn limeys were welcome to keep the sandwich islands he muttered under his breath as he swabbed a stretch of the dakotas deck he chuckled wryly somehow though folks who outrank me dont give a damn that i sunburn if you look at me crosseyed wonder why that is wonder why what is asked vic crosetti who was sanitizing the deck not far away and who slept in the bunk above carstens wonder why people who outrank a seaman first dont give a damn about him or wonder why you look like a piece of meat the galley didnt get done enough ahh shut up you damn lucky dago sam said more jealousy than rancor in his voice crosetti had been born swarthy all the sun did to him was turn him a color just this side of negro brown hey bein dark oughta do me some good crosetti said no matter what color he was nobody would ever mistake him for a negro not with his nose and thick beard and arms thatched with enough black hair to make him look like a monkey sam dipped his mop in the galvanized bucket and got another stretch of deck clean hed been a sailor for six years now and had mastered the skill of staying busy enough to satisfy officers and even more demanding chief petty officers without really doing anything too closely resembling work crosetti wasnt going at it any harder than he was if the skinny little italian hadnt been born knowing how to shirk hed sure picked up the fundamentals in a hurry after he joined the navy carsten stared off to port the destroyer jarvis was frisking through the light chop maybe half a mile away quick and graceful as a dolphin its wake trailed creamy behind it the jarvis could steam rings around the big stolid dakota that was the idea the destroyer could keep torpedo boats and submersibles away from the battlewagon that the idea still had some holes in it was attested by the repairs just completed on the dakota crosetti looked out over the water too might as well relax he said to carsten nobody in the navys seen hide nor hair of the japs or the limeys since we got bushwhacked the last time stands to reason theyre mounting patrols to make sure we aint goin near the philippines or singapore same as were doing here stood to reason last time too sam answered only thing is the japs werent being reasonable crosetti cocked his head to one side yeah thats so he said you got a cockeyed way of looking at things that makes a lot of sense sometimes you know what im saying maybe carsten said ive had one or two guys tell me that before anyway now if there was some gal whod tell me something like that id have something but hell gals here they aint gonna look past the raw meat he ran a sunburned hand down an equally sunburned arm if thats the way you think thats whatll happen to you yeah crosetti said its all in the way you go after em you know what im saying i mean look at me i aint pretty i aint rich but i aint lonesome neither not when im on shore you gotta show em theyre what youre after and you gotta make em think youre what theyre after too all how you go about it and thats a fact maybe sam said again but the ones you really want to hook onto theyre the ones who wont bite for a line like that too who says crosetti demanded indignantly then he paused wait a minute youre talkin about gettin married for gods sake whats the point to even worrying about that youre in the navy sam no matter what kind of broad you marry you aint gonna be home often enough to enjoy it carsten would have argued that the only difficulty being that he couldnt so he and crosetti talked about women for a while instead no subject being better calculated to help pass time of a morning sam didnt really know how much his bunkmate was making up and how much hed really done but hed been blessed with either a hell of a good time or a hell of an imagination an aeroplane buzzed by sam looked at it anxiously following a japanese aeroplane had got the dakota torpedoed but this one bore the american eagle it had been out looking for enemy ships carsten guessed it hadnt found any had it sent back a message by wireless telegraph the fleet would have changed course toward any vessels presumptuous enough to challenge the usa in these waters you really think the english and the japanese are just sitting back waiting for us to come to them sam asked crosetti they could cause a lot of trouble if they took the sandwich islands back from us yeah they could but they wont crosetti said when the president declared war on england i dont figure he waited five minutes before he sent us sailing for pearl harbor we caught the damn limeys with their drawers down they hadnt reinforced the place yet and they couldnt hold it against everything we threw at em but we got more men more ships there than you can shake a stick at they want it back theyre gonna hafta pay one hell of a bill thats all true carsten said but now that weve got all those men there and weve got all those ships there what are the limeys and the japs going to think well do with em sit there and hang on tight does that sound like teddy roosevelt to you theyre going to figure were heading out toward singapore and manila sooner or later unless they do something about it even if they dont land on oahu theyre going to do their damnedest to smash up the fleet right vic crosetti scratched at one cheek while he thought if sam had done anything like that he probably would have drawn blood from his poor sunbaked skin after a bit crosetti gave him a thoughtful nod makes pretty good sense i guess how come the only stripe you got on your sleeve is a service mark way you talk you oughta be a captain maybe an admiral in one of those damnfool hats they wear carsten laughed out loud all i got to say is if theyre so hard up they make me an admiral the usa is in a hell of a lot more trouble than the japs are the grin that stretched across crosettis face was altogether impudent i aint gonna argue with you about that he said whereupon sam made as if to wallop him over the head with his mop they both laughed crosetti grew serious though unwontedly fast you do talk like an officer a lot of the time you know that do i carsten said his fellow swabbieat the moment in the most literal sense of the wordnodded sam thought about it cant worry about chasing women all the damned time you got to keep your eyes open you look around you start seeing things i see a couple of lazy lugs is what i see a deep voice behind them said sam turned his head there stood hiram kidde gunners mate on the fiveinch cannon carsten helped serve he had plenty of service stripes on his sleeve having been in the navy for more than twenty years he went on go ahead try and tell me you were workin hard have a heart capn carsten said using kiddes universal nickname cant expect us to be busy every second who says i cant kidde retorted he was broadfaced and stocky thick through the middle but not soft he looked like a man you wouldnt want to run into in a barroom brawl from what sam had seen of him in action his looks werent deceiving petty officers never remember what it was like when they were seamen crosetti said he looked sly course it is kind of hard remembering back to when buchanan was president kidde glared at him then he shrugged hell i figured you were gonna say when jefferson was president shaking his head he walked on got him good vic carsten said crosetti grinned and nodded they went back to swabbing the deckstill not working too hard jefferson pinkard kissed his wife emily as she headed out the door of their yellowpainted company house to go to the munitions plant where shed been working the past year be careful honey he said he meant that a couple of ways for one her usually fair skin was still sallow from the jaundice working with some of the explosives caused for another riding the trolley in birmingham as in a lot of cities in the confederacy these days was something less than safe i will she promised as she did whenever he warned her she tossed her head these days shed cut her strawberryblond hair short to keep it from getting caught in the machinery with which she worked jeff missed the braid shed worn halfway down her back she kissed him again a quick peck on the lips i got to go i know he said you may get home a little before me tonighti got to vote remember i know its today she agreed she gave him a sidelong look one of these days i reckon ill be voting too so you wont have to remind me about it he sighed and shrugged it wasnt worth an argument shed come up with more radical ideas since she started working than in all the time theyd been married up till then she hurried off toward the trolley he stood in the doorway for half a minute or so watching her walk he would have forgiven a lot of radical ideas from a woman who moved her hips like that it gave him something to look forward to when he came home from work because the company housing was only a few hundred yards away from the sloss foundry he didnt have to leave as soon as his wife did to get to work on time he went back in finished his coffee and ham and eggs set the dishes to soak in soapy water in the sink grabbed his dinner pail and then headed out the door himself as he walked into the foundry he waved to men he knew there werent that many not any more most of the whites in the sloss labor force had already been conscripted every time he opened his own mailbox pinkard expected to find the buffcolored envelope summoning him to the colors too he sometimes wondered if theyd lost his file along with the white men in overalls and caps came a stream of black men dressed the same way many of them nowadays were doing jobs to which they wouldnt have dared aspire when the war began jobs that had been reserved for whites till the front drained off too many they still werent getting white mens pay but they were making more than they had before pinkard had been working alongside a negro for a good long while now though hed hated the notion at first hed since come to take it for granteduntil the uprising had broken out the month before leonidas the buck he was working with these days had kept right on coming in uprisings or no uprisings that would have made pinkard happier though had leonidas shown the least trace of brains concealed anywhere about his person he went into the foundry and out onto the floor the racket as always was appalling you couldnt shout over it you had to learn to talkand to hearunder it when it was cold outside it was hot in there hot with the heat of molten metal when it was hot outside the foundry floor made a pretty good foretaste of hell it smelled of iron and coal smoke and sweat two negroes waited for him night shift had started hiring blacks well before they got onto the day crew one was agrippa the other a fellow named sallust who didnt have a permanent slot of his own but filled in when somebody else didnt show up seeing sallust made jeff scratch his head wheres vespasian at he asked agrippa i dont ever remember him missin a shift he aint shiftless like that damn leonidas he laughed at his own wit then after a moment he stopped laughing leonidas was shiftless and at the moment late too agrippa didnt laugh he was in his thirties older than pinkard and right now he looked older than thathe looked fifty if a day his voice was heavy and slow and sober as he answered reason he aint here mistuh pinkard is on account of they done hanged pericles yesterday pericles was his wifes kin you know an he stayed home to help take care othings hanged him pinkard said lord pericles had been in jail as an insurrectionist for months before that hed worked alongside the white man in the place leonidas had now hed been a damn sight better at it than leonidas too pinkard shook his head thats too damn bad maybe he was a red but he was a damn fine steel man i tell vespasian you say dat agrippa said he be glad to hear it sallust sent him a hooded glance pinkard had seen its like before it meant something on the order of go on tell the white man what he wants to hear very slightly as if to say he meant his words agrippa shook his head the two black men from the night shift left jeff got to work he had to work harder without leonidas around but he worked better too because he didnt have to keep an eye on his inept partner one of these days leonidas would be standing in the wrong place and theyd pour a whole great crucible full of molten metal down on his empty head the only things left would be a brief stink of burnt meat and a batch of steel that needed resmelting because it had picked up too much carbon leonidas came strutting onto the floor twenty minutes late lord the girl i found me las night he said and ran his tongue across his lips like a cat after a visit to a bowl of cream he rocked his hips forward and back he was always talking about women or illegal whiskey a lot of men did that but most of them did their jobs better than leonidas which meant their talk about what they did when they werent working was somehow less annoying pinkard tossed him a rake come on lets straighten up the edges of that mold in the sand pit he said we dont want the metal leaking out when they do the next pouring leonidas rolled his eyes he couldnt have cared less what the metal did in the next pouring and didnt care who knew it without the war he would have had trouble getting a janitors job at the sloss works as things were hed been out here with pinkard for months one more reason to hate the war jeff thought he kept leonidas from getting killed and so wondered as he often did whether that made the day a success or a failure pericles now pericles had been a good worker and smart as a white man but hed also been a red and now he was a dead red a lot of the smart negroes were reds pinkard supposed that meant they werent as smart as they thought they were when the quitting whistle blew he headed out of the foundry with barely a goodbye to leonidas that was partly because he didnt have any use for leonidas and partly because he was heading off to vote and leonidas wasnt given what leonidas used for brains that didnt break jeffs heart but rubbing the black mans nose in it at a time like this seemed less than clever sometimes a couple of weeks would go by between times when jefferson pinkard left company grounds he spent a lot of time in the foundry his friendsthose who werent in the armylived in company housing as he did and the company store was conveniently close and gave credit even if it did charge more than the shops closer to the center of town the polling place though was at a veterans of the war of secession hall a couple of blocks in from the edge of company land he saw two or three burntout buildings as he went along emily had seen more damage from the uprising than he had because she took the trolley every day he shook his head steelworkers armed with clubs and a few guns had kept the rampaging negroes off sloss land the black workers or almost all of them had stayed quiet they knew which side their bread was buttered on a line of white men a lot of them in dirty overalls like pinkards snaked out of the veterans hall above which flapped the stars and bars he took his place dug a stogie out of his pocket lighted it and blew out a happy cloud of smoke if he had to move slowly for a bit hed enjoy it by their white hair and beards the officials at the polling place were war of secession veterans themselves pinkard jefferson davis jeff said when he got to the head of the line he took his ballot and went into a booth without hesitation he voted for gabriel semmes over doroteo arango for president as woodrow wilsons vice president semmes would keep the confederacy on a steady course while arango was nothing but a wildeyed hotblooded southerner jeff methodically went through the rest of the national state and local offices then came out and pushed his ballot through the slot of the big wood ballot box mr pinkard has voted one of the elderly precinct workers said and pinkard felt proud at having done his democratic duty he walked home still suffused with that warm sense of virtue if you didnt vote you had no one to blame but yourself for what happened to the countryunless of course you were black or a woman and one of these years the way things looked theyd probably let women have a go at the ballot box no matter what he thought about it he supposed the world wouldnt end emily came out onto the porch as he hurried up the walk toward the house hi darlin he called then he saw the buffcolored envelope she was holding lieutenant nicholas h kincaid raised a forefinger another cup of coffee for me here if you please the confederate cavalry officer said ill take care of it nellie semphroch said quickly before her daughter edna could edna glared at her half the reason kincaid came into the coffeehouse the two women ran in occupied washington dc was to moon over edna his eyes as big and glassy as those of a calf with the bloat that was also all the reason nellie tried to keep edna as far away from kincaid as she could shed caught them kissing once and who could say where that would have led if she hadnt put a stop to it in a hurry she shook her head she knew where it would have led shed been down that path herself and didnt intend to let edna take it edna filled a cup with the blend from the dutch east indies that kincaid liked set the cup on a saucer and handed it to nellie here you are ma she said her voice poisonously sweet she knew better than to argue out loud with nellie when the coffeehouse was full of customers as it was this afternoon that didnt mean she wasnt angry far from it nellie semphroch glared back at her full of angry determination herself given a generations difference in their agesa short generations differencethe two women looked very much alike they shared light brown hair though nellies had some streaks of gray in it oval faces fine fair skin and eyes somewhere between blue and green if nellies expression was habitually worried well shed earned that in this day and age if you were an adult and you didnt have plenty to worry about something was wrong with you she carried the steaming cup over to lieutenant kincaid obliged maam he said he was polite when he could easily have been anything but and when he dug in his pocket he put a real silver quarterdollar on the table not the confederate scrip that let rebel officers live like lords in the conquered capital of the usa outside in the middle distance a sudden volley of rifle shots rang out nellie jumped shed been through worse when the confederates shelled washington and then fought their way into town but shed let herself relax since that had been well over a year ago now nothin to worry about maam kincaid said after sipping at the coffee thats just the firing squad getting rid of a nigger waste of bullets you ask me ought to string the bastards up thatd be the end of that yes nellie said she didnt really like talking with kincaid it encouraged him and he didnt need encouragement to come around but confederate soldiers and military police were the only law and order washington had these days the negro rebellion that had tried to catch fire here hadnt been against the csa alone a good part of the fury had been aimed at whites in general kincaid said those niggers were damn foolsbeg your pardon maamto try givin us trouble here places where theyre still in arms against the csa are places where there werent any soldiers to speak of they take a deal of rooting out from places like that on account of we cant empty our lines against you yankees to go back and get em but herewe got plenty of soldiers here coming and going and staying why we got three regiments comin in tonight back from whipping the reds in mississippi and heading up to the maryland front and its like that every day of the year sometimes i dont think niggers is anything but a pack of fools yes nellie said again three regiments in from mississippi going up to maryland hal jacobs who had a little bootmaking and shoerepair business across the street had ways of getting such tidbits to people in the usa who could do something useful with them bring me another sandwich here maam a confederate captain at a far table called nellie hurried over to serve him despite the rationing that made most of washington a gray joyless place she never had trouble getting her hands on good food and good coffee of themselves her eyes went across the street for a moment she didnt know exactly what connections mr jacobs had but they were good ones and he liked having the coffeehouse full of confederates talking at the top of their lungsor even quietly so long as they talked freely you had a ham and cheese there she asked the captain nodded she hurried back of the counter to fix it for him nicholas h kincaid was not without resource he gulped down the coffee nellie had given him and asked for another refill while she was still making the sandwich that meant edna had to take care of him not only did she bring him the coffee she sat down at the table with him and started an animated conversation the person to whom she was really telling something was nellie and the message was simple ill do whatever i please seething inside nellie sliced bread ham and cheese with mechanical competence she wished she could haul off and give her daughter a good clout in the ear but edna was past twenty so how much good could it do why dont young folks listen to people who know better she mourned silently forgetting how little shed listened to anyone at the same age she took the sandwich over to the captain accepted his scrip with an inward sigh and was about to head back behind the counter when the door opened and a new customer came in unlike most of her clientele he was neither a confederate soldier nor one of the plump clever businessmen who hadnt let a change of rulers in washington keep them from turning a profit he was about fifty maybe a few years past with a black overcoat that had seen better times a derby about which the same could be said and a couple of days stubble on his chin and cheeks he picked a table near the doorway and sat with his back against the wall when nellie came over to him he breathed whiskey fumes up into her face she ignored them i thought i told you never to show your face in here again she said in a furious whisper oh little nell you dont have to be that way he answered his voice unlike his appearance was far from seedy he sounded ready for anything his eyes traveled the length of her up and down youre still one finelooking woman you know that he said as if hed seen right through the respectable gray wool dress she wore her face heated bill reach knew what she looked like under that dress sure enough or he knew what she had looked like under her clothes back when shed been younger than edna was now she hadnt seen him since or wanted to till hed shown up at the coffeehouse one day a few months before then shed managed to frighten him off and hoped he was gone for good now if you dont get out of here right now she said im going to let these officers here know youre bothering a lady confederates are gentlemen they dont like that except when theyre trying to get you into bed themselves reach laughed showing bad teeth it looked like a goodnatured laughunless you were on the receiving end of it i dont think youll do that oh and why dont you she might be betraying rebel information to hal jacobs but that didnt mean shed be shy about using confederate officers to protect herself from bill reach and whatever he wanted but then he said why oh i dont know a little bird told mea little homing pigeon you might say for a couple of seconds that meant nothing to nellie then it did and froze her with apprehension one of mr jacobs friends was a fancier of homing pigeons he used them to get information out of washington and into the hands of us authorities if bill reach knew about thatwhat do you want nellie had to force the words out through stiff lips now the smile was more like a leer for now a cup of coffee and a chickensalad sandwich he answered anything else i have in mind you couldnt bring me to the table men nellie thought a oneword condemnation of half the human race all they want is that well hes not going to get it ill bring you your food and the coffee she said and then to show himto try to show himshe wasnt intimidated she added that will be a dollar fifteen silver jingled in his pocket he set a dollar and a quarter on the tablereal money no scrip hed looked seedy the last time shed seen him too but he hadnt had any trouble paying her high prices then either she scooped up the coins and started back toward the counter she almost ran into edna im sorry ma her daughter said continuing in a low voice i wondered if you were having trouble with that guy its all right nellie said it wasnt all right or even close to all right but she didnt want edna getting a look at the skeletons in her closet edna was hard enough to manage as things were one of the things that helped keep her in line was the tone of moral superiority nellie took if she couldnt take that tone any more she didnt know what shed do and then from behind her bill reach said sure is a pretty daughter you have there nell thank you nellie said tonelessly edna looked bemused but nellie hoped that was because reachs appearance failed to match the other customers at least he hadnt called her little nell in front of edna the most unwanted pet name brought the days when hed known her back to all too vivid life id be proud if she was my daughter reach said that was too much to be borne well she isnt nellie answered almost certain she was right the cold north wind whipped down across the ohio river and through the covington kentucky wharves cincinnatus felt it in his ears and on his cheeks and in his hands he wasnt wearing heavy clothesoveralls and a collarless cotton shirt under thembut he was sweating rather than shivering in spite of the nasty weather longshoremans work was never easy longshoremans work when lieutenant kennan was bossing your crew was ten times worse kennan swaggered up and down the wharf as if the greengray uniform he wore turned him into the lord jehovah come on you goddamn lazy niggers he shouted got to move by god you do get your black asses humping you there the shout wasnt directed at cincinnatus you dont do like youre told you dont work here jesus christ them rebs were fools for ever setting you dumb coons free you dont deserve it another laborer an older negro named herodotus said to cincinnatus id like to pinch that little bastards head right off i would you got a long line in front of you cincinnatus answered both of them speaking too quietly for the us lieutenant to hear herodotus chuckled under his breath cincinnatus went on hell of it is hed get more work if he didnt treat us like we was out in the cotton fields in slavery days those days had ended a few years before he was born but he had plenty of stories to give him a notion of what theyd been like probably the only way he knows to deal wid us herodotus said cincinnatus sighed picked up his end of a crate and nodded aint that many black folks up in the usa he said they mostly didnt want us before the war of secession an they kep us out afterwards on account of we was from a different country then me i keep wonderin if kennan ever set eyes on anybody who wasnt white fore he got this job herodotus just shrugged he did the work kennan set him he groused about it when it was too hard or when he was feeling ornery and that was that he didnt think any harder than he had to he couldnt read or write and hed never shown any great desire to learn saying he was content as a beast of burden overstated the case but not by too much cincinnatus now cincinnatus had ambition an ambitious negro in the csa was asking for a broken heart but hed done everything he could to make life better for himself and his wife elizabeth when the usa seized covington hed hoped things would get better us law didnt come down on negroes nearly so hard as confederate law did but hed discovered lieutenant kennan was far from the only white man from the usa who had no more use for blacks than did the harshest confederate along with herodotus he hauled the crate from the barge to a waiting truck he could have driven that truck freeing a us soldier to fight hed been a driver before the war started but the yankees wouldnt let him get behind the wheel of a truck for no better reason he could see than that he had a black skin that struck him as stupid and wasteful but how was he supposed to convince the occupying authorities the plain answer was he couldnt and so he did what he had to do to get along he and elizabeth had a son now better yet achilles was sleeping through the night most of the time so cincinnatus didnt stagger into work feeling threequarters dead most mornings he thanked jesus for that because what he did was plenty to wear him out all by itself without any help from a squalling infant he and herodotus finally loaded the days last crate of ammunition into the last truck and lined up for the paymaster along with the usual dollar they both got the fiftycent hardwork bonus the grayhaired sergeant who paid them said you boys is taming that kennan half a dollar at a time aint you maybe herodotus said cincinnatus just shrugged the paymaster wasnt a bad fellow but he didnt feel easy about trusting any white man even one who criticized a comrade herodotus spent a nickel of his bonus on trolley fare and headed for home in a hurry cincinnatus had always saved money even before he had a child so he walked through covington on his way to the colored district that lay alongside the licking river walking through covington was walking through a minefield of resentments the stars and stripes floated over the city hall and all the police stations troops in greengray uniforms were not just visible they were conspicuous the yankees had the town and they aimed to keep it some local whites did business with them too with cincinnati right across the ohio covington had been doing business with the usa for as long as kentucky had been in confederate hands but more than once cincinnatus saw whites cross the street when us soldiers came by for no better reason he could find than that they didnt want to walk where the men they called damnyankees had set their feet cincinnatus didnt worry about that he walked past joe conroys general store the white storekeeper saw him but pretended he didnt nor was there any advertising notice taped to the lower lefthand corner of conroys window that meant neither conroy nor tom kennedy who had been cincinnatus boss before the war and was now a fugitive from the yankees wanted to talk with him tonight and thats a damn good thing he muttered under his breath on account of i dont want to talk with them neither if he hadnt hidden tom kennedy when a us patrol was after him he never would have been drawn into the confederate underground that still functioned in covington and he supposed in other yankeeoccupied parts of the csa as well he shook his head if the us soldiers had just treated negroes like ordinary human beings they would have won them over in short order it hadnt happened it didnt seem to have occurred to anyone that it should happen and so he found himself though far from in love with the government that had been driven out of these parts no less unhappy with the regime replacing it as if life wasnt hard enough he thought after a while the big white clapboard houses and wide lawns of the white part of town gave way to smaller dingier homes packed tightly together the mark of a negro district in any town in the confederate states of america the paving on a lot of the streets here was bad the paving on the rest of the streets did not exist at all boys in battered kneepants kicked a football up and down one dirt street one of them threw it ahead to another who caught it and ran a long way before he was dragged down yankee rules the two of them shouted gleefully as football had been played in the confederacy forward passes were illegal north of the ohio things had been different this wasnt the first such pass cincinnatus had seen thrown the us game was catching on here he walked past a whitewashed picket fence like fresh blood red paint had been daubed here and there on the whitewash a couple of houses farther on he came to another fence similarly defaced on the side of a shack that nobody lived in somebody had painted revolution in big crimson letters and a crude sketch of a broken chain beside the word aint nobody happy cincinnatus muttered whites in covington hated the us occupiers who kept them apart from the confederacy most of them held dear blacks in covington hated the us occupiers who kept them from joining the uprising against the confederacy most of them despised he turned a corner he was only a couple of blocks from home now being an upandcoming man he lived on a street that was paved and that boasted real concrete sidewalks that meant horses and mules drawing wagons and buggies didnt step on the wreaths there and meant that the blood on the sidewalk though it had gone brown rather than crimson and looked gray almost black in the deepening twilight had not been washed away by rain he kicked at the sidewalk with his shabby shoes yankee soldiers didnt hesitate to shoot down negroes aflame with the beauty of the notion of the dictatorship of the proletariat maybe the revolution would succeed down in the confederacy with so many armed whites having to stay in place and fight the usa it would not work here not now not yet a kerosene lamp burned in the front window of his house the savory smell of chicken stew wafted out toward him all at once he could feel how tiredand how coldhe was as he hurried up the walk toward the front door it opened his mother came out his wife was right behind achilles in her arms you sure you wont stay for supper mother livia elizabeth asked cincinnatus mother shook her graying head thats all right child she said i got my own man to take care of nowhe be gettin home about this time got some good pork sausages i can do up quick and fry some potatoes in the grease i see you in the mornin she paused to kiss her son on the cheek then headed back to her own house a few blocks away achilles smiled a large onetooth smile at his father cincinnatus smiled back which made the babys smile get larger elizabeth turned and went back into the house cincinnatus came with her he shut the door then gave her a quick kiss standing in the short front hallway they looked at each other elizabeth looked worn shed put in a full day as a domestic while her motherinlaw watched the baby no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than she said you look beat honey could be he admitted that kennan hed be happier if they gave him a bullwhip for us but what can you do he pulled money out of his overalls got me the bonus again anyways good news she said and then come on into the kitchen suppers just about ready cincinnatus dug in with a will the way he worked he needed to eat hearty thats right good he said and without missing a beat added but it aint a patch on yours that made elizabeth look happy cincinnatus had learned better than to praise his mothers cooking at the expense of his wifes he played with achilles in the front room while elizabeth washed supper dishes the baby could roll over but couldnt crawl yet he thought peekaboo was the funniest game in the world cincinnatus wondered what went on inside that little head when he covered his face with his hands did achilles think hed disappeared by the way the baby laughed and laughed maybe he did elizabeth came out sniffed gave cincinnatus a reproachful stare and went off to change achilles when she came back she sat down in the rocking chair to nurse the baby she didnt have a lot of milk left but enough to feed him in the evening before he went to sleep and sometimes in the morning when they first got up too he fell asleep now the tip of her breast slid out of his mouth cincinnatus eyed it till she pulled her dress back up over her shoulder hed thought he was too beat to try to get her in the mood for making love tonight but maybe hed been wrong when she carried achilles off to his cradle cincinnatus gaze followed her she noticed and smiled back over her shoulder maybe she wouldnt need too much persuading after all shed just sat down again when somebody knocked on the door cincinnatus wondered who it was curfew would be coming soon and us soldiers were especially happy about proving their shoottokill orders were no joke in the black part of town sighing cincinnatus opened it and there stood lucullus the young black man the son of apicius the best barbecue chef in a goodly stretch of the confederacy had yet to develop his fathers formidable bulk heres the ribs you ordered this afternoon he said and handed cincinnatus a package before cincinnatus could say anything lucullus had hurried down the walk climbed into the kentucky smoke house delivery wagon and clucked the mule into motion the package was not ribs considering what apicius did with ribs that sent a pang of regret through cincinnatus what you got elizabeth called who was that here and gone so quick lucullus cincinnatus answered elizabeth caught her breath cincinnatus hefted the package though wrapped in old newspaper and twine like apicius barbecue it made a precise rectangle in his hands and was much heavier than he would have guessed from the size a note was attached put in third trash can pier before tomorrow it said very much to the point after reading it he tore it into small pieces and threw them away elizabeth asked no more questions she took one look at the package then refused to turn her eyes that way cincinnatus wondered what was under the newspaper set type by the size and startling heft that was his best guess whoever picked it out of the trash can would print it and the reds would have themselves another poster or flyer or news sheet or whatever it was he shook his head being part of the confederate underground was hard and dangerous being part of the red underground was harder and more dangerous being part of both of them at onceat the time all his other choices had looked worse he wondered how long he could keep juggling and how bad the smashup would be when he started dropping plates chow call the prison guard in the greengray uniform shouted along with several thousand other captive confederates reginald bartlett lined up tin mess kit and spoon in his hand the guard like all the guards wore an overcoat reggie wore an illfitting butternut tunic and trousers not really enough to keep him warm in a west virginia autumn that had not a drop of indian summer left to it actually the tunic fit better than it had when hed got to the prison camp he was skinnier than he had been but he had to belt his pants with a piece of rope to keep them from sliding down over what was left of his backside the boots theyd given him were too big too hed stuffed them with crumpled paper to help keep his feet warm this here prisoner business it aint no fun atall jasper jenkins said he and reggie had been captured in the same raid on confederate trenches east of big lick virginia a lot of men from both sides had died in the struggle for the roanoke valley between the blue ridge mountains and the alleghenies a lot more from both sides had been captured but you never think its going to happen to you reggie agreed maybe if i think real hard ill find out it didnt he gave a whimsical shrug to show he didnt intend that to be taken seriously hed always been cheerful hed always been goodnatured hed always been able to make people like himand what had it got him a thirdtier bunk in a damnyankee prison camp maybe i should have been more of a bastard he thought couldnt have turned out much worse could it jasper jenkins on the other hand was more of a bastard a dark lanky farmer who looked out for himself first and everybody else later and here he was too so what did that prove jenkins looked around at the prisoners almost all of them as much alike as so many sheep this here wars too big for people you ask me he remarked now why the devil do you say that bartlett asked deadpan he and jenkins both laughed neither of them happily the line in which they stood made reggie think of nothing so much as a trail of ants heading for a sandwich that had been dropped on the ground compared to the size of the war in which theyd been engaged that was about what they were and to think i went and volunteered for this jenkins shook his head i was a damn fool yeah me too reggie agreed i was there in capitol square in richmond when president wilson declared war on the damnyankees i went and quit my job right on the spot and joined the armydidnt wait for the regiment id been conscripted into to get called up figured wed win the war in a couple of months and go on home shows how much i knew doesnt it nobody who didnt live by it knew about the roanoke then jasper jenkins said wish i didnt know about it now that damn valley is going to be sucking lives till the end of the war i only wish you were wrong bartlett answered they snaked toward the front of the line moving not quite fast enough to stay warm in the chilly breeze as they drew near the kettles that would feed them reggie held his mess tin in front of him with both hands that was how the rules said you did it if you didnt follow the rules in every particular you didnt get fed the cooks enjoyed finding an excuse not to give a prisoner his rations miserable bastards jenkins muttered under his breath glaring at the men who wore white aprons over their baggy butternut clothes but he made sure he kept his voice low so low that only bartlett could hear if the cooks found out he was complaining about them theyd find ways to make him sorry they were prisoners too the usa wasnt about to waste its own men to feed the confederates it captured but whoever had thought up the prisoncamp system the united states used had been a devilishly sneaky fellow what better way to remind soldiers in enemy hands what their status was than to make them dependent on the goodwill of the negroes who had formerly been their laborers and servants white teeth shining in their dark faces as they grinned unpleasantly at the men they fed the cooks ladled stewheavy on potatoes and cabbage and bits of turnip thin on meat that was probably horse or maybe cat anyhowinto the mess kits if they liked you you got yours from the bottom of the pot where all the good stuff rested if they didnt you ate nothing but broth complaining did no good either the damnyankees backed up the negroes all the time a few men in front of reggie a confederate cursed when he saw what hed been given you stinkin niggersre tryin to starve me to death he snarled ill git you for that if its the last thing i ever do so help me god i will shut up kirby one of his friends told him youre just gonna make things worse you keep going on like that that was good advice the prisoner named kirby didnt take it to hell with all of em he shouted and shook his fist at the negro cooks they didnt say anything they just looked at him memorizing his face reggie thought mr kirby was going to be on short commons for a long long time he must have known that too but he didnt care maybe he was already too hungry to care he went on you black sons of bitches think youre so great on account of the damnyankees let you lord it over usns but it dont matter youre still niggers to them too his friend shoved him along to keep the line moving if the line didnt move the prisoners caught hell from the guards kirby started cussing all over again when the piece of hardtack he got was both small and full of weevils what do you expect you damn fool bartlett thought hoping kirbys outburst wouldnt make the cooks take out their anger on everybody anywhere near the loudmouthed prisoner his bowl of stew when he got it had a decent amount of real food in with the watery broth he nodded to the negro whod dished it out thanks tacitus he said the cook nodded back soberly some of the prisoners tried sucking up to the cooksacting like niggers themselves reggie thought with distastein the hopes of getting better rations he couldnt make himself do that and he hadnt seen that it helped either treating them a little better than he would have before he got captured seemed like a good idea though he took the square of hardtack another cook handed him it wasnt too big but it wasnt too small either he shrugged it would do he and jenkins found a place where the wind wasnt blowing too hard sat down there and began to eat lettin niggers lord it over white men just aint right jenkins said that kirby fellow knew what he was talkin about this here wars over and done with its time to pay back what we owe em wonder what its going to be like when we get home again reggie said around a mouthful of potatoes wonder whats going on with the negro uprising down there he and jasper jenkins had argued about that for a while jenkins had refused to believe blacks could rise up against the whites who had dominated the confederacy since its founding and the south before that but freshcaught prisoners confirmed at least some of the stories the yankee guards so gleefully told to the men who had been captured earlier now jenkins said well smash the bastards flat and then well go on and smash the damnyankees too no matter how long it takes reggie nodded inside though he wondered he still wanted to believe everything would turn out all right but it got harder every day it had been getting harder since the first time he saw what machine guns did to charging men no matter whose uniform those men wore if the war went on long enough he figured nobody on either side would be left alive when hed finished eating he took his mess tray over to a barrel of water waited for his turn and sluiced the tray around before drying it on his shirttail he made sure hed got all the gunk out of the corners if you came down with food poisoning herewell the prison camp was a bad place but the hospital next door was worse work detail a confederate officer bawled some men went off to chop firewood others to clean the latrines still others to police up the grounds of the camp jasper jenkins shook his head in bemusement never thought id be glad of a chance to work he said but it sure as hell beats standing around doing nothing like we been doin yeah reggie agreed like jenkins he had no duties today and when there wasnt anything to do you just waited for the minutes and the hours to crawl by and every one of them moved on hands and knees hed never imagined the worst part of being a prisoner of war was boredom but the damnyankees didnt care what their captives did in here so long as they didnt try to escape and so long as they didnt try to get us soldiers to do anything for them feel like some cards jenkins asked not right now no bartlett answered i think im going to stand here till the dust covers me up maybe the yanks wont notice me any more after that jasper jenkins laughed he thought reggie had made a joke reggie knew too well he hadnt sergeant chester martin cowered in a bombproof shelter in a trench dug through the ruins of what had been big lick virginia waiting for the confederate artillery bombardment to end the bombproof was thirty feet below ground level even a shell from an eightinch gun landing right on top probably wouldnt collapse it and the rebels didnt have many heavy artillery pieces though their light field guns were better than anything the us army owned but a collapsed roof wasnt martins worst worry although his lips skinned back from his teeth whenever a shellburst nearby made the candles jump nobody could see the expression on his face though not behind the soaked pad of cotton wadding he wore over his mouth and nose the chemicals in the pad wouldwith luckkeep poison gas out of his lungs without luck he feared gas more than a direct hit the dugout that sheltered him from explosives and splinters could be a death trap now for gas heavier than air crept down and concentrated in such places the usa had started using the deadly stuff several months before the confederacy could answer in kind but the rebs had the knack now sitting there beside him in the flickering neardark squeezed up tight against him as a lover corporal paul andersen muttered something over and over again the mask he wore muffled the words but martin knew what he was saying fucking bastards he said it a lot it was a sentiment with which few of the men in the company would have disagreed all at once sudden as a kick in the teeth the barrage stopped martins stomach knotted in pain he was senior man in the bombproof he had to order the men to rush out to their postsor to stay there the rebs were sneaky sons of bitches sometimes theyd stop shelling you long enough to draw you out from your cover then pick up again with redoubled fury once you were more nearly out in the open but sometimes theyd send their men at your lines the minute after a barrage ended if they reached the trenches before your troops got up to the firing steps and the machine guns you were gone captured if you got lucky more likely dead no wonder his guts knotted he had to figure out which way to jump his own life depending on the answer along with everyone elses he weighed his choices better to guess wrong about more shelling than about a raid he decided out out out the words were muffled and blurry but nobody had any doubt about what he meant men streamed out of the dugout and ran shouting up the steps cut into the earth those steps were full of dirt that had cascaded down from hits up above enough hits like that and it wouldnt matter whether the bombproof caved in or not because nobody could escape it anyway clutching his rifle martin ran for a firing step waving for his men to follow him sure as hell here came the rebels they didnt move forward yowling like catamounts not any more theyd learned better than that but come on they did martin started shooting at the butternutclad figures stumbling toward him through nomansland the rebs went down not in death or injury so much as to take shelter in shell holes and what had been trenches and were now ruins in their mudcaked boots he would have done the same not all of them took refuge some kept moving no doubt thinking their best chance for survival lay in seizing a length of us trench they might have been right but then a couple of machine guns added their din to the mix at that some of the confederate soldiers did yell in horrified dismay advancing against rifle fire was expensive but might be possible advancing against machinegun fire was suicide without the fancy label none of the rebs made it into the trenches the ones who hadnt fallen broke and made for their own lines some of the ones who had fallen lay still others twisted and writhed and moaned out there in nomansland some us soldiers took pleasure in shooting the rebs who came out to try to recover their wounded some confederates did the same thing to us soldiers seeking to pick up their comrades martin took off his gas mask he breathed warily the air still had a chlorine tang to it but it didnt make him choke and turn blue we threw em back he said not too bad maybe twenty feet down along the firing step joe hammerschmitt suddenly cried out he dropped his rifle and clutched a hand to his right shoulder the springfield fell in the mud red started oozing out between his fingers he opened his hand for a moment to examine the wound once hed done that pain warred with exultation on his long thin face exultation won got me a hometowner looks like he said happily half the men up there with him made sympathetic noises the other half looked frankly jealous hammerschmitt was going to be out of the firing line for weeks maybe months to come and they still risked not just death but horrible mutilation every day get him back to the doctors martin called a couple of hammerschmitts buddies roughly bandaged the wound and helped him out of the front line of trenches they got envious looks too they werent going on a long vacation like joes but they were able to escape the worst of the firing till theyd turned him over to the quacks in the rear you take care of yourself joe specs peterson told his friend dont let the bugs bite you back at the hospital everyone laughed at that the bugs bit harder in the trenches than anyplace else peterson went on ill see if i cant shoot the damn reb who got you there for that moment he looked and sounded altogether serious birds who wore glasses were supposed to be peaceable types somehow specs hadnt got the word paul andersen let out a long sigh he sat down on the firing step took off his iron helmet and ran a dirty hand through his dirtyyellow hair another one of the old boys down he remarked chester martin sat down beside him and began to roll a cigarette yeah he said time this wars finally done aint gonna be a lot of people left who went in at the start dont i wish you were wrong andersen touched the two stripes on his sleeve then the three on martins he didnt say anything he didnt need to say anything theyd both been promoted because men senior to them had gone down one of these days you had to figure they would go down too and freshfaced kids would inherit their jobs martin lighted the cigarette and sucked in smoke it rasped his lungs raw maybe that was because the us tobacco wasnt so good as the stuff from the csa that you could get only from rebel corpses nowadays or maybe the chlorine still mixed with the air had something to do with it martin didnt know he didnt care either the cigarette eased his nerves back of the line us artillery opened up on the confederate forward positions go ahead martin exclaimed with the bitterness any veteran comes to feel about the shortcomings of his own side hit the sons of bitches now thats bully thats what that is doesnt do us a damn bit of good why didnt you shell them when they were coming up over the top at us andersen also got out makings for a cigarette damn right he said while rolling it course that would have done us some good so we cant have it now can we he leaned forward to get a light from martins smoke they were probably getting shelled too martin allowed trying to be fair paul andersen wasted no time on such useless efforts poor babies he said yeah they get shelled every once in a while so what you bring those bastards up to the front line and theyd turn up their toes double quick tell me im lyingi dare you cant do it martin said infantrymen took as an article of faith the notion that nobody else in the army had a nastier job than theirs it was as far as martin was concerned a faith justified by works he laughed at least the artillery fights you ever seen a dead cavalryman not likely andersen exclaimed hey theyre all sitting back there living soft and sharpening up their sabers for the breakthrough the breakthrough were going to give them martin said he and his friend laughed that they would see a breakthrough in their lifetimes struck both of them as unlikely that the cavalry would be able to exploit it if it ever came was even more absurd meditatively martin observed a horse makes a hell of a target for a machine gun you know that its a fact sure enough andersen said they both smoked on till their cigarette butts were too tiny to hold then they tossed them into the mud at the bottom of the trench rain began pattering down a few minutes later always comes right after a bombardment martin said that wasnt strictly true but shelling and rain did seem to go together at first he welcomed the rain which washed the last remnants of poison gas from the air but it did not let up it kept raining and raining and raining till the trenches went from mud to muck martin ordered men to start laying down boards so they could keep moving up and down the trench in spite of the rain that would workfor a while eventually if the rain kept up the muck would start swallowing the boards martin had seen that the winter before hed never expected to spend two winters in the trenches but then when the war started he hadnt figured on spending one winter in the trenches only goes to show he muttered and began to fix himself another cigarette he hadnt known how to keep one going in miserable weather till the war started he did now the sort of talent i could live without he thought as he struck a match and lighted the cigarette shielding it from the wet with his cupped hands as he did so he sucked in more smoke as long as he had the talent he saw no reason not to use it come on sylvia enos said to george jr and mary jane were going to be late to the coal board if you two dont stop fooling around her son was five her daughter two they didnt understand why being late for a coal board appointmentas with any government appointment in the usawas a catastrophe but they did understand that it was a catastrophe they also understood sylvia would warm their backsides hotter than any coal fire if they made her late shed made that very plain taking one of them in each hand she started to head away from brigid conevals flat which lay down the hall with the one she and her children had shared with george sr till the navy sent him off to the mississippi george jr said why cant we stay with mrs coneval we like staying with mrs coneval mary jane nodded emphatically she couldnt have said anything so complex but she agreed with it you cant stay with mrs coneval because she has an appointment with the coal board this afternoon too sylvia answered had george meant we like staying with her better than staying with you sylvia tried not to think about that she worked all day five days a week and a halfday saturday like everyone else that meant her children spent more time awake with brigid coneval who hadnt taken a factory job when her husband was conscripted but made ends meet by caring for the children of women who had than with their own mother no wonder they thought the world of her these days dont wanna go coal board mary jane said sylvia enos sighed she didnt want to go to the coal board either we have to she said and let it go at that the coal board the meat board not that she couldnt evade that one with her connections to the fishing boats that came into t wharf the flour boardall the bureaucracies that kept life in the united states efficient and organizedif you listened to the people who ran them if you listened to anyone else you got another story but no one in power seemed interested in that tale mary jane stuck out her plump lower lip which had a smear of jam beneath it no she said being two she used the word in every possible intonation with every possible variation on volume do you want to go to the coal board or would you rather have a spanking sylvia asked as shed known it would that got mary janes attention her daughter held still long enough so she could button the girls coat all the way up to the neck it was early december still fall by the calendar but it felt like winter outside and a hard winter at that george jr had buttoned his own buttons he was proud of everything he could do on his own in which he took after his father he had unfortunately buttoned the buttons wrong sylvia fixed them quickly and with as little fuss as she could nodded to mrs coneval and took the children downstairs and down to the corner where the trolley stopped had she imagined it or did brigid coneval seem to be looking forward to a trip to the coal board offices putting up with a dozen or more little ones from before sunup to after sundown had to wear at her nerves george jr and mary jane were often plenty to make sylvia wish shed never met her husband and they were her own flesh and blood if you didnt sneak into the whiskey bottle while caring for your neighbors brats you were a woman of stern stuff out on the street newsboys wearing caps and wool mufflers against the chill hawked copies of the boston globe and other local papers they were shouting about battles in west texas and sequoyah and up in manitoba too sylvia thought about spending a couple of cents to get one but decided not to the blackbordered casualty lists that ran on every front page would only make her sad so long as the newsboys werent yelling about gunboat disasters on the mississippi river she knew everything about the war that mattered to her she clambered onto the trolley and put a nickel in the fare box the driver cast a dubious eye at george jr hes only five sylvia said the driver shrugged and waved her on she was having to say that more and more next year shed have to pay her sons fare too when every five cents counted that hurt coal board the trolley man shouted pulling up to the stop half a block away from the frowning graybrown sandstone building as if by magic his car nearly emptied itself it filled again a moment later when people who had already arranged for their coming months ration climbed aboard to go home it didnt used to be this way an old man complained to his wife as sylvia shepherded the children past them back before the second mexican war we distance and the crowd kept sylvia from hearing the rest of that it mattered little she knew how the old man would have gone on her own mother had always said the same sort of thing back in the s the usa hadnt been full of boards watching every piece of everybodys life and making sure all the pieces fit together in a way that worked best for the government back then the csa england and france had humiliated the united states only once in the war of secession and people figured it was a fluke after the second time though it seemed pretty obvious that the only way to fight back was to organize to the hilt thus conscription thus the boards thus endless lines and endless forms coal board forms were stacked in neat piles a whole array of them on a long table just inside the entrance sylvia started to reach for the one that said entire family dwelling in same living quarters she jerked her hand away that hadnt been the right form for some months now instead she grabbed the one reading family member on military service she sat down on one of the hard uncomfortable chairs in the vast office after fishing a cloth doll out of her handbag for mary jane and a couple of wooden soldiers painted greengray for george jr she guddled around in there till she found a pen and a bottle of ink normally she would have contented herself with a pencil if anything but since the start of the war all the boards had grown insistent on ink the form was long enough to have been folded over on itself four different times as she did each month she filled out the intimate details of her familys life ages address square footage location of absent members and on and on and on she wished the bureaucrats could remember from one month to the next what shed put down the month before that didnt seem to be in the cards although if you invented a palace for yourself so you could get a bigger coal ration they generally did find out about that whereupon you wished you hadnt come on she said to the children they got into the line appropriate to the form it was naturally the longest line in the entire office conscription had made sure of that up at the distant front a clerk standing behind a tall marble counter like that of a bank examined each form in turn when satisfied he plied a rubber stamp with might and main thock thock thock wonder whats keeping him out of the army the middleaged woman in front of sylvia muttered under her breath when they start conscripting clerks youll know the war is as good as lost sylvia said with great conviction the woman in front of her nodded the ragged silk flowers on her battered old picture hat waving up and down the line inched forward sylvia supposed she should have been grateful the coal board offices stayed open all day saturday without that she would have had to leave work at the fishcanning plant in the middle of some weekday which would not have made her bosses happy about her of course she would have been far from the only one with such a need so what could they have done without coal how were you supposed to cook and to heat your house or flat when she was three people away from pushing her form over the high counter to the clerk behind it paying her money and collecting the ration tickets shed need for the month ahead the woman whose turn it was got into a disagreement with the clerk thats not right she shouted in an italian accent you think you can cheat me on account of i dont know much english i tell you this whatever this was it was in italian and italian so electrifying that a couple of women who not only heard but also understood it crossed themselves it rolled off the clerk like seawater down an oilcloth im sorry mrs uh vegetti but i have applied the policy pertaining to unrelated boarders correctly as warranted by the facts stated on your form there he said lousy thief stinking liar the rest was more italian even more incandescent than what had gone before people from all over the coal board offices were staring at anyone bold enough to vent her feelings in that way before the representative of such a powerful organ of government the clerk listened to the stream of abuse for perhaps a minute so wideeyed did george jr whats she saying mama he asked she sure sounds mad whatever it is i dont understand the words myself sylvia answered relieved at being able to tell the literal truth clang clang the clerk had heard enough when he rang the bell a couple of policemen came up to the irate italian woman one of them put a hand on her shoulder wham she hauled off and hit him with her handbag the two cops grabbed her and hustled her out of the office she screeched every inch of the way shut up you noisy hag one of the policemen shouted at her no coal for you this month a sigh ran through the big room the woman in front of sylvia said it would almost be worth it to have the chance to tell the nogood rubber stampers what you really think of them almost sylvia agreed wistfully but that was the operative word the italian woman was going to lose a months fuel for the sake of a few minutes pleasure like a foolish woman who fell into immorality she wasnt thinking far enough ahead sylvia smiled there were temptations and then there were temptations at last she reached the head of the line the clerk took her form studied it with methodical care and spoke in a rapid drone do you swear that the information contained herein is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth knowing false statements are liable to the penalty for perjury i do sylvia said just as she had when the preacher asked her if she took george as her lawful wedded husband thock thock thock the rubber stamp did its work a consummation less enjoyable than the one that had followed the earlier i do but then george had heated her only through the wedding night the coal board clerk would let her keep herself and her children warm all month long she passed money over the counter receiving in return a strip of ration tickets each good for twenty pounds of coal the clerk said be ready for a ration decrease or a price increase or maybe both next month nodding she took george jr and mary jane by the hand and headed out of the office be ready the clerk had said he made it sound easy but where was the extra money supposed to come from what was she supposed to do if they didntcouldntgive her enough coal for both cooking and heating the clerk didnt care it wasnt his problem come on she told her children like all the others the war caused the problem was hers one way or another she would have to deal with it outside the farmhouse the wind howled like a wild thing here on the manitoban prairie it had a long running start arthur mcgregor was glad he wouldnt have to go out in it any time soon he had plenty of food the locusts in greengray hadnt been so thorough in their plundering as they had the winter before he even had plenty of kerosene for his lamps henry gibbon the storekeeper over in rosenfeld had discovered a surefire way to cheat the yankees rationing system mcgregor didnt know what it was but he was willing to take advantage of it cheating the americans was almost like soldiers making a successful raid on their lines up farther north as if picking that thought right out of his head his son alexander said the yanks still dont have winnipeg pa at fifteen alexander looked old enough to be conscripted he was leaner than his father and fairer too with brown hair that partly recalled his mother maudes auburn curls arthur mcgregor might have been taken for a black irishman had his craggy features not been so emphatically scots not after a year and a half of trying he agreed now the troops from the mother country helped us hold em back and as long as we have winnipeg we have canada alexander finished for him arthur mcgregors big head went up and down his son was right as long as grain could go east and manufactured goods west the dominion was still a working concern the usa had almost cut the prairie off from the more heavily settled eastern provinces but hadnt quite managed it the real question is arthur rumbled can we go through another year like this one and the last half of the one before of course we can alexander sounded indignant that his father should presume to doubt canada could hold on arthur mcgregor studied his son with a mixture of fondness and exasperation the lad was at an age where he was inclined to believe things would turn out as he wanted for no better reason than that he wanted them to turn out so the united states are a big country he said that being another oblique way to say he wasnt so optimistic as he had been were a big country toobigger than the usa alexander said and the confederacy is on our side and england and france and russia and japan well lick the yanks yet you wait and see were a big country without enough people in it and our friends are a long way away mcgregor answered always dark and cold december was a good time of year in which to be gloomy if the yankees had chosen to stand on the defensive against the csa and throw everything they had at us they would have smashed us in a hurry and then gone on to other things nahh alexander rejected the idea out of hand but arthur mcgregor nodded they would have son they could have theyre just too big for us but one thing about americans is they always think they can do more than they really can they tried to smash us and the confederates and england on the high seas all at the same time and i dont care how big they are i dont care how much they love the kaiser and the huns no country on the face of the earth is big enough and strong enough to do all that at once at last hed succeeded in troubling his son do you think theyre going to win the war pa mcgregor had lain awake at night from that very fear i hope not he said at last its just that there are so blasted many of them that put a sour twist on alexanders mouth it was inarguably true in arthur mcgregors minds eye he saw endless columns of men in greengray tramping north endless queues of snarling canvastopped trucks painted the same shade endless teams of horses hauling wagons and artillery pieces endless trains also bringing men and supplies up toward the front true there were also endless ambulances and trains marked with the red cross taking wounded yankees away for treatment and no doubt endless corpses at the front but somehow the us military machine kept grinding on despite the wastage alexander said what can we do hope mcgregor answered pray though god will do as he likes not as we like he was as stern a presbyterian as he looked cooperate with the americans as little as we canthough if they hadnt bought our grain however little they paid for it i cant imagine what wed do for money he scowled a farm didnt need much in the way of cash especially when a war knocked deeds and land taxes all topsyturvy you could live off your crops and your livestock and you might even make your own cloth from wool and from flax if youd planted any but you couldnt make your own coal or your own kerosene or your own glass or books ora lot of things that made life come close to being worth living its not enough alexander said not going along with the yanks i meanits not enough we shouldnt be talking about not doing things with themthats why you dont send my sister to the school they set up like i say its good but its not enough weve got to figure out ways to do things to the americans like that bomb in rosenfeld arthur mcgregor asked his son nodded gray eyes fierce but mcgregor sighed its possible i suppose but its not easy they almost made me one of the hostages they took after that bomb went off remember they would have given me a blindfold lined me up against a wall and shot me this is a war son and you cant back out and say you didnt mean it if something goes wrong i know that alexander exclaimed but the jaunty tone with which hed replied gave him away he didnt believe for a moment that anything could go wrong in a scheme to tweak the yankees tails when you were fifteen you knew everything always turned out fine in the end arthur mcgregor was a good deal past twice fifteen he knew how foolish you were at that age he addressed his son with great seriousness i want you to promise me you wont go off on your own to try to do anything to the americans and once you make that promise i expect you to keep it now alexander mcgregor looked most unhappy aw pa i dont want to have to lie to you i dont want you to have to lie to me either his father said mcgregor was at the same time proud of his son for not taking a lie for granted and alarmed at how serious he was in wanting to do something to strike at the american soldiers holdingand holding downmanitoba believe me pa alexander went on im not the only fellow who wants to he stopped kerosene light was on the ruddy side anyhow but mcgregor thought he turned red i dont think i should have said that i wish you hadnt ill tell you that mcgregor studied alexander who did his inadequate best to show nothing on his face how many boys were there on the scattered farms of manitobaand boys they would have to be for everyone of conscription age before the land was overrun had already been called to the colorsplotting heaven only knew what against the usa whatever these fellows have in their minds you will not be a part of it do you understand me arthur mcgregor knew he sounded like a prophet laying down the law he hadnt taken that tone with alexander for years hed had no need now he wondered whether his son who was nearly a man and who thought himself more nearly a man than he was would still respond to it as he had when he was smaller and sure enough defiance kindled in alexanders eyes i understand you pa he said but that was a long way from pledging his obedience mcgregor exhaled heavily im not just saying this for myself you know what do you suppose your mother would do if the yanks caught you at whatever mischief you have in mind he knew that was a low blow and used it without compunction or hesitation it went home too alexander winced it wouldnt be like that pa he protested no why wouldnt it mcgregor pressed the advantage and how would you keep julia out of it once you got in or even mary julias just a girl and shes only twelve alexander said as if that settled that and she hates the americans worse than you do and shes stubborner than you ever dreamt of being mcgregor said before alexander could respond he went on and one of these days you and your pals would decide that the yanks couldnt think she was dangerous because shes a girl and shes only twelve and youd send her out to do something and shed be proud to go and what if she got caught son the yanks are nasty devils but lord help you if you think theyre stupid wed never alexander began but he didnt finish the sentence when you were in a war who could say what you might be driven to do neither of them spoke of mary that was not because she had but seven years it had more to do with a certainty father and son shared that the littlest girl in the house would take any chance offered her to hurt the us cause and an equally shared determination not to offer her any such chance mary was very bright for her age but unacquainted with anything at all related to restraint i asked you once for your promise and you would not give it mcgregor said im going to ask you again he folded his arms across his chest and waited to hear what his son would say if alexander said nohe didnt know what he would do if alexander said no his son let out a long deep sigh the sigh not of a boy but of a man facing up to the fact that the world doesnt work the way he wished it would it was the most grownup noise mcgregor had ever heard from him at last voice full of regret he said all right pa i promise promise what alexander that was mary coming out of the kitchen where shed been putting away the plates her mother had washed and her big sister dried promise to tickle you till you scream like theres american soldiers coming down the chimney instead of santa claus alexander said and made as if to grab her that could be dangerous she fought as ferociously as a halftame farm cat but now she hopped back laughing she turned to arthur mcgregor what did he promise pa to be a good boy mcgregor said mary snorted that sort of promise meant nothing to her mcgregor had to hope it meant something to her brother jonathan moss peered down at his whiskey then up toward the ceiling of the officers club the rafters were blurry not from the effects of drinkthough hed had a good dealbut because of the haze of tobacco smoke he knocked back the whiskey then signaled the colored steward behind the bar for another one yes sir the fellow said and passed him a fresh glass full of the magical amber fluid that inflamed and numbed at the same time his tentmates sat around the table daniel dudley who usually went by dud the flight leader tom innis fierce as a wolf and zach whitby new in the tent replacing a casualty and still a little hesitant on the ground because of that none of the four lieutenants was far past twenty all of them wore twinwinged pilots badges on the left breast pockets of their uniform tunics tom innis got a villainous pipe going its fumes added to those already crowding the air moss flapped a hand in his direction here he said dont start shooting poison gas at us you should talk those cheroots you smoke innis retorted running a hand over his brown peltlike kaiser bill mustache they smell like burning canvas painted with aeroplane dope since that was at least half true moss didnt argue with it he leaned back in his chair almost overbalancing dud dudley spotted that as he might have spotted a canuck aeroplane with engine trouble trying to limp back toward toronto how are you supposed to handle a fighting scout when you cant even fly a chair he demanded well hell moss landed awkwardly when im up in a fighting scout ill be sober it does make a difference that struck all four men as very funny probably because none of them was sober the weather had been too thick to fly for several days now leaving the pilots with nothing to do but fiddle with their aeroplanes and gather in the officers club to drink as moss had found the year before winter in ontario sometimes shut down operations for weeks at a time he sipped his fresh whiskey and looked around the club other groups of pilots and observers had their own circles most of them raucous enough that they paid little attention to the racket he and his friends were making on the walls were pictures of the fliers who had served at the aerodrome some posed portraits some snapshots of groups of them or of them sitting jauntily in the cockpits of their aeroplanes a few with their arms around pretty girls moss hadnt had much luck along those lines most canadian girls wanted little to do with the americans who occupied their country a lot of the pilots in the photographs were men hed never known men killed before hed joined the squadron as a replacement new as zach whitby others had died after moss came here luther carlsen for instance whose place whitby was taking the rest were survivorsup till now the quick and the dead he thought also on the walls were souvenirs of the aerial action that had accompanied the grinding slogging american advance through southern ontario towardbut all plans aside not yet totoronto blue white and red roundels cut from the canvas of destroyed enemy machines some were from british aeroplanes with all three colors being circles others from native canadian aircraft where the red in the center was painted in the shape of a maple leaf along with the roundels were a couple of twobladed wooden propellers also spoils of war seeing the souvenirsor rather noticing themmade jonathan moss proud for a moment but his mood swung with whiskeydriven speed i wonder how many canvas eagles the canucks and the limeys have in their officers clubs he said too damn many zach whitby said even one would be too damn many we might as well enjoy ourselves dud dudley said because we arent going to live through the damned war any which way ill drink to that innis said and did the quick and the dead moss thought again the hell of it was dudley was right or the odds said he was which amounted to the same thing moss looked again at those photographs of vanished fliers back in the observers unit from which hed transferred after his photographer was wounded theyd had a similar display one of these days would zach be explaining to some newcomer still wet behind the ears who hed been and what hed done contemplating things like that was plenty to make you want to crawl into a whiskey bottle and pull the cork in after you the door to the officers club opened captain shelby pruitt the squadron commander walked in with him came a blast of cold ontario air some of the smoke in the big room escaped though not enough to do much good i want to tell you miserable drunks something pruitt said loudly and waited till he got something approaching quiet before going on word from the weathermen in manitoba is that theyve had a couple of days of clear weather and its heading our way we may be flying tomorrow you dont want to drink yourselves altogether blind who says we dont tom innis demanded i say so pruitt answered mildly and innis nodded all at once meek as a child the squadron commander hadnt earned his nickname of hardshell by breathing fire every chance he found but he expected obedienceand got it like moss previous co he not only commanded the squadron but also flew with it and hed knocked down four enemy aeroplanes on his own even if he was by the standards of the men who flew fighting scouts somewhere between middleaged and downright doddering zach whitby waved to the bartender coffee he called i got to sober me up we run into any limeys up there i dont want to do anything stupid hell with coffee innis said hell with sobering up too much too id rather fly with a hangoverit makes me mean ill have my coffee in the morning and some aspirin to go with it moss said if i load up on java now i wont sleep for beans tonight we go up there we ought to be in the best shape we can dudley nodded moss had noticed that he and his flight leader often thought alike under hardshell pruitts inexorable stare the officers lounge emptied fliers scrawled their names on bar chits and strode or sometimes lurched off to their cots pruitt sped them to their rest with a suggestion that struck moss as downright sadistic heres hoping canuck bombing planes dont come over tonight his was not the only groan rising into the chilly night the thought of enduring a bombing raid while hung over was not one to inspire delight as things werethe groundcrew will be cleaning puke off somebodys control panel tomorrow he predicted puke is one thing dudley answered getting blood out of a cockpit is a whole different business but you know about that dont you yeah i know about that moss remembered percy stone his observer he remembered how much blood had splashed stones cockpit after hed been wounded hed heard stone had lived but the photographer still hadnt returned to duty enough thick wool blankets stood on moss cot to have denuded half the sheep in canada living under canvas in canada wasnt easy half the year it was however a hell of a lot easier than living in the trenches aviators who groused too much about how tough they had it sometimes got handed a springfield which did wonders for shutting them up he took off his boots burrowed under the blankets like a mole and fell asleep waking up in gray twilight the next morning was something he would sooner have skipped he gulped coffee and aspirin tablets and began to feel human in a somber sort of way tom innismorning preparation consisted of brandy and a raw egg then coffee one way probably worked about as well as the other sure enough the day dawned clear the pilots swaddled themselves in the leather and fur of their flying suits it was cold at altitude even in scorching midsummer during the worst of winter the flying suits rarely came off moving slowlybending your knees wasnt easy with all that padding around themthey went out to their aeroplanes groundcrew men had already removed the canvas covers from the martin onedeckers us copies of a german design also copied from the fokker monoplane was the interrupter gear that let a forwardfacing machine gun fire through the spinning propeller without shooting it off and sending the machine down in a long helpless glideor that let the machine gun shoot through the prop most of the time anyhow clumsily moss climbed into the cockpit a couple of bullet holes in the side of the fuselage from his most recent encounter with an enemy aeroplane had been neatly patched the machine could take punishment had the bullets torn through his soft vulnerable flesh he would have spent much longer in the shop he nodded to a mechanic standing by the propeller the fellow his breath smoking in the cold morning air spun the twobladed wooden prop after a couple of tries the engine caught moss studied his instruments he had plenty of gas and oil and the pumps for both seemed to be working well he tapped his compass to make sure the needle hadnt frozen to its case when he was satisfied he waved the airstrip was full of the growl of motors turning over dud dudley looked around to make sure everyone in his flight had a functioning machine then taxied across the fieldruts through graybrown dead grass moss followed watching his ground speed he pulled back on the joystick lifting the fighting scouts nose the aeroplane bounced a couple of more times after the second bounce it didnt come down he climbed as quickly as he could going into formation behind his flight leader and to his left zach whitby held the same place relative to him as he did to dudley on the right tom innis flew alone down in the trenches men huddled against cold and mud and frost the line ran from southeast to northwest between lake ontario and lake huron behind it on land the united states had had to fight to win everything had been wrecked by stubborn canadian and british defense and equally stubborn american attacks on the other side the terrain still showed what a fine country this was machine guns spat fire at the aeroplanes from the enemys trenches that was futile machinegun bullets reached only a couple of thousand feet and the martin singledeckers flew a good deal higher but soon canadian and british archibaldor archie as he was more familiarly knownwould start putting antiaircraft shells all around them a lucky hit could bring down an aeroplane moss knew that as he knew of a thousand other ways he could die up here he did his best to forget what he knew dud dudley wagged his wings to draw the flights attention he pointed to the south the enemy was in the air too there buzzing along contentedly as if without a care in the world was a canadianor perhaps a britishtwoseater an old avro no longer fit for frontline combat but still good enough to take a photographer over the american lines to see what he could see as moss swung into a turn toward the enemy reconnaissance aircraft he glanced in the rearview mirror then up and back over his shoulder were scouts lurking up there waiting to pounce when the americans attacked the avro keeping an eye peeled for such was really zach whitbys job but you didnt get to go back to the officers lounge and have more drinks if you took too seriously the notion that you didnt have to worry about something because someone else would on flew the avro straight as if on a string that meant the observer was taking his pictures and the pilot a brave man wouldnt spoil them even if he was under attack moss knew what that took since hed piloted observation aircraft himself he prepared to make the enemy pay for his courage hed just fired his first burst when tracers streaked past himnot from the avro but from behind zach whitbys fighting scout tumbled out of the sky not in any controlled maneuver but diving steeply a dead man at the controls flame licking back from the engine sure as hell the canucks had had a surprise waiting moss threw his own aeroplane into a tight rolling turn to the right he was more maneuverable than the twoseater on his tail but the biplane kept after him firing straight ahead that wasnt rightthe enemy wasnt supposed to have an interrupter gear yet and they didnt but this enterprising chap had mounted two machine guns on his lower wing planes outside the arc of the propeller he couldnt reload them in flight but while they had ammo he was dangerous any way you looked at him then all at once he wasnt tom innis knocked him down as neatly as he and his chums had ambushed whitby then innis and dudley teamed up against one of the other aeroplanes which caught fire and fell like a dead leaf moss own turn brought him close to the decoy observation aircraft the observer done with photos now blazed away at him from a ringmounted machine gun he fired a burst that made the observer clutch at himself and slumped the pilot over his joystick dead or unconscious if he was unconscious he would die soon his weight on the stick sent the aeroplane nosing toward the ground jonathan moss looked around for more foes he found none the last enemy twoseater had streaked away and had gained enough of a lead while the americans were otherwise engaged to make sure it would not be caught got no guts moss thought with weary anger but for himself and dudley and innis the sky was clear of aircraft he turned the nose of his martin toward the aerodrome wonder what theyll find us to fill the fourth cot in the tent with whitby dead he knew he should have felt more but for the life of him that was all his weary brain would muster rain drummed down on the big canvas refugee tent here and there it came through the canvas and made little puddles on the cold ground one of the puddles was right in front of anne colletons cot unless she thought about it she stepped right into the puddle when she got down a couple of little woodburning stoves in the open space in the middle of the tent glowed red holding the worst of the chill at bay one of the women who made the dreary place her home looked at a watch and said five minutes to twelve a couple of women and girls murmured excitedly anne knew her own face remained stony who cared whether was only five minutes away the one thing for which she could hope from the year to come was that it would be better than the one that was dying she did not see how it could possibly be worse but what did that prove she was no longer so confident as she had been that she had such a good grasp on what might lie ahead come on said the woman with the watchher name was melissa lets sing auld lang syne some of the women did begin to sing softly so as not to disturb those who had gone to sleep instead of staying up to see in the new year off in the distance artillery rumbled throwing shells at the territory still proclaimed to be the congaree socialist republic the territory that shrunken though it was in the fighting of late still included marshlands before the red revolt anne could not have told that distant artillery from distant thunder nor the crack of a springfield from that of a tredegar shed learned a lot these past few weeks and would have given a lot to unlearn it melissa looked across the tent at her youre not singing miss colleton she said her voice full of shrill complaint she was plump and homely and her hair must have stolen its golden sheen from a bottle because the part of it closest to her head had grown out mousebrown thats right im not singing anne replied take it or leave it her tone said she did not feel like being sociable unlike most of the women in the tent unlike their male kin in other tents she could have escaped the refugee camp any time she chose but she could not make herself move any farther from marshlands than she had to she had food of a sort shelter of a sort clothing of a sort yes shed been used to better but she was discovering better while pleasant was less than necessary here she would stay till the rebellion collapsedor till she strangled melissa which might come first the pale pudgy woman with the twotone hair certainly seemed to be trying to promote her own untimely demise glaring at anne she remarked some people dont seem to care about anyone but themselves some people anne said relishing the chance to release the bile that had been gathering inside her ever since the negro uprising began some people dont care about anything except stuffing their faces full of sowbelly till they turn the same color as the meat and the same size as the hog it came from she heard the sharp intakes of breath from all around the tent here we go one woman said in a low voice to another so theyd been expecting a fight had they theyd been looking forward to one anne had thought only of entertaining herself but if she entertained other people tooshe showed her teeth in what was more nearly snarl than smile if she entertained other people toothat was all right melissas mouth opened and closed several times as if she were a fish out of water werent for you damn rich folks the niggers never would have riz up she said at last two or three women nodded at that anne colleton laughed out loud melissa couldnt have looked more astonished had anne flung a pail of water in her face for about two cents anne would have and enjoyed it too its the truth melissa insisted in a pigs eye anne replied sweetly its you who liar melissa squealed her voice shrill if youd have been born on a little farm like me nobody wouldve ever heard of you maybe anne replied and if youd been born at marshlands nobody would ever have heard of you either a classical education came in handy in all sorts of unexpected ways the jibe was so subtle the eager listeners needed a moment to take it in when they did though their hum of appreciation made the wait worthwhile melissa needed longer than most of the women around her to understand shed been punctured when she did she sent anne a look full of hate that look also had fear in it as if shed only now realized she might have picked a dangerous target proves youre a fool for not seeing it sooner anne thought not that shed been in any great doubt of that but melissa did not back away from the argument go ahead make all the smart cracks you want she said but you rich folks you stop that anne said coldly you talk like the negroes with their red flags pitting rich against poor are you a red yourself melissa didnt have the brains to be a red and anne knew it full well but she also calculated the other woman would need some little while to find a comeback that calculation proved accurate melissa looked around the tent for support when she saw she wasnt getting anyno one there for good and sufficient reasons wanted anything to do with either reds or even ideas possibly redshe resumed her attack though she had only one string on her fiddle werent for you rich folks niggersd just stay in their place and what a pile of horseshit anne said drawing gasps on account of the language as shed known she would shed also shocked melissa into shutting up as shed hoped would happen into that sudden and welcome silence she went on yes im rich so what if you ask me its the way the po buckrashe dropped into the negro dialect of the congaree for those two scornful wordslike you treat the negroes that melissa surged to her feet po buckra who are you calling white trash you anne told her and i dont need to give you the name because you give it to yourself by the way you act youre the sort of person who treats a negro like an animal because if you treated him any different he might thinkand you might thinkhe was as good as you she rose too as she spoke and just as well for melissa rushed over to her aiming a roundhouse slap at her face as her brothers had taught her in longago roughandtumble anne blocked the blow with her left hand while delivering one of her own with her right she didnt slap but landed a solid uppercut with a closed fist square on the point of melissas chin the other woman staggered back and sat down hard shed almost stumbled into one of the stoves which would have given her even worse hurt than anne had intended blood dribbled from the corner of her mouth she stared up at anne like a dog that rolls over onto its back to present its belly and throat to a stronger rival before they sent me to this camp anne said i asked them to give me a rifle and let me fight alongside our soldiers and militiamen they wouldnt let memenbut i could have done it and anyone who thinks i cant take care of myself without a gun is making a mistake too nobody argued with her not now shed not only flayed melissa with words but also thrashed her the plump woman slowly stood up and went back to her own cot one hand clutched to her jaw she sat down on the canvas and blankets and didnt say a thing anne spoke into vast silence happy new year before the war people had celebrated the hour by shooting guns in the air these past two new years theyd shot with intent to kill not only on the hour but all day long all week long all month convinced the trouble in the tent was over for the time being anne sat down again as she did so the irony of one of the arguments shed used to discomfit melissa suddenly occurred to her she hadnt been wrong when shed said that poor whites in the confederacy were more concerned about keeping blacks down than were the rich who would stay on top no matter what the relationship between the races happened to be a few miles to the north though the agitators of the congaree socialist republic were using similar arguments to spur their followers to fresh effort against their white foes did that mean the negroes had been right to rebel she shook her head that wasnt what shed had in mind at all they werent building anything up there just tearing down she wondered if anything would be left of marshlands by the time she was finally able to return to it one way or another though she figured she would get along she wasnt melissa to fall into obscurity no melissa hadnt fallen into obscurity shed never been anything but obscure many fates might yet befall anne colleton but not she vowed that one look at that bastard burn ben carlton said his voice as full of joy as if hed never seen anything more beautiful than the flaming factory in clearfield utah watching the utah canning plant go up in smoke felt pretty good to paul mantarakis too as they had a habit of doing the mormons had used the big strongly built building to anchor their line now that it was a blazing wreck theyd have to abandon it which meant the united states army could take one more grinding step on the road toward the last rebel stronghold in ogden three quarters of the way there mantarakis muttered under his breath they were only nine miles from ogden now he could see the town from hereor he could have seen it had the smoke from the great burning here in clearfield not obscured the northern horizon soon all the misbelievers shall be cast into the fiery furnace and receive the punishment they deserve gordon mcsweeney said he had the drum and hose of the flamethrower strapped onto his back he hadnt been the one whod set the canning plant on fire though artillery had managed that had the big guns failed paul could easily imagine the other sergeant going out there and starting the blaze pop poppop short sharp explosions began sounding deep within the bowels of the utah canning plant some poor dead son of a bitchs ammo cooking off ben carlton said paul shook his head doesnt sound quite right for that thump something slammed into the ground hard not ten feet from where he stood almost a year and a half of war had honed his reflexes razorsharp he was flat on his belly before he had the slightest conscious notion of what that thump was better by far to duck and not need to than to need to and not duck another thump came this one from farther away thump a foot soldier nearby started to laugh what the hells so funny stonebreaker paul demanded were under bombardment yeah i know sarge but dan stonebreaker was still laughing he went on i damn near got killed by a can of string beans huh mantarakis looked at the missile that had landed close to him sure as hell it was a tin can that must have exploded in the fire inside the plant he examined the goop inside the can this one wasnt beans looks more like apricots something like that in short order the soldiers also identified beets and peas whenever some more cans exploded inside the factory the men would sing out vegetable attack and take cover more melodramatically than they did against artillery or machinegun fire they took casualties from the superheated produce too one fellow who wasnt wearing his helmet got a fractured skull when a onepound can of peas landed right on his luckless foolish head hot bits of metal almost as dangerous as shrapnel or shell fragments burned several more then the us guns opened up with another barrage when it eased the soldiers went up and over the top and drove the mormons out of clearfield the menand womenwho fought under the beehive banner and the motto deseret fought as hard as ever but there were fewer of them in these trenches than there had been farther south i think weve finally got them on the run captain schneider said he looked like a negro with a bad paint jobhis face was black with soot but smeared here and there just enough to suggest he might be a white man after all paul mantarakis looked down at himself he couldnt see his own face but his hands and uniform were as filthy as those of the company commander come on gordon mcsweeney shouted his voice ringing over the field like a trumpet we have the heretics on the run the more we push them the greater the punishment we give forward mantarakis opinion was that mcsweeney was a hell of a lot crazier than the mormons he didnt say so mcsweeney was after all on his side and the shouts were doing some good pulling us soldiers after the scotsman as he singlehandedly advanced against the enemy he would have advanced though had not a single man followed crazy mantarakis thought again and tramped north himself for the next mile maybe two the going was easy the mormons had no real line of solid fortifications here men retreating before the american advance traded shots with their pursuers but it was hardly counted as a rearguard action maybe we do have em on the run paul said to nobody in particular even the fanaticism of the mormons had to have limitsdidnt it before long he was doubting that again us troops ran up against yet another defensive line prepared in advance and manned by still more determined warriors such a line called for spadework in return and the americans began turning shell holes into a trench line of their own captain schneider pointed west toward some ruins not far from the horizon we want to be careful the enemy doesnt pull a fast one on us those buildings or whats left of them are the ogden ordnance depot itd be just like the mormons to pack em full of powder and touch em off as our forces were moving up to em the buildings were not part of the mormon defensive line which only increased mantarakis suspicions the rebels fought from builtup positions till forced out of them by artillery or more often by the bayonet but before long us troops had not only occupied the ordnance depot buildings they were firing from them on the mormon defenses farther north when an american aeroplane dropped a couple of bombs nearbywhether because it thought the enemy still held the depot or because it simply couldnt aim worth a damn paul never knewthe soldiers shooting from it began waving a big stars and stripes to show under whose ownership it had passed maybe the sight of the american flag in the ruins of the ordnance depot was some kind of signal paul never knew that either but whether by plan or by coincidence the ground rocked under his feet a couple of minutes later he staggered stumbled fell what the hell he shouted while clods of earth rained down on him from the wall of the trench in which hed been standingand from on high too or so it seemed he was afraid the whole trench would collapse through the shaking through the hideous din captain schneider shouted earthquake i was in the presidio in san francisco ten years ago and it was almost like this he managed to stay on his feet make it stop jesus make it stop ben carlton howled it would have taken jesus to make it stop that was surely beyond the power of an infantry captain or even of teddy roosevelt himself mantarakis succeeded in standing the rumble had faded leaving behind an awful silence the sound that came through it was not one he had expected to hear in the wake of a natural catastrophe it was cheering and it was all coming from the mormon lines gordon mcsweeney got up on the firing step or on what was left of it after the ground had shaken the misbelievers are coming out of their trenches and moving forward in an attack he reported his head turned to the left so that he was looking west for once not even his stern rectitude was proof against merely human astonishment theyve blown a hole in our lines you could drive a freight train through he burst out his voice squeaking with surprise what paul got up there beside mcsweeney sure enough any resistance from the us lines ended perhaps a quarter of a mile west of where he stood a great haze of dust and smoke hung in the air west of that but no us gunfire was coming from the ground under the haze and that ground what little he could see of it looked different sagging slumped captain schneiders mouth fell open when he saw that it wasnt an earthquake he said accusingly as if angry at having been mistaken the filthy stinking mormons mined the ground under us and touched off their charge when we got on top of it he went on cursing in a harsh steady monotone mantarakis didnt blame him it looked as if a whole great chunk had disappeared from the us linethe us line in an advance that had been up till then finally turning into the rout it should have been from the beginning then a bullet cracked past his head the mormons werent trying to overwhelm only the part of the line theyd blown to kingdom come they were aiming to take out all of it to throw the americans back as far as they could of itself the springfield jumped to pauls shoulder he aimed and fired a man in overalls went down whether hit or diving for cover he couldnt have said bad position to try to defend captain schneider muttered we dont have a whole lot of wire in front of us he grabbed carlton by the arm and pointed him west go on down as far as there are any live men in the trench and tell them to fall back at a right angle to our lineor what used to be our line we dont want the mormons to be able to roll us all up theyve got their breakthroughwe have to keep them from exploiting it too much carlton went mantarakis admired the captains presence of mind in these circumstances he himself was having enough trouble figuring out what he needed to do worrying about the bigger picture was altogether beyond him schneider was earning his pay todayassuming he lived to collect it right now that didnt look like the best bet in the world more and more americans were shooting back at the mormons now but the enemy kept coming some of them singing hymns as they advanced theyd learned how to move forward against heavy fire some shooting from cover to make their foes duck while others advanced and they used their machine guns aggressively manhandling the heavy weapons forward so they too could make the americans keep their heads down jesus youd think wed have killed all the damned mormons in utah by now captain schneider said he was blazing away with the pistol he wore on his belt and the enemy was close enough to the trench line for it to be about as effective a weapon as a springfield i wish we had paul said with great sincerity he was getting low on ammunition and heaven only knew when more would come forward three mormons popped up out of a shell hole not fifty feet away the winter sun pierced the haze rising from the exploded mine to glitter off the bayonets of the rifles they carried shouting the rebel battle crycome ye saintsthey rushed for the trench gordon mcsweeney laughed the triumphant laugh of a man seeing the enemy delivered into his hands he fired a single jet of flame that caught all three mormons in it only one of them had even the chance to cry out all three jerked and writhed and shrank all in the blink of an eye blackening into roasted husks like those of insects that littered the street below gas lamps of a summers evening come on mcsweeney shouted who wants the next dose you might as well come aheadyoure all going to hell anyhow the mormons kept coming up and down the line machinegun fire hammered many of them into the ground and mcsweeney got to use his infernal weapon several more times after that the rebels avoided the stretch of trench where he was stationed even their spirit proved to have limits here and there they did break into the trench line but they did not force the americans outnot at least in the stretch where the line hadnt been blown skyhigh farther west paul could trace the progress of the fighting only by where the gunfire was coming from by the sound of it the mormons were pushing on south toward clearfield through a gap that was bigger than hed thought how much dynamite did they pack underground anyway he asked as if anyone nearby had the slightest chance of knowing tons captain schneider saidnot an exact answer but one with plenty of flavor to it has to be tons he shook his head in disbelief and if wed been over there instead of over here that thought had already gone through pauls mind if hed been over there instead of over here hed have been blown up or buried or one of any number of other unpleasant possibilities as things stood all he had to worry about was getting shot he hadnt imagined that that could seem an improvement but suddenly it did what do we do now sir he asked form a perimeter try to hold on hope there are enough government soldiers in utah to patch something together again here the company commander answered mantarakis nodded schneider gave straight answers even if they werent the sort you were delighted to hear if he was still alive tomorrow and if he still remembered he wondered which of those competing unlikelihoods was less likely hed have to tell the captain that roger kimball looked out from the conning tower of the bonefish toward the northern bank of the pee dee he hadnt brought the submersible so far up the river this time as he had on his earlier run against the black rebels of the congaree socialist republic not yet but he figured hed end up going farther now than hed managed then tom brearley stood up there with him what do you think of the new improved model tom he asked his executive officer brearley answered with the same serious consideration he usually showed you ask me sir the boat looked better before yeah youre right about that kimball admitted but who the hell ever thought theyd have to modify a sub to do gunboat duty the plain truth was nobody had ever thought of that nobody had imagined the need but need and the bonefish had been in the same place at the same time and soin the charleston shipyard theyd put steel armor all around the threeinch deck guns mount so its crew could shelter against bullets from the riverbank and theyd mounted the machine guns on circular slabs of iron with cutouts in them so the gunners could revolve them with their feet to bear on any target more steel armor coming up from the outer edges of the slabs gave the machine guns protection against rifle fire too kimball pointed toward the bank you ask me thats where our real improvement is oh the marines yes sir brearley said this whole operation really makes you understand what the army is talking about when it comes to how important seizing and holding ground is doesnt it yeah kimball said and then under his breath to hell with the army as far as he was concernedas far as almost any confederate states navy officer was concernedthe army was a dismal swamp that sucked up enormous sums of money most of which promptly vanished without trace money that could have gone for more battleships cruisers destroyers submarines marines of course were the navys admission that some action on dry land did have to be contemplated every now and again no matter how distasteful the notion might be somehow or other somebody with pull had arranged to land a couple of companies of them at the mouth of the pee dee and have them work their way northwest along the river toward the black heart of the congaree socialist republic had anne colleton managed that it was the sort of thing kimball would have expected from her but he didnt know for a fact that she was alive whoever had thought of it it was a good idea the insurgent negroes couldnt ignore the marines and kimball didnt think any irregular troops in the world could stand against them no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than a brisk poppop of smallarms fire broke out along the riverbank he couldnt see where the negroes were theyd concealed themselves in amongst the heaviest undergrowth they could find but he knew where the marines were theyd made a point of keeping in touch with the bonefish and apprising him of their position he didnt have to be a jesuit to own enough logic to realize that the fellows who were shooting and werent marines had to be the enemy all right boys he called to the gun crews lets show the people why they brought us to the dance the machine gun on top of the conning tower opened up a split second before the one mounted on the rear deck the racket was appalling kimballs head started to ache he tried to imagine standing next to a machine gun after a good friendly night in port the mere thought was plenty to make his headache worse he got the response for which hed been hoping the negroes turned a machine gun of their own either captured from confederate forces or donated by the damnyankees on the bonefish as soon as it started firing he and brearley ducked down the hatch into the conning tower being in there under machinegun fire was like standing in a tinroofed shed during one hell of a hailstorm but in firing the negroes machine gun revealed its position the bonefishs machine guns were not the only weapons that opened up on it so did the deck gun at what was pointblank range for a cannon after six or eight shells went into the woods bullets stopped clanging off the side of the conning tower kimball who was closer to the top than brearley grinned down at his exec with luck we just wrecked their gun even without luck we just put a crew who knew how to serve it out of action yes sir brearley said the negroes cant have a whole lot of trained fighting men the more of those we eliminate the faster the rebellion as a whole will fall apart thats right kimball said hell these niggers havent been through conscription where are they going to come by the discipline they need to stand up against some of the best fighting men in the confederate states dont know sir brearley answered then he went on perhaps unwisely i never thought they had the discipline to stand up against whites any kind of way if id known they could fight the way theyve already shown id have been for conscripting them along with us and letting em kill some yankees kimball shook his head so sharply that he almost smacked it against the inside of the conning tower mr brearley i have to tell you thats a mistake he hadnt called his executive officer by his surname since the first couple of days they were working together suppose niggers do make soldiers i dont believe it for a minute but suppose suppose we send em up into the trenches and they do help us lick the damnyankees and win the war then they come back home right you with me so far yes sir brearley answered he sounded like a puppy that doesnt understand why its just been paddled normally roger kimball would have felt some sympathy for him not now he continued all right the war is over we whipped the yankees and we got say five divisions of nigger soldiers coming on home what the hell do we do with em mr brearley theyve been up at the front theyve been killing white men hell weve been payin em to kill white men what are they gonna do when we tell em good boys now go on back to the cotton field and the pushbroom and forget all about that business of shooting people you reckon theyre gonna pay much attention to us the junior lieutenant didnt answer right away when at last he did he said seems to me sir if they fight for us itd be mighty hard to make em go back to being what they were before the war started thing of it is though its already gotten to be hard to put em back where they were so many of em have gone to factories and such making em into field hands again is going to be like putting humptydumpty back together again yeah well itd be a lot worse if they were toting guns kimball insisted the executive officers response hadnt been what hed expected or what hed wanted hell one of the reasons we fought the war of secessionnot the only one but onewas so we could do what we wanted with our niggers not what anybody else wanted us to do yes sir thats true brearley said when we decided to manumit them twenty years later after the second mexican war we did it on our own and if we wanted to reward them for fighting for us would it be so bad sir kimball stared down at the innocentlooking youngster perched on the steel ladder a few rungs below him it was as if hed never seen brearley beforeand in some important ways maybe he hadnt youd let em all be citizens wouldnt you mr brearley youd let niggers be citizens of the csa he might have accused brearley of eating with his fingers or perhaps of practicing more exotic less speakable perversions the executive officer bit his lip but answered sir if they fought for us how could we keep from making them into citizens and if its a choice between having them fight for us or against us which would you sooner see that wasnt the way the argument was supposed to go theyre niggers kimball said flatly they cant fight whites not really yes sir brearley said and said no more he needed to say no more if negroes couldnt fight why was the bonefish coming up the pee dee for a second run against them even more to the point why hadnt the congaree socialist republic and the other red rebel outfits the blacks had set up collapsed weeks before would all this have been prevented had the confederacy let blacks join the army and strange as the notion felt let them vote kimball shook his head the army laborers are reds too and if the black bastards voted theyd have elected that damn lunatic arango last year this time brearley didnt say anything at all when your commanding officer had expressed his opinion and you didnt agree with it nothing was the best thing you could say clang a bullet hit the outside of the conning tower the deck machine guns opened up blasting away at where they thought the fire had come from and then defiantly a machine gunmaybe the same machine gun that had shot at the bonefish beforebegan hosing the submersible down again boom boom boom the deck gun roared out its reply kimball looked down at brearley again the exec still didnt say anything but a silent reproach was no less a reproach because it was silent a portly colonel sporting the little medal that said hed fought in the second mexican war looked down his nose at irving morrell not as smart as we thought we were eh major he said instead of a kaiser bill mustache he sported white wraparound whiskers that with his bald head gave him a striking resemblance to franz joseph the elderly austrohungarian emperor no colonel gilbert morrell answered tonelessly longtime general staff officers had been saying things like that to him ever since the mormons exploded their mines south of ogden the only safe response he had was agreeing with them and also the only truthful one the mormons had done a hell of a lot of damage with those mines and he hadnt anticipated them he looked glumly at the situation map for utah the drive toward ogden the last major rebel stronghold no longer proceeded nearly north with east and west ends of the line parallel to each other the eastern end of the line was still about where it had been anchored against the wasatch mountains but now the line ran back on a ragged slant the western end touching the great salt lake a good ten miles farther south than it had been only frantic reinforcement had kept the disaster from being even worse than it was colonel gilbert studied the map too if we hadnt had to pull those troops out of sequoyah and kentucky major our progress against the confederates would have been a good deal greater than it is yes sir morrell said the usa should have been taking advantage of the uprising within the enemys territory not quelling an uprising of its own he knew that as well as the whitewhiskered colonel knowing it and being able to do anything about it unfortunately were two different things captain john abell came into the room too seeing morrell and colonel gilbert examining the utah situation he came over and looked at the map himself he put his hands behind his back and interlaced his fingers his face assumed an expression of thoughtful seriousness what he looked like morrell thought was a doctor hovering over the bed of a patient who had taken a turn for the worse morrell had seen plenty of doctors with that expression when it had looked as if he would lose his leg unfortunate abell murmured he couldnt very well say anything more morrell outranked him but what he was thinking was plain enough and there was nothing morrell could do about it hed gained the credit for his notion of hitting the mormons from several directions at once to weaken their resistance to the main line of effort because the notion had worked hed come to be thought of as the expert on utah and when something happened there that he hadnt allowed for he found blame accruing to him as readily as credit had before no more readily than credit for credit had come grudgingly even after his success was obvious no one blamed him only grudgingly here he was an outsider a newcomer whod dared to presume himself more astute more clever than general staff veterans when he turned out not to have thought of everything it was as if he hadnt thought of anything the door to the map room opened the newcomer was a lieutenant so junior he hardly seemed to have started shaving he too made a beeline for the map of utah that didnt surprise morrell not any more misery loved company but the lieutenant wasnt interested or wasnt chiefly interested in the strategic situation there he was interested in irving morrell saluting he said general woods compliments sir and he would like to see you at your earliest convenience im coming morrell said when the chief of the general staff wanted you at your earliest convenience he wanted you right now the lieutenant nodded he might have been even greener than his uniform but he understood that bit of military formality behind morrell colonel gilbert spoke to captain abell maybe the general is trying to figure out how we can get blown up on the ontario front too maybe he hadnt intended morrell to hear that maybe but when abell snickered morrell knew he was supposed to have heard that the young captain was too smooth to offer insult by accident escape then became something of a relief the lieutenant led him through the maze of general staff headquarters without offering a word of conversation and responded only in monosyllables when morrell spoke that made morrell fear he did not stand in general woods good graces he clicked his tongue between his teeth he thought he should still have had credit in his account with the head of the general staff utah wasnt the only matter concerning which hed come to woods notice along with a doctor back in tucson new mexico hed suggested the steel helmets that by now had been issued to just about every us frontline soldier that should have counted for something against the troubles in utah woods adjutant sat at a desk in an outer office pounding away at a typewriter hard and fast enough to make the rattle of the keys sound almost like machinegun fire idly morrell wondered if the adjutant had ever heard real machinegun fire they led sheltered lives here major morrell the adjutant said rising politely enough ill tell the general youre here he went into woods private office when he returned a moment later he nodded go on sir hes expecting you the staccato typing resumed as morrell walked past him morrell came to stiff attention before general leonard wood reporting as ordered sir he said saluting at ease major wood answered easily smoke if you care to its not the firing squad for you or the guillotine either one of his hands went to the back of his neck thats what a frenchman comes up with when he thinks about efficiency let it be a lesson to you yes sir morrell wouldnt have minded a cigar but didnt light up in spite of woods invitation the general sighed and studied morrell with that same sickroom expression hed come to loathe from the chief of the general staff the look came naturally hed earned an md before joining the military he sighed again it didnt quite work out did it major i beg your pardon sir morrell replied though hed long since reached the same conclusion its too bad wood said i honestly dont know if this place is good for you but youve certainly been good for it we get insulated against the soldier in the field and what he needs youre a breath of fresh air here too fresh id say by whats happened lately morrell spoke without rancor major its not your fault we did not anticipate the mormons mining us wood said no blame for that will go into your record i assure you but utah had turned into your baby and when the baby turned out to have warts more than warts id say sir morrell answered they wrecked most of a division there and we only had two in the front line that is very much in peoples minds right now wood agreed i think its unfortunate but its true as a result your usefulness here has been compromised through what is i repeat no fault of your own sir if my usefulness here is compromised could you please return me to the field morrell could hear the eagerness in his own voice a chance to get out of philadelphia to get back to real action and general wood was nodding im going to do exactly that major as you know i would have liked you to stay around longer to learn some more tricks of the trade so to speak but situations have a way of changing like it or not my eye is still on you major now though i think it best to have it on you at a distance for a while i assure you once more no imputation of blame will appear in your personnel file morrell barely heard that it mattered little to him what did matter was that he would be able to fight his way now out in the open face to face with the foe he had learned a few things here and was eager to try them out along with everything hed known before he came where do you plan on sending me sir he asked someplace where things are busy i hope youve given the rebels a hard time through the first year of the war wood said which was true only if you neglected the months during which morrell had been flat on his back being the chief of the general staff wood was allowed to neglect details like that he said youve shown a knack for mountain warfare what would you say if they sent you up to the canadian rockies and helped us cut the pacific coast off from the rest of the canucks what would i say sir id say yes sir morrell knew he was all but quivering as he stood there the mountains in eastern kentucky had been little gentle knobby things the canadian rockies were mountains with a capital m full of ice and snow and jagged rocks nobody would figure you could accomplish much on that kind of terrain at this time of year all the more reason to go out and prove people wrong ill make the arrangements then wood said good luck major thank you very much sir morrell said much more for the promised arrangements than the polite wishes the canadian rockiesthe prospect sang in him john abell would think him a fool he didnt care what john abell thought after not too hard a day doing not too muchalthough anyone who heard him talking about it might conclude hed been at slave labor since he tumbled out of his bunksam carsten lined up for evening chow call we been out here a long time wherever the devil here is he said i want to get back to honolulu spend some of the money ive earned i can feel it burnin a hole in my pocket while im standing here yeah well if it gets loose it can come to me vic crosetti said i got one pocket in every set of dungarees lined with asbestos just for money like that carsten snorted so did everybody else who heard crosetti the sailor in front of him a big rangy fellow named tilden winters said wish my stomach had a pocket like that the slop theyve been giving us the past few days i wouldnt feed it to a rat crawling up the hawser you tried feedin it to a rat crawling up the hawser hed crawl back downrats arent stupid carsten said that got a laugh too but it was kidding on the square the dakota had indeed been out on patrol a long time and gone through just about all the fresh food with which shed left port sam went on some of the things the cooks come up with and some of the things the purchasing officers bought figuring wed be stupid enough to eat em winters added that salt beef yesterday tasted like it had been in the cask since the second mexican war or maybe since the war of secession again loud profane agreement came from everybody in earshot there were several conversations farther back in the chow line that carsten couldnt make out but their tone suggested other people were also imperfectly delighted with the bill of fare theyd been enjoyingor rather not enjoyinglately vic crosettis long fleshy nose twitched his nostrils dilated whatever that is theyre gonna do to us it aint salt beef he made the pronouncement in a way that brooked no disagreement a moment later carsten caught the whiff too youre right vic he made a sour face thats fish and its been dead a long long time tilden winters delivered his own verdict you ask me one of the cooks got diarrhea again if that joke aint as old as the navy its only on account of its older sam said the closer he got to the pots from which the horrible smell was coming though the more he wondered if it was a joke this time he took a tray with more reluctance than hed ever known as he came up to one of the cooks the fellow ladled a dollop of stinking yellowish stuff onto the tray then added some sauerkraut a hard roll and a cup of coffee sam pointed at the noxious puddle you got a sick cat johansen funny man everybody thinks hes a cottonpicking funny man the cook said its herrings in mustard sauce and ill say i told you so when you come back for seconds dont hold your breath sam told him which considering the stench was a curse of no mean proportion he took the tray over to a table sat down and looked dubious hey vic maybe the padre ought to give it the last rites crosetti shook his head way it smells up the galley its been dead a hell of a lot too long for that to do any good ever so cautiously carsten scooped up a forkful and brought it to his mouth jesus he exclaimed it tastes as lousy as it smells he looked down at the tray with loathing that was almost admiration i didnt figure it could tilden winters made the taste test too then gulped down his coffee as if it were the only thing standing between him and an early grave seeing their reaction crosetti said i dont think i want any never was much for sauerkraut but tonight most of the time such grumbling would have got them in dutch with the cooks this evening their complaints went unnoticed in the wider tide of revolted complaint echoing through the galley do the officers eat this shit too somebody shouted carstens eyes lit up he knew he could trust crosetti for what he had in mind and winters was a pretty square guy too listen he said if they try and feed us this kind of slop they oughta know what we think of it right sounds good to me winters said sounds damn good to me crosetti nodded too carsten gestured to both of them they all put their heads together after they were done laughing they solemnly clasped hands to seal the bargain tilden winters got up first he slammed his tray down on the stack then started saying to the cooks what everybody else had been saying to one another he had a talent for abuse and certainly a fitting subject for it too a good many other sailors joined in his vehement griping that brought several cooks over both to defend their honor such as it was and to keep the men from getting any creative ideas like flinging the herrings around the galley carsten however had already had a more creative idea than that he and crosetti took advantage of the confusion to slip behind the galley counter grab one of the kettles full of the herringandmustard mixturefortunately one with a lidand slip off before anyone noticed what they were doing as soon as they were away they looked like a couple of sailors on some assignment or other the kettle wasnt that different from any of a number of containers aboard the dakota no one paid them the least attention as they headed up into officer country again looking as if you belonged was more important than actually belonging in a prisonyard whisper crosetti said only slippery part is gonna be if hes in there hey come on carsten said if he is we go sorry sir wrong cabin and we ditch the stuff instead of dumping it either way were jake the cabin door bore a neatly stenciled inscription lieutcmdr jonathan y henrickson chief ships purchasing officer sam knocked his knuckles ringing off steel nobody answered he turned the latch the cabin door opened easily he grinned again hed been wondering if henrickson was the sort who locked his door but no inside the cabin was as neat as a cpos dreams of heaven with everything in its placeexactly in its placeand a place for everything somehow that only made what they were about to do the sweeter come on lets get going crosetti said our luck aint gonna hold forever that might have been cold feet but it didnt sound as if it wasjust a steady professional warning his comrade no his accomplice sam thought of things that could go wrong they took the lid off the kettle instantly the stink of the herrings filled the cabin they proceeded to make sure the stink wasnt all that filled it they methodically poured herrings and mustard sauce over everything they could desk bedding clothes deck everything as soon as theyd finished they got the hell out of there an officer in the passage would have spelled disaster sams shoulders sagged in relief when the long graypainted metal corridor proved bare now all we got to do is look ordinary youre too ugly to look ordinary crosetti retorted but carsten took not the slightest offensetheyd pulled it off when they got back down to their proper part of the ship tilden winters looked a question at them they both nodded so did he that was all he did too before returning to the friendly argument about honolulu whores in which hed been involved before his partners in crime returned the hue and cry started about an hour later grimfaced petty officers started escorting cooks and galley helpers up to officer country near the bridge when the first batch of them returned rumor of what had happened started spreading through the sailors the general reaction was delight if i knew who done that hiram kidde declared although no one yet was quite sure of what that was the first thing id do is kick his ass he was after all a cpo himself but hed suffered through the herrings in mustard sauce too and after that by jesus id pick him up and buy him a beer hell id buy him all the beer he could drink the gunners mate roared laughter what i wouldnt give to see henricksons face none of the cooks knew anything carsten carefully didnt look at crosetti somebody might have noticed them lifting the kettle but it didnt seem as if anyone had that didnt stop the officers from trying to get to the bottom of who had perpetrated the atrocity they kept right on trying all the way up until the dakota docked in honolulu carsten went up before lieutenant commander henrickson himself no sir he said im sorry sir all i know is ships scuttlebutt what did you think of the fish the purchasing officer demanded his thin mouth set in a tight bloodless line sir beg your pardon but i didnt like it worth a damn carsten told him he sighed im afraid everyone says that i hoped the bastards who did this would sing songs about how good it was to try to turn looks away from them no such luck though damn sailors are too damn sly that last was an angry mutter carsten carefully did not smile back when scipio had been butler at marshlands hed wondered how a man could ever get used to the racket of battle even single gunshots had been plenty to set his heart pounding he was inclined to laugh at his former self nowadays he hadnt known much back then he hadnt known much about a lot of things back then as far as a lot of them went he would gladly have remained ignorant too much of what cassius fondly thought of as revolutionary practice looked to scipio an awful lot like what the whites of the confederate states had been doing only stood on its head sometimes the strain of keeping his mouth shut was almost more than he could bear but hed turned his own experience in the days before the congaree socialist republic to his advantage too anne colleton hadnt been able to see past the smooth butlers mask he wore and neither could cassius now fortunately cassius hadnt noticed that he hadnt noticed scipios mask the chairman of the republic had plenty of other things on his mind he somehow managed to make the undyed unbleached cotton homespun of negro field laborers into a good approximation of a uniform and even to look smart in it which was far beyond scipios ability what he could not do though was lose the worried expression on his face aint got enough white folks wid we kip he said now de po buckra de govment press them same as it done to we dey gots to see where dey class intrest is at dey gots to see de revolution fo dey too not jus fo we he shook his head but dey don dey is still de dogs o de massers dat sploits dey cipher dat out fo me kip don make no sense scipio still found revolutionary rhetoric and the congaree dialect an odd blend no one cared about his opinion in such matters though and he was canny enough to keep it to himself cassius had asked his opinion about the other matter though and might even have been ready to hear it scipio decided to take a chance there he pointed to what had been the country courthouse of kingstree south carolina the twostory buffcolored building with a fancy fanlighted pediment built in the style of the early years of the last century no longer flew the stars and bars instead the red revolutionary banner of the congaree socialist republic fluttered above it red paint had been daubed over the name kingstree which was carved into the frieze above the pediment in letters equally bloodcolored someone had given the town a substitute name peoples tree dat kind o thing cassan we done a lot of itdat kind o thing like i say dat skeers de white folks out o dey shoes he said cassius looked back at the courthouse then swung his gaze toward scipio once more as soon as scipio saw the expression on the chairmans face he knew he had failed aint gwine have no backslidin in this here revolution cassius declared we is bringin liberty to de people an if dey is too foolish to be grateful dey pays de price he truly did not seem to realize that terrorizing everyone who was not ardently on his side to begin with would ensure that he drew few new supporters who didnt have great grievances against the confederate states hardly any negroes lacked such grievances but exactly because whites had been inflicting grief instead of taking it the system that had been in place suited them well enough and now he went on de niggers here in peoples tree dey live in the sections dey call buzzards roost and frog level you tink de white folks dey want to live in sections wid they names he spat on the ground to show how likely he reckoned that was scipio didnt think it was very likely either but destroying white privilege only boosted white fear and then cassius wondered why whites fought against the red revolution with everything they had once more scipio tried to suggest that de more we puts they backs up the harder they tries to put us down for a moment he thought hed got through to cassius the chairman of the congaree socialist republic sighed and shook his head he said we git a messenger under flag o truce las night dat a fact scipio said if it was a fact it was news to him that was worrisome in and of itself cassius had been in the habit of letting him know what happened as soon as it happened a change in the pattern was liable to mean scipios status was slipping which was liable to prove hazardous to his life expectancy warily he asked dis messenger what he say he say dat if we doesnt lay down we arms de white folks liable to start killin de niggers in de part o de country we aint managed to liberate what you tink o dat scipios first reaction was horror his second reaction was horror too the confederates could do that and who would be able to stop them the answer to that question came all too clear nobody what you say he asked cassius i say two things the exhunter answered i say if dat de game dey gwine play we got plenty white folks to kill too dey got mo niggersn we got white folks but dey think one white folks worth a whole heap o blacks so dat make dis cocky ristocrat think some scipio nodded it was a brutal ploy but one to match the threat from the csa he had no doubt cassius would carry it out either and was sure the chairman had left no doubt in the confederate envoys mind dat one he said his voice showing his approval what de other cassius startled him by laughing out loud a deep rich nasty laugh the kind of laugh you let out after youd heard a really good really ripe dirty story a moment later scipio understood why for the chairman said i tell he we dont even got to do no killin to git our own back if de pressors start de persecution in de unliberated land i tell he dere plenty white folks wimmin in the congaree socialist republic i don say no more aint got no need to say no more do jesus scipio said confederate laws against miscegenation were harsh and vigorously enforced for some reason confederate white men seemed convinced that the first thing blacks would do given any sort of chance was make a beeline for white women even after the uprisings in the congaree socialist republic it hadnt happened much scipio had heard of a few cases but the revolutionary government had more urgent thingssurvival for instancewith which to concern itself but now to use the mere idea as a club with which to beat the confederates over the headscipio stared at cassius in astonished admiration you is a devil you is cassius took that as the compliment it was intended to be wish you was there this white folks captain he got a seegar in he mouth when i say dat he like to swallow it he laughed again so did scipio the story was worth laughing aboutif it turned out to have a happy ending once he cough de seegar up what he say he say we never dare do no such thing cassius eyes glittered i tell he we is a pack o desprate niggers an who know what we do de whitefolks govment been sayin dat so much an so loud dey lackeys all believes it so he say de honor o de white folks wimmin matter to de govment an dey dont do nuffin to hurt it you know what dat mean mean dey dont want white folks wimmin birthin a pack o yaller babies scipio said cassius nodded with yet another chuckle marx he know bout dis if de peasant wench have de lords baby dey call dat de droit de seigneur what he did to the pronunciation of the french words was a caution but scipio understood him he went on but de lords lady if she have a baby by de peasant everybody run around like chickens wid a fox in the henhouse an if that baby yaller like you say you reckon de white folks think twice then scipio asked dey think fofive times fore they want the likes o me humpin dis fifteenyearold buckra gal wid de hair in de yaller braids cassius said positively and scipio thought he was right the chairman spat again like i got me trouble findin wimmin wants to do it he wasnt boasting just stating a fact hed boasted plenty back when he was chief hunter on the marshlands plantation as chairman of the congaree socialist republic he seemed to find it beneath his dignity scipio prodded him a little drusilla he said slyly he won a chuckle from cassius which relieved him when cassius was thinking about cassius he wasnt thinking about scipio aint looked fo she since de revolution come cassius said maybe i ought to his hands described an hourglass in the air hed used the excuse of fooling around with drusilla whod lived on the late purged jubal marberrys plantation to travel by routes only he knew and bring back weapons from the usa scipio spoke another name cherry hed intended that to come out sly and mantoman too somehow it didnt not quite and cassius stopped grinning his answer this time was serious dat gal she do anything to help de revolution if dat mean sleep wif you she do it that so scipio agreed shed slept with jacob colleton to keep the mistress gassed brother distracted from any of the revolutionary buildup on the plantation and then shed used his abuse of heror what she claimed to be his abuse of herto touch off the uprising at the right moment she was scipio knew sharing a bed with cassius these days but the chairman instead of leering and braggingfor cherry was one finelooking strongminded womanheld up a forefinger in warning she do anything to help the revolution he said anything at all if dat mean cut yo balls off while you sleep she do dat too an she don think twice if he thought scipio would argue with him he was mistaken the former butler was more afraid of cherry than he was of cassius and that was saying something finding out that she also intimidated the chairman was interesting he wondered if and how hed be able to use that before he had a chance to think about it he heard a screaming whistle in the sky coming out of the south several artillery shells burst with thunderous roars a few hundred yards outside of the renamed peoples tree more explosions farther south meant the peoples revolutionary army line was taking a pounding artillery was the one thing the republic conspicuously lacked cassius swore with bitter resignation i don reckon we gwine hold they white folks out of this here town moren another twothree days what we do then now scipio sounded nervous and knew it when cassius was optimistic about the way the fighting was going he was often wrong when he was pessimistic he was always right fall back what else kin we do the chairman answered we maybe lose dis here standup warthe first time he had admitted the possibility which sent a chill up scipios spinebut we go to de deep swamp fight they white folks forever an some o we we jus goes back to bein ordinary niggers again niggers what aint never done nothin de white folk get theyselves in a ruction abouttill we sees de chance we sees de chance an we seize de chance he looked sharply at scipio to make sure he caught the wordplay scipio did and gave back a dutiful smile he hoped that smile covered what was no longer a chill but a blizzard inside him if cassius admitted the revolution was starting to come unraveled then it was and while cassius and some of his followers could no doubt carry on a guerrilla campaign against the confederacy from out of the swamps they knew better than any white man did scipio wasnt any of those followers his skills at living under such conditions were nonexistent he couldnt go back to being an ordinary negro either the uprising had literally destroyed the place hed had in the world what did that leave he saw nothing hed always had trouble believing the revolution would succeed whenever hed oh so cautiously raised doubts no one paid him any mind now he saw himself vindicated much good it does me he thought bitterly george enos looked to his left the woody shoreline of tennessee lay to port of the monitor punishment george looked to his right to starboard were the hills of northeastern arkansas us land forces held the tennessee side of the mississippi god only knew who could lay claim to the arkansas side of the river it wasnt trench warfare over theremore like largescale bushwhacking wayne pitchess came up to enos he was looking toward the arkansas bank of the mississippi too if we ever clear out those rebs well have a better chance of heading down the river and grabbing memphis he said thank you admiral george said which made pitchess glare at him in mock anger he went on we get memphis thats a long step toward cutting the csa right in half sure would be fine now whos the admiral pitchess retorted and enos spread his hands admitting to attempted strategizing his buddys face took on a wistful expression wonder if well ever see the day if it takes us a year and a half to clear a quarter of the river how long do we need to do all of it reminds me of the kind of questions that ran me out of school and onto a fishing boat george said to which pitchess nodded george looked south now toward the distant tennessee city i feel like moses looking toward the promised land knowing im never going to get there sailor you have the wrong attitude pitchess declared sounding very much like the moralebuilding lectures that came out of the navy department and were read with straight faces by the officers of the punishment if only we dont worry about the minefields in the mississippi and the shore batteries that can blow us out of the water and the confederate river monitors well waltz into memphis day after tomorrow now theres sugar for my morning coffee enos exclaimed and wayne pitchess laughed out loud now mr sugar sir what happens if i do worry about those things or even about one of em then it takes longer pitchess said and you get written up for malicious fretting and impeding the war effort they issue you a ball and chain and a sledgehammer and you start making boulders into sand sounds bully dont it the punishment inched down the mississippi everyone on deck kept an eye peeled for the round spiked ugliness of mines george methodically checked and cleaned the action of his machine gun lieutenant kelly would have given him hell had he neglected it but he didnt need the officer riding him to make sure he attended to what needed doing hosing bullets out at the rebs was the likeliest way hed stay alive in an action if the gun jammed that gave the enemy a free shot at him best then that it didnt jam kelly came up behind him and watched in approval so silent that george jumped when he turned around and discovered him there you take care of the equipment the navy man said as if surprised to discover that trait in someone so recently a civilian sir i put in a lot of years on a fishing trawler george answered we didnt spend so much time polishing things as we do here but everything had to work the atlantic he thought was much less forgiving of mistakes than the mississippi it would quite impersonally kill you if you gave it even a quarter of a chance on the other hand the rebels would kill you most personally if they got their chance or even a piece of their chance he supposed that pretty much balanced things out kelly might have been thinking along those lines too for he said we have to be ready every second yes sir enos agreed kelly sighed i do wish we were something more than fire support for the army out on the ocean by all i hear ships do what they need to do not what some fool in greengray thinks they need to do as far as george was concerned a dark blue uniform could also cover up a fool he carefully did not mention that to kelly who was liable to think enos had him in mind with the comment what he did say was crazy kind of war were fighting here sailor if you think im going to argue with you youre the one whos crazy kelly told him snappingturtle navy is a strange sort of place enos would have said more but klaxons started shouting he would have run to his battle station but he was already there what he did do was run a belt into his machine gun then look around to see what he was supposed to use for a target he didnt spot anything word was not long in coming fingers began pointing south squinting enos spotted a tiny smudge of smoke on the horizon it was what the smoke from the punishments stacks might have looked like if seen from a distance of several miles which meant well well lieutenant kelly said whistling tunelessly between his teeth you dont see shiptoship actions very often in river warfare arent you glad weve found an exception for you enos sir ill fight george said you know ill fight expecting me to be glad about it is probably asking too much hed had revenge enough by now for what the rebs had done to him while he was a fisherman he wouldnt have minded spending the rest of the war somewhere far away from the roar of guns and close to sylvia george jr and mary jane he wondered if his little girl remembered him then he wondered if sylvia remembered himhe hadnt had a letter for a while kelly said the next interesting question is whether we saw the rebs before they saw us interesting was such a nice bland word to apply to a question that was liable to determine whether the punishment remained a river monitor or turned into a flaming hulk in the next few minutes with a small noise half whir half grind the turret of the punishment began to revolve the big guns elevated a few degrees before they could fire though a couple of great columns of water fountained up from the mississippi several hundred yards ahead of the monitor secondary splashes rose from shell fragments hitting the water well well kelly said again as calmly as if the toast were too dark to suit him that answers that doesnt it it did and as far as george was concerned it was the wrong answer he felt singularly useless whatever happened in the duel between the punishment and the confederate monitor it wasnt going to happen at ranges where a machine gun would do any good that meant he had to remain a spectator at what might be his own destruction hed had to do that before aboard the submersiblehunting trawler spray he didnt think hed get used to it if he had to do it a hundred times the punishments guns bellowed the deck quivered under enos feet he hoped the fellow at the rangefinder knew his business no way to be certain not with land and the twists of the river hiding the enemy from sight only smoke by which to gauge positionsit was a particularly deadly version of blindmans buff smoke spurted from the punishments stacks now the monitor had to move quickly either that or present a sitting target to its confederate counterpart moving though was as likely to mean heading into the path of enemy fire as away from it george wondered how commander heinrich the skipper of the punishment chose which way to go however he did it he earned his money more shells from the confederate gunboat splashed into the mississippi these were closer so that some of the water they kicked up came raining down onto the deck of the punishment enos wished he had his slicker from the ripple lieutenant kelly though was grinning they havent straddled us he said their next salvo will be long and the one after that if were lucky longer yet that gives us more time to find them and hit them he spoke as if that were all in a days workand so in fact it was george still hadnt got used to the notion that wearing this uniform his days work involved killing people boom boom the guns in the punishments turret replied to the confederate fire george hadnt watched to see whether their muzzles had moved up or down or whether they thought they had the range how firing with only smoke to go by would they know if theyd made a hit by seeing more smoke he supposed or by having the enemy gunboat quit shooting at them it hadnt quit shooting at the moment worse luck as kelly had predicted the next two shells were long enos waited anxiously for the salvo after that how clever was the rebel captain george had heard the confederate shells roaring overhead before they splashed into the mississippi when the roar came again he cringed at his machine gun the shells screaming down sounded as if they were going to land on top of his head brace yourselves boys lieutenant kelly shouted through the screech of their descent theyre one of them hit just to port of the punishment the other half a second later to starboard the monitor staggered under enos feet as if it had fallen into a hole but there were no holes in the mississippior rather there hadnt been that stagger was part of what knocked george off his feet the rest was blast which flung him against the side of the turret a fragment from the shell clanged off the turret about the same time as he hit it a fresh bright scar appeared on the metal less than six inches above his head he sucked in a breath wondering if hed feel the stab of a broken rib or two to his relief he didnt dazedly he sat up and looked around lieutenant michael kelly hadnt been so lucky as he was there kelly sprawled cut almost in half by a piece of flying steel to his horror he saw the lieutenants eyes still had awareness in them kellys mouth moved but only blood came from it then mercifully he slumped down dead and then quite as if nothing had happened the punishments guns bellowed out a reply to the confederate salvo the crew might have been damaged but the warship lived on it would keep doing its job too george had an uneasy vision of a stream of men entering its hatches like beeves being driven into a slaughterhouse the cannon firing and out the far hatches coming not steaks and ground meat but coffins but that would not matter to the ship there would always be more men to feed into it as there were always more men to feed into the trenches across the water came a deep low rumble like thunder far away for a moment enos thought it was the sound of the confederate gunboat firing but he hadnt heard it when the other vessels previous salvos reached for the punishment the distant plume of smoke suddenly swelled enormously at the base hit somebody shouted somebody else yelled blew the bastards to kingdom come george enos started yelling too it was victory then he looked at mike kelly or what was left of him and at the gouge on the metal of the turret so close to where his own head had been as easily as not kelly could have been alive and himself dead and mutilated he yelled louder than ever jefferson pinkard was one of the lucky ones he had a real seat in a real passenger coach on the troop train rumbling through the night somewhere in southern georgia if this is good luck he thought i dont want to know what bad luck is like his backside and the base of his spine ached the seat was bare wood it might have been a car for whites too poor to afford even secondclass fare or it might have been reserved for negroes if pinkard had had to ride in cars like this whenever he took the train he might have risen up himself against the people who made him do it he couldnt stretch his legs out either the space between his seat and the one in front of it was too narrow it would have been too narrow even if he hadnt been kitted out with a pack on his back and a rifle between his knees as things were he felt like a sardine jammed into its tin his newly issued helmet a lowcrowned iron derby with a wide rim on the british model added to that canned feeling what he didnt feel much like was a soldier theyd given him his uniform theyd given him his tredegar theyd given him a couple of weeks screamed instruction at closeorder drill and riflery and then theyd hauled him and his training regiment out of the camp near birmingham and put them on the train even his drill instructorsogres in human shape if ever there were anyhadnt been happy about that werent for them damn niggers yalld be here another month likely tell longer one of them had said when the orders arrived yall was goin up against the damnyankees wouldnt be a man jack of you left breathing in two weeks time but they reckon yall are good enough now to whip them red niggers back into line pinkard turned to the raw private on the hard cramped seat next to his a skinny little fellow with spectacles whod been a clerk in dothan till the conscription bureau finally swept him up stinky he said if them niggers was soldiers as lousy as they say wed have done licked em already dont you reckon my name stinky salley said in tones of relentless precision is christopher hed said the same thing in the same tone to the drill sergeants whod rechristened him after hed evaded bath call one evening hed kept on saying it even after they knocked him downhe had spirit maybe more than his scrawny body could safely contain it did no good the nickname had stuck listen stinky pinkard went on it stands to reason that one of the soldiers who sprawled in the aisle between seats somewhere between sitting and lying spoke up stands to reason somebodys gonna kick your ass you dont shut the hell up and let him sleep if hes able pinkard did shut up he wished he could sleep he was too uncomfortable he wondered how hed be when the train finally stopped probably shuffle around like a ninetyyearold man with the rheumatism he thought the window three seats in front of his suddenly blew in spraying glass around the car he yelped when a piece stung his cheek a warm trickle of blood began to flow what the hell somebody yelled another window blew out this one behind him he felt somethingprobably more glassrebound from his helmet back there a man started screaming oh mother he wailed im hit oh god oh mama realization smote theyre shooting at us the sons of bitchesniggers in the night i mean he couldnt do anything about it either he had no target at which to shoot all he could do was sit there and hope the red revolutionaries would miss him that might have been worse than anything else about itor so he thought till his squad leader a dour corporal named peter ploughman said thank god they aint got but a rifle or two you boys aint never seen what comes out of a train that done got chewed up by a machine gun a couple of the men near the wounded soldier did what they could for him which wasnt much the car held neither a doctor nor a medical orderly jeff had no idea how anybody who knew anything could have come from another car to the hurt man not with the way soldiers had been shoehorned into this train the poor fellow would have to suffer till it stopped and it wasnt stopping the reverse in fact it was speeding up to escape the harassing fire from the brush by the tracks in a speculative voice ploughman said how sneaky are them damn niggers anyways they tryin to spook us into runnin right over some explosives they planted jesus jefferson pinkard said he was glad he wasnt the only one who said it hed thought working at the sloss foundry was such a dangerous job war would hardly faze him afterwards but in the sloss works even leonidas appearances to the contrary notwithstanding wasnt actively trying to kill him and devoting all his ingenuity toward that end the idea that the red negroes might be using a small incident to give rise to a big one as if they were throwing stones to flush game out of deep cover to where it could more readily be shotthat made the hair stand up at the back of his neck acceleration pressed him against his seat things in his pack dug into his spine and his kidneys he tried to brace himself against an explosion that would fling the car off the tracks like a toy kicked by a brat with a nasty temper he didnt think anything he did would help much but sitting there like a lump of coal wouldnt help at all without warning he wasnt being pressed back any more he had everything he could do to keep from going facefirst into the back of the seat in front of him soldiers in the corridor who could not steady themselves tumbled over one another in a shouting cursing heap iron screamed on iron rails and wheels locking in an embrace so hot it sent orangered sparks leaping up higher than the window through which jefferson pinkard stared absurdly he wondered if hed helped bring any of that iron into being groaning and shuddering the train staggered to a halt pinkard saw a couple of men with kerosene lanterns outside their voices came through the shattered windows of the car out out everybody out that wasnt easy or quick it wouldnt have been easy or quick with veteran troops with raw recruits all the shouting of their officers and noncoms helped only so much they got in one anothers way went in this direction when they should have gone in that and generally blundered their way out of the coaches into the night cold nipped at pinkard as he stood in the darkness a coal stove and a lot of bodies had kept the car warm now he got out the overcoat stowed in his pack he wished he were home in bed with emily who would warm him better than any army overcoat could most of the time hed been too busy to notice how much he missed her not now standing here all confused breathing in coal smoke from the engine breathing out fog from the chill just in time the phrase started going through the raw soldiers some of them plainly repeating it without any clear idea of why they were then somebody who sounded as if he did know what he was talking about spoke up we hadnt been able to flag the engineer down in time reckon this here train would have blown sky high what did i say corporal peter ploughman sounded both vindicated and smug pinkard shrugged if ploughman didnt know more about the soldiering business than the men he led he had no business wearing stripes on his sleeves but jeff supposed the noncom did need to impress them every now and again with how much he knew where are we someone asked about twenty miles outside of albany the authoritativesounding voice answered albany or its outskirts had been their destination jeff had a ghastly suspicion he knew how they were going to get there now a moment later that suspicion was confirmed captain connolly the company commander shouted form column of fours grumbling and cursing in low voices the soldiers obeyed again less efficiently than veterans might have done and off they tramped eastward along the line of the railroad toward albany pinkard promptly tripped over a rock almost falling on his face theyre going to pay for this he muttered hed had to make only one night march during his abbreviated training he hadnt liked it for beans now he discovered practice was a lot easier than the real thing after some endless time dawn began to break what had been dark punctuated by deeper black turned into trenches and shell crates and burnedout negro shacks and also the occasional burnedout mansion freshturned red earth in the middle of winter meant new graves there were a lot of them a faint odor of corruption hung in the air niggers are playing for keeps stinky salley remarked in tones full of the same surprise and disbelief pinkard felt never would have reckoned they could do nothin like this whole damn worlds gone crazy since the war started jeff said women workin mens jobs niggers workin white mens jobs and now hell niggers fightin damn near like white men shitfire i wish they were fightin the damnyankees not me that argument had raged on the train and in the training camp as it had all over the confederacy since the negro uprising began stinky salley was on the other side he stared at pinkard with withering scorn yeah and i bet you wish they was marrying your womenfolks too he said dont wish anything of the kind goddammit pinkard said just use your eyes instead of your mouth for a change why dont you if niggers was the happygolucky stayathomes everybody been sayin they are you and me wouldnt be here wed be fighting the usa instead salleys glare didnt get any friendlier but he shut up not even he could argue that they were where theyd figured on being or that negroes in arms werent opposing the confederate government lets get moving captain connolly shouted you dont want to fall out of line hereaboutsniggersd sooner cut your throat than look at you sooner we put these stinking reds down sooner we can get back to whipping the damnyankees train cant do the work so your legs got to keep movin keep moving pinkard did though his feet began to ache he wondered if the csa really could recover from this rebellion as if nothing had happened the captain certainly seemed to think so looking at the devastation through which they were marching pinkard wasnt so sure who would repair everything that had been damaged a couple of negroes a man and a woman were working in a garden plot near the tracks they looked up at the column of white men in butternut had they been rebels a few days before had they hidden their weapons when government forces washed over them would they cut his throat if they saw half a chance or were they as genuinely horrified by the uprising as a lot of blacks in birmingham were how could you know how were you supposed to tell pinkard pondered that as he tramped past them try as he would he found no good answers lucien galtier spoke to his horse as the two of them rolled down the road from riviereduloup toward his home this paving it is not such a bad thing eh oh i may have to put shoes on you more often now but we can go out and about in weather that would have kept us home before nestce pas the horse didnt answer the horse never answered that was one of the reasons lucien enjoyed conversing with it back at the house he had trouble getting a word in edgewise he looked around snow lay everywhere even with overcoat wool muffler and wool cap pulled down over his ears he was cold the road however remained a black ribbon of asphalt through the white the americans kept it open even in the worst of blizzards they did not do it for him of course the racket of an engine behind him and the raucous squawk of a horn told him why they did do it moving as slowly as he could get away with he pulled over to the edge of the road and let the us ambulance roar past it picked up speed racing with its burden of wounded men toward the hospital the americans had built on galtiers land on my patrimony he told the horse it snorted and flicked its ears as if here for once it sympathized with him his land had been in his family for more than two hundred years since the days of louis xiv that anyone should simply appropriate a piece of it struck him as outrageous had the americans no decency he knew the answer to that only too well major quigley the occupier in charge of dealing with the quebecois had blandly assured him the benefits of the road would make up for having lost some of his land quigley hadnt believed it himself hed taken the land for no other reason than to punish lucien but it might even turn out to be so and what if it is lucien asked now sensibly the horse did not respond how could anyone even a horse make a response thievery was thievery and you could not compensate for it in such a way did they reckon him devoid of honor devoid of pride if they did they would be sorryand sooner than they thought so he hoped at any rate another ambulance came up the road toward him he took his time getting out of the way for this one too that was a tiny way to resist the american invaders but even tiny ways were not to be despised perhaps a man who might have lived would die on account of the brief delay he glanced toward the west ugly clouds were massing there another storm coming even on a paved road galtier did not care to be caught in it he flicked the reins and told the horse to get moving the horse which had been listening to him for many years snorted and increased its pace from a walkto a walk here came a buggy toward his wagon he stiffened on the seat the man in the seat did not wear american greengray american soldiers at least had the courage to fight their foes face to face however reprehensible their other habits might be the small plump man in black there far from fighting his foes embraced them with a fervor galtier found incomprehensible and infuriating the priest waved to him bonjour lucien he called bonjour father pascal galtier called back adding under his breath mauvais tabernac even englishspeaking canadians thought the quebecois way of cursing peculiar but lucien did not care it satisfied him more than their talk of manure and fornication father pascals cheeks were always pink and doubly so with the chilly wind rising as it was now i have given those poor injured men a bit of spiritual solace he said smiling at lucien do you know my son a surprising number of them are communicants of our holy catholic church no father i did not know that galtier did not care either they might be catholics but they were unquestionably americans that more than made up for a common religion as far as the farmer was concerned father pascal saw the world differently cest vraiits true he said father pascal lucien thought saw the world in terms of what was most advantageous for father pascal the americans were here the americans were strong therefore he collaborated with the americans nodding again to lucien he went on i had the honor also to see your lovely daughter nicole at the hospital in her whites i did not recognize her for a moment the doctors tell me she is doing work of an excellent sort you must be very proud of her i am always very proud of her lucien said that had the virtue of being true and polite at the same time something which could not be said about a good many other possible responses galtier glanced over toward the building clouds and now father if you will pardon me the horse broke into a trot this time as if it truly did understand how much he wanted to get away go with god my son father pascal called after him he waved back toward the priest hoping the snowstorm would catch him before he got back to riviereduloup if lucien was to reach the farmhouse he had to drive past the hospital it was almost as if major quigley had set a small town on his property the hospital certainly had more ambulances coming to it and leaving it than riviereduloup had had motorcars at the start of the war it also had a large gasolinepowered generator that gave it electricity while trucks and big wagons brought in coal to keep it warm against the worst a quebec winter could do people bustled in and out the front door those going in pausing to show their bona fides to armed guards at the doorway a doctor stood outside the entrance smoking a cigarette red spattered his white jacket out came a us officer in greengray a formidable row of ribbons and medals on his chest and an even more formidable scowl on his face lucien would have bet he hadnt got what he wanted whatever that was and here came a couple of women pulling overcoats on over their long white dresses to fight the chill outside galtier steered the wagon toward them and reined to a halt bonsoir mademoiselle he said formal as a butler may i offer you a ride to your home nicole galtier smiled at him oh bonsoir papa she said i didnt expect you here at just this time she started to climb into the wagon then turned back toward the other nurse see you tomorrow henrietta see you tomorrow henrietta said she went over to the doctor he gave her a cigarette and lighted it with his own leaning his face close to hers the horse had taken several strides before lucien fully noticed what hed heard you spoke to her in english he said to nicole i am learning it yes she answered and tossed her head so that the starched white cap she wore almost flew off if i am to do anything that is important and not just wash and carry i have to learn it she glanced at him to see how he was taking that when he didnt say anything she went on you have learned it and use what you have learned is that not so yes it is so he told her and wondered where to go from there discovering he had no idea he kept quiet till he had driven the wagon into the barn go on to the house he said then ill see to the horse and be in with you in a few minutes brushing down the animal and making sure it had food and waterbut not too much of eitherwas a routine he took for granted he had heard that rich farmers had motorcars of their own and tractors and threshers with motors too he wondered what they thought of doing without horses he shrugged he was not a rich farmer nor likely to become one as he often did he sighed with pleasure on walking into the farmhouse not only was it warm it was also full of the good smells of cooking is that chicken stew he called in the direction of the kitchen maries voice floated resignedly out yes lucienchicken stew one day i swear i shall buy a zebra or a camel so i can roast it in the oven and not have you know at first sniff what it is zebra would probably taste like horse their son georges said and then exercising his gift for the absurd although it could be the meat would have stripes thank god we have not been hungry enough to have to learn the taste of horse lucien said thank him twice for the beast we have is so old he would surely be tough charles said i have read in a book on the french foreign legion that the roasted hump of a camel is supposed to be a great delicacy since a man has to be a foola brave fool yes but a foolto join the foreign legion i do not think he is to be trusted in matters of taste galtier said and i do not think a camel would do well in the snow you do not have reason papa charles said glad to show off knowledge at his fathers expense not only are there camels that live in the desert there are also othersbactrians they are calledthat live in cold countries but not in quebec lucien said firmly he caught the evil gleam in georges eye and forestalled him nor for that matter have we any great herds of zebras here georges pouted he hated having his father anticipate a joke over the supper table they talked of camels and zebras and of more practical matters like the price chickens were bringing in riviereduloup whether the kerosene ration was likely to be cut again and what a good bunch of applejack this latest one from their neighbor was warms you better than the fire does charles said sipping the potent illegal popular stuff and nicole as had become her habit talked about the work she did at the hospital the officer had a wounded leg full of pus and i helped drain it she said i did not do much of course as i am so new but i watched with great care and i think i will be able to do more next time her nose wrinkled the smell was bad but not so bad that i could not stand it susanne screwed up her face into a horrible grimace thats disgusting nicole she exclaimed freighting the word with all the emphasis she could give the rest of her sisters older and younger nodded vehemently gently marie said perhaps not at supper nicole it is my work nicole said sounding as angry as lucien had ever heard her we all talk about what we do in the day am i to wear a muzzle because i do not do what everyone else does she got up and hurried away from the table lucien stared after her when he had hesitated over letting her take the job at the hospital it had been because he feared and disliked the company into which she would be thrown there he had never thought that simply by virtue of doing different things from the rest of the family she might become sundered from itand might want to become sundered from it he knocked back his little glass of applejack and poured it full again the problems he had expected with nicoles job had for the most part not arisen the problems he had not expectedlife is never simple he declared maybe it was the applejack but he had the feeling of having said something truly profound gas shells jake featherston said enthusiastically isnt that fine the damnyankees have been doing it to our boys and now we get to do it right back michael scott grinned at him chokes me up just thinkin about it sarge he said and did an alarmingly realistic impression of a man trying to cough chlorinefried lungs right out of his chest after the laughter at the gallows humor subsided he went on when they going to have em for the big guns god knows jake said rolling his eyes best i can tell we got our factories stretched like a rubber band thats about to break and hit you a lick between the eyes theres a war on case you havent noticed so they got to make more stuff than they ever reckoned they could they got to do that with most of the men who were workin in em before totin guns now and they got to do it with half the niggers maybe up in arms instead of doin the jobs theyre supposed to be doin damn lucky the yankees aint ridden roughshod over us that produced a gloomy silence it also produced several worried looks toward the north the first us attacks after the red uprising had been beaten back and the damnyankees as if taken by surprise that they hadnt easily overwhelmed the confederates seemed to have paused to think things over signs were though that they were building up to try something new whenever the weather was decent us aeroplanes buzzed over the confederate lines spying out whatever they could confederate reconnaissance reported more activity than usual in the yankee trenches featherston added one thing more the artillerymans tipoff their guns been firing a lot of registration shots lately when a few shells came over falling around important targets you started worrying that usually meant the other sides artillery was taking exact ranges before too long a lot more than a few shells would be dropping thereabouts sarge we got these gas shells to go with the rest of what we shoot michael scott said he glanced around nobody was in earshot of the gun crew even so he lowered his voice with things like they are with captain stuart and all we gonna be able to get enough of em to shoot to do any good thats a damn fine question jake told him wish to jesus i had me a damn fine answer for it way things used to be we had shells the way a fellow been eatin green apples gets the runsthey were just fallin out of our ass on account of jeb stuart iii was jeb stuart iii and that was plenty to get him everything he wanted nowadays he sighed nowadays i reckon id sooner have me captain joe doakes in charge of the battery or somebody else no one ever heard of we might not get a whole raft o shells but we wouldnt get shortchanged neither and i got the bad feeling were gonna be from here on out everybody in the gun crew sighed jeb stuart iii wasnt richmonds fairhaired boy any more now he was under a dark cloud and that meant the whole battery had to go around carrying lanterns sooner or later stuart would pay the price for not having kept a better eye on pompey trouble was the rest of the battery would pay it along with him featherston filled his coffee cup from the pot above the cookfire the coffee was hot and strong once youd said those two things youd said everything good about it you could nothing was as good as it had been before the negroes rose up against their white superiors not the chow not the coffee not anything damn niggers jake muttered if we lose this damn war its their fault stabbing us in the back like they done we could have licked the damnyankees easy wasnt for that as if to contradict him us artillery opened up in earnest then as soon as he saw the flashes to the north as soon as he heard the roar of explosions and the scream of shells in the air jake knew the enemy guns werent doing registration fire this time they meant it the howitzer he commanded had a splendid view north come on he shouted pointing toward the gun lets give it back to em he didnt think any of his men could have heard him not through the blasts of shells landing close by and the whine and hiss of shrapnel balls and flying fragments of shell casing but theyd been bombarded before they knew what to do in less than a minute they were flinging shellsgas and shrapnel bothback at the us lines those lines were working vomiting out men the way an anthill vomited ants after you kicked it featherston whooped when shells burst among the damnyankees swarming toward the confederate lines whooped when men flew through the air or sprawled bonelessly on the ground or threw themselves flat and stopped moving forward but a godawful lot of damnyankees kept right on toward the confederate trenches which were taking a fearful pounding the infantry in the trenches couldnt do any proper shooting at the advancing yanks not with tons of metal coming down on their heads so much dust and dirt flew up from the confederate lines jake had trouble spotting targets at which to aim his piece theyre gonna get in he yelled if the us troops didnt just get into the confederate lines but also through themif that happened the confederate position in northcentral maryland was going to come unglued in a hurry back in his training days hed learned that the threeinch howitzer with its muzzle brake to keep recoil short and not fling the carriage backwards at every shot could in an emergency fire twenty rounds a minute most of the time that was only a number the normal rate of fire was less than half as fast no picky drillmaster was standing over the crew with a stopwatch now as had been so back on the firing range but if jake and his men didnt smash every firingrange record ever set he would have eaten his hathad he had any idea where the damn thing was in spite of the shells falling on them the other guns of the battery matched his round for round or came close enough as to make no difference and in spite of all they did the damnyankees kept coming men started emerging from the confederate trenches up aheadmen in butternut at first some of them looked for new firing positions from which to shoot back at the us soldiers who had forced them out of what had been the safety of their lines others were running nothing else but then featherston spotted men in greengray shrapnel he shouted and depressed the barrel of the howitzer till he was all but firing over open sights he yanked the lanyard the shell roared again he watched men tumble they were closer now and easier to see he could even spy the difference in shape between their roundish helmets and the tin hats some of the confederate troops were wearing a rifle bullet cracked past the guns splinter shield and then another he shook his head in dismay hed done a lot of shooting at enemy infantry during the warthat was what the threeincher was for up till now though hed never been in a spot where enemy infantry could shoot back at him running low on ammunition somebody shouted in the chaoshe wasnt sure who shells from the guns of the battery still in action tore great holes in the ranks of the oncoming us soldiers but they kept coming nonetheless on a wider front than the field guns could sweep free bring the horses up to the gun and to the limber jake shouted he looked around for the negro laborers attached to the gun they were nowhere to be seen he wasted a few seconds cursing nero and perseus who had been with the battery from the day the war started would have done as he told them no matter how dangerous the work was hed seen that but nero and perseus had been infected by the red tide too and had deserted when the uprising broke out god only knew where they were now if the niggers wont do it reckon we got to take care of it our own selves will cooper said along with a couple of other men he went back to the barn nearby and brought out the horses the animals were snorting and frightened jake featherston didnt worry about that he was plenty frightened himself thank you very much and if they didnt get the howitzer out of there in a hurry hed be worse than frightened and he knew it hed be dead or captured and the gun lost a disgrace to any artilleryman god damn it to hell what the devil do you think youre doing it wasnt a shoutit was more like a scream for a moment featherston didnt recognize the voice though hed heard it every day since before the war his head snapped around there stood jeb stuart iii head bare pistol in his hand eyes blazing with a fearful light sir featherston pointed ahead toward the advancing yankees sir if we dont pull back he didnt think he needed to go on the confederate front was dissolving a bullet ricocheted off the barrel of the cannon if they didnt get out theyd be picked off one by one with no chance of doing anything to affect the rest of what was plainly a losing battle jeb stuart iii leveled the pistol at his head sergeant you are not going anywhere we are not going anywhereexcept forward there is the enemy we shall fight him as long as we have breath in us is that clear uh yes sir jake said the barrel of the pistol looked as wide to him as that of his howitzer call me naive will they call me stupid say my career is over stuart muttered not to featherston maybe not even to himselfmore likely to some superior who wasnt there perhaps to his father he had jake realized decided to die like a hero rather than living on in disgrace if he took a gun crew to glory with him so what they unhitched the horses and fired a couple of shells at the damnyankees stuart made no effort whatever to seek shelter on the contraryhe stood in the open defying the yankees to hit him in short order he went down blood spurting from a neck wound the gun crew got the horses hitched again in moments under featherstons bellowed orders they got the howitzer out of thereand captain stuart too they saved the gun stuart died before a doctor saw him chester martin wished hed had a bath any time recently he wished the same thing about the squad he led of course with so many unburied corpses in the neighborhoodso many corpses all up and down the roanoke frontthe reek of a few unwashed but live bodies would be a relatively small matter turning to the distinguished visitor without whose presence he wouldnt have cared nearly so much about the bath he said you want to be careful sir were right up at the front now you give the rebel snipers even the littlest piece of a target and theyll drill it they wont know youre a reporter not a soldierand the bastards probably wouldnt care much if they did know dont you worry about me sergeant richard harding davis answered easily ive been up to the front before yes sir i know that martin answered davis had been up to the front in a good many wars over the past twenty years or so ive read a lot of your stuff davis preened he wasnt a very big man but extraordinarily handsome and dressed in greengray clothes that were the color of a us uniform but much snappier in cutespecially when compared to the dirty unpressed uniforms all around him im very glad to hear it he said a writer who didnt have readers would be out of work in a hurryand then i might have to find an honest job he laughed so did martin who asked are you all right sir handsome or not davis was an old geezerwell up into his fiftiesand looked a little the worse for wear as he strode along the trench he was game enough though im fine bit of a bellyache maybe i eat army chow when i come up to the front god knows how you poor souls survive on it it probably wasnt anything like the fancy grub he ate back in new york city martin thought with a touchmore than a touchof envy then davis went on as a matter of fact sergeant i know your work too thats why i chose this unit when i decided to visit the roanoke front beg your pardon sir for a second martin didnt get it richard harding davis spelled it out for him teddy roosevelt recommended you to me as a matter of fact he said you knocked him flat and jumped on him when the rebs started shelling your men while he was on an inspection if youd do it for him he said you might even do it for me he flashed that formidable smile again do you want to know the truth sir martin said id almost forgotten about that been a lot of war since if you know what i mean davis produced a notebook from a coat that had as many pockets as josephs must have had colors and scribbled in it if you forget about the president of the united states sergeant what do you remember martin chewed on that when you thought about it it was a damn good question most of what happened in the trenches wasnt worth remembering most of what happened in the trenches you would have paid anybody anything to forget davis right behind him he turned out of a traverse and into a long firebay and there found his answer when you get down to it sir he said the only thing you want to remember is your buddies here came paul andersen whod been with him from the start after so many casualties that alone was plenty to forge a bond between them here came specs peterson who looked as if he ought to be a pharmacist and who was probably the meanest roughest son of a gun in the whole battalion here came willard tarrant joe hammerschmitts replacement who carried the name of packer because he worked at the armour plant in chicago fellas this heres richard harding davis martin said and let them tell the correspondent their own stories they had plenty of stories to tell him if you stayed alive for a week at the front line even a week where the official reports called the sector quiet youd have stories enough to last you the rest of your lifestories of courage and suffering and fear and endurance and everything else you could name experience was intense concentrated while it lastedif it lasted davis hand raced over the pages of the little notebook trying valiantly to keep up with the flood of words at last after what might have been an hour or so the tales that came of themselves began to flag to keep things going the correspondent pointed east across the rusting barbed wire across the cratered horror of nomansland over toward the confederate line and asked what do you think of the enemy soldiers now packer and specs and the rest of the privates fell silent and looked to martin and andersen it wasnt martin judged so much because they were sergeant and corporal more because theyd been there since the beginning and had seen more of the rebels than anybody else chester paused to gather his thoughts at last he said far as i can see rebs in the trenches arent a hell of a lot different than us theyre brave sons of bitches ill tell you that weve got more big guns than they do and there was a good long while there last summer when we had gas and they didnt but if you wanted to move em back you had to go in there with more men than they had and shift em no way in hell they were going to run then and they dont now either paul andersen nodded thats how it is all right theyre just a bunch of ordinary guys same as we are too damn bad they didnt let us have a real christmas truce last year way there was in nice to be able to stick your head out of the trench one day a year and know somebodys not going to try and blow it off but what the hell can you do ill tell you something corporal davis said the reason there wasnt a truce last year is that the powers that bein philadelphia and richmond both from what i hearmade certain there wouldnt be because they watched the whole war almost fall to pieces on christmas day what they think wed have quit fighting packer tarrant shook his head at the very idea got to lick em taking longer than anybody figured but well do it several men nodded most of them new to the front richard harding davis wrote some more then asked if theyre just like you are in the trenches what keeps you going against them in a different tone of voice the question would have been subversive as it was it produced a few seconds of thoughtful silence then specs peterson said hell and breakfast mr davis we done too much by now to quit aint we we got to beat those bastards or all of that dont mean nothin thats about the size of it chester martin agreed one of my grandfathers he got shot in the war of secessionand for what the usa lost everything he did was wasted jesus itd be awful if that happened to us three times in fifty years corporal andersen pointed over to the enemy lines and the rebs they dont want to find out what losing is all about either thats why they keep cominat us i guess been a lot of what the newspapers been calling battles of the roanoke anyway as if to underscore his words a machine gun started rattling away a couple of hundred yards to the north rifles joined in and for five or ten minutes a lively little firefight raged gradually the firing died away anything might have started it martin wondered if anyone had died in the meaningless exchange of bullets are the rebels any different since their negroes rose in revolt davis asked the soldiers looked at one another not when were coming at them thats for sure martin said and everybody nodded you think about it though they havent been coming at us as hard lately course its been winter too so i dont know just how much that means confederates more inclined to stand on the defensive richard harding davis said the words aloud as if tasting them before setting them down on paper then he grunted it sounded more like surprise than approval he looked at martinno through martin his mouth opened as if he was about to say something else instead he swayed the notebook and pencil dropped from his hands into the mud his knees buckled he collapsed jesus martin and the other soldiers crowded round the fallen reporter martin grabbed for his wrist he found no pulse hes dead the sergeant said in blank amazement davis body bore no wound he could see he knew a shell fragment as tiny as a needle could kill but no shells had landed anywhere close by his shouts and those of his squadmates brought a doctor into the front line within a couple of minutes the soldiers wouldnt have rated such an honor but davis was important the doctor stripped the correspondent out of his fancy notquiteuniform try as he would he couldnt find a wound either his heart must have given out on him poor fellow he said and shook his head hes nothe wasntthat old but hed been working hard and he wasnt that young either isnt that a hell of a thing martin said as a couple of soldiers carried the mortal remains of richard harding davis to the rear terrible paul andersen agreed you got a cigarette makings martin answered and passed him a tobacco pouch hell of a thing you ever expect to see man die of what do you call emnatural causesup here what a fucking waste andersen laughed at that as he rolled coarse tobacco into a scrap of newspaper after a moment martin laughed too yes graveyard humor came easy at the front it was the only kind that did there is there is there is a god in israel george armstrong custer chortled brandishing a newspaper at his adjutant sir abner dowling said hed already seen the army newspaper he hadnt noticed anything in it to make him want to do a buckandwing he wondered what the devil general custer had spotted to bring him out of the badtempered depression in which hed been sunk ever since his wife got to kentucky custer wasnt just happy he was gloating look he said pointing to a story on the second page of the paper richard harding davis had the good grace to drop dead on a visit to the front i wish he would have done it while he was on this front but damn me to hell if ill complain davis had written about custer in less than flattering terms a capital crime if ever there was one as far as the general commanding first army was concerned sir his work is being judged by a more exacting critic now than any editor he knew here dowling said which not only smacked of truth if you were a believing man as dowling was but was noncommittal letting custer pick for himself the way in which the late correspondent was likely to be judged he picked the way dowling had been sure he would how right you are major which means theyve got him on a frying pan hotter than the one that does my morning baconand hell stay there a lot longer and get a lot more burnt not that thats easy these days he hadnt stopped complaining about the ways the meals that were cooked for him had gone downhill since olivia left he hadnt stopped complaining to dowling that is he hadnt said one word where his wife was liable to hear it to dowlings regret the old boy had a keenly developed sense of selfpreservation still snorting with glee the illustrious general waddled into the kitchen dowling suspected the corporal doing duty at the stove for the time being would hear fewer fulminations than usual when custer was in a good mood everything looked rosy to him trouble was he wasnt in a good mood very often libbie custer came downstairs a moment later she was only a few years younger than her husband and had the look of a schoolmarm who would sooner crack a ruler over her pupils knuckles than teach them the multiplication table her eyes were the gray of the sky just before it settles down to rain for a week when she fixed her gaze on dowling he automatically assumed hed done something wrong he didnt know what yet but he figured mrs custer would tell him she however chose an indirect approach did i hear the general laughing just now she often spoke of her husband in that oldfashioned way uh yes maam dowling answered he had not taken long to decide that at least two thirds of the brains in the custer family resided in the female of the species libbie custer did her best to prove herself more deadly than the male too where is she she hissed ill send her packing in a hurry i promise you that and afterwards ill deal with the general too she sounded as if she looked forward to it moreshe sounded as if shed had practice at it too but dowling said truthfully if not completely theres no woman here maam it was only dont give me that mrs custer cut him off so abruptly he was glad she didnt have a knife in her hand hes been doing this for forty years the philandering skunk ever since he found that pretty little cheyenne girl monahseetahdid you ever think youd learn how to say stinking whore in cheyenne major dowling when he laughs that way hes done it again i know him i ought to by now dont you think maam youre wrong that was truthful too if only technically dowling had enough troubles serving as intermediary between custer and the rest of first army serving as intermediary between custer and mrs custer struck him as conduct above and beyond the call of dutyfar above rather desperately he explained for a wonder libbie custer heard him out for another wonder she didnt call him a liar when he was done instead she nodded and said oh that explains it mr richard harding davis george armstrong custer had sworn at davis hed said he would use davis reportage in the outhouse nothing he had said though packed the concentrated menace of those four words mrs custer went on yes that would explain it thank you major she swept into the kitchen her long gray dress almost brushing the ground as she walked she clung to the bustle which had gone out of style for younger women a few years before as far as dowling was concerned it made her look more like a cruising manofwar than a stately lady but no one had sought his opinion no one was much in the habit of seeking his opinion from inside the kitchen came the sounds of mirth and gaietydowling couldnt hear the words but the tone was unmistakable the general and his wife were happy as a couple of larks dowling scratched his head a moment before mrs custer had been ready to scalp her husband now the two of them seemed thick as thieves it didnt figure and then after a bit it did libbie custer would come down on george like a dynamited building for any of his personal shortcomings given the scope of those she had plenty of room for action but mrs general custer protected general custers career like a tigress bad press jeopardized the general not the man i couldnt live like that dowling muttered and yet the custers had been wed since the war of secession marital bliss dowling had his doubts he shook his head he didnt have doubts he damn well knew better whether they were what any outsider would call happy or not though theyd grown together he doubted one of them would live more than a year or two if the other died libbie custer looked ready to last another twenty years dowling wasnt so sure about the general but hed have bet custer would have keeled over from a heart attack or a stroke not richard harding davis you never could tell the two custers came out of the kitchen arm in arm for the moment they presented a united front against the world and would probably go right on doing so till libbie found out for sure about olivia to his wife the general said i do have to fight the war now ill see you in a while she nodded and went upstairs custer turned to dowling major ill want to consult with you about the artillery preparation for the attack on bowling green give me ten minutes to study the maps then come into my office yes sir dowling said custer was acting more like a proper general these days that was likely to be libbies influence too the brains of the outfit dowling thought again while he was waiting for custer to finish studying an unlikely notion in and of itself the kitchen door opened again uh sir it was the corporal whod been frying everything in sight since olivia made herself scarce what is it renick dowling asked the corporal who looked more like a lightheavyweight prizefighter than a cook opened his left hand to display a small gold coin look sir the general gave me a quarter eagle said i was the best cook anybody could ask for said hed write me a letter of commendation any time i wanted good for you renick dowling said ill make sure he does that today davis death was doing the cook some good anyhowbut if custer didnt sign that letter while still in the warm glow of euphoria renick didnt stand a chinamans chance of getting it added to his record not on skill alone he didnt dowling hurried to the tiny downstairs room he used as his own office ran a sheet of army stationery into his typewriter and banged out the letter eventually mrs custer would go back to michigan and olivia would replace corporal renick if he had that letter in his file he might end up cooking for some other officer not in the trenches he seemed a good kidwhy not give him a better chance to come out of the war in one piece and sure enough general custer did sign the letter fine lad he said that youngwhatever his name is renick sir dowling put the letter back in the manila folder from which hed produced it ah yes of course custer said which meant he hadnt heard the answer but was too vain to ask his adjutant to say it over again louder he picked up a pointer and aimed it at the situation map of kentucky i am of the opinion major that bowling green falls at the next onslaught seeing as were approaching from the west and the north the confederates will have a hard time keeping us out yes sir dowling agreed but fighting in builtup country can be expensive as the devil as you said before we need to use our superiority in artillery to the best advantage custer hadnt actually said anything quite like that but had talked about the artillery preparation which as far as his adjutant was concerned came close enough he scratched at his mustache well give the rebs enough artillery preparation to blow them right back to the war of secession he growled and then well follow it with infantry and then with cavalry i think the ground troops may well be able to capture the city without the cavalry sir dowling said custer would probably remain sure to his dying day that cavalry could exploit any breakthrough the infantry made try as dowling would he hadnt been able to convince the general otherwise breakthroughs of any sort looked to be illusory in this war and if they came the cavalry wasnt going to exploit them not till somebody bred an armorplated horse it wasnt ground troops custer grumbled artillery he let out a long wheezy sigh the spirit has gone out of warfare major its not as it was when i was a young man no sir dowling wondered if he would be saying the same thing if he lived till or so maybe he would but dowling hoped he wouldnt try to turn an entire army on its head because he didnt care to adjust to a new reality custer whacked the map with the stick and after bowling green falls major we advance on nashville we took it in the war of secession and we held it too till the stinking limeys and frogs made us give it back when we take it this time well keep it ah but a mans reach should exceed his grasp or whats a heaven for the words from browning ran through dowlings head theyd needed a year and a half to get tonot yet into but tobowling green at that rate another year might with luck see them on the cumberland by the way custer talked he expected to be there week after next as grand strategy what he said made a certain amount of sense turning it from grand strategy to tactical maneuvering thoughwas liable to fall squarely on abner dowlings broad shoulders well need help from the navy he warned and up till now their monitors havent been able to get anywhere near nashville well then seems to me that theyll need help from us too custer observed the comment was so much to the point that dowling frankly stared at the general commanding first army hed been glad to have libbie custer come visit for no better reason than to see her husband dismayed but if her presence meant custer turned into something close to the general first army needed dowling hoped shed never leave and if that meant custer didnt get to jump on olivias sleek brown body any more everyone had to make sacrifices to win the war hell dowling thought ill even put up with renicks godawful cremated bacon cincinnatus pulled the wool sailors cap down over his ears to keep them warm as he walked to the covington wharves the sun wasnt up yet though the eastern sky glowed pink days were getting longer now noticeably so but it was still one snowstorm after another he walked past a gang of us soldiers they were busy tearing posters off walls and pasting up replacements some of the ones they were destroying had been smuggled up from the unoccupied csa cincinnatus turned a chuckle into a cough so the soldiers wouldnt notice him he knew about those the other posters going down were printed in red and blackimages of broken chains stalwart negroes with rifles and revolutionary slogans cincinnatus knew about those too he paused for a moment to have a look at the posters the us soldiers were putting up to replace the confederate and red propaganda the art showed three eaglesthe us bald eagle the german black one and the twoheaded bird symbolizing austriahungarywith their talons piercing four redwhiteandblue flags those of the csa england france and russia the message was one word victory not bad he murmured and disguised another chuckle behind a glove hed never expected to become a connoisseur of poster propaganda not before the war started a lot of things hed never expected had happened since the war started he saw more of the threeeagle posters as he came closer to the riverfront and nodded to himself so the yanks were going to be putting out a new type were they it had the look of the first in a series he wouldnt have thought of that kind of thing back in either when he got to the wharves he waved to the other negro laborers coming in to help keep the us war effort moving some of them no doubt also belonged to red revolutionary cells he didnt know which ones though he hadnt had the need to know what you didnt know you couldnt tell here came lieutenant kennan goddamn pipsqueak cincinnatus thought if he ever got the chance he knew he could snap kennan in two like a stale cracker but kennan had the weight of the us army behind him now he fixed cincinnatus with his customary glare you boy he snapped yes suh cincinnatus said warily kennan sounded more filled with bile than usual which was saying something dont i remember you bragging once upon a time that you could drive a truck dont know about braggin suh but i can drive a truck cincinnatus said been doinit for a while before the war started before the war started here it was barely sunup and that phrase had already crossed his mind several times it was going to be a dividing line for his life for everybodys life for a long time to come lieutenant kennan looked as if every word he was about to say tasted bad you see that line of trucks over yonder you get your ass over there ask for lieutenant straubing and tell him youre the nigger i was talking about yes suh cincinnatus said were the yanks finally getting smart if they were theyd taken their own sweet time about it better late than never cincinnatus wouldnt have bet on that not till he saw for certain if im drivin a truck suh what do they pay me i dont know anything about that kennan said as if washing his hands of cincinnatus you take it up with lieutenant straubing youre his baby now no he didnt want to have anything to do with cincinnatus he rounded on the rest of the men in the labor gang what are you coons doing standing around gaping like a bunch of gorillas get your nigger asses moving cincinnatus had all he could do not to spring over to the trucks to which kennan had directed him nobody he told himself could be a worse boss than the one he was escaping but then after a moment he shook his head since the war began hed learned you couldnt tell about things like that a sentry near the trucks wore one of the helmets that made us soldiers look as if they had kettles on their heads he carried a springfield with a long bayonet which he pointed at cincinnatus state your business he snapped with a clear undertone of it had better be good lieutenant kennan back there suhhe pointed toward the wharf where his old gang under kennans loud and profane direction was beginning to unload a bargehe tol me to come see lieutenant uh straubing here for a moment he wondered if thered be no lieutenant straubing and if kennan for reasons of his own maybe connected with cincinnatus dealings with one underground or another maybe only with kennans loathing for blacks had sent him here to get in trouble or perhaps to get shot but the sentry though he didnt lower the rifle did nod stay right here he said as if cincinnatus were likely to be going anywhere with that bayonet aimed at his brisket then he raised his voice hey lieutenant colored fellow here to see you colored fellow it was just a description cincinnatus not used to being just described heard it with some incredulity out from around the row of trucks came an ordinarylooking white man with silver firstlieutenants bars on the shoulder straps of his us uniform hello he said to cincinnatus you the man eddie was telling me about last night seeing cincinnatus frown he added lieutenant kennan i mean oh yes suh cincinnatus had labored for kennan for well over a year without learning or wanting to learn his christian name he says you can drive a truck straubing said he waited for cincinnatus to agree then went on how long have you been doing that couplethree years before the war started cincinnatus answered havent had the chance to do it since lieutenant straubing cocked his head to one side you dont hardly look old enough to have been driving that long for a moment cincinnatus thought he was calling him a liar then he realized straubing meant he had a younglooking face come on the lieutenant said and walked him past the sentry he halted in front of one of the big greengray white trucks think you can drive this baby reckon i can cincinnatus said the white was a monster a good deal larger than the delivery truck hed driven for tom kennedy but it was still a truck a crank was still a crank a gearshift still a gearshift all right show me the keys in it lieutenant straubing scrambled up into the truck sliding over to the passengers half of the front seat cincinnatus had no trouble starting the truck it was a barebones military model without even a windscreen which surprised him when he climbed in behind the wheel but he didnt let it worry him he didnt ask straubing about pay either not right then that he wasnt hauling heavy crates was plenty to keep him happy for the moment pull out of the line and take me on a spin through town be back here in oh twenty minutes or so lieutenant straubing told him over the growl of the motor yes suh cincinnatus said he put the truck in gear and got moving every once in a while he sneaked a glance over at the soldier beside him he wanted to scratch his head but didnt something in the way straubing dealt with him was peculiar but he had trouble putting his finger on it they didnt get back to the parked trucks in twenty minutes they had a blowout not five minutes after getting on the road cincinnatus fixed it straubing helped not the least bit fussy about getting mud and grease on his hands or on his uniform all right where were we he said when the two of them got back onto the rather hard seat cincinnatus didnt answer he didnt feel he had to answer even though a white man had just spoken to him when he realized that he realized what was funny about how the us soldier was treating him as one man would treat another regardless of whether he was white and cincinnatus black no wonder cincinnatus had taken so long to figure that out as best he could remember hed never run into anything like it before some white men hated negroes plain and simple hed met a good many of those before having the imperfect delight of busting his hump for lieutenant kennan for so long but that kind of outandout hatred wasnt the most common response hed had from whites over the years more treated him as they would have treated a mule they gave him orders when they needed him and made as if he were invisible when they didnt hed even had white men grateful to him tom kennedys image rose up in his mind after hed hidden his former boss and kept us soldiers from finding him kennedy had been nice as you please but it had been a condescending sort of niceness even then a lord being kind to a serf who by some accident of fate had been in position to do him a good turn he didnt feel any of that from lieutenant straubing the way straubing was acting they might both have been whiteor for that matter they might both have been black hed never run into that from confederate white men he hadnt run into it from yankees either not till now he didnt know how to react to it straubing suddenly spoke up you can go on back now cincinnatus im soldyou can drive a truck better than i can wouldnt be surprised as cincinnatus turned back toward the riverfront the lieutenant went on dollar and a half a day suit you its what im makin now most days cincinnatus answered but yes suh it suits workll be easier i thought longshoremans rate was a dollar a day straubing said with a small frown then he laughedat himself and im a dimwit i think half the reason kennan sent you over to me is that you were ruining his accounts getting the extra halfdollar so often the other half unless im wrong is that you were getting the extra halfdollar so often you were ruining his notions of what colored people are like he probably hasnt figured that half out for himself yet tell you whati wont tell him if you dont now cincinnatus did stare at him he almost ran down a horse and buggy before he started paying attention to the road again never in all his born days had he heardor expected to hearone white man discussing anothers attitude toward negroes and discussing it in tones that made it obvious he thought lieutenant kennan was a damn fool youre changing jobsyou ought to do better for yourself straubing said hmm can you read and write cincinnatus looked at lieutenant straubing one rule of survival for blacks in the confederacy had always been never let the white man find out how much you know without that rule the red underground would never have had the chance to pull off its rebellionnot that the rebellion looked as if it would succeed worse luck he clicked his tongue between his teeth yes suh good the us lieutenant said in that case my accountsll stand paying you a buck six bits how does that sound before the warthat phrase again a day had been white mans wages and not the worst white mans wages it was a good deal more than tom kennedy had been paying him you got yourself a driver lieutenant cincinnatus said good lieutenant straubing answered glad to hear it i can use people who know what theyre doing cincinnatus expected him to go on i dont care if theyre white or black hed heard that before every now and then most of the time it was a thumping lie that you needed to say it proved it was a lie but straubing didnt say it by everything cincinnatus could see he took it for granted after cincinnatus had parked the truck straubing led him into a dockside building and spoke to a clerk there the clerk took down cincinnatus name and where he lived and who his family were then he swore him to loyalty to the united states cincinnatus was already sworn to loyalty to the confederate underground and to the negro marxist underground he took the oath without hesitationafter so many what was one more the clerk slid papers across the desk at him make your mark here to show all this information is correct and complete lieutenant youll witness it for him cincinnatus took the pen he looked at the clerk he signed his name in a fine round hand the clerk stared at him good thing you know your letters lieutenant straubing said itll make you a hell of a lot more useful tom kennedy had known he could read and write too kennedy had also used that to his advantage but with him there had always been something of the flavor of a man using a highschool horse it wasnt there with straubing cincinnatusear for such things was keen had it been there he would have heard it before long blacks from the wharves were loading crates into the back of cincinnatus truck they werent from his labor gang but he knew several of them even so they looked at him from the corners of their eyes nobody said anything not with white men all around most of the other truck drivers were white for instance cincinnatus waited to see how that would go the trucks rumbled out of covington before nine oclock the front was between lexington and richmond kentucky about a fourhour trip a little more than halfway there they rolled past the corinth monument which commemorated braxton braggs victory in late that had brought kentucky into the confederacy braggs statue was gone from its pedestal these days and the pedestal itself plastered over with fresh crisp threeeagles posters the usa aimed to keep as much of kentucky as it had seized laborers mostly black but some white unloaded the trucks some of what those had brought would go to the front in small wagons some on muleback or on mans back cincinnatus ate his dinner out of the dinner pail then drove the truck back to covington everyone took him for granted he still had trouble knowing what to make of that he got back into covington with his headlamps on straubing paid off the drivers himself some got some some two dollars even one of the twodollar men was black nobody raised a fuss money jingling in his pocket cincinnatus headed for home with more news for elizabeth than he could shake a stick at he went past conroys general store as he always did when coming home from the riverfront conroy had a paper stuck in the bottom lefthand corner of his window that meant he and tom kennedy wanted to see cincinnatus well ill be damned if i want to see them cincinnatus muttered paper what paper i didnt see no paper he walked right past the general store three eagles glared out at flora hamburger from every other wall as she walked to the socialist party offices she glared right back at them she was sick to death of wartime propaganda what worried her most was that the democrats were getting better at what shed thought of as a socialist specialty other posters some with text in yiddish as well as english the government didnt miss a trick exhorted people to buy the latest series of victory bonds to use less coal than their legal ration which was most of the time not big enough as it was to take the train as little as they could which also saved coal to turn back glass bottles and tin cans to give waste grease to the war department through their local butcher shop toshe lost track of everything anyone who tried to do all the things the posters urged him to do would go mad in short order but then the world already seemed to have gone mad here and there among the eagles and the handsome men in greengray and the women who had to be their wives or mothers socialist party posters managed to find space keeping them up there wasnt easy as fast as boys went round with pastepots and brushes soldiers circle men followed tearing down anything that might contradict what tr wanted people to think today peace and justice one of the socialist posters said a square deal for the worker shouted another a good many copies of that one stayed up some of the soldiers circle goons took it for a governmentissued poster stealing the oppositions slogan was always a good idea fewer soldiers circle men prowled the centre market than was usually so and most uncommonly none loitered in front of max fleischmanns butcher shop fleischmann was sweeping the sidewalk in front of the shop when flora came up good morning my dear he said with old world courtliness he was a democrat himself which didnt keep the government goons from giving him a hard time with his shop right under fourteenth ward socialist party headquarters it was guilt by association in the most literal sense of the words good morning mr fleischmann flora answered how are you today today not so bad the butcher answered last night he rolled his eyes youve seen the turn in old grease posters after pausing to see if flora would nod he went on last night just as i was closing up shop one of those soldiers circle mamzrim brought in a gallon tinof lard oy flora exclaimed that was more nastily clever than the soldiers circle usually managed to be a gallon of pigs fat in a kosher butcher shop oy is right fleischmann agreed mournfully thank god i had no customers just then i shut the shop and brought my rabbi over the place is ritually clean again but even so i can complain to the city council about that kind of harassment if youd like me to flora said but the butcher shook his head better not if one of them does it one time a kholeriyeh on him and life goes on if you give the idea to a whole great lot of them it will happen over and over for the next six months no better not it shouldnt be like that flora said but shed spent enough time as an activist to know the difference between what should have been and what was shaking her head in sad sympathy with max fleischmann she went upstairs people were still coming into the socialist party offices which meant the chaos wasnt so bad as it would be later in the day she had time to get a glass of tea pour sugar into it and catch up on a little paperwork before the telephones started going mad how are you this morning maria tresca asked ive been worselittle yossel slept through the whole night flora answered but ive been better too she explained what the soldiers circle man had done to max fleischmann maria was catholic but shed spent enough time among jews to understand what lard in the butcher shop meant its an outrage she snapped and he probably went out to a saloon and got drunk afterwards laughing about it probably just what he did flora agreed anyone who could think of anything so vile he should walk in front of a train herman bruck walked in just then flora wished fleetingly that he would walk in front of a train too but no that wasnt fair yes herman was a nuisance and wouldnt leave her in peace but hed never yet made her snatch a hatpin out from among the artificial flowers where it lurked and she didnt think he ever would there were nuisances but then there were nuisances good morning flora he said setting his homburg on the hat tree you look pretty todayyou must have had a good nights sleep yes thanks she answered shortly she wasnt going to tell him about little yossel she didnt encourage himbut then he needed no encouragement hed got himself some tea and sat down at his desk when a western union messenger opened the door to the office flora thought about the messenger whod brought word of little yossels fathers death back to sophie at the apartment the family shared she shook her head annoyed at herself that wouldnt happen here people didnt live here however much it sometimes seemed they did she accepted the yellow envelope gave the delivery boy a nickel and watched him head back down to the street who is it from herman bruck asked its from philadelphia she answered and tore the envelope open her eyes slid rapidly over the words there she had to read them twice before she believed them no one would bring bad news here the thought jeered in her mind its congressman zuckerman she said in a voice so empty she hardly recognized it as her own he was walking downstairs with congressman potts from brooklyn and and he tripped and he fell and he he broke his neck he died not quite three hours ago she had never heard the socialist party office go so quiet not even in the aftermath of the remembrance day riots myron zuckerman had been a socialist stalwart in congress since before the turn of the century come november his reelection would have been as automatic as the movement of a threeday clock the democrats wouldnt have put up more than a token candidate against him and the republicans probably wouldnt have run anyone at all all of a sudden though everything was different theres no doubt maria tresca asked not unless the telegram is wrong flora answered her voice was gentle she knew maria hadnt been doubting so much as hoping she looked down at the telegram it blurred not from changing words but from the tears that filled her eyes thatsterrible herman brucks voice was shaken as if he was holding back tears himself he was like a father to all of us what are we going to do three people spoke at the same time everyone in the office had to be thinking the same thing maybe because yossel reisens death had got her used to thinking clearly through shocks flora answered before anyone else the governor will appoint somebody to fill out the rest of his term that brought dismayed exclamations from everyone governor macfarlane was as thoroughgoing a democrat as anyone this side of tr almost a year of being represented by someone who does not represent us maria tresca said bitterly the syntax might have been imperfect but the meaning was clear its liable to be longer than that flora said whoever he is hell have most of that time to establish himself too he may not be so easy to throw out when november comes either well have to pick the finest candidate we can to oppose him whoever he turns out to be herman bruck said he stood up and struck a pose as if to leave no doubt where he thought the finest candidate could be found flora studied him he was bright he was earnest he would campaign hard if he was elected he would serve well enough he was also bloody dull if governor macfarlane named someone with spirit the socialists were liable to lose this district that would behumiliating was the word that came to floras mind id make a better candidate than herman bruck she thought at first that was nothing but scorn but the words seemed to echo in her mind she looked at bruck she looked down at her own hands women could vote and hold office in new york state she was over twentyfive she could run for congressif the socialists would nominate her she looked at herman bruck again no one had shouted his name to the rafters but there he stood confident as if he were already the candidate of one thing she was certain anyone so confident with so little reason could be overhauled she didnt know how it would happen or even if she would be the one to do it but it could be done she was sure of that arthur mcgregor rode the farm wagon toward rosenfeld manitoba days were almost as long as nights now but snow still lingered they could have more snow for another month maybe six weeksand for six weeks after the thaw finally began the road to rosenfeld would be hubdeep in mud most years mcgregor cursed the spring thaw which not only cut him off from the world but also made working the fields impossible or the next thing to it now he turned to maude who sat on the seat beside him and said the roadll make it hard for the yanks to move that it will she agreed weathers never been easy here for anyone i expect theyve found that out for themselves by now alexander mcgregor sat up in the back of the wagon you know what they say about our seasons pa he said grinning weve only got two of emaugust and winter when i first came to this part of the country the way i heard it was july and winter mcgregor said but its not far wrong however you say it and when the weathers bad they have the devil of a time getting from one place to another except for the trains alexander said making no effort to conceal his anger at the railroads if its not a really dreadful blizzard the trains get through i cant say youre wrong son because youre right mcgregor answered the way he thought about trains was another measure of how the past year and a half had turned the world on its ear up till the day the war started hed blessed the railroads they brought supplies into rosenfeld in all but the worst of weather as alexander had said they also carried his grain off to the east without them he would have had no market for most of what he raised without them the canadian prairie could not have been settled nor defended against the united states if somehow it was but now the usa held the tracks leading up toward winnipeg and used them to ship hordes of men and enormous amounts of materiel to the fighting front in peace hed blessed the railroad and cursed the mud in war he did the exact opposite he nodded to himself things were on their ear all right mary stuck her head up and looked around with her eyes sparkling and her round cheeks all red with cold she looked like a plump little chipmunk we ought to do something about the railroads she said in a voice that did not sound at all childlike what she sounded like was a hardheaded saboteur thinking out loud about ways and means you hush mary her mother said youre not a soldier i wish i was mary said fiercely hush is right arthur mcgregor said he looked back over his shoulder at alexander so far as he knew his son was keeping the promise hed made and not trying to act the part of a franctireur so far as he knew till the war he hadnt savored the full import of that phrase either it was what he didnt know that worried him half a mile outside of rosenfeld a squad of us soldiers inspected the wagon mcgregor hated to admit it but they did a good professional job one of them even getting down on his back on the dirt road to examine the axles and the underside of the frame they were businesslike with him reasonably polite to maude and smiled at his daughters who were too young to be leered at if they gave alexander a sour look or two those werent a patch on the glares he sent them after a couple of minutes they nodded and waved the wagon forward fortunately alexander didnt curse them till it had gone far enough so they couldnt hear him julia gasped mary giggled arthur mcgregor said dont use that sort of talk where your mother and sisters can hear you he glanced over to maude she was keeping her face stiffso stiff he suspected a smile under there rosenfeld as it had since it was occupied seemed a town of american soldiers with the canadians to whom it rightfully belonged thrown in as an afterthought soldiers crowded round the cobblers shop the tailors the little cafe that had been struggling before the war started what ruined most folks made a few rich and the saloon that had never struggled a bit there were three or four rooms up above the saloon that must have had us soldiers going in and out of them every ten or fifteen minutes mcgregor had never walked up to one of those roomshe was happy with the lady hed marriedbut he knew about them he glanced over to maude again she probably knew about those rooms too husband and wife had never mentioned them to each other he didnt expect they ever would henry gibbons general store was full of us soldiers too buying everything from fiveforapenny jawbreakers to housewives with which to repair tattered uniforms in the field to a horn with a big red rubber squeezebulb you dont mind my askin henry gibbon said to the sergeant in greengray who laid down a quarter for that item what the devil you going to do with that next fellow in my squad i catch dozing when he aint supposed to the sergeant answered with an evil grin his hairs gonna stand on end for the next three days a couple of privates who might have been in his squad sidled away from him a tiny smile made the corners of mcgregors mouth quirk upward back in his army days hed had a sergeant much like that when they were just being themselves the yanks were ordinary people when they were being occupiers thoughthe smile disappeared if they had their way theyd do whatever they could to turn all the canadians in the land theyd occupied into americans that was why julia and mary didnt go to the school theyd reopened mcgregor held onto marys hand maude had charge of julia they picked their way toward the counter some of the us soldiers politely stepped aside others pretended they werent there that rude arrogance angered mcgregor but he couldnt do anything about it he held his face still so did maude their children werent so good at concealing what they felt once he had to give marys hand a warning squeeze to get rid of the ferocious grimace she gave an american whod walked through the space where she had been standing as if she didnt exist good day to you arthur henry gibbon said had a moving picture wanted to cast somebody as a storekeeper he would have been the man if only his apron had been cleaner he was tubby and bald with a gray soupstrainer of a mustache that whuffed out when he talked brought the whole kit and kaboodle with you i see well what can i do for you this mornin need a couple of hacksaw blades and a sack of beans if youve got some well get our kerosene ration too i expect and the missus is going to make a run at your yard goods and tobacco aint got any gibbon moved his hand just enough to suggest that the yanks had bought him out mcgregor looked glum so did alexander life was hard life without a pipe was harder and well see what kind of candy youve got here too mcgregor said his eye went to the minnesota and dakota papers piled on the counter he reached out and shoved one of them at the storekeeper too it would be full of yankee lies but new lies might be interesting he went over and stood by the pickle barrel waiting while maude told gibbon what she needed and he compared that to what he happened to have which was a good deal less he wasnt quite emptied out though as mcgregor had feared he would be that was something anyhow when mcgregor took a look at the hacksaw blades while walking back to the wagon he understood why these were made in the united states he exclaimed and then a few steps later no wonder henrys still got stuff on his shelves traitor alexander said low enough so that none of the us soldiers passing by could hear him but after a moment mcgregor shook his head everybodys got to eat he said storekeeper cant live selling dust and spiderwebs im surprised hes able to get things from the usa thats all he rubbed his chin maybe im not not with all the soldiers he has in there no maybe im not theyre getting things from him they likely cant get straight from their own quartermasters i dont like it alexander said as they got into the wagon everybodys got to eat arthur mcgregor repeated rokeby the postmaster sells those occupation stamps with ugly americans on them because those are the only stamps the yankees let him sell that doesnt make him bad hes just doing his job werent for the yankees buying our crop last fall i dont know what wed be doing for cash money right now that produced an uncomfortable silence which lasted for some time none of the mcgregors cared for the notion of the united states as an entity with which they and their countrymen did business and upon which they depended but whether you cared for the notion or not it was true when they got back to the farmhouse the front door was open maude spotted it first arthur she said reproachfully all the heat will have gone out of the house mcgregor started to deny having failed to shut it but hed ducked back inside for his mittens after everyone else was in the wagon so it had to have been his fault so he thought glumly till a man in greengray walked out onto the front porch and pointed at the wagon several more us soldiers all of them armed came running out of the house what are they doing here alexander demanded his voice quivering with indignation i dont know mcgregor answered some of the yankees were aiming rifles at him he made very sure they could see both his hands on the reins the man whod first spotted the wagon walked toward it he wore a captains bars on each shoulder strap you are arthur mcgregor he said in a tone brooking no denial he pointed that is your son alexander and who the devil are you mcgregor asked what are you doing in my house i dont have to tell you that the captain said but i will i am captain hannebrink of occupation investigations we have uncovered a bomb on the railroad tracks and arrested some of the young hotheads responsible for it under thorough interrogationwhich probably meant torturemore than one of them named alexander mcgregor as an accomplice in their vicious attempt its a lie alexander said i never did anything like that captain hannebrink pulled a scrap of paper from his breast pocket are you acquainted with terence mckiernan ihor klimenko and jimmy knight yes i know them but so what alexander said arthur mcgregor knew them too boys his sons age more or less from nearby farms he knew jimmy and ihor were hotheads he hadnt been so sure about the mckiernan lad do you deny having joined with them in discussing subversion and sabotage hannebrink went on all the more frightening for being so matteroffact no i dont even deny that alexander said im a patriot the same as any good canadian but i never knew anything about a bomb on the tracks and thats the truth the american captain shrugged well find out what the truth is for now youre coming with us a couple of his soldiers gestured with their rifles alexander had no choice he scrambled out of the wagon and walked with them to a big motor truck they had waiting behind the barn its engine roared to life it rolled away back toward rosenfeld arthur mcgregor stared after it till it was no more than a black speck alexander had been talking about the railroad that very morning but his father still thought he had kept the promise hed made that alexanders keeping the promise might not matter hadnt occurred to him not till now not till too late jonathan moss looked down from several thousand feet on a yellowgreen cloud of gas rolling from the american line toward the defensive positions the british and canadians were holding chlorine was heavier than air none of it surely had any way of reaching him here more than a mile up in the sky in any case the goggles he was wearing against the wind would have given his eyes some protection against the poison gas they stung in spite of that and he felt like coughing he shook his head annoyed at himself if the cook takes the head off a chicken you dont get a pain in the neck he said the roar of the engine drowned the words while the slipstream blew them away artillery thundered down onto the canucks and limeys in the wake of the gas some of the shells ripped through the air alarmingly close to his martin singledecker those near misses made the aeroplane buck like a poorly broken horse accidental hityou didnt want to think about an accidental hit odds are against it moss told himself very firmly sure as sure the canucks and the english soldiers who helped fill their trenches were catching hell whenever their long slow retreat moved them back into another town they fought harder than ever now they were trying to hold on to acton a noaccount little place a few miles east of guelph acton had been noaccount anyhow now its name was going into the history books in letters of blood when the artillery let up americans swarmed out of their trenches and rushed across fields some snowcovered others brownblack with mud toward the enemy line watched from high in the sky it looked as if gods hand were moving pieces on an enormous board more like chess than war one thing neither god nor gas nor shelling had managed was to sweep all the canucks and limeys from that board machine guns began winking from redoubts of timber and sandbags between them came flashes of rifle fire from his lofty perch moss saw the american advance falter he also saw dud dudley wagging his wings up ahead of him the flight was supposed to support the infantry attack on acton dudley put the nose of his fighting scout down and dove on the enemy trenches tom innis followed so did moss the wind howling past the wires supporting his wings so did phil eaker who had replaced zach whitby who had replaced luther carlsen who had probably replaced moss didnt want to think about that either he was a replacement here too even if hed been in the war from the beginning instead he thought about the rapidly swelling scene below yes the attack had bogged down sure as the devil the artillery hadnt cut enough wire in front of the enemy trenches to give the americans decent avenues to close with their foes the united states had come as far as they had in canada on the strength of overwhelming numbers if they kept throwing men away at this rate their numbers wouldnt stay overwhelming forever thats what im here for moss said to get rid of some numbers on the other side he squeezed the firing button for his machine gun tracers let him guide the stream of bullets down the trench ahead of him as he roared over it at treetop height the way the khakiclad soldiers scattered before him made him feel treetop tall himself as firing at men on the ground always did he felt like a boy in short pants amusing himself by stepping on bugs if you fooled with the wrong bug though you were liable to get stung and the soldiers in the traverses which ran perpendicular to his line of fire blazed away at him instead of scattering he laughed as he would have laughed stepping on a bee while wearing shoes theyd have a hell of a time hurting him how could they draw a bead on a target streaking past at almost a hundred miles an hour thwump a bullet passing through canvas made a noise like a drumstick tapping on a rather loose drumhead a lot of bullets were in the air some dammit would touch the aeroplane hed found that out in scraps with the limeys and canucks right at the start of the war it was unnerving thwump but you could put a lot of holes in an aeroplanes canvas and it would keep on flying thwump clang he swore that wasnt canvas that was the engine his oil pressure began to drop maybe he thought hopefully the bullet had only damaged the pump mechanism he had a hand squeezebulb to augment that the pump was often balky he couldnt shoot and work the squeezebulb at the same time when he stopped shooting to work the bulb the pressure kept dropping it wasnt the pump mechanism a fine mist of oil started coating his goggles he could leave them on and not see well from oilor take them off and not see well from the breeze clang thats not fair he shouted angrily fair or not the damage the second bullet had done was immediately obvious a plume of hot water from the radiator rained back on him he turned back toward the us lines and put the martin into a steep climb figuring hed need all the altitude he could get beforeno sooner had the thought crossed his mind than the engine started dying he throttled back for a moment to see whether it would run better at low revs when it didnt he gave it all the power it had a short life but a merry one he said and wondered whether he was talking about the engine or himself hed find out one way or the other abruptly the engine went from dying to dead that left him in charge of a noseheavy glider a couple of hundred feet above nomansland he kept the nose up as best he could the ground got closer with every beat of his heart he was over the american trench linenot very far over it either an idiot took a shot at him thwump the bullet drilled through the fuselage not far behind him nice to know our boys on the ground are such good shots he thought and then if i ever find out who that son of a bitch is ill kick his teeth in between trenches and shell holes he couldnt have found a worse landscape in which to try to set down an aeroplane if hed had a choice he wouldnt have tried it he had no choice there was a road of sorts one on which fresh ammunition and supplies came to the front and there was a little train of wagons on it bringing forward whatever they were bringing would hecould heget over them and set the martin down ill do it or die trying he said and giggled never had a hackneyed phrase been more literally true with his engine fallen silent he could hear the horses whinny in fright he could hear their drivers cuss too he thought that if hed wanted to he could have reached down and snatched the caps off those drivers heads he cleared their wagons that closely a moment later his landing gear thudded down on rutted earth the ruts god be praised ran in the direction he was going the surface he thought thankfully wasnt that much worse than the usual landing strip then one of the wheels went into a hole his teeth slammed together on his tongue blood filled his mouth the aeroplane tried to stand on its nose if it had succeeded it would have shoved the engine and machine gun back into his chest and squashed him into jelly it didnt have quite enough momentum the tail slammed back to earth moss bit his tongue again he unfastened his harness and scrambled out of the martin it hadnt caught fire but that didnt mean it couldnt he stood there on the muddy halffrozen ground looking for any sign of the rest of his flight he saw no aeroplanes at all the driver of the rearmost wagon hopped down and ran toward him you all right buddy he asked moss spat a mouthful of red into the muck but then he nodded think so he answered talking hurt but other than that and what would probably be bruises where the harness had kept him from going facefirst into the instrument panel he didnt seem damaged thought you was going to clip me there the driver said had time for one hail maryhe crossed himselfand then you was over me yeah moss legs suddenly felt as if they were made of some cheap grade of modeling clay not flesh and bone now that he was down he could realize what a narrow escape hed had before up in the air hed been too busy trying to stretch every last inch from his bus soldiers came out of the trenches to shake his hands and congratulate him on being in one piece among them was a captain who asked wheres your aerodrome pal back near cambridge he answered well get you home the captain told him probably tomorrow not today you can enjoy the hospitality of the trenches tonight he stuck out a hand im clyde landis jonathan moss sir just then the canucks started lobbing artillery at where they thought his aeroplane had gone down diving into the trenches seemed the most hospitable thing in the world all the rest of that day the soldiers made much of him they gave him cigars and big bowls of horrible slumgullion and enough shots of the rotgut they werent supposed to have to make his head swim they all sounded convinced he was a hero and made him tell story after story of what fighting in the air was like more shells rained down he wouldnt have done an infantrymans job for a million dollars if there were any heroes in the war the foot sloggers were the ones they laughed when he said so this is a letter from your father sylvia enos said to george jr and mary jane see how it says naval post on the envelope by the stamp george jr nodded impatiently he knew his abcs and he could read a few words to mary jane the rubberstamped phrase didnt mean anything sylvia opened the envelope and took out the letter she read aloud in a portentous tone dear sylviathats mei hope you and the children are well i am fine here we have done some fighting on the river i came through it fine and so did the ship we hit the enemy and he did not hit us boom george jr yelled as if he were a shell going off then as best he could on the floor of the front room he imitated a stricken warship capsizing and sinking finishing the performance with a loud glub glub glub mary jane thought that was very funny so did sylvia till it crossed her mind that the punishment could have been the vessel going to the bottom as easily as its foe do you want to hear the rest of the letter she asked more sharply than shed intended she wanted to finish it george didnt write so often as she wished he would with a touch of guilt she realized her own letters were also fewer and further between than they should have been yes mama george jr said mary jane chiming in with rest of letter i miss all of you and i wish i could come back to boston she resumed here in the middle of the country you cannot get any fish that is very good the cooks do up catfish we catch in the river but no matter what you do to it it still tastes like mud yuck george jr exclaimed mary jane stuck out her tongue i love all of you and hope i will get some leave one day before too long sylvia finished tell the children to be good i bet they are getting as big as can be your husband george george mary jane said in tones of wonder she pointed to her brother george thats right sylvia said george jr is named after his papayour papa too you know papa mary jane dutifully repeated the word and nodded but she didnt sound convinced she hadnt seen her father for months sylvia wondered if she remembered him she said she did but then she said all sorts of things that had only the vaguest connection with reality seeing her remembering george jr at the same age sylvia was convinced twoyearolds lived in a very strange world she wondered if shed been like that at the same age she probably had george jr asked will papa ever come home before the war ends and weve beaten the rebs all up where does he hear such things sylvia wondered at home she didnt talk much about the war that left brigid coneval and the other children she watched sylvia shrugged she supposed war needed hate but wished it didnt the question deserved an answer though no matter how it was framed she said when papa talked about getting leave in his letter that meant he hoped he could come for a visit before he had to go back to his ship oh her son said seriously well i hope he can too ill get supper going now and then well wash you two and put you to bed sylvia said that drew mixed responses her children were hungry but unenthusiastic about baths and even more unenthusiastic about bedtime she told them if you eat all your supper up and youre good in the bathtub maybe you can play for a little while afterwards they wolfed down fried halibut and potatoes they didnt do anything too outrageous when she took them out of the apartment and down the hall to the bathroom at the end a good thing too with her carrying hot water to mix with the cold and they didnt splash up the place too badly she brought them back swaddled in towels and changed george jr into pajamas which made him look very grownup and mary jane into her nightgown george jr played with toy soldiers the us troops storming trench after confederate trench sylvia wished it were really so easy mary jane gave her doll a bottle then climbed up into sylvias lap and fell asleep there not even the bloodcurdling explosions her brother kept producing did anything to stir her maybe so much warmaking had worn out george jr too for he didnt put up his usual complaints about going to bed that left sylvia the only one awake in the apartment which seemed as it often did at such times too big and too quiet i should write to george she said she found paper and a pen soon enough but the bottle of ink had escaped she finally came upon it lurking in her sewing box i didnt put it there she declared and wondered which of her offspring had mary jane would say no to everything on general principles and george jr knew better than to admit to anything that would get him spanked dear george sylvia wrote i got your letter it was good to hear from you i am glad you are well and safe i saw charlie whites wife on t wharf and she says he is out to sea on a cruiser they will have good food on that ship despite his name charlie was black not white and had been the cook on the ripple reinking her pen she went on i am well the children are well we all hope you do get leave so we can see you we miss you i love you sylvia when she was done she read the letter over it seemed so flat and empty she wished she were a better writer to be able to say all the things she wanted to say all the things that really mattered maybe she could have done that if shed had more schooling as things wereit would have to do more searching scared an envelope out of cover seaman george enos she wrote on it us navy central river command st louis mo she went on one more scouting expedition this time through her handbag in search of a stamp she found one stuck it on the envelope and put the letter in the handbag so she could mail it in the morning in the chaos of getting the children ready and over to mrs conevals and then of getting herself off to work she forgot about the letter she remembered only when her machine stuck the first label on a can of mackerel can after can followed that first one she had to pull three levers for each can keep the machine full of labels and paste and clear the feeding mechanism when it jammed as it did every so often after a while she noticed isabella antonelli wasnt at the machine next to hers the foreman mr winter was running it instead mr winter was fat and fiftyfive and walked with a limp from a wound hed got in the second mexican war the army didnt want him which made him a godsend for the canning plant when she asked him where her friend was she thought for a moment he hadnt heard her over the rattle of the lines that sent the cans moving from one station to the next then he said she called on the telephone this morning western union visited her last night oh god sylvia said isabella antonellis husband had been a fisherman on a little boat that operated out of t wharf then the army had taken him and sent him off to quebec the newspapers did their best to be optimistic about the fighting north of the st lawrence but their best wasnt all that good the going was hard up there and bad weather liable to last till may mr winter nodded he was bald with a fringe of gray hair above his ears the lights shone off his smooth pate shell be out a few days im afraid he said theyll put a temporary on the machine here tomorrow i expect till she can come back sylvia nodded too hiding a flash of fury frightening in its fierceness yes mr winter was a godsend for the canning plant all right he thought of getting the mackerel out before he worried about the people who got it out keep the machines running no matter what she thought antonelli was one more line in the casualty lists so what she filled the paste reservoir to her machine from one of the cans under it the foreman at the paste plant probably had the exact same attitude for that matter the generals probably had the exact same attitude too what was antonelli to them but one more line in the casualty lists all the canning machines including sylvias ran smoothly unlike the war machine she pulled her three levers one after the other then went back and did it again and again and again if you didnt notice how your feet got sore from standing by the machine for hours at a time you could get into a rhythm where you did your job almost without conscious thought so that half the morning could go by before you noticed sylvia didnt know whether to like those days or be frightened of them mr winters voice startled her out of that halfmesmerized state your husband well mrs enos what she said and then really hearing the words oh yes thank you i got a letter from him yesterday as a matter of fact i wrote an answer too she added virtuously but i forgot to mail it this morning ill do it on the way home good thats good the foremans smile displayed large yellow teeth a couple of them in the lower jaw missing goodlooking woman like you though i bet you get lonely anyhow no man around being lonelys no fun i know about that since priscilla died a few years ago numbly sylvia nodded the machine ran low on labels which let her tend to it without having to say anything mr winter hadnt been crude as men sometimes were but she felt his eyes on her as she loaded in the labels he was the foreman if he pushed it and she said no he could fire her the line kept running smoothly but she never got the easy rhythm back among the butternut uniforms in the west virginia prisonerofwar camp were a few dark gray ones navy men captured by the damnyankees reggie bartlett found himself gravitating toward them for a while he wondered why hed never had any special interest in the confederate states navy before the war began after a bit he found an answer that if it wasnt the whole picture was at least a good part of it the trouble was soldiers were boring hed done as much hard fighting as any of them and more than mostwar in the roanoke valley was as nasty a business as war anywhere in the world hed seen almost all the horrors there were and heard about the ones he hadnt seen soldiers told the same kinds of stories over and over again they got stale navy men now navy men were different and so were their stories theyd been in strange places and done strange thingsor at least things reggie bartlett had never done those tales made the time between stretches of chopping wood and filling in slit trenches and the other exciting chores of camp life pass more quickly even when things went wrong in the stories they went wrong in ways that couldnt happen on dry land a senior lieutenant who somehow managed to look clean and spruce and wellshaved in spite of the general camp squalor was saying damnyankees suckered me in neat as you please there sat this fishing boat out in the middle of the atlantic no ships around her naked as a whore in her working clothes so up came my boat to sink her with the deck guncheaper and surer than using one of my fish one of your what lieutenant briggs reggie asked a beat ahead of a couple of other prisoners who had gathered around the navy lieutenant for reasons probably similar to his own torpedoes briggs explained under his breath he muttered landlubbers but he resumed after a moment as glad to tell the story as the others were to hear it you cant always trust a whore though even when shes naked and sure enough this was the badger game the fishing boat was towing a yankee sub on a cable with a telephone line attached i let the fishermen go over the side before i sank their boat and what thanks did i get their damned submersible blew me out of the water his face clouded only a couplethree of us lived the rest went right to the bottom never had a chance its almost like what the mormons done to the damnyankees blowin up all that powder right under em somebody said more like snipers work reggie contradicted a lot of times a sniperll be hiding and hell try and make somebody on the other side look up to see whats going on further down the trench and if youre dumb enough to do it the bastard with the scope on his rifle hell put one right in your earhole for you good analogy briggs said nodding he wasnt a whole lot older than bartlett but better educated and also stiffer in manner had he been a civilian he would have been something like a junior loan officer at a bank he was steady he was sound he was reliableand reggie would have loved to play poker against him because if the yankees could play him for a sucker that way reggie figured he could too hed just noticed that his analogy whether briggs approved of it or not took things back to the trenches when the us guards started shouting prisoners form by barracks in parade ranks senior lieutenant briggs frowned this isnt right its not time to form parade ranks the break in routine irked him probably got some kind of special announcement for us bartlett said the guards had done that before a time or two the special announcements they handed out werent good news not if you backed the entente he didnt get the chance to learn briggs opinion of his guess he had to hurry off to form up outside his own harsh chilly building a good ways away from where the navy man was holding forth the uniforms he and his comrades in misery wore would have given a confederate drill sergeant a fit but the ranks the men formed were as neat and orderly as anything that sergeant could have wanted what do you reckon this is jasper jenkins asked taking his place beside bartlett dunno reggie told his friend i hope its that weve had a couple more escapes and theyre gonna make the rest of us work harder on account of that i dont mind paying the price they put on it worth it you ask me yeah thatd be good jenkins agreed they havent figured out that were gonna keep on tryin to break out o here no matter what they do only a foold want to stay and thats a fact a us captain strode importantly to the front of the prisoners formation he unfolded a sheet of paper and read from it in a loud harsh voice the imperial german government the loyal ally of the united states has announced the capture of the city of verdun the french having evacuated the said city after being unable in six weeks of battle to withstand the might of german arms victory shall be ours dismissed the neat ranks of prisoners broke up into pockets of chattering men jasper jenkins tugged at bartletts sleeve hey reggie wheres this vairdone place at he asked before the war he probably would have asked the same thing about houston or nashville or charleston his horizon had been limited to his farm and the small town where he sold his crops and bought what little he couldnt raise for himself reggie could have done better at the geography of the confederate states when it came to foreign countries even foreign countries to which the csa was alliedi dunno not exactly he admitted somewhere in france it has to be and i reckon somewhere near germany or the huns wouldnt have been fighting for it past that though i cant tell you damnyankees sound like losin its about two steps from the end o the world for the frenchies jenkins said i know they do reggie answered but youve got to remember two things first one is for all you know theyre lying just to get us downhearted second one is even if theyre not i expect theyre making it out to be more important than it really is what are we going to do call em liars theyre damnyankeesof course theyre liars jenkins said as if stating a law of nature you got a good way of lookin at things pal thanks he went off whistling a dirty song having made his friend happy reggie discovered he was unhappy himself jenkins had made his bump of curiosity itch he went off looking for senior lieutenant briggs the naval officer being an educated man he would be the one to know where verdun was and what its fall meant he found briggs without much trouble then wished he hadnt the navy man sat on the ground in front of his barracks head in hands the picture of misery bartlett didnt think the news the yankees had announced could do that to a man and wondered if briggs had just got word his brother had been killed or his sweetheart had married somebody else but when he asked what the matter was briggs like poes raven spoke one word and nothing more verdun sir reggie said losing one town didnt sound like that big a catastrophe to him the confederacy had lost a good many towns all along the border but was still very much in the fight verdun briggs repeated and climbed heavily to his feet from everything i heard the french were swearing theyd defend the place to the last man now theyve pulled back instead the germans have hit em such a lick they couldnt afford to keep on fighting where they were not if they wanted to hang on best they think they can do now looks like is make the huns pay such a price for the land they get that they decide its not worth the cost thats not so bad reggie began but then corrected himself its not so good either the germans theyre inside france and the french they dont have any soldiers inside germany now youre getting the picture briggs agreed same sort of picture weve got over here tooa goddamn ugly one yes sir reggie tried to look on the bright side weve still got us washington for now the navy man saidthe report from france seemed to have taken all the wind from his sails i tell you this though bartlett our country is going to need every man it can lay its hands on if were going to give the american huns what they deserve he paused to let that sink in then added in a low voice it is the positive duty of every prisoner of war to try to escape reggie felt a sudden hollow in the pit of his stomach having nothing to do with the hunger that never left the yankees can shoot you if they catch you trying to escape he remarked they catch you after youve got out they can pretty much do what they want to you under the laws of war confederate guards had the same rights with us prisoners but he didnt dwell on that briggs just nodded as if hed remarked on the weather if we once get out we can get away we wouldnt be like frenchmen stuck in the middle of germany we speak the same language as the yankees not just the same language reggie objected they talk ugly i think so too briggs said but i know how they talk and how its different from the way we talk i can teach you come with me the last three words had the snap of an order bartlett followed him into the barracks the senior lieutenant picked up an object made of galvanized sheet iron and walked across the room with it asking what am i doing as he walked why youre toting that pail sir reggie stated the obvious but briggs shook his head thats what id be doing in the csa he said if im doing it in the usa im carrying this bucket you see yes sir bartlett said and he did see for that last part of the sentence briggs hadnt sounded like a confederate at all hed not only chosen different words hed sort of pinched his mouth up so all the vowel sounds were somehow sharper howd you do that got started in theatricals at the naval academy down in mobile briggs answered if we can get outside the wire itll come in handy like i say i can teach you do you want to learn do you want to do the other things youll have to do to get outside the wire it was a good question if he stayed here reggie could sit out the war if not in comfort at least in security if he tried to escape he guaranteed himself all the risks involved with yankee guards and patrols if he managed to evade them and got back to the csa what would happen next he knew exactly what would happen theyd pat him on the back grant him a little leave and then hand him a new uniform and a tredegar and put him back in the line hadnt he had enough of that for a lifetime im carrying the bucket he said trying to pronounce the words as briggs had he wasnt getting them right he could hear that listen briggs repeated the phrase bartlett tried it again better the navy man said reggie didnt know exactly how hed agreed to try to escape from the prisonerofwar camp but by the time he left briggs barracks he had no doubt hed done just that closing time gentlemen nellie semphroch said as the clock in the coffeehouse finished striking nine when none of the confederate officersor the washingtonians whod grown rich dealing with themshowed any sign of being ready to leave she added im following the regulations you people set down you wouldnt want me to break your own rules would you a plump grayhaired colonel who did not look to be the sort for late night adventures rose from his chair saying we must set an example for the lovely ladies here he tossed a halfdollar down on the table and walked out into the night with him taking the lead the rest of the men and the handful of womenloose women nellie thought for what other kind would consort with the occupiersdrifted out of the coffeehouse last of all went nicholas h kincaid who paused outside the doorway to send a mooncalf look back at edna till nellie almost broke his nose by slamming the door in his face ma you keep doin things like that he wont come back no more edna said gathering up cups and saucers and plates and tips some in scrip some in good silver money god i hope he doesnt nellie said hes not here for the coffee and victuals hes here because hes all soppy over you the reverse as she knew also held shed caught them kissing and well on their way to worse a year before and had watched edna like a hawk ever since her daughter just tossed her head hes all right she said carelessly there are plenty of others though that was calculated to make nellie steam and achieved the desired effect nellie was bound and determined that her daughter should go to the altar a maidenshe knew too well how grim the alternative could be but edna and ednas hot young blood werent making things easy work helped running the coffeehouse kept the two of them hopping from sunup till long past sundown if you were busy you didnt have time to get into trouble nellie said start doing up the dishes ill help in a minutei want to count up whats in the till first all right ma edna said she would work nellie admitted to herself more than a little grudgingly she wasnt a bad girl not really just a wild girl wild for life wild for anything she could get her hands on wild to let lifeand the men crawling through lifeget their hands on her the cash box was nicely heavy nellie had thought it would be if she could do any one thing it was gauge how busy the place had been through the day most of the take was in silver too as her place had become a favorite stop for the occupiers they became more likely to give her real money and fob off their nearly worthless scrip on merchants whose goodwill mattered less to them a couple of dollars less than i thought there would be she murmured and then shrugged she was doing well enough that a couple of dollars one way or the other mattered much less to her than they would have before the war started she had no use for the rebs she spied on them whenever their loose talk gave her the chance but she was getting if not rich at least welltodo off them serves them right she thought and went to help her daughter clean up artillery rumbled off to the north and northeast the noise clearly audible through splashing and the clank of china on china louder these days edna remarked glancing in the direction of that deepthroated roar were you listening to the rebs tonight nellie asked edna shook her head that exasperated her mother edna saw the war only in terms of how it affected hernot least by supplying her with handsome young confederate officers to meet nellie went on they say they think they can stop our attack out of baltimore but it didnt sound to me like they were real sure about it if were lucky we may run the rebs out of here this summer edna kept right on drying saucers she didnt say anything for a while the way she stood though suggested she wasnt altogether sure it would be good luck she liked the way things were going business wouldnt be the same with the usa holding washington again that wasnt all that wouldnt be the same mother and daughter spoke together nellie said the rebs wont want to give this town back while edna put it more gamely theyll fight like bastards to hold on to washington they finished doing the dishes in gloomy silence there wouldnt be much left of washington after a big fight for it the city had been badly damaged when the rebels overran it in and theyd taken it pretty quickly what would it look like if they chose to defend it street by street house by house nellie lighted a candle at one of the downstairs gas lamps then turned them out she and edna went up the stairs to their bedrooms by the light of the candle she used it to light the lamps in those rooms then blew it out good night ma edna said around a yawn good night nellie answered hiding a smile keep edna busy enough and she wouldnt have time for mischief all right maybe she wouldnt nellie undid the hooks and eyes that held her skirt closed then unbuttoned the long row of motherofpearl buttons on her shirtwaist she tossed it into the wicker clothes hamper the hamper was almost full shed have to go to the laundry soon the corset came off next she sighed with pleasure at being released from its steelboned grip she put on a long cotton nightdress turned off the gas lamp and climbed under the blankets falling asleep seldom took her long shed almost done it when the confederates sent a column marching up the street in front of the coffeehouse the tramp of boots on pavement the rattle of steeltired wagon wheels and the clop of horses hooves made her sit up it was a goodsized column they hadnt sent so many men north in a while she tried to figure out what that meant was it good news or bad good if the rebs were moving because they needed men against the us attacks not so good if these were troops freed up because the negro uprisings in the csa were collapsing shed have to see if she could find out tomorrow when the column had passed she settled back down again she was drifting toward sleep when someone knocked on the door the knock was soft but insistent as if whoever was there wanted to make sure she and edna heard but also wanted to be equally sure no one else did she got out of bed in the dark her first suspicious glance when she reached the hall was to ednas bedroom but edna was in there snoring shed never been able to fool her mother about being asleep scratching her head nellie slowly and carefully went downstairs the knocking persisted she wished she had a pistol down there by the cash box shed never thought shed need one though not with so many confederate soldiers always in the coffeehouse and the rebs had made it against their rules for locals to keep firearms with penalties harsh enough to make her not want to take the chance of hiding one right under their noses they hadnt made any rules against keeping knives she picked up the biggest carving knife she had one that would have made a decent sword with a different handle and walked to the door whos there she asked making no move to open it its me little nell bill reach didnt name himself confident she could identify his voice she didnt but no one else these daysthank godused the name from her sordid past when she neither said anything nor worked the latch he hissed let me in darlin i got nowhere else to go and its lateway past curfew nellie knew what time it was go away she said through the door quietly so as not to wake edna that he had the nerve to call her darling filled her with fury dont you ever come here again i mean it her hand closed on the handle of the knife hard enough to hurt listen nell reach said also quietly if you dont let me in im a dead man i cant stay on the dodge any more and they if you dont get out of here this instant nellie told him in a deadly whisper ill scream loud enough to bring every confederate patroller for a mile and a half around this place on the dead run but reach muttered something under his breath then he grunted an involuntary frightened sound jesus nell here they comeits a whole goddamn confederate column they see me here im dead and buried for a moment nell thought he was trying to trick her then she too heard the rhythmic thump of marching men and the jingle of harness another columnprobably another regimentheading up toward the fighting nellie bit her lip till she tasted blood she didnt want the rebs to lay their hands onanyone even bill reach she asked herself silently and with great reluctance nodded even bill reach she opened the door reach scurried inside like a rat running into its hole god bless you nell he said while she closed it as quietly as she could if theyd have caught me theyd have squeezed everything out of me about you and this place and the shoemaker andguk nellie held the tip of the knife against his poorly shaved throat dont you talk about such things not to me not to them not to anybody she said in a voice all the more frightening for being so cold im not the foolish girl i was and you cant blackmail me when that column marches past youre going out the door again if you come around here after that ill shove this inshe did shove the knife in perhaps a quarter of an inch reach moaned and tried to pull away but she wouldnt let himand ill laugh while im doing it do you hear me you laughed when you shoved it into me didnt you my turn now he didnt say anything that was the smartest thing he could have done a little moonlight came through the plateglass window from outside his eyes glittered the fear smell sharp and acrid came off him in waves the confederates tramped past the coffeehouse maybe the noise of their passing woke edna nellie would have sworn she hadnt been noisy enough to disturb her daughter but from the hall edna asked ma whats going on whos this bird and ednas breath caught sharply what are you doing with that knife hes trouble nothing else but nellies voice was grim but hes in trouble too so he can stay here till the rebs have gone by outside after that hes gone forever i knew your mother before you were born bill reach said to edna back in the house at he drew a frightened breath of his own for nellie had stuck the knife in farther how deep do you have to stab to kill a man she wondered a couple of more words out of reach and she would have found out the sounds of marching feet clattering wagons and clopping hooves drowned out the drone of aeroplane engines high overhead maybe someone in the confederate ranks was unwise enough to strike a match to light a cigar or pipe maybe the moonlight let a us pilot spot the column even without such help however that wasnellie had no way of knowinga stick of bombs came falling out of the sky oh jesus reach said when he heard the highpitched shriek of air rushing past the bombs fins nellie needed a split second longer to identify the noise us bombers hadnt come over washington all that often a split second after that sharp explosions left no possible doubt of what was going on one bomb fell a little in front of the head of the confederate column then two more in quick succession landed right in the middle of it either the us bombaiming was extraordinarily good or the bombardier was trying for another target altogether and got luckyagain nellie never knew glass sprayed inward a sharp shard caught nellie in the leg she yelped edna screamed bill reach let out a groan and clutched at his midsection nellie staggered back from him he sank slowly to the floor a moment later the front door opened hitting him and knocking him sideways it wasnt another bomb it was confederate soldiers seeking shelter from the rain of destruction from the sky outside in the street injured soldiers screamed and groaned a horse screamed too on a higher note officers shouted for medical orderlies and negro stretcherbearers seeing nellie one of the rebs pointed to reach and said this here your husband the damnyankees done hurt maam even at such a time he worked to separate the people of washington from the government of the usa i should say not she answered and raised her voice hoping reach wasnt too far gone to pay attention hes a burglar i caught him breaking in here i was going to give him to you if they thought him an ordinary criminal they wouldnt ask him questions about anything but burglary she didnt know how he knew what else he knew or exactly how much that was she did know it was too much one of the confederate soldiers said all right maam well take charge of himthrow him in a wagon till we find somebody we can give him to dont want to leave him bleedin all over your floor here come on you he and a buddy got bill reach to his feet and out the door the bombs had stopped falling the rest of the rebels whod tumbled into the coffeehouse took their leave some of them even apologized for bothering nellie and your pretty daughter one of them added which did him less good in her eyes than he would have guessed nellie shut the door after the last departing reb a futile gesture with the window smashed she looked around at glinting drifted glass go on upstairs and get me some slippers edna she said ill cut my feet to ribbons if i try to walk through this stuff she sighed but went on its not near so bad as it was after the rebs shelled us no i reckon not edna agreed she started toward the stairway then stopped and looked back at nellie what was that crazy fellow talking about houses for i aint never lived in a house and i didnt think you had neither not all houses are homes ran through nellies mind i never did live in a house she answered hes crazy like you said thats all get me those slippersand get me a blanket too will you with the windows gone i think i better stay down here till sunup all right ma edna said but i still think that feller knows you a whole lot better than you let on if he didnt you wouldnt let him get you all upset like you do just get me my things nellie snapped shaking her head edna went upstairs nellie shook her head too sooner or later the tawdry tale would come out she could feel it in her bones and what would she do then how would she keep edna in line at all out in the street wounded confederates kept on groaning they did give her a sense of proportion you didnt die of mortification however much you wished you could bombs falling out of the sky were something else again thunder filled the air artillery was pounding ever closer to st matthews south carolina from the south and from the east negroes streamed back through the town some of them wore red armbands and carried the rifles with which they had fought their white capitalist oppressors so long and so hard one or two even wore helmets taken from confederate corpses they still had the look of soldiers to them more though had thrown away armbands and weapons and were looking for escape not more battle scipio wished he could have fled too but he was too prominent too recognizable to escape the square so easily hed been one of the leaders of the congaree socialist republic from the beginningfrom the beginning till the end he thought the end could not be delayed much longer i tried to tell them he hadnt sought the revolution hed been drawn into it that seeming a safer course than letting himself be eliminated for knowing too much and it had been a safer coursefor a little more than a year now with everything ending in fire he sawas hed seen from the beginningthat going along with the reds had bought him only a little time the rest of the leaders of what had been the congaree socialist republic and was falling to pieces still refused to admit the game was up cassius stood in the town square shouting rally rally god damn de lot of you rally gainst de pressors don let dey take yo freedom he had picked men with him men who could have formed a line and stoppedor tried to stopthe collapse but who stood with their rifle butts trailing in the dust and watched men who had been fighters but were now only fugitives running past cherrys appeal to the faltering followers of the republic was more fundamental kill de white folks got to kill de white folks dey catches you dey kills you sure she was probably right noshe was almost certainly right but the men who had done so much had concluded they could do no more neither her fiery words nor her even more fiery beauty were enough to turn them back toward the trenches they could not hold she rushed over to scipio and to his startlement and no small alarm threw herself into his arms her breasts were firm and soft against his chest make dey stop kip she said in a bedroom voice make dey stop make dey fight you de best talkin man we gots make dey go back an fight and i is yours i do whatever you wants you make dey stop she ran her tongue over her full lips making them even moister and more deliciouslooking than they had been every sort of promise smoldered in her eyes scipio sighed and shook his head caint he said regretfullynot so much regret that he would not have her for she frightened him more than he wanted her but regret that this collapse would get so many people killed with him all too likely to be among them caint cherry it over dont you see it over bastard she screamed and twisted away from him liar quitter she slapped him a roundhouse blow that snapped his head sideways on his neck and left the taste of blood in his mouth blood on my hands too he thought blood on all our hands cherry cared nothing about the blood on her hands he counted himself lucky she hadnt pulled out a knife and gutted him with it in spite of haranguing the negroes who didnt want to be soldiers any more cassius heard the exchange between cherry and scipio cassius as best scipio could tell never missed anything he came trotting over to the two of them scipios guts knotted with fear all over again cherry was cassius woman nocherry was her own woman and had been giving herself to cassius that wasnt quite the same thing even if from cassius point of view it probably looked as if it were but cassius didnt want to quarrel the exhunter now chairman of what was left of the congaree socialist republic sadly studied scipio it over now kip he asked you tink it over now fo true dont you scipio waved his arms as he did so a shell landed only a couple of hundred yards away black smoke with angry red fire at the core dirt leaped upward in graceful arcs beauty in destruction we done everything we kin do dey gots too many buckra too many rifles too many cannons dey whip we cass too many buckra cassius said bitterly dey don rise fo dey class intrest de fools de ristocrats got dey all mystified up he lifted a weary hand we been over this before i know we make de struggle go on he pointed north toward the swamps of the congaree gwine make de stand up there de niggers in de pressed zones dey always gwine know de struggle go on de white folks dey never takes we fo granted again that no doubt was true scipio wished he thought it likelier to help than to hurt it was liable to be another fifty years before the negro cause revived in the csa he didnt say that what point now what he did say was i caint go to de swamp with you cass to his surprise the exhunter burst out laughing i knows thatyou was just a house nigger and you dont know nothin bout that kin o life what you gots to do is you gots to blend in don let nobody know you got dat white folks talk hidin in your mouth git work in de field in de factory be a good nigger till de heat die down then hurt they white folks however you kin he slapped scipio on the back then he and cherry hand in hand headed north along with some of the other negroes who still had fight in them scipio stood in the st matthews square till shells started landing a good deal closer than a couple of hundred yards away then he turned on his heel and ran along with so many other blacks men and women both from behind came shouts of de buckra de buckra comin he ran harder the leaders of the congaree socialist republic unlike their confederate counterparts hadnt gone in for fancy uniforms in his undyed cotton homespun he could have been anybody at all and anybody at all was just who he aimed to pretend to be once white control washed over this part of what was again south carolina hed lie low find work eventually find better work and spend the rest of his life trying to pretend this whole unfortunate business had never happened he stopped running about half a mile outside st matthews that was partly because his wind wasnt all it should have been before the uprising he had lived soft it was also partly because he calculated that a negro overrun while fleeing was more likely to be killed on sight than one who looked to have some business where he was if he seemed a field hand or a farmer maybe the white soldiers wouldnt figure hed been in arms against them and as a matter of fact he hadnt hed never once fired a weapon at the duly constituted forces of the confederated states of america not that that mattered his laugh came bitter as cassius if the white folks ever figured out who he was hed hang he wouldnt simply hang either what theyd do to him first he moaned a little down deep in his throat hed never been a physically brave man the idea of being tortured made him want to piss himself with fright he forced himself to something dimly resembling calm your wits are all youve got now he thought if you dont use them that will kill you gunfire and faint shouts rose behind him that would be the white folks entering st matthews he nodded to himself the congaree socialist republic was dead all right even if cassius could keep a nasty ghost of it going in the swamps when scipio came to a patch of woods he chose a winding path through them over going around in the woods he thought he would be perceived as doing something in particular rather than simply trying to escape from the victorious whites that again might help keep them from shooting him for the fun of it maybe there was a farm on the far side of the woods maybe the world had just gone topsyturvy whatever the reason a fat hen walked out from among the pine trees and stood in the path staring at him from beady black eyes for a moment that didnt mean much to him then it did food he thought no more communal kitchens no more suppers arguing the workings of the dialectic if he was going to eat hed have to feed himself slowly he bent and picked up a fistsized stone the chicken kept watching him from about ten feet away he drew back his armand let fly hard as he could the bird had time for one startled squawk before the stone hit feathers exploded out from it it tried to run away but had trouble making its legs work he sprang on it snatched up the stone and smashed in its little stupid head he wore a knife on his belt he cut off the broken head and held the chicken by the feet letting it bleed out then he gutted it he worked slowly and carefully there hed seen the job done in the kitchens at marshlands more times than he could count but couldnt remember the last time hed done it himself he saved the liver and gizzard and heart putting them back inside the body cavity hed just tossed the rest of the offal into the bushes by the side of the patha fox or a coon or a possum would find a treatwhen a white man called you there nigger what are you doin got me a chicken suh scipio said he turned toward the white mana confederate majorand put on a wide servile smile be right glad to share you leave me jus a little bit that was how sharing between blacks and whites worked when it worked at all in the csa give it here the major said a lot of the time sharing didnt work at all in the csa scipio handed the bird over without a word the officer took its feet in his right hand his left hand wasnt a hand but a hook scipio stiffened in dismay hed dealt with this white man arranging to exchange wounded prisoners maybe though the fellow wouldnt recognize him one raggedy negro looked a lot like another especially when you hardly saw them as human beings at all but major hotchkiss even if he was mutilated wasnt stupid his eyes narrowed i know your voice he said half to himself youre the nigger who from narrow his eyes went wide he didnt bother saying talks like a white man but dropped the chicken and grabbed for his pistol he was a split second too slow scipio hit him in the face with the rock hed used to kill the hen the negro leaped on him as he had on the bird pounding and pounding with the stone till hotchkiss was as dead as a man ever would be scipio reached for the majors pistol then jerked his hand away he didnt want to be caught with a firearm not in these times he didnt want to be caught with a bloodspattered shirt either he stripped it off and hid it in a hole in the ground a shirtless negro would draw no comment the chicken was another matter it was his you damn thief he muttered to the late major hotchkiss he picked up the bird and got out of there as fast as he could before any more white soldiers came along to connect him to the majors untimely demise paul mantarakis strode warily through the ruins of ogden utah boy this place looks like hell he said i cant tell whether what im walking on used to be houses or street hell was let loose on earth here said gordon mcsweeney who still wore on his back the flamethrower which had loosed a lot of that hell but then he went on hell let loose on earth giving the misbelievers a foretaste of eternity beside them ben carlton said feels damn strange walking along where theres mormons around and not diving for cover they surrendered mantarakis said but he was warily looking around too he carried his springfield at the ready and had a round in the chamber for all we know they aint gonna go through with it carlton said maybe they got more tnt under this here tabernacle park and theyll blow us and them to kingdom come instead of giving up samson in the temple mcsweeney murmured but the big scotsman shook his head no i cannot believe it samson worked with the lord not against him i do not think satan could steel their souls to such vain sacrifice the whole damn state of utah is a sacrifice paul said i dont know what the hell made the mormons fight like that but they did more with less than the damn rebs ever dreamt of doing only way we licked em is we had more men and more guns here and there people who were not us soldiers picked through the remains of ogden women in bonnets and long skirts shoved aside wreckage looking for precious possessions or food or perhaps the remains of loved ones children and a few old men helped them the spoiledmeat smell of death hung everywhere a few men not old also went through the ruins most of them wore overalls with poplin or flannel shirts underneath their clothes were as filthy and tattered as the soldiers uniforms and for the same reason theyd spent too long in trenches if looks could kill paul said quietly his companions nodded the mormon fighting men no longer carried weapons that was one of the terms of the ceasefire to which their leaders had agreed they stared at the american soldiers and stared and kept on staring their eyes were hot and empty at the same time theyd fought and theyd lost and it was eating them inside my granddads fought in the war of secession carlton said i seen a photograph of one of em after we gave up he looks just like the mormons look now they tramped past a fiveyearold boy a little towhead cute enough to show up on a poster advertising shoes or candy his eyes blazed with the same terrible despair that informed the faces of the beaten mormon fighters the women were no different they glowered at the victorious us troopers the prettier they were the harder they glared some of them had carried rifles and fought in the trenches too soldiers who won a war were supposed to have an easy time among the women of the people theyd defeated that hadnt happened anywhere in utah that paul had seen he didnt think it would start happening any time soon either but the mormon women didnt aim that look full of hatred and contempt at the americans alone they also sent it toward their own menfolk as if to say how dare you have lost even the mormon fighters quailed under the gaze of their women carlton pointed ahead must be the park most of ogden was shell holes and rubble tabernacle park was for the most part just shell holes the only major exception was the burnedout building at the southeast corner it had been the local mormon temple and then the last strongpoint in ogden holding out until surrounded and battered flat by us artillery captain schneider was already in the park he waved the men of his company over to him pulling out a pocket watch he said ceremony starts in fifteen minutes general kent could have got himself a fancy honor guard but he chose us instead he said he thought it would be better if soldiers whod been through it from the start saw the end that is a just deed gordon mcsweeney rumbledhigh approval from him congratulations again on your medal sir mantarakis said schneider looked down at the remembrance cross in gold on his left breast pocket won for rallying the line south of ogden after the mormons exploded their mines thank you sergeant he said i shouldnt be the only one wearing it though we all earned them that day under his breath ben carlton muttered damn fine officer paul mantarakis nodded here came major general alonzo kent tramping along through the rubble like a common soldier he waved to the veterans gathering in front of the wrecked mormon temple well boys it was a hell of a fight but we licked em he said he wasnt impressive to look at not even in a generals fancy uniform but hed got the job done and here came the mormon delegation behind a standardbearer carrying the beehive banner under which the utah rebels had fought so long and hard and well most of the leaders of the defeated mormons looked more like undertakers than politicians or soldiers weary old men in black suits and wingcollared shirts one of them stepped past the standardbearer general kent i am heber louis jackson nowhe looked extraordinarily bleak as he spoke that wordpresident of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints i have treated with your representatives yes kent said not agreement only acknowledgment the mormon leader went on with me here are my counselors joseph shook and orem pendleton we make up the first presidency of the church and are the authority in ultimate charge of the forces that have been resisting those of the government of the united states and herehe pointed to the youngest and toughestlooking of the mormons in his partyis wendell schmitt commander of the military forces of the nation of deseret the nation of deseret does not exist general kent said in a flat voice president roosevelt has as you know declared the entire state of utah to fall under martial law and military district he has also ordered the arrest of all officials of the rebel administration in the state of utah on a charge of treason against the government of the united states of america that specifically includes you gentlemen here pity theyll shoot them or hang them gordon mcsweeney whispered to mantarakis as heber jackson bowed his head they should be burned he touched the nozzle to his flamethrower mantarakis hissed at him to be quiet he wanted to hear what the mormons said wendell schmitt took an angry step forward the terms you set us were already hard enough without that general the constitution does not apply here because of the presidents declaration general kent interrupted you people put yourselves beyond the pale when you hopped into bed with the confederates and the canadians now that you have made that bed for yourselves you shall be made to lie in it you tried to destroy our government here you failed we will destroy your government here this surrender will let the common people of the state survive if you reject it we will destroy them too and turn utah back into the desert it was before they came and call that peace joseph shook murmured it sounded like a quotation but paul didnt know what it was from general kent evidently did if you like mr shook but you mormons will not joggle our elbows again while we are fighting this bigger war and you will not disturb the peace in the usa once we have won the war he opened an attache case and took out a sheet of fancy paper here is the formal instrument of surrender before we affix our signatures to it i am going to summarize its provisions one last time so that we have no unfortunate misunderstandings is that agreeable to you hard terms heber jackson said softly having fought us tooth and nail for a year you cannot expect a kiss on the cheek now kent retorted he fumbled in the case again this time for a pair of reading glasses item all troops in resistance to the government of the united stateswell weve done that they laid down their arms when you asked for the ceasefire item all firearms in utah to be surrendered within two weeks penalty for possession after that time is death item any act of violence against soldiers of the united states shall be punished by the taking and execution of hostages not to exceed ten for each soldier wounded or fifty for each soldier killed item all public gatherings of more than three persons are banned this includes churches vaudeville houses picnicsyou name it violators will be fired upon without warning by soldiers of the united states item all property of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints is forfeit to the government of the united states in reparation for the cost of suppressing this rebellion item gatherings in private homes to worship in the fashion of the church of jesus christ of latterdays saints shall be construed as public gatherings under the meaning of the previous item and shall be dealt with like any other public gatherings under the terms of that item item he droned on and on after a while paul stopped paying close attention the mormons had tried to break away from the usa and they were paying a heavy price for it in effect they had broken away and were being treated not as a state returning to the union but as a conquered province as far as he was concerned theyd earned it hed been in utah most of a year and nasty strangers had been trying to kill him the whole time one of general kents aides unfolded a portable table and produced a pen and bottle of ink with which to sign the instrument of surrender may i say something before i set my name there wendell schmitt asked go ahead general kent told him if you think anything you say will change matters though not likely the mormon military commander broke in no what i want to tell you is that terms like these will come back to haunt you years from now youre sowing the seeds of hatred and bloodshed that will grow up in the days of our grandchildren and of their grandchildren too do you know what general kent said i dont care teddy roosevelt doesnt care either and if they have to mr schmitt my grandchildren will come in here to utah and blow your grandchildren skyhigh all over again if more damn fools like you come to power here thats just what will happen if you people are smart enough to realize youre fighting out of your weight it wont he folded his arms across his chest biting his lip wendell schmitt signed the surrender document so did the three men who made up the first presidency of the mormon church last of all so did general kent his aides took the mormon leaders into custody the mormon standardbearer handed the beehive banner to one of those us aides with deliberate contempt the american soldier let it fall in the dirt its over ben carlton said yeah paul agreed now we either get to stay here for occupation duty with everybody hating us like rat poison or else they ship us back to fighting the rebs or the canucks he laughed ruefully sounds like a bully time either way doesnt it anne colleton cranked to life the engine of the battered ford theyd given her the motorcar shivered and shuddered like a man with the grippe it sounded as if it would fall to pieces at any momentit was about as far a cry from her vauxhall roadster as an automobile could possibly be she didnt complain not any more shed had to move heaven and earth to pry the ford out of confederate officialdom it would with luck get her back to marshlands which was all she wanted for the time being god only knew where the vauxhall major hotchkiss had confiscated was now that might well have been literally true hotchkiss himself she was given to understand was dead killed along with so many others in the death throes of the congaree socialist republic anyone want to ride with me anne asked not for the first time none of the women with whom shed shared a refugee tent for so many months made a move toward her the bayoneted tredegar with a full clip shed laid in the middle of the seat probably had something to do with that the officers say youre asking to get yourself killedor else somethin even worseif yall go into that country now the fat woman named melissa declared by her tone she looked forward to that prospect for anne ill risk it anne answered ive always been able to take care of myself unlike a lot of people i can think of being on the point of leaving gave her the last word she hopped into the ford released the hand brake put the motorcar in gear and putputted away going was slow as shed known it would be the robert e lee highway had been one of the main lines of confederate advance which meant the red negro rebels had defended it as well as they could which in turn meant the artillery had gone to work which meant what was called a road was in many places anything but anne was glad shed managed to get her hands on several spare inner tubes and a pump and patches not many trees along the road were standing most had been blasted to tinder those that did stand often held ghastly fruit rebels captured and then summarily hanged ravens and buzzards flew up from them as the noisy ford rattled past the stench of death was everywhere and far stronger than the hanged bodies could have accounted for by themselves anne wondered if the fronts between the csa and usa were full of this same dreadful reek if they were how did the soldiers endure it in a field by the side of the road negroes were digging trenches that would probably serve as mass graves from a distance the scene looked almost as it would have before the red uprising began almost for the couple of whites who supervised the laborers carried rifles the spring sun glinted off the sharp edge of a bayonet anne bit her lip putting humptydumpty back together again in the csa wouldnt be easy if whites had to get labor out of blacks at gunpoint how were they supposed to fight the damnyankees at the same time and if they offered concessions to make negroes more willing to go along with them wasnt that as much as saying the reds had been right to rise against the government reaching st matthews took her more than twice as long as shed thought it would and she hadnt been optimistic setting out from the refugee camp by the time she got to the town nearest marshlands she found herself astonished shed made it at all she was also filthy from head to foot having repaired three punctures along the way st matthews shocked her again it wasnt so badly smashed up as some of the territory through which shed driven the rebellion had been dying on its feet by the time confederate forces reached the town and the reds hadnt fought house to house here but st matthews was the town she knew best in the back of her mind she expected to see it as it always had been with whitewashed picket fences neatly painted storefronts and even warehouses and streets lined with live oaks shaggy with moss most of the fences had been knocked flat two of the four big cotton warehouses were only burntout wreckage some of the live oaks still stood but the artillery bombardment before the assault on the town had put paid to most of them it would be a hundred years before saplings grew into trees that could match the ones now ruined annes eyes filled with tears shed kept trying to think of the rebellion as something that once defeated could in large measure be brushed aside negroes working under white mens guns had gone a fair way toward telling her how foolish that was the blasted oaks though warned even more loudly that the uprising would echo for generations a grayhaired white man in an oldfashioned gray uniform shifted a plug of tobacco from one illshaven cheek to the other and held up a hand ordering her to stop what theblazes you doinhere lady he demanded dont you know theres still all kinds o bandits and crazy niggers running around loose what am i doing here anne replied crisply i am going home here is my authorization she handed the militiaman a letter she had browbeaten out of the colonel in charge of the refugee camp by the way this fellow stared at the sheet of paper he couldnt read that she had it though impressed him into standing aside ifn they say its all right reckon it is he said touching the brim of his forage cap but you want to be careful out there i intend to be careful anne said a thumping lie if ever there was one she put some snap in her voice now kindly give that letter back so i can use it again at need oh yes maam sorry maam where her grimy appearance and this beatup motorcar hadnt convinced the militiaman she was a person of quality her manner did he handed the letter back to her the road from st matthews to marshlands was not so heavily cratered as the highway up to town had been by the time the rebels abandoned st matthews theyd pretty much abandoned organized resistance against confederate forces too but that thought had hardly crossed her mind before she heard a couple of brisk spatters of gunfire from the north the direction of the congaree swamps not all the reds it seemed had given up woods blocked any view of marshlands from the road till not long before a traveler needed to turn onto the lane leading up to the mansion i am ready for anything anne told herself again and again whatever i see i will bear up under it coughing and wheezing the ford passed the last trees there familiar as the mole she carried on one wrist was the opening into that winding lane just before you turned you looked along the lane and you saw hell she said quietly shed been hoping the place had survived but it looked like a skeleton with most of the flesh rotted away altogether against her will tears blurred her eyes jacob she whispered if marshlands had burned her brother must have burned with it by contrast the negro cottages off to one side of the great house looked exactly as they had before the red uprising began a couple of men were out hoeing in their gardens a couple of women were feeding chickens a whole raft of pickaninnies were running around raising hell after a little while her eyes left the vicinity of the mansion and traveled out to the cotton fields her teeth closed hard on the soft flesh inside her lower lip if anyone had done anything with the cotton since shed left for charleston all those months before she would have been astonished was that what the red revolution had been aboutthe freedom not to work her face twisted into an expression half sneer half snarl if the rest of the plantations in what had been the congaree socialist republic looked the same way a lot of planters were bankrupt busted flat she wasnt shed invested wisely ever since marshlands came into her hands most people though couldnt see past their noses and speaking of seeing one of the men in the garden plots had spotted her he dropped his hoe and pointed calling out to the rest one after another heads swung in her direction other than that none of the negroes moved that in itself chilled her before the uprising they would have come running up to her motorcar calling greetings and hoping she had trinkets for them telling lies she realized hiding what they really thought for a moment she was especially glad of the tredegar on the seat beside her then all at once she wasnt how much good would it do her what kind of arsenal did the negroes have hidden in those cabins shed prided herself on knowing her laborers well she hadnt known them at all maybe the army men had been right when they thought her crazy to come here by herself a woman walked slowly toward her it was she realized after too long julia who had been her body servant the young woman instead of a maids shirtwaist and black dress wore homespun made gaudy with bits of probably stolen finery she was also several months pregnant the only reason anne hadnt taken her to charleston was that shed gone there for an assignation not legitimate business had it been otherwise would julia have turned on her the thought was chilling but could hardly be avoided so yous come back miss anne julia said her voice had something of the old servile tone left in it but not much yes im back anne looked over the neglected acres of what had been the finest plantation in south carolina i dont know why the hell i bothered things they aint the same no mo julia said had truer words ever been spoken anne hadnt heard them almost as one equal to another she asked and what did you do in the uprising julia what did the niggers here do nothin julia said we stay here we mind we bidness but now she didnt meet annes eyes anne nodded this was a lie she recognized what happens when the soldiers start asking the same thing she said julia flinched anne smiled to herself yes no matter what she could manage mind my businessshe pointed to the forgotten fieldsalong with your own and ill keep the soldiers off your back you know i can do things like that have we got a bargain julia thought for most of a minute then nodded miss anne i think we has george enos had felt constricted on the mississippi he was used to the broad reaches of the atlantic to looking around from his perch on deck and seeing nothing but the endless ocean in all directions next to the atlantic any river even the father of waters seemed hardly more than an irrigation ditch and the cumberland was considerably narrower than the mississippi these days he and his fellow deck hands aboard the punishment wore army helmets painted navy blue this stretch of the river was supposed to be pretty clear of snipers but nobody with the brains god gave a haddock felt like betting his life on it before the punishment headed up the cumberland navy ironworkers had installed protection around the deck machine guns too little by little the war heading toward two years old they were figuring out that this riverine fighting had rules of its own george was glad of that but wondered what the devil had taken them so long as far as he could tell the rebs had got the idea from the beginning he pointed to the minesweeping boat moving slowly down the cumberland ahead of the punishment and said anybody would think the damn rebs did nothing but build mines in all the time between the second mexican war and now near as i can tell thats right wayne pitchess answered his connecticut accent not far removed from the flat vowels and swallowed rs of enos boston intonation then he shook his head and pointed out to the battered farms out beyond the river i take it back they raise tobacco too thats so george agreed some of it got into navy supply channels too probably by most unofficial means he had a pouch of pipe tobacco in a trouser pocket it wasnt as good as it might have beenwhich meant it had been cured or half cured after the war startedbut it was a lot better than nothing flags fluttered up the minesweepers signal lines the punishments engine changed its rhythm the monitor began crawling away from the sweeper as the screw reversed to give power astern rather than ahead id say they found one pitchess remarked george nodded id say youre right other thing id say is i hope they havent missed one there is that pitchess agreed you had to hope they hadnt missed one as you had to hope a storm wouldnt sink you out on the atlantic you couldnt do much about it either way the minesweeping boat cut the cable mooring the deadly device to the bottom of the cumberland when it bobbed to the surface the sweeper cut loose with its machine guns the explosion showered muddy water down onto enos a quarter of a mile away the punishment rocked as waves spread from the blast lord george had known what mines could do but hed never been so close to one when it went off if its all the same to everybody else id just as soon not run over one of those now that you mention it i think id rather be on top of my wife too wayne pitchess said with a veterans studied dryness george laughed at the comparison then walked over to his machine gun and got busy checking the mechanism hed finished cleaning not five minutes before most of the time he managed not to think about how much he missed sylvia he hadnt yet visited one of the whorehouses that sprouted alongside rivers like toadstools after rain he had stained his underwear once or twice waking up from dreams he didnt much remember dreams of the sort he hadnt had since not long after he started going to the barbershop for a shave engineers were busy at clarksville tennessee as us monitors pushed up the cumberland toward the town the confederates had dropped two railway bridges right into the water before the us monitors advanced any farther the steel and timber and the freight cars the rebs had run out onto the bridge to complicate their enemies lives all had to be cleared away it was slow work it was dangerous work too every so often confederate batteries off to the south would lob some threeinch shells in the direction of the fallen bridges the engineers didnt have a lot of heavy equipment with which to work once theyd cleared the river the us presence in this part of tennessee would firm up then they could bring in the tools they really needed now of course they wouldnt need them so much then yeah thats a hell of a thing pitchess said when george remarked on the paradox but hell if you wanted things simple you never would have joined the navy i suppose youre right enos said i joined the navy so i could give the rebs a kick in the slats to pay them back for the one they gave me i was already a sailor so what the helland i didnt want to get conscripted into the army but i never thought theyd stick me here in the middle of the country you join the navy you think youll be on the ocean right didnt matter to me one way or tother his friend answered i wasnt making enough to keep a roof on my head and food in my belly when i was fishing i figured i wouldnt starve in the navy and i was right about that a wry grin stretched across his lean weathered face maybe i didnt think about getting blown to smithereens as much as i shouldve men and mules straining mightily hauled a freight car out onto the north bank of the river pointing george said i expect thatll be the last train to clarksville for a good long time yeah pitchess said till we get our own rolling stock running through anyways confederate field guns opened up with another barrage just then shells screamed down on the engineers who dove for cover mules werent smart enough to do that or george thought stupid enough to start a war in the first place thin across the water the screams of wounded animals floated over to the punishment the guns had the bridge zeroed to a faretheewell and could strike at the wreckage or at either bank as they chose they didnt have the range for the punishment down so precisely that didnt keep them from trying to hit her though shells splashed into the river and chewed up the bushes on the northern bank george dove into the shelter the ironwrights had built around his machine gun a splinter hit the steel and clattered away he hadnt thought enough about getting blown to smithereens either growling and grumbling on its bearings the punishments turret swung round so the sixinch guns it carried bore on the field pieces harassing them on land sixinch cannon were heavy guns hard to move at any sort of speed except by rail on the water though they were nothing out of the ordinary and the punishment gave them a fine steady platform from which to work they roared the monitor heeled ever so slightly in the water from the recoil then recovered sprawled out as he was george felt the motion more acutely than he might have on his feet up in the armored crows nest atop the mast an officer with field glasses would be watching the fall of the shells and comparing it to the location of the rebel guns more grumbling noisesthese smaller to correct the error in the turrets previous position the big guns boomed again wafting powder fumes made george cough and sent tears streaming from his eyes confederate shells kept falling too one of them exploded against the turret a whole shower of splinters rattled off enos protective cage hed wondered whether the ironworkers had made it thick enough nothing tore through it to pierce him evidently they had the turret carried more armor than any other part of the punishment it was made to withstand a shell from a gun of the same caliber as those it carried it didnt laugh at a hit from a threeinch howitzer but it turned the blow without trouble and it replied with shells far heavier than those the field pieces threw hit shouted the spotter from the crows nest thats a hit by god he whooped with glee the guns fired several more salvos the spotter kept yelling encouragement what encouraged george more than anything else was that after a while no new fire came toward either the punishment or the clarksville bridges he got to his feet ready to hose down the riverbank with machinegun fire in case the rebs having lost their guns chose to bring riflemen forward to make the engineers jobs harderand perhaps to snipe at the men on the monitors deck too they often tried that after big waterborne guns smashed their artillery not this time though all was calm as the punishment floated on the cumberland the engineers got back to work the minesweeping boat ran right up to the wreckage to pick up a couple of wounded men on the shore pistol shots rang out soldiers were shooting wounded mules just another days work george thought noticing that thought brought him up sharply it was the sort of thought a veteran might have me he muttered no one answered naturally but no one needed to either roger kimball stood up on the conning tower of the bonefish he looked around all he saw were the cool gray waters of the north atlantic all he smelled was clean salt airnone of the rotting stinks of the south carolina swamps he sucked in a long deep breath and let it out like a connoisseur savoring a fine wine his executive officer smiled feels good to be back at sea doesnt it sir junior lieutenant brearley said feels better than good tom kimball answered were doing our proper job again and about time too if id wanted to be a policeman and wear a funny hat id have joined the police in the first place a wave crashed against the bonefishs bow the conning tower and the hatch leading down into the submersible were protected by canvas shieldsor so claimed the men whod designed the shields kimball supposed they were better than nothing they didnt keep him and brearley from getting seawater in the face they didnt keep more seawater from puddling under their feet or from dripping down the hatch brearley used a sleeve to wipe himself more or less dry his smile now was rueful harder to keep the boat dry than it was on the river price you pay for doing the proper job kimball said airily he could afford to be airy now up here when he went below the dieseloil and other stenches inside the bonefishall produced despite everything the crew could dowould easily surpass those of the swamps flanking the pee dee since that couldnt be helped he put it out of his mind wiping the lenses of his field glasses with a pocket handkerchief he raised the glasses to his eyes and scanned the horizon for a telltale plume of smoke that would mark a ship the wind quickly whipped away the exhaust from the bonefishs diesel bigger vessels though burned coal or fuel oil and left more prominent signatures in the air he spied nothing the bonefish might have been alone in the atlantic he didnt like that letting the binoculars thump down against his chest on their leather strap he pounded on the conning tower rail with his fist damn it tom theyre supposed to be out here yes sir the exec said that was all he could say intelligence had reported the us navy was gathering for a push against the british and french warships protecting their home countries merchant vessels sending one or two of those yankee ships to the bottom would make life easier for the entente powers against the twin colossi of the usa and germany as if picking the thought from his mind brearley said we have managed to keep the damnyankees and the huns from joining hands wed better go right on keeping em from doing that too sonny or you can kiss this war goodbye kimball answered dryly weve got to keep the trade route from argentina to french west africa open too or england starts starving even worse than she is already and weve got to keep the route from england to canada at least partway open or else the usa sits on canada like an elephant squashing a mouse if we manage to do all of that the soldiers can go on doing what theyre supposed to do have we got enough ships brearley asked have all of us togetherus and the british and the french and the russians and whatever the canadians have lefthave we got enough ships to do everything we have to do kimball clapped him on the back weve done it so farjust barely reckon we can keep on doing itjust barely and dont forget the japanese theyre giving england and canada quite a hand in the pacific by everything i hear dont know as how i really care for them fooling around in a white mans war brearley said but i suppose we have to grab the help now and be thankful for it and then worry later about sorting out what it means thats how it works kimball agreed as soon as hed spoken though he wished hed kept his mouth shut brearley was all for cutting a deal with the negroes too and then sorting out what that all meant later had his exec set him up so he would notice he was arguing one way on one of the questions and the other way on the other he let his eyes slide toward tom brearley sure as hell the young pup looked ever so slightly smug but brearley had too much sense to say anything so kimball couldnt gig him for it this round went to the junior lieutenant so kimball wouldnt have to admit as much he raised the field glasses once more to scan the horizon he did not do it expecting to spot anything more to give him an excuse not to answer and to change the subject when he did speak again but there off to the northeast rose an unmistakable plume of smoke he stiffened and thrust out an index finger as if he were a bird dog coming to the point tom brearley didnt have field glasses of his own before the war most of them had been made in germany and they remained in short supply throughout the entente powers but after a minute or so brearley nodded yes sir i see it too kimball called down to the petty officer at the wheel change course to ohfourfive aye aye sir ben coulter answered his voice caught with excitement as he sent a question up the hatchway you spotted something sir something yes kimball answered submersible officers and crew paid less attention to the minutiae of military formality than any other part of the cs navy dont know what yet he peered through the field glasses again a swell lifted the bonefish extending the horizon for him he got a glimpse of the hull producing the smoke thats a yankee destroyer sure as hell it is now the fun begins his lips curled back from his teeth in what was more nearly snarl than smile he started calculating at a furious clip a destroyer could run away from his submersible even when he was surfaced or could attack him with bigger guns than he carried submerged the bonefish made only nine knots going flat outa pace that would quickly exhaust her batteries and force her to the surface again he couldnt pursue the us ship then he had to see if he could place the submarine in her path and lie in wait for her if not hed have to let her escape if so lets go below tom kimball said his exec nodded and dove down the hatch kimball followed dogging it shut after him he bawled an order to the crew prepare to diveperiscope depth klaxons hooted tanks made bubbling popping noises as water flooded into them the bonefish slid under the water inthirtyeight seconds i make it brearley said an eye to his pocket watch kimball grunted that was acceptable but something less than wonderful he raised the periscope hope the damn thing isnt too misted up to see through he muttered the odds were about even he grunted again this time appreciatively the view was if not perfectly clear clear enough he turned the periscope in the direction of the destroyer hed spotted the fellow hadnt altered course which kimball devoutly hoped meant he hadnt a clue the bonefish was anywhere about he was unless kimball had botched his solution making about twenty knots and about two miles away give me course kimball told the helmsman and then spoke to the rest of the crew ready the torpedoes in the two forward tubes the bonefish crept east the us destroyer was doing most of the work coming right across his bow leaving itself wide open for a shotif it didnt pick up speed and steam past the submersible before the latter was in position to launch its deadly fish i want to get inside twelve hundred yards before i turn em loose kimball remarked more as if thinking out loud than talking to tom brearley ill shoot from a mile if i have to though and trust to luck that im not carrying any moldies yes sir brearley agreed duds were the baneand often the endof a submariners existence the executive officer went on are you sure you want to shoot from such long range sir a miss will bring the us fleet after us full bore just because theyre after us doesnt mean theyll catch us kimball said smugly so yes ill take the chance thanks he grinned after all if i sink that destroyer thatll bring the us fleet after us too yes sir brearley sounded as if he was smiling too kimball didnt look away from the periscope to see a good kid he thought absently a little on the soft side but a good kid and here came the destroyer fat and sassy hed have lookouts peering in all directions for periscopes but some of those fools would have seen enough periscopes that werent there to make officers leery of taking their reports too seriously they wouldnt be expecting confederate company quite so far out to sea either the bonefish was well past her normal cruising radius but shed picked up fuel from a freighter not long before and sowell give you damnyankees a surprise kimball muttered he wasnt going to get a shot off at twelve hundred yards the electric engines were too puny to get him close enough fast enough but he would be inside a mile any time you could split the difference between what you really wanted and what youd settle for you werent doing too bad depth he asked quietly thirtyfive feet sir brearley answered after checking the gauge give me a couple more degrees south coulter kimball said a little moresteadyfire number one fearsome clangs and hissings marked the launch of the first torpedo a moment later kimball shouted fire number two he studied both tracks with grave intensity they looked straight they looked good the destroyer had less than a minute to react and momentum that kept her from reacting fast she started to turn toward the bonefish presenting the smallest area for the fish to reach kimball couldnt tell whether the first torpedo passed under her bow or hit and failed to explode he hadnt snarled more than a couple of curses though when the second one caught her just aft of amidships hit he screamed hell of a hit shell go down from that damn me to hell if she dont the destroyer lay dead in the water and bent at an unnatural angle she was already starting to list some of the yankees aboard would make her boats kimball thought but some wouldnt too rebel yells ripped through the narrow steel tube in which the bonefishs crew lived and worked the men pounded one another on the back score one for the captain ben coulter whooped everybody pounded kimball on the back too something unthinkable in the surface navy give me course kimball told the helmsman heading obliquely away from the path of the torpedoes was a good way not to have your tracks followed half speed hed have mercy on the batteries after an hour he surfaced to recharge them foul pressurized air rushed out of the bonefish when he undogged the hatch all the stinks seemed worse somehow right at that moment he went up onto the conning tower to his relief now he spied no smoke plumes on the horizon good shooting sir tom brearley said coming up behind him thanks kimball said thats what they pay me for and speaking of pay we just made the damnyankees pay plenty we done licked em twice theyre stupid enough to think we cant do it three times running no matter what our niggers try doin they can damn well think again yes sir brearley said snow in my face in april major irving morrell said enthusiastically this by god this is the life yes sir captain charlie hall had rather less joy in his voice snow in your face about eight months a year hereabouts the snow blowing in his face and morrells obscured the canadian rockies for the moment morrell didnt mind hed seen them when the weather was better they were even grander than they were in the usa they were even snowier than they were in the usa too and that was saying something i hope you dont mind my telling you this morrell said to hall but i think youve been going at this the wrong way charge straight at the damn canucks and theyll slaughter you youve seen that halls face twisted he was a big bluff blond man bronzed by sun chapped by wind with a kaiser bill mustache he kept waxed and impeccable regardless of the weather he said its true sir i cant deny it we sent divisions into crows nest pass and came out with regiments the canucks didnt want to give up for hell and they were waiting for us to do what we did too morrell said give the enemy what hes waiting for and youll be sorry a hundred times out of a hundred the canucks made us pay and pay and what did we have when we were done paying less than wed hoped they just stopped running trains through crows nest pass and doubled up in kicking horse pass he pointed ahead us forces had been slogging toward kicking horse pass for the past year and a half he didnt intend to slog any more he was going to move and to make the canadians move too and when we finally take this one theyll go on up to yellowhead pass hall said this war is a slower business than anyone dreamt when we first started fighting if we drive enough nails into their coffin eventually they wont be able to pull the lid up any more morrell said i like that halls face was better suited for the grin it wore now than for its earlier grimace a couple of morrells other company commanders joined them then captain karl spadinger who for looks could have been charlie halls cousin and first lieutenant jephtha lewis who would have seemed more at home behind a plow on the great plains than in the rockies of alberta with them came sergeant saul finkel who had a dark quiet face and the long thinfingered hands of a watchmakerwhich he had been before joining the army heres what were going to do morrell said pointing to the canadian position ahead of them and then to the map he took from a pouch on his belt the view was better on the map the snow didnt obscure it weve got this fortified hill ahead of us i will lead the detachment advancing to the west sergeant finkel sir the sergeant said you and one machinegun squad from lieutenant lewis company will cover the ridge road up therehe showed what he had in mind both through the blowing snow and on the mapand block the canadians from coming down and getting in our rear i rely on you for this sergeant if i had to make do with anyone else id leave two guns behind but your weapon always works it will keep working sir finkel said morrell looked at his hands again anyone who could handle the tiny intricate gearing of watches was unlikely to have trouble keeping a machine gun operating and finkel along with being mechanically ept was also a brave coolheaded soldier morrell pointed to captain spadinger karl youll take the rest of your company and open the hostile position on the eastern side of the slope hold your fire as long as you can yes sir spadinger said as you ordered well be carrying extra grenades for when actual combat breaks out good morrell said spadingers efficiency pleased him which was why hed given him the secondary command for the attack he went on captain hall your rifle company and lieutenant lewis machinegun company less that one squad im leaving with sergeant finkel will accompany me on the main flanking thrust if we can chase the canucks off this hill weve gone a long way toward clearing the path to banff any questions gentlemen nobody said anything morrell nodded well try it then we advance as rapidly as possible keep speed in your minds above all else we move at in the fifteen minutes before they began to move he checked his men especially the teams manhandling the machine guns across country they were good troops in grim darwinian fashion most of the soldiers who didnt make good mountain troops were dead or wounded by now he felt the mens eyes on him too this would be the first real action theyd faced with him commanding them he didnt suppose they knew about his having had to leave the general staffhe hoped they didnt anyhowbut they had to be wondering about what he and they would be able to do together well they were finding out he didnt care to huddle in trenches lets go he said spruce and fir and swirling snow helped screen the men in greengray from the canadians above no firing broke out off to the right which relieved morrell to no small degree he grinned imagining spadingers men rounding up sentries and poking bayoneted rifles into dugouts catching the canucks by surprise his own men scooped up a fair number of prisoners too one of them brought back to morrell glared at him and said what the devil are you bastards doing so far from where the fighting is why moving it someplace else of course he answered cheerfully which made the canuck even less happy morrells leg tried to protest when he pushed up to the very head of his force but he ignored it its only pain he told himself and as he usually did managed to make himself believe it he reached the lead just in time to help capture a machinegun position the canadians had blasted out of the living rock of the hill again without firing a shot this is wonderful sir captain hall exclaimed weve got the drop on the canucks for sure this time so far so morrell began before good got out of his mouth a burst of fire made him whip his head back toward the direction which captain spadinger and his company had gone it sounded as if they were heavily engaged we appear to have lost the advantage of morrell didnt get to finish that sentence either machine guns from atop the hill opened up on his detachment before he could say surprise that was a surprise to him and not a pleasant one dig in he shouted do it now sweat saves blood as the riflemen began to obey he turned to lieutenant lewis get those machine guns set up weve got to neutralize that fire the machinegun crews mounted their heavy weapons on top of the even heavier tripods in time that would have kept a drill sergeant happy on the practice field it wasnt for prestige here it was for survival morrell cursed as one of his men slumped over briefly kicking in a way suggesting hed never get up again advance on them he yelled shift to the northeast so we can take that hilltop and support captain spadingers company move move move it wasnt the fight hed wanted but it was the fight he had now he had to make the best of it keeping everything as fluid as possible would also keep the canucks confused about how many men he had and what he intended to do with them since he suspected he was outnumbered that was all to the good back where this movement had originated sergeant finkels machine gun started hammering morrell nodded to himself the canucks wouldnt be getting into his rear now he had to see if he could get into theirs hold fire as much as you can as you advance he called to the riflemen let them think spadinger has the main force if they concentrate on him well make them regret it arent you telling the men more than they need to know captain hall shouted as the two of them ran to a boulder and flopped down behind it side by side bullets whined away from the other side of the stone then went elsewhere in search of fresh targets just the opposite captain morrell answered this way if i go down the attack will go forward because theyll know what i expect of them hall didnt look convinced but he didnt argue with his commanding officer either if morrells methods didnt work odds were hed end up dead and so beyond criticism morrell raised his voice keep the machine guns well forward lieutenant lewis lewis and his machine gunners bless their hearts didnt need that order they treated the machine guns almost like rifles advancing at a stumbling run from one patch of cover to the next they sawor hoped they saw even so morrell was worried and worse than worried from the sound of the fighting off to the east spadingers men werent withholding fire on the contrary it sounded as if every man was in the line fighting desperately to stay alive if the forces theyd run into could crush them those forces would swing back on him and smash him up too hold on karl he whispered fiercely make them pay the price one of the canuck machine guns up at the crest of the hill fell silent morrell whooped as he ran forward the canadians were used to facing slow carefully set up attacks not to this sort of lightning strike with things hitting them all at once from every which way and then he whooped again for men in khaki scrambled out of their trenches and ran downto the southeast toward captain spadingers embattled company they gave morrells men the kind of target soldiers dreamt about now he shouted give em everything weve got again the men did not need the order they loosed a storm of lead at the canadians who shouted in dismay at taking such fire from the right flank and rear yelling with glee the us soldiers dashed forward to take out the foes giving their comrades so much trouble half an hour later morrell stood on the height hed intended to bypass a long file of dejected prisoners many of them roughly bandaged stumbled back toward what had been the us line you dont fight fair one of them shouted to morrell good morrell answered the canuck scowled his own men laughed they felt like tigers now for that matter he felt on the tigerish side himself things hadnt gone exactly as hed thought they would but they seldom did one thing both real war and the general staff had taught him was that no plan long survived contact with the enemy he looked around the view was terrific hed taken the objective he hadnt taken crippling casualties doing it how hed taken it didnt matter that hed taken it did he looked around again a new question burned in his mindwhat could he do next jefferson pinkard looked down at himself his butternut uniform was so full of stains from the red dirt of southern georgia it might as well have started out mottled he smelled by the way his head itched he probably had lice emily would have thrown him in a kettle boiled him and shampooed him with kerosene before she let him into the house let alone into her bed he didnt care he was alive hed seen too many different kinds of horrible death these past few weekshed dealt out too many different kinds of horrible death these past few weeksto worry about anything past that the black belt socialist republic was dying when hed set out hed supposed that would make everything worthwhile did it he didnt know he didnt care much either he detached the bayonet from his tredegar and methodically cleaned it it was clean already but he wanted it cleaner it had had blood on it a couple of days before he couldnt see that blood not now but he knew it was there damn niggers ought to give up he muttered under his breath what you say that was hip rodriguez a recruit from down in sonora he didnt speak a whole lot of english most of what he did speak was vile up till the conscription bureau nabbed jeff pinkard hed thought of sonorans and chihuahuans as one step above negroes and a short step to boot but rodriguez had saved his life if that didnt make him a good fellow nothing ever would and so instead of barking jeff repeated himself adding theyre licked they damn well ought to know it rodriguez shrugged we keep licking they they quitone way or todder he carried a thoroughly nonregulation knife on his belt and a whetstone to go with it when he honed that blade it made a vicious little grinding sound he smiled enjoying it thats true pinkard admitted no two ways around it i guess question that keeps cominup in my mind though is what happens afterwards they gonna be pullin knives like yours out o their hip pockets and stabbin white men twenty years from now when they think they got the chance thats a hell of a way to try and run a country you know what im sayin rodriguez shrugged again they try that they get killed is no big nevermind to me he flashed a big shiny grin at jeff in sonora we dont have no mallatesno niggerstill you confederates you buy us from mexico you bring in the problem you should ought to fix it too with some amusement pinkard noted that rodriguez looked down his nose at negroes too in a way it made sense if not for them he would have been on the bottom himself but the blacks were on the bottom that made putting them down harder because they had so little to lose from their rebellion off to one side a field piece began barking throwing shells into albany georgia captain connolly looked up from his tin cup of coffee and said all right boys now we go and take their capital away from em about time id say and doing thatll just about put the last nail in the coffin cant hardly claim theyve got a country when they havent got a capital any more can they damnyankees do stinky salley said connolly didnt catch him opening his mouth he looked around all right whos the smart bird he demanded nobody said anything he gulped down the rest of the coffeeheavily laced with chicory and god only knew what all else if it was anything like jeffs pinkard didnt care it was hot and strong and made his heart beat faster the captain said come on boys time to do it he didnt tell them what to do and sit back on his duff he went out with them and helped them do it pinkard had appreciated that in a foundry foreman he appreciated it even more in an officer after patting himself to make sure he had plenty of spare clips for the tredegar he scrambled to his feet and trudged on toward albany the front hereabouts was too wide with too few men covering too many miles for proper entrenchment you dug foxholes where you happened to be fought out of them and advanced some more the survivors of the new regiment to which he belonged werent advancing in neat files of men now theyd learned better they moved forward in open order well spread out more space for the bullets to pass between pinkard thought a shot rang outbehind him one of his comrades went down clutching at the back of his left thigh half a dozen men close by went down too hitting the dirt at the first sound of gunfire pinkard was one of them hed developed a tremendous respect for the horrid things flying lead could do to the human body another shot kicked up red dirt and spat it in his face its another one of those hideout sons of bitches he said unhappily as their strength faltered the reds had formed the nasty habit of digging in with concealed foxholes facing not toward their confederate foes but away and holding their fire till the soldiers had gone past them theyd done considerable damage that way this fellow looked to have added to it stalking him through the pine woods was a deadly game of hide and seek he wounded another man before rodriguez flushed him out of his hole with a grenade and three other soldiers shot him from three different directions he wasnt quite dead even after that jeff put a round through his head at close range which made him stop thrashing and moaning what did you go and do that for one of the other confederates asked bastard deserved to suffer i reckon yeah but if we went and left him he might have found a way to do more mischief even shot up like he was pinkard answered oh tactics thats all right then said the other soldier a hulking tennessean named finley you talk kind of soft on niggers sometimes so i wondered if you was just doing him a kindness pinkard bristled he wasnt a hardliner and nobody could make him onehe was a free white man with a right to his opinion listen he said theres ten million of em in the csa or ten million take away however many got themselves killed in this stupid uprising of theirs we got to figure out what to do with em after this part of the shootings done put the slave chains back on em finley snapped serve em right not many confederates wanted to go that far for which pinkard thanked god they done showed they can fight he said you buy a big buck nigger now finley you think you ever dare turn your back on him finley scowled from under the brim of his helmet he didnt say anything which suited jeff fine they emerged from the woods a few hundred yards outside of albany field pieces were still pounding the town answering fire came mostly from the big houses on the north side of the main street from what had been the white section of the city red flags still flew defiantly above several of those houses bastards are doing it on purpose hurting whites as much as they can finley said now pinkard was the one who didnt answer one of those big houses with a twostory colonnaded porch held a machine gun it spat death out toward the advancing soldiers in butternut the fields had been plowed with shell holes pinkard jumped into one once he was in it he discovered he shared it with the stinking corpse of a negro he stayed where he was stench or no stench with bullets whining past overhead he figured hed wind up a corpse himself if he moved too soon but however much you might like the notion you couldnt huddle in a hole forever when the machine gun chose a different target he got up and ran for another hole closer to albany he got fired on again but made it safely the confederates were moving on the city from the west and the north the red rebels holed up inside did not have the firepower to keep them out but instead of fading back into the countryside the negroes fought house to house making the government forces clear them out with grenades and once or twice with the bayonet at last the reds were pushed back to the last couple of houses where they still had machine guns up and firing a flag still flew from one of them inside the negroes shouted the defiant cry theyd raised through the whole unpleasant engagement the people fo the people when gunfire eased for a moment pinkard shouted back give up you lying bastards we are the people liar your own self one of those machine guns lashed the rubble in which he lay hed expected that and stayed very low behind the big pile of red bricks that had been a chimney before a shell knocked it down but his words seemed to have angered the black rebels so much they didnt just want to kill him the same fellow whod yelled before shouted out again you aint the people you is the dogs o the aristocracy is what you is he barked derisively the hell you say pinkard answered a measure of how good his cover was lot more white men than niggers in the csa not in the black belt socialist republic the red retorted not in the others neither he laughed we havin our own war o secession ifn you want to put it like that jeff didnt want to put it like that even to himself it would have made the fight the negroes were raising seem altogether too legitimate to him and then another red let out a dark nasty laugh and added sure as hell aint mo white folks than niggers in the black belt socialist republic nowadays we done took care o that from off to the side a confederate soldier started pitching grenades into the house where the red revolutionaries were holed up pinkard had no idea whether they wounded any of the negroes they did set the house on fire that left the reds a desperate choice they could stay and burn or flee and get shot down they fled disciplined enough to carry the machine gun with them to set up again if they found fresh refuge they didnt one more house and the fighting was done captain connolly carried a red flag as he strode through the shattered wreckage of what had been a prosperous georgia farming town its over he said here its over pinkard looked around he felt giddy half stunned half drunk at being alive wearily he shook his head the fighting might have ended but the revolt and its aftermath werent over he wondered how many years would pass before they were he wondered if they ever would be remembrance day passed quietly in new york city soldiers circle men and military bands paraded as did newly raised units going off to the front enough soldiers with glittering bayonets and full clips in their rifles stood along the parade route to have marched on richmond and taken it in about ten daysthat was flora hamburgers sardonic thought at any rate the soldiers had ordershighly publicized ordersto shoot to kill at the first sign of trouble and a look that said they would have enjoyed doing it they seemed disappointed when the socialists didnt give them the chance now its our turn flora said back at the fourteenth ward socialist party offices after the sun set on a day without incident may day next week and then we show them what we really think of their government and their war they still may try to find some way to keep us from holding our parade herman bruck said nervously there is such a thing as the constitution of the united states flora said we have the right to petition for redress of grievances unless they put new york under martial law the way they did to utah and well make absolutely certain we give them no excuse to do that we dont necessarily have to give them any excuses maria trescas brown eyes flashed an agent provocateur i wouldnt put anything past teddy roosevelt bruck said darkly as a matter of fact i doubt tr would authorize anything like that flora said hes a class enemy but he has the full set of upperclass notions about legitimate and illegitimate ways and means as a storm of disagreement washed over her she held up a warning hand that doesnt mean i dont think there will be any provocations his henchmen dont worry about the niceties but i dont think the order for provocations comes straight from the top give the devil his due bettergive him a good kick in the tukhus and send him home in november that swung people back to her planning went onthe order of march for unions from all the different trades that would be joining up and as important the order of the speakers bruck said such a pity myron wont be here to tell the people the truth everyone sighed for a moment the mood in the offices went soft and sad congressman zuckerman had been able to rouse a crowd almost the way a goyishe preacher could in a tentshow revival reverently flora said if you werent a socialist after you heard myron zuckerman youd never be a socialist she forced herself back to business back to practicality but hes not here and we have to go on without him herman bruck appointed himself to the podium flora bit down on her lower lip herman wouldnt come close to zuckerman as an orator if he lived twenty years longer than methuselah as far as she was concerned zuckerman dead was a better orator than herman bruck alive she was about to add her own name to the list to counteract bruck not that she would have put it so crassly when he said and of course to keep the ladies happy well have a woman speaker or two flora why dont you take care of that for us shed never had to get out the hatpin to stop him from feeling her up she felt like pulling it from her hat now though and sticking it into him about three inches deep the way he casually dismissed the importance of half the human race was in a way a worse violation than if hed tried to squeeze her bosom maybe worse still was that he hadnt the slightest idea of what hed done ill speak to the women she said through tight lips and to the men too thats fine bruck said nodding geniallyno he hadnt a clue she studied himperfect coif perfect clothes perfect confidence inside where it didnt show she smiled a hunters smile perfect target when she got home that evening she found her mother and her younger sister esther in tears little yossel her nephew was in tears too but only in the ordinary babyish way of things whats wrong flora exclaimed in alarm with trembling finger her mother pointed to the supper table there among the advertising circulars lay an envelope with a formidable heading government of the united states of america war department the next line set in slightly smaller type in the same hardtoread font said bureau of selection for service the envelope was addressed to david hamburger oh no flora whispered the older of her younger brothers had turned eighteen a few months before and had dutifully enrolled himself at the local selection for service bureau offices the penalties for failing to enrolland the rewards for informantswere too high to make any other course possible ever since then the family had known this day might and probably would come that made it no easier to bear on its arrival benjamin hamburger came in next he spotted the envelope without prompting he said nothing but walked into the kitchen filled a shot glass with whiskey and knocked it back he breathed heavily after a moment he filled the glass again and drained it as quickly as before he often took one drink flora could not remember the last time hed taken two the apartment was eerily silent when david walked in as flora had he asked whats wrong no one spoke just as no one ever mentioned the angel of death but the angel was there mentioned or not so was the envelope no one had opened it the hamburgers never opened one anothers mail and when it was likely to be a letter like thisdavid did the job himself they want me to report for my physical examination next tuesdaythe second he said sophie had come in while he was opening the envelope she still wore mourning for her husband she began to wail as she had when shed learned yossel was dead nothing could console her her dismay set little yossel who had calmed down to wailing again that was the scene on which isaac hamburger walked in itll be all right david said over and over perhaps trying to convince himself as well as his kin it cant be helped anyhow where the other might well have been wrong that at least was true flora never remembered what she had for supper that night while she was making final preparations for the may day parade her brother would be looking forward to getting poked and prodded by coldhearted men in white coats intent on seeing how he would suit as cannon fodder she found herself wishing he were pale and consumptive not strong and ruddy and bursting with life life could burst all right so easily the family had seen that she went into the office the next morning full of grim determination to keep countless other young men from having to face the danger her brother was all too likely to confront that meant throwing all her energy into working with the groups taking part in the parade and into working with the authorities to make sure it went off with as little interference as possible we will be peaceable she promised over and over again we wont provoke anything dont provoke us in return and dont let the soldiers circle goons provoke us the united states still have a constitution dont they the authorities needed to be reminded of that even more than herman bruck did some of the answers she got from police captains and city bureaucrats were conciliatory some ambiguous at best and more than a few downright hostile she did what she could to defuse those sighing late in the afternoon on the saturday before the parade she said ive made more compromises the past week than in all the time i worked here up till then its good training for congress maria tresca answered the look she sent toward flora was speculative to say the least flora didnt answer not in words but her smile was jauntier than she would have thought possible considering how tired she was herman bruck never noticed the byplay he was busy tooimpressively ostentatiously busydrafting his speech may day dawned warm and muggy a day right out of july more than a few men in the crowds lining broadway sported straw hats instead of homburgs or caps as if it truly were summer the band at the head of the paradenot so fancy as the military bands that strutted down the avenue on remembrance daystruck up the internationale then the marseillaise and last the starspangled banner everyone cheered the national anthem the other two brought mingled cheers and boos the hell with the frogs and the hell with their song somebody shouted its a song of revolution flora shouted back as she marched along its a song against tyranny and oppression and for freedom dont you think we need that theyre the enemy the heckler yelled to her theyve forgotten freedom she returned defiantly she added and so have we a few eggs flew out of the crowd toward the parade the cops didnt do anything about that when somebody threw a bottle instead though they waded in nightsticks swinging flora gave a judicious nod throwing eggs wasnt that far from heckling and the constitution protected heckling no matter who did it a bottle now a bottle was liable to be lethal one of the red banners the socialists carried showed a barechested negro carrying a rifle revolution of the csa revolution in the usa the rebs put the niggers down that cry came out of the crowd at least twice every city block the socialists were ready for it does that mean you want us to act just like the confederates identifying us actions with those of the hated enemy reduced all but the most politically savvy hecklers to confusionbetter yet to speechless confusion jews and irishmen italians and a few negroes anglosaxons and germans too the marchers made their way up to central park where they congregated for the speeches herman bruck and flora climbed up onto the platform packed with politicians and labor leaders bruck eyed her with complacent glee and introduced her to some of the socialist bigwigs something even an egalitarian party possessed she hadnt yet met big bill haywood eyed her too in a manner that tempted her to take out the hatpin he had only one eye that tracked and he stank of whiskey but the furious energy he brought to any causewhether organizing or strikingmade him a force for the money power to reckon with give em hell missy he said in a gravelly bass they deserve it senator debs of indiana was more urbane but no more ready to back down tr wants to deal with us as the french dealt with the paris commune he said well show him we are stronger even in the midst of this foolish war we never should have agreed to help finance he grimaced at the tactical blunder his party had made back in flora wondered though whether he would say the same thing if as seemed likely he gained the socialist nomination for president later in the year one speaker after another went up to the podium blasted the democrats praised labor to the skies and withdrew and now from the fourteenth ward home of the late great congressman zuckerman mr herman bruck yelled the fellow in charge of keeping the speeches in some kind of order he stepped back herman bruck stepped forward he delivered his speech flora stopped listening to it about a minute and a half in it was everything shed thought it would be in its strengths and weaknesses the latter summarized by the yawns she saw out in the crowd bruck finished and stepped back to polite tepid applause also from the fourteenth ward miss flora hamburger the presenter shouted trying to ignore the pounding of her heart flora looked out over the podium at the sea of faces out there birds have nests she cried and pounded a fist down on the polished wood foxes have dens what does the proletariat have nothing but the strength of its right arms for the capitalists have stolen everything else and now not content with that they send the workers of our countrythe workers of the worldout to die by millions in a war that has nothing to do with them do we sit idly by and let that happen or do we take action brothers and sisters maybe fear for david who would go in for his examination tomorrow lent her even more passion than she would have had otherwise however that was by the time she finished the applause she got lifted her far higher above the crowd than could have been accounted for by the platform alone she stepped back dazed hardly knowing what shed done big bill haywoods hungry stare put her in mind of a wolf eyeing a slab of steak eugene debs said young lady i think i shall tear up my own speech herman bruck looked half astonished half terrified that somehow was sweetest of all tom kennedy put a friendly arm around cincinnatusshoulder come on into the back room he said have a cigar with us he laughed so did joe conroy the storekeeper waved cincinnatus into that back room with no small reluctance he followed the two white men in there inside he was sighingno worse he was sweating he didnt want to have anything to do with the confederate underground still operating in covington kentucky not any more he didnt but quite literally they knew where he lived if they wanted him to play along he either had to do it or betray them to the us occupying authorities and then live in fear for the rest of his life for now going along seemed less dangerous the back room smelled of tobacco and spices and sweets and leather with a faint undertone of potatoes going bad to his surprise conroy reached into a cigar box and handed him a plump panatella thank you suh he said in some surprise kennedy was the one whod always treated him pretty well to conroy hed been just another hired nigger hear tell youve been drivin trucks all over creation for the damnyankees these past few weeks conroy said reckon thats why you aint been in to see us much even when we put the signal up in the window for you its a fact suh cincinnatus agreed gratefully seizing on the excuse the storekeeper offered him sometimes im gone fo days at a time thats fine tom kennedy said he was thin and dapper and clever it wasnt by accident hed been running the hauling firm for which cincinnatus had worked before the war i always knew there was a lot to you cincinnatus once we win the war smart black fellows like you will have a lot more chances in the csa i reckon its in the cards you say that even after the red uprisin cincinnatus asked kennedy and conroy didnt know he was a parttime red himself but he was in no danger of blowing his cover with the questionthe only people who didnt know about the red negro attempted revolution were dead kennedy nodded quite seriously hell yes i say that richmond wont ever want that kind of thing to happen again not ever i tell you too many niggers to hold down all of you so i figure theyll have to give you some of what you want dont you cincinnatus shrugged he eyed joe conroy the storekeeper nodded however unenthusiastically that made cincinnatus think kennedy might be right the next question was did he care that was harder to answer a few weeks before he would have said a confederacy with some rights for blacks didnt sound too bad but now that hed met lieutenant straubing it didnt sound too good either hed seen that men who didnt care about color were rare in the usa in the csa they werent rarethey simply didnt exist taking his silence for consent kennedy picked up the box from which conroy had drawn the panatella and the box under it he opened the one under that it held not cigars but thinwalled lead cylinders of about the same size cincinnatus didnt know what they were for but he figured kennedy would tell him he was right kennedy picked up one of the tubes and said thanks to these little sugar plums we can make the yankees very unhappy theres a copper disk edgeon right in the middle herehe held the cylinder toward a kerosene lamp so cincinnatus could see it wasnt hollow quite all the way throughthat divides it into two compartments you put sulfuric acid in one picric acid in the other cork both ends with wax plugsand then all you have to do is wait wait for what cincinnatus was starting to get an idea but again he didnt know enough to be sure when the sulfuric acid eats through the copper it mixes with the picric acid right kennedy said with a grin that would have made him a hell of a snakeoil salesman and out both ends of the tube comes the nicest little spurt of flame you ever did see melts down the bomb so nothings left and starts a hell of a fire both at the same time set one in a crate of shells say i see what youre talkin about mr kennedy i surely do cincinnatus said the confederates had indeed come up with a nasty little toy here how much time goes by fore the stuff in there eats through the copper and the fire starts depends on how thick the copper disk is conroy answered anywhere from an hour or so to a couple of weeks we got all kinds you dont need to worry about that good cincinnatus said it wasnt good but it was better than it might have been if he started setting firebombs all over creation the yankees would take a while to associate the blazes with him but sooner or later they would he had no doubt of that the yankees werent stupid even lieutenant kennan did his job well enough no matter how wrongheaded his ideas about negroes were conroy and kennedy probably didnt think the yankees were stupid either what they did think was that cincinnatus was stupid with a big false smile pasted across his face the storekeeper said see how easy itll be boy not a chance in the world of getting caught cincinnatus glanced over to tom kennedy kennedy treated him as well as any confederate white had ever done and sometimes showed or seemed to show some understanding that dark skin didnt mean no brains if kennedy warned him to be careful now when he picked his spots and to make sure he didnt bring suspicion down on himselfhe wasnt sure what hed do then but at least hed have proof in his former boss actions that the csa might see its way clear to looking at negroes as human beings once the war was done kennedy smiled too joe is right cincinnatus he said you can see for yourself they wont ever have a clue about how the fires start you can do the cause a whole lot of good i see that mistuh kennedy suh cincinnatus said slowly the confederate cause came first with kennedy too how do i tell the fewhour bombs from the ones that go for days fore they catch on fire tom kennedys smile got broader he clapped cincinnatus on the back youre a good fellow you know that here ill show you he held out one of the lead tubes the time its set for is stamped right here you see this ones a sixhour delay he held up a warning forefinger thats not perfect mind you it might be four hours and it might be eight but it wont be two hours and it wont be two days either i got you cincinnatus said it was a good system it would do damage it would also get traced back to him sure as the sun would set tonight and come up again tomorrow conroy and kennedy had a rucksack ready for him to carry home it contained lead tubes inset with copper disks of varying thickness a glass jar full of oilylooking sulfuric acid and another jar that held a powdery yellowish substance presumably picric acid it also had a couple of dozen wax stoppers a spoon and a couple of glass funnels you dont want to get this stuff either kind on your skin or let the one go through the funnel thats held the other conroy said if the storekeeper was warning him cincinnatus figured he was dealing with nasty stuff indeed the rucksack was small but surprisingly heavylead was like that cincinnatus felt almost as if hed lugged a crate of ammunition home with him when he got back to the house elizabeths eyebrows shot up at the burden he brought in you dont want to know he told her and she didnt ask any more questions shed learned you were liable to be better off without some answers than with them that evening working in the sink after elizabeth had gone to bed cincinnatus carefully made up three firebombs one with a oneday disk one with a twoday disk and one with a fourteenday disk the longest in the whole set of tubes the men from the confederate underground had given him he accidentally spilled a drop of sulfuric acid on the galvanized iron it steamed and bubbled and was doing its best to eat its way right through the sink till he poured lots of water on it afterwards he eyed the discolored spot with considerable respect he didnt like having the bombs in his pocket when he went to work the next morning if a stopper came loose he figured hed like it even less nodding in a friendly way to lieutenant straubing came hard along with the other drivers he rattled south and stopped to drop his cargosmallarms ammunition from what was stenciled on the cratesa little past one in the afternoon while laborers unloaded the trucks he ate his lunch and wandered around planting a couple of bombs was as easy as kennedy and conroy had said it would be night had fallen by the time he got back to covington see you tomorrow cincinnatus lieutenant straubing called and waved yes suh cincinnatus waved back he walked home no signal for him in conroys front window todaythe confederate underground had got what it wanted from him the general store was quiet and dark closed for the day he ducked into the alley behind the place to make sure nothing was wrong then went on home he made up a couple of more bombs that evening and planted them the next day that evening conroy waved to him as he walked pastword of the first fire hed set must have already got back to the storekeeper glad youre happy cincinnatus thought and returned the wave as he had lieutenant straubings twelve days later conroys store burned to the ground jonathan moss thumb stabbed the firing button the tracers his machine gun spat helped him guide the line of fire across the fuselage of the british biplane whose pilot hadnt spied him coming till too late the flier slumped over his controls dead or unconscious his aeroplane spun down down down moss followed it down on the off chance the limey was shamming he wasnt the aeroplane crashed into the battered ground of nomansland and began to burn moss pulled up sharply down there in the trenches men in khaki were blazing away at him he didnt take them for granted not any more theyd brought him down once he wanted to give them as little chance of doing it again as he could a couple of bullets punched through the fabric covering his singledeckers wings the sound brought remembered fear in a way it hadnt when the englishman put some rounds through there no aeroplane had ever knocked him out of the sky which meant he could make himself believe no aeroplane could knock him out of the sky he couldnt pretend even to himself that the infantry which had got lucky once might not get lucky again small arms still aimed his way looking back in the rearview mirror mounted on the edge of the cockpit he saw muzzle flashes bright as the sun but his altimeter was winding steadily by the time he passed twentyfive hundred feet which didnt take long he was pretty safe up above him dud dudley waggled his wings in a victory salute moss waved back to the flight leader his buddies had covered for him while he flew down to confirm his kill of the british biplane he waved again good fellows he thought looking around for more opponents he found none dudley waggled his wings again and pointed back toward the aerodrome moss checked his fuel gauge he had less gas left than hed thought he didnt argue or try to pretend he hadnt seen but took his place in the flight above behind and to the left of dudley one after another the four martin singledeckers bounced to a stop on the rutted grass of the airstrip outside cambridge ontario groundcrew men came trotting up not only to see to the aeroplanes but also to pick up the word on what had happened in the war in the air johnny got one tom innis said slapping moss on the back hard enough to stagger him innis grin was wide and fierce and full of sharp teeth as if he were more wolf than man thats bully lieutenant the groundcrew men crowded around him one of them pressed a cigar into a pocket of his flying suit knock em all down sir the more you sting the fewer theyve got left eventually the fliers detached themselves and headed for captain pruitts office to make their official report that was really fine shooting sir phil eaker said he was skinny and blond and unlikely to be as young as he looked nobody moss thought from the height of his midtwenties was likely to be as young as phil eaker looked he also hadnt had enough flying time to harden him yet that would comeif he lived i dove on him out of the sun moss said shrugging he could smell the leftover fear in his sweat now that the slipstream wasnt blowing it away if he doesnt know youre there thats the easiest way to do the job he only got off a few rounds at me when the war broke out hed thought of himself as a knight of the air nothing left him happier now than a kill where the foe didnt have much chance to kill him he suspected knights in shining armor hadnt cried in their beer when they were able to bash out a saracens brains from behind either hardshell pruitt looked up from the papers on his desk when dudley and the men of his flight ducked into his tent the squadron commander pulled out a binder dipped his pen into a bottle of ink and said tell me gentlemen try to give me the abridged version i spend so much time filling out formshe waved at the documents over which hed been laboringi havent been getting the flight time i need yes sir dudley said concisely and accurately he reported on the flight the most significant item was moss downing the british flying scout moss told a good deal of that tale himself well done captain pruitt said when hed finished let me just see something here he shuffled through some manila folders opened one read what was in it and grunted then he said very good moss youre dismissed i have some matters i need to take up with your pals here you may see them again or i may decide to ship them all out for courtsmartial im sure they all deserve it sir moss said cheerfully which got him ripe raspberries from the other men in the flight he ignored them making his way back to his own tent when he peeled off his flight suit he realized how grimy and sweaty he was the aerodrome had rigged up a makeshift showerbath from an old fuel drum set on a wooden platform the day held a promise of summer he didnt even ask to have any hot water added to what was in there he just grabbed some soap and scrubbed till he was clean dudley innis and eaker still hadnt returned from captain pruitts office by the time moss got back to his tent he scratched his freshly washed head maybe hardshell hadnt been joking and they really were in dutch he smoked the cigar the groundcrew man had given him stretched out on his cot and dozed for half an hour his tentmates werent back when he woke up he muttered under his breath what the devil had they done why the devil hadnt they let him do some of it too he got up went outside and looked around no sign of them hardly any sign of anybody when you got down to it he ambled over to the officers lounge you could always find somebody there it was nearly sunset too which meant the place ought to be filling up for some heavyduty professional drinking the way it did every night except tonight oh a couple of pilots from another squadron were in there soaking up some whiskey but the place was dead except for them somebody get shot down moss wondered out loud it was the only thing he could think of but it didnt strike him as very likely when a fellow died up in the sky his comrades usually drank themselves stupid to remember him and to forget they might be next drinking alone wasnt mossidea of fun and the other two pilots didnt seem interested in company having nothing better to do he was about to wander off and sack out when a groundcrew corporal poked his head into the lounge spotted him and exclaimed oh there you are sir jesus im glad i found you hardshelluh captain pruitthe wants to see you right away i was you sir i wouldnt keep him waiting he disappeared moss hopped to his feet whatever trouble his flightmates were in maybe hed found a piece of it after all he hurried over to the captains tent which was only a few feet away wishing he hadnt been so blithely agreeable about hardshells courtmartialing his friends he was liable to be seeing a court himself captain pruitt stood outside the tent moss didnt think that was a good sign shadow shrouded the squadron commanders face he grunted on seeing jonathan approach here at last are you he growled well youd better come in then rudely he ducked through the tentflap by himself and didnt hold it for moss shaking his head moss followed he was going to get it all right braced for the worst he lifted the canvas and followed captain pruitt inside light blazed at him all the fliers he hadnt been able to find packed the inside of the tent they lacked only a coating of olive oil to be sardines in a can tom innis pressed a pint of whiskey into moss hand congratulations everybody shouted moss stared in astonishment what the devil he blurted laughter erupted and rolled over him in waves he doesnt even know dud dudley hooted clear a space and well show him then captain pruitt said clearing a space wasnt easy a few people grumbling had to go outside when moss finally saw pruitts desk it was for once clear of papers a cake sat on top of it instead a rectangular cake with white frosting a big chocolate symbol turned it into an enormous playing card with chocolate as at the appropriate corners my god moss said was that my fifth he counted on his fingers jesus i guess it was here we have something new pruitt observed the unintentional ace more laughter rang out dud dudley said its a good thing you finally showed up we were going to eat this beauty without you in a couple of minutes and then spend the next five years gloating about it give me a piece moss said fiercely you want a piece go to the brothel innis told him you want some cake stay here a bayonet lay next to the cake he picked it up and started slicing cake and whiskey wasnt a combination moss had had before after hed taken a couple of good swigs from the pint he didnt much care the hooch was good the cake was good the company was good and he didnt think at all about the man hed killed to earn the celebration jake featherston went from gun to gun making sure all six howitzers in the battery were well positioned supplied with shells and ready to open up if the yankees decided to pay the trenches a call he didnt think that would happen the drive through maryland had taken an even crueler toll on us forces than on those of the confederacy and the latest yankee push had drowned in an ocean of blood a couple of days before all the same he made sure he hunted up caleb meadows the next most senior sergeant in the battery and said you know what to give the damnyankees if they hit us while im gone and youre in charge sure do meadows adams apple bobbed up and down as he spoke he was a scrawny gangly man who spoke as if he thought somebody was counting how many words he said two guns sighted on that ridge they got two right in front of our line and tother two ready for whatever happens thats it jake agreed i expect ill be back by suppertime meadows nodded he didnt say anything that was in character he didnt salute either how could he when he and featherston were both sergeants jake had commanded the battery ever since captain stuart went out in a blaze of glory he was still a sergeant he didnt like still being a sergeant he went back through ceresville past a couple of mills that had stood by the look of what was left of them since the days of the revolutionary war they werent standing any more us guns had seen to that the bridge over the monocacy still did stand though the ground all around both ends of it had been chewed up by searching guns military policemen stood on the northeastern bank rifles at the ready to keep unauthorized personnel from crossing jake dug in his pocket produced his pass and displayed it to one of the men with a shiny mps gorget held on his neck by a length of chain the fellow examined it looked sour at being unable to find anything irregular and waved him across he had to ask several times before he could find his way to the headquarters of the army of northern virginia they were farther back toward frederick than hed thought probably to make sure no longrange us shells came to pay them a call once he got into the tent city he had to ask for more directions to get to intelligence a corporal who looked more like a young college professor was clacking away on a typewriter inside the flap of the tent which was big enough to be partitioned off into cubicles he finished the sentence he was on before looking up and saying yes sergeant his tone said he outranked featherston regardless of how many stripes each of them wore on his sleeve i have an appointment with major potter jake displayed his pass once more the corporal examined it more carefully than the military policeman had done he nodded one moment he vanished into the bowels of the tent when he came back he waved for jake to accompany him major clarence potter was typing too unlike the corporal he broke off as soon as he saw featherston sit down sergeant he said and then to the noncom whod escorted jake back to him fetch sergeant featherston a cup of coffee why dont you harold thanks it was an order but a polite one good coffee jake said a minute or so later you couldnt make coffee this tasty up near the front not when you were brewing it in a hurry in a pot you hardly ever got the chance to wash jake realized he couldnt complain too much not when the infantry hardly boasted a pot to their name but made their joe in old tin cans id say youve earned good coffee major potter said equably glad you like it we get the beans shipped up from a coffeehouse in washington but enough of that he glanced down to whatever paper he had in the typewriter id say youve earned any number of things but my opinion is not always the one that counts which is i suppose why you asked to see me today yes sir featherston said and then as hed feared it would all the frustration came boiling to the top sir who the devil do i have to kill to get myself promoted in this mans army potter frowned at him the major didnt look like much not till you saw his eyes snipers eyes the soldiers called a glance like that they didnt necessarily mean the fellow who had them was good with a rifle only that you didnt want to get on his bad side or hed make you pay but jake was also frowning too purely ticked off at the world to give a damn about what happened next and potter looked down first he fiddled with some of the papers on his desk then sighed im afraid killing yankees doesnt do the job sergeant i wish it did its the criterion id use but as i told you my views while they have some weight are not the governing ones i been running that battery every since captain stuart went down sir jake said and clarence potter nodded weve fought just as good with me in charge of things as we did with him maybe better besideshe had enough sense to hold his voice down but he couldnt keep the fury out of itthat damned fool would have got every man jack of us killed for nothin better than him goin out in a blaze of glory we would have lost every man and every gun we had i dont doubt it for a moment major potter said but you asked whom you had to kill to get a promotion sergeant after waiting for featherston to nod in turn he went on the plain answer is you will never be promoted in the first richmond howitzers and you are most unlikely to win promotion anywhere in the confederate states army for the simple reason that you killed captain jeb stuart iii jake stared at him potter was dead serious i didnt sir and you know i didnt jake said holding up one hand to deny the charge when i was starting to move the battery out i did everything i could to get him to come along he stopped me he stopped the whole battery if the damnyankees hadnt shot him he would have kept us there till they overran us if the damnyankees hadnt shot him potter repeated and why sergeant did he put himself in a position where the yankees were able to shoot him so easily you ought to know sir jake answered on account of the trouble he got into with you for keeping that snakeinthegrass nigger pompey around and not letting anybody find out the son of a bitch really was a red thats right major potter said and having fallen under a cloud he did the noble thing and fell on his sword tooor the modern equivalent at any rate his nostrils twitched by the way he said the noble thing he meant something more like the boneheaded thing but now we come down to it who was it sergeant featherston who first alerted army of northern virginia intelligence to the possibility that there might be something wrong with this pompey when a heavy shell landed close to the battery it picked you up and slammed you down and did its level best to tear your insides out right through your nose and mouth and ears that was how jake featherston felt now sitting in a woodandcanvas folding chair in a tent too far back of the line to have to worry about shellfire christ he said hoarsely theyre blaming me of course they are major potters manner was as mild as his appearance to look at him or listen to him youd peg him for a schoolteacheruntil you noticed what he had to say you wouldnt expect them to blame jeb stuart iii would you all he did sergeant was cause the suppression of an investigation if some low crass individual hadnt mentioned this pompeys name no one would have needed an investigation in the first place and captain stuart could have continued on his brave emptyheaded track toward a generals stars and wreath featherston stared at the intelligence officer again this time for an altogether different reason once hed drunk the stuff the russians cooked up from potatoes it didnt taste like anything so he hadnt thought he was drunktill he tried to stand up and fell over instead potters words were like that they unexpectedly turned the whole world sideways thats not fair sir jake said thats shooting the messenger for bad news potter suggested of course it is what do you expect that they should blame their own not likely sergeant you must know the first richmond howitzers are a blueblood regiment if ever there was one you must know jeb stuart jr has a fancy office in the war department down in richmond from which he sends eager young men out to die for their country ive done everything i can for you sergeant i know your record ive urged your promotion set that against the traditions of the first richmond howitzers and the animus of jeb stuart jr and it doesnt amount to a hill of beans im sorry if i transfer out ill be a sergeant im afraid till your dying day major potter interrupted jeb stuart iii blighted his career by being wrong youve blighted yours by being right sergeant featherston i am sorry i feel i ought to apologize for the entire confederate states of america but theres not one damned thing i can do about it have you got any more questions no sir jake got to his feet if thats how it is then thats how it is but if thats how it is then something stinks down in richmond sir he figured hed said too much there but clarence potter slowly nodded something does stink down in richmond if we try to root it out now were liable to lose the war in the confusion that would follow but if we dont try to root it out were liable to lose the war from the confusion it causes again i have no good answers for you i wish i did featherston saluted thank you for trying sir i hope you dont end up hurt on account of that all ive got to say is sooner or later there has to be a reckoning all these damn fools in fancy uniforms who let the niggers rise up without having a notion they were going to all the damn fools who cant think of anything past promoting their friends and relationsthey ought to pay the price yes sir they ought to pay the price thats a political decision not one for the military potter said if thats what it is jake broke off he saluted again and left the tent heading back to his battery all right he wasnt going to be a lieutenant he had a goal even so major abner dowling hurried into the fancy house on the outskirts of bowling green kentucky heres the motorcar sir come to take you back toward bremen he called loudlyyou had to call loudly if you expected general custer to hear you libbie custer heard him she was sitting in the parlor reading harpers her expression became remarkably similar to that of a snapping turtle on the point of biting back in bremen was olivia she didnt knowdowling didnt think she knewabout olivia not in particular but she knew there was someone like olivia back there and she didnt like it for beans but the car had been laid on not at general custers instance but at that of the secretary of war and she couldnt do anything about it no wonder she looked ready to chomp down on a broom handle and here came custer looking no happier himself this is all a pack of nonsense and idiocy he said loudly why dont they leave a man alone so he can run a proper campaign but no that doesnt satisfy them nothing satisfies them pack of ghouls and vultures is what they are back in philadelphia crunching the bones of good mens reputations at first dowling thought that soliloquy was delivered for libbies benefit but custer kept on grumbling louder than ever after he went outside and waddled toward the greengraypainted ford waiting for him in front of his residence the driver scrambled out and opened the door to the rear seat for him and dowling neither of them was thin which made that rear seat uncomfortably intimate as they rattled off toward the northwest custer leaned forward and asked the driver what is this stupid barrel thing youre taking me to see some newfangled invention i dont doubt well let me tell you lieutenant i am of the opinion that the world has seen too many new inventions already what do you think of that sir the driver said a gloriously unresponsive but polite answer dowling didnt know whether to wish the first army commander would shut up or to hope hed go on blathering and at long last give the war department enough rope to hang him a couple of miles later custer ordered the driver to stop so he could get out and stand behind a tree along with so much of the rest of him his kidneys werent what they had been forty years earlier he came back looking even more dissatisfied with the world than he had when hed scrambled up into the motorcar the road ran roughly parallel to the railroad line every so often it would swing away only to return at one of the places where it came very close to the tracks the driver stepped on the brake here we are sir he said here was a meadow that had been part of the confederate line defending bowling green about halfway between the tiny towns of sugar grove and dimple but for wrecked trenches and dozens of shell holes big enough to bury an elephant the only thing to be seen was an enormous greengray tent with a couple of squads worth of soldiers around it why the driver had chosen to stop at this particular place was beyond abner dowling it was evidently beyond custer too we arent even halfway back toward bremen he complained olivia had been on his beady little mind then libbie custer knew her husband well if youll just come with me sir the driver got out of the automobile and handed down custer and dowling as if they were a couple of fine ladies he headed for the tent the general and his adjutant perforce followed it was either that or be left all alone by the motorcar at every other step custer snarled about what the mud was doing to his boots a man came out of the tent he was wearing ordinary army trousers but with a leather jacket and leather helmet that put dowling in mind of flying gear with a wave he hurried toward custer as he got nearer dowling saw he wore a majors oak leaves on that jacket and a few steps later that he had the eagleonstar badge of a general staff officer general custer he said saluting im ned sherrard one of the men from the barrel works the way he said it you could hear the capital letters thudding into place the only trouble was dowling had no idea whether or not whatever he was describing deserved those capitals custer had evidently formed his own opinion and when do you and the barrel works go over niagara falls he inquired with acid courtesy major sherrards smile showed white even teeth as if custer had made a good joke we cant quite manage that yet with our barrels sir but were working on it he stuck out his hand to dowling a greeting of equal to equal major im pleased to meet you pleased to meet you too major dowling returned so what are these barrels anyway ive heard the name a few times the past couple of weeks and im curious i wish you hadnt heard it at all sherrard said security you know but it cant be helped i suppose weve got one inside the tent and you can see for yourself well even put it through its paces for you we want the commanding generals on all fronts familiar with these weapons because they will play an increasing role on the battlefield as time goes by newfangled foolishness custer said not bothering to keep his voice down but sherrards cheerful smile didnt waver he was made of stern stuff turning he led custer and dowling toward the tent some of the soldiers outside came to attention and saluted others ducked into the tent ahead of the officers sherrard held the flap open but not wide open go on in he said invitingly you can see what barrels are like better than i could explain them to you in a month of sundays custer of course went first he took one step into the enormous tent and then stopped in his tracks so that dowling almost ran into him excuse me sir but id like to see too the adjutant said plaintively as usual dowling had to repeat himself before custer took any notice of him when the general commanding first army finally did move out of the way dowling stared in wonder at the most astonishing piece of machinery hed ever seen it impressed custer too which wasnt easy isnt that bully he said softly isnt that just the bulliest thing in the whole wide world more like the ugliest thing in the whole wide world dowling said too startled for once to watch his tongue as well as he should have he got lucky custer didnt hear him major sherrard did but didnt act insulted custer said so this is what a barrel looks like eh bigger than i thought tougher than i thought too had dowling named the beast he would have called it a box not a barrel big it was twentyfive feet long if it was an inch and better than ten feet high too an enormous box of steel plates riveted together with a cannon sticking out from the slightly pointed front end four machine gunsa pair on either flanka drivers conning tower or whatever the proper name was sticking up from the middle of the top deck and as dowling saw when he walked around to the rear of the thing two more machine guns there youve got it on tracks instead of wheels he remarked thats right sherrard said proudly itll cross a trench seven feet wide easy as you pleaseclimb out of shell holes too and keep on going how big a crew custer asked eighteen major sherrard answered two on the cannonits a twoincher in case youre wondering sirtwo on each machine gun two mechanics on the engines a driver and a commander engines dowling said plural well yes now the major sounded a trifle embarrassed sarah bernhardt here does weigh something over thirty tons it takes a pair of white truck engines to push her along theyre a handed pair like gloves one with normal rotation one with reverse that lets us put the exhausts which are very hot in the center of the hull and the carburetors and manifolds toward the outside thirtytons dowling murmured how fast will uh sarah go eight miles an hour flat out on level ground the barrel enthusiast told him you must remember major shes carrying more than an inch of steel armor plate all around to keep machinegun fire from penetrating are these chaps gathered here and around the tent the crew custer asked eagerly if they are may i see the barrel in action they are and you may sherrard said thats why i brought you here sir he clapped his hands and called out a couple of sharp orders the crew scrambled into the barrel through hatches dowling had hardly noticed till they swung wide major sherrard opened the whole front of the tent which was dowling realized with that a special model itself made to shelter barrels the war department was serious about barrels all right if it had had tents created with them in mind the driver and commander up in that little box of a conning tower opened their armored vision slits as wide as they could no one would be shooting at them today the engineno engines dowling reminded himselfmust have had electric ignition because they sprang to noisy stinking life without anyone cranking them lets step outside major sherrard said even with the slits wide the driver hasnt got the best view of the road wouldnt do to have us squashed flat because he didnt notice we were there heh heh dowlings answering chuckle was distinctly dutiful custer though laughed almost as loud as he had on learning richard harding davis had dropped dead he was enjoying himself dowling wasnt the day was hot and sticky the worst kind of day for anyone with a corpulent frame like his as the sun beat down on him he wondered what it was like for the crew of the barrel inside that steel shell he wondered what it would be like in combat with the hatches and slits closed down tight he decided he was glad to be on the outside looking in not on the inside looking out the rumble changed note as the driver put sarah bernhardt into gear tracks clattering the barrel slowly crawled out of the tent through the slit dowling heard the commander shouting at the driver in spite of the shouting he wondered if the driver could hear anything down into a shell hole went the barrel the engine note changed again as the driver shifted gears up out of the hole the barrel came dirt clinging to its prow down into another hole it went up it came once more it rolled over some old rusty confederate barbed wire as if the stuff hadnt been there as major sherrard had said it showed no trouble crossing a trench wider than a man was tall do you know what this is major custer said to dowling thishe gave an utterly custerian melodramatic pauseis armored cavalry this for once is no flapdoodle this is a breakthrough machine it may well prove useful in trench warfare yes sir dowling agreedor half agreed custer had always wanted to use cavalry to force a breakthrough dowling remembered thinking about armored horses but to his mind sarah bernhardt didnt measure upthe barrel struck him as more like an armored hippopotamus but custer as usual was letting himself get carried away give me a hundred of these machines on a twomile front he declared and ill tear a hole in the rebs lines so big even a troop of blind threelegged dogs could go through it let alone our brave american soldiers major sherrard coughed the polite cough of a juniorgrade officer correcting his superior abner dowling knew that cough well war department tactical doctrine sir sherrard said is to employ barrels widely along the front to support as many different infantry units with them as possible poppycock custer exclaimed utter goo and drivel a massed blow is whats required majornothing less once we get into the rebs rear theyre ours sir major sherrard said stiffly i have to tell you that one criterion in the allocation of barrels to the various fronts will be commanders willingness to utilize them in the manner determined to be most efficacious by the war department custer looked like a cat choking on a hairball dowling turned to watch sarah bernhardt climb out of yet another shell hole so his commanding officer wouldnt see him laugh custer had gall all right if on three minutes acquaintance with barrels he presumed to offer a doctrine for them wildly at odds with that of the people whod invented them in the first place well custers gall wasnt anything with which dowling had been unacquainted already very well the general commanding first army said his voice mild though his face was red ill use them exactly the way the wise men in philadelphia say i should good major sherrard smiled now of course he smiledhed got his way progress on this front i am sure will improve because of them im sure of that myself custer said now dowling did look at him and sharply he was sure of something toosure his boss was lying reggie bartlett glanced over at senior lieutenant ralph briggs briggs no longer looked like a recruiting poster for the confederate states navy as he had all through his stay in the prisonerofwar camp near beckley west virginia what he looked like now was a hayseed he was wearing a collarless cotton shirt under faded denim overalls hed hooked off a clothesline while a farm wife was busy in the kitchen a disreputable straw hat perched on his head at an even more disreputable angle reggie looked down at himself by his clothes he could have been briggs cousin his shirt instead of hiding under overalls was tucked into a pair of dungarees out at the knee and held up by a rope belt in lieu of galluses the straw hat keeping the sun out of his eyes was even more battered than the one briggs wore catching the glances briggs clicked his tongue between his teeth weve got to do something about our shoes he said fretfully if anyone takes a good long look at them were ruined sure are ralph bartlett said in his not very good rendering of a west virginia twang an accent altogether different not only from his own soft richmond intonations but also from the yankee way of talking briggs had tried to teach him his brown sturdy confederate army boots were at least well made for marching briggs navy shoes both tighter and less strongly made had given him trouble after he and reggie and several others tunneled their way out of the prisonerofwar camp reggie went on hard to steal shoes though and no promise theyll fit once weve done it i know briggs said unhappy still wish we could walk into a town and buy some but he broke off reggie understood why all too well for one thing they had no money for another in these little hill towns they were strangers with a capital s and for a third showing himself in confederate footgear was the fastest ticket back to camp reggie could think of way off in the distance behind them hounds belled the sound sent chills running down reggies spine he didnt think the hounds were after briggs and him theyd been free for several days now and had done everything they knew how to do to break their trail but other pairs of confederate prisoners were also on the loose every bunch the damnyankees recaptured hurt the cause of the csa and besidesnow i know what niggers must have felt like running away from their masters with the hounds after them reggie said hadnt thought of that briggs paused for a moment to take off his hat and fan himself with it he set the straw back on his head his expression darkened id like to set the dogs on some niggers too the way they rose up against us they ought to pay for that way they lorded it over us in camp too reggie said full of remembered anger at the insults hed endured damnyankees set that up briggs said wanted to turn us and them against each other reggie nodded hed seen the same thing himself the navy man went on i will say it did a better job than i ever thought it would those niggers had no loyalty to their country at all he would have said more but a bend in the road brought a town into sight up ahead thatll beshady spring reggie asked doubtfully thats right ralph briggs sounded altogether sure of himself it was as if he had a map of west virginia stored inside his head every so often when he needed to hed pull it down take a look and then roll it up again reggie wondered how and why hed acquired that ability which didnt seem a very useful one for a navy man to have whatever the name of the town was though they had to avoid it they had to avoid people and towns as much as they could us forces paid a bounty on escaped prisoners the locals captured even had that not been so west virginians werent to be trusted when virginia seceded from the usa theyd seceded from virginia and made that secession stick they had no love for the confederate states of america the hillsides surrounding shady spring werent too steep forests of oaks and poplars clothed them so ralph briggs said at any rate bartlett whod lived all his life in richmond couldnt have told one tree from another to escape the firing squad when he and briggs came to a rill they stopped and drank and washed their faces and hands then splashed along in the water for a couple of hundred yards before returning to dry land no point making the dogs lives any easier in case they are on our trail reggie remarked youre right about that briggs said although hiking through the water soaked his feet and did his shoes more harm than it did to bartletts taller boots here and there in the woods sometimes by themselves sometimes in small clusters sometimes in whole groves dead or dying trees stood barebranched as if in winter under the warm spring sun reggie pointed whats wrong with them he asked having developed considerable respect for how much bartlett knew and the navy man did not disappoint him chestnut blight he answered started in new york city ten maybe twelve years ago been spreading ever since way things are going wont be a chestnut tree left in the usa or the csa in a few years time damnyankees let all sort of foreign things into their country he spat in disgust chestnut blight reggie echoed now that briggs mentioned it he remembered reading something about it in the newspapers a couple of years before so these are chestnuts he wouldnt have known it unless briggs had told him these were chestnuts briggs corrected him now the yankees got the blight and now theyre giving it to us he scowled chestnuts the warwhats the difference reggies stomach rumbled it had been doing that right along but this was a growl a bear would have been proud to claim reggie went through his trouser pockets he came up with half a square of hardtack the last of the painfully saved food hed brought out of camp even more painful was breaking the fragment in two and offering briggs a piece we dont get our hand on some more grub were not going to make it out of west virginia whether the damnyankees catch up with us or not reggie said youre right briggs sounded as if he hated to admit it were going to have to kill something or steal something one or the other they tramped on through the woods bartletts nostrils twitched thats smoke he said at first he thought it came from shady spring but theyd gone west to skirt the town and the breeze was blowing into their faces not from their backs thats a farm up ahead somewhere he added briggs was thinking along with him lots of chances to get food from a farm he sniffed thats not just smoke either smells like theyre smoking meatvenison or maybe ham hell in these back woods maybe even bear for all i know reggie knew nothing about bears the thought of there being bears in these woods hadnt occurred to him till the navy man mentioned it he looked around as if expecting to see black shaggy shapes coming out from behind every tree then he sniffed again smelling meat after months on camp rations made him ready to fight every bear in the usa for a chance at someor to eat one if the farmer had done the fighting for him lets follow our noses he said carved out of the middle of the woods were some tiny fields full of corn and tobacco a couple of children fed chickens near a barn a woman bustled between that barn and the farmhouse no man was visible hes probably in the army briggs whispered as he and bartlett stared hungrily from the edge of the forest at the hollow log mounted upright over smoldering hickory chips from the top of the log issued the wonderful smell that had drawn them here well wait till dark till theyve all gone to bed reggie said then we grab it and get the hell out liable to be a dog briggs said meats liable not to be smoked all the way through either i dont see any dog i dont hear any dog do you bartlett asked and ralph briggs shook his head reggie went on and i dont care about the meat either hell i dont care if its raw ill eat it wont you when briggs didnt answer he presumed hed won his point and the thievery went off better than hed dared hope a couple of kerosene lanterns glowed inside the farmhouse for half an hour or so after sundown then went out that left the night to the moon and the stars and the lightning bugs reggie and briggs waited for an hour then sauntered forward no dog went crazy no rifle poked out of a window they stole the hollow log and carried it away with nobody inside the farmhouse any the wiser it proved to be pork in there ribs and chops and all sorts of good things dont eat too much briggs warned youll make yourself sick you were empty so long he was an officer so reggie didnt scream shut up at him he ate till he was deliciously full a feeling he hadnt known for a long time carrying the smoked pork they couldnt finish the two of them headed south again theyd done a deal of traveling by night when they could use the roads with less risk of being recognized for what they were and every foot they gained was a foot their pursuers would have to make up in the morning since the war started the usa had punched a railroad south and east from beckley through shady spring and flat rock to join the lines already going into eastern virginia the damnyankees are throwing everything theyve got into this war reggie said pointing to the new bright rails gleaming in the moonlight close by the road i know briggs voice was bleak it worries me half an hour later a southbound train came by reggie and briggs hid by the side of the road till it passed to bartletts surprise it had only a few passenger cars behind them came a long stretch of flatcars carrying big shapes shrouded in canvas each flatcar also carried a couple of armed guards theyre singing something now ralph briggs sounded indignant as if us soldiers had no business enjoying themselves what in blazes are they singing i know that tune reggie told him its roll out the barrel a couple of officers from the corps of engineers came up to the stretch of trench on the roanoke front chester martins squad called their own what are you up to martin called to them curious about the strips of white cloth they were tying to pegs setting up the approach replied one of the engineers a stocky bald bulletheaded fellow with a closecropped fringe of gray hair above his ears and at the back of his neck the answer didnt tell chester anything much but it didnt anger him either the engineer sounded like a man who knew his own business so well he forgot other people didnt know it at all martin approved of people who knew what they were doing hed seen too many who hadnt the foggiest notion sunshine glinted off the wire frames of captain orville wyatts glasses martin worried about his captain another competent man he didnt want to lose those spectacles might make him easier for a sniper to spot wyatt said dont joggle lieutenant colonel gross elbow sergeant this has to do with what was discussed in the briefing yesterday martin shook his head annoyed at himself im sorry sir i should have figured that out he looked around to see how many of his men were paying attention he hated looking dumb in front of them dont worry about it lieutenant colonel gross said he seemed younger when he smiled this is new for everybody and we have to work out what needs doing as we go along the real point is thisll be new for the rebs too he pointed over past the us barbed wire past nomansland past the cs wire to the trenches beyond if everything goes according to hoyle captain wyatt said well take a big bite out of the rebs real estate tomorrow morning specs peterson was standing not far from martin he pitched his voice so the sergeant could hear but the captain couldnt yeah and if it doesnt work theyre going to bury us in gunnysacks on account of the rebsll blow us all over the landscape i know martin said also quietly you got any better ideas though specs this duking it out in the trenches is getting us nowhere fast hey what are you talkin about sarge paul andersen said weve moved this front forward a good ten miles and it hasnt taken us two years to do it at that rate we ought to be in richmondthe corporal paused calculating on his fingersoh about twenty minutes before the second coming everybody laughed everybody pretended what andersen had said was only funny not the gospel truth specs peterson liked an argument as well as the next guy and wasnt shy about arguing with his superiors but he didnt say boo he just made sure he had the full load of grenades everybody was supposed to carry over the top darkness fell this sector of the front had been pretty quiet lately every so often a rifle shot would ring out or somebody on one side or the other would spray the foes trenches with a couple of belts of machinegun fire but the artillery didnt add its thunder to the hailstorm effects from both sides small arms martin knew that wouldnt last he rolled himself in his blanket and got what sleep he could he wouldnt be sleeping much tomorrow not unless he slept forever at the barrage began martin didnt sleep any more after that the noise he thought was plenty to wake half the smashedup dead whose corpses manured the roanoke river valley some of his men though did their damnedest to sleep right through the bombardment he made sure everybody was up and ready to move listen this is my neck were talking about earnshaw he growled to one yawning private if youre not there running alongside me its liable to mean some damn reb gets a chance to draw a bead on me he wouldnt have had otherwise you think im going to let that happen so you can sleep late youre crazy captain wyatt was up and prowling the trench too where the hell are the barrels he said about half past three they were supposed to be here at without them we dont have a show that wasnt quite true the infantry no doubt would assault the confederate lines with or without barrels without them the foot soldiers were sure to be slaughtered with them they wereless sure to be slaughtered two barrels came rumbling up at where the devil have you been wyatt demanded his voice a whiplash of anger chester martin didnt say anything this was the first time hed actually seen barrels their great slabs of steel spied mostly in silhouette put him in mind of a cross between a battleship and a prehistoric monster sorry sir one of the men riding atop a barrel said through the unending thunder of the barrage and the flatulent snarl of the machines engines we got lost about six times in spite of the tape and we broke down a couple times too thats where bessie mccoy is now somebody else added the engine men said they thought they could get her running again though martin approached the barrel you fellows better get inside if thats what you do he said youre at the front now the rebs figure out youre here a few machinegun bursts and you wont be any more with obvious reluctance the soldiers climbed down off the roofs of the barrels and into their places inside the contraptions it had to be hotter than hell in there and stinking of gasoline fumes too maybe the steel kept bullets out but it kept other things in bessie mccoy limped into place at fifteen minutes before the attack was due to start as twilight brightened toward dawn martin made out the names painted on the other barrels vengeance and halfmoon the latter with an outhouse under the word he still didnt know whether to be encouraged all three barrels had made it or dismayed theyd had so much trouble doing it if dismayed turned out to be the right answer he figured hed end up dead at on the dot the barrage moved deeper into the confederate trench system to keep the rebels from bringing up reinforcements captain wyatt blew his whistle the barrels rumbled forward at about walking pace treads grinding and clanking the cannon each one of them carried at its prow sent shells into the confederate trenches from across nomansland chester martin heard the shouts of fear and alarm the rebs let out rebel rifles and machine guns opened up on the barrels they might as well have been shooting at so many ambulatory boulders sedate but deadly the barrels kept coming they rolled through the us barbed wire they went down into shell holes and craters and came up the other side still pounding the rebel trenches they flattened the confederate barbed wire lets go boys captain wyatt shouted that bessie she is the mccoy chester martin and his squad scrambled out of the trench and sprinted toward the confederate lines only light fire came their way most of what the rebs had was focused on the barrels it wasnt doing much good either all three machines kept moving forward firing not just cannon now but the machine guns on their sides too bessie mccoy rumbled up to the foremost rebel trench and poured enfilading fire down its length vengeance and halfmoon were only a few yards behind vengeance went right over that first trench and positioned itself to enfilade the second halfmoon blazed away at confederate soldiers who weremartin rubbed his eyes to make sure he saw straightrunning for their lives half a mile to the north a couple of more barrels had forced their way into the confederate position half a mile to the south two others had done the same though a third sat burning in the middle of nomansland martin noticed the other barrels only peripherally he scrambled over the parapet and leaped down into the confederate trenches a lot of men in butternut lay in them some moving some not he threw a grenade over the top into a traverse and then dashed into it ready to shoot or bayonet whomever hed stunned dont kill us yank several men cried at once they threw down their rifles and threw up their hands we give up go on back there then martin growled pointing toward the us position from which hed come the newcaught prisoners babbled thanks and obeyed what are those horrible things one of them asked pointing toward the barrels which were systematically raking trench line after trench line concentrating most of all on machinegun nests i think martin said i think theyre called victory all along the line rebs were giving up in numbers greater than he ever remembered seeing and they were running away too unwilling to die to no purpose trying to halt the invincible barrels in all the time hed spent at the front line hed never seen confederate soldiers run like that hed dreamt of it but hed never seen it paul andersen shouted another word of which hed dreamt breakthrough for much of the rest of that morning martin thought his buddy was right they stormed through the confederate trench system whenever a machine gun or some holdouts in a strong position gave them trouble one barrel or another waddled over to it and poured bullets or shells into it until the diehards either surrendered or died i dont believe it captain wyatt said over and over weve come a good mile since daybreak no wonder he sounded disbelieving on this front mobility was more often measured in yards we keep it up well be out of the trenches and into their rear by nightfall yes sir martin said he had trouble believing it too a deepthroated rumble behind him made him turn his head here comes bessie mccoy over another trench the barrel by then had crossed so many of them that hed come to take its ability for granted the lip of this one though was soft and muddy and gave way under the weight of the massive machine it went into the trench at an awkward nosedown angle martin saw at a glance that it couldnt move forward any more its engine roared as it tried reverse that didnt help either one of the side machinegunners opened up a hatch and shouted were stuck youre going to have to dig us out if you want us to keep moving more hatches opened and barrel crewmen came out to help with the digging and to escape the heat and fumes in which theyd been trapped for hours some of them simply sprawled in the dirt and sucked in great long breaths of fresh air now captain wyatt looked worried thats the second barrel weve lost halfmoon broke down back there and they still havent been able to get it going again if anything happens to vengeance the barrel in question fired its cannon the men whod pushed farthest into the confederate works started shooting too and kept it up even though not much answering fire came back martin stuck his head up to see why everybody was excited here came a battery of those cursed confederate quickfiring threeinch guns they sensibly stopped outside of rifle range in such cover as they could find and started firing over open sights at vengeance the barrel returned fire but it had only one cannon and that far slower between rounds than the rebel pieces vengeance was armored against rifle and machinegun bullets but not against shells if you let a sledgehammer fall onto an iron floor from a building a hundred stories high you might get a noise like the one the shells made slamming into armor plate vengeance started burning hatches popped open crewmen dove out the confederate guns shelled them too rebel yells announced the arrival of reinforcements for the enemy now us troops thin on the ground and without barrels to support them were the ones who had to fall back bessie mccoys crew salvaged her guns and set her afire to deny her to the confederates then joined the retreat when night fell martin was still in what had been confederate trenches but not very far in the rebs had taken back about twothirds of what theyd lost in the morning he turned to paul andersen and let out a long weary sigh not quite a breakthrough no i guess not andersen allowed we got more work to do he started rolling a cigarette not quite a breakthrough but goddamnyou could see one from where we were yeah martin sighed again and i wonder how long itll be before we see another one arthur mcgregor rode his wagon toward rosenfeld manitoba maude sat on the seat beside him her back ramrod straight hands clasped tightly in her lap they both wore seldomused sunday best the wing collar and cravat seemed to be trying to strangle mcgregor who couldnt remember the last time hed put on a jacket with lapels maybe we should have brought the girls maude said her voice under tight rein only her mouth moved she did not turn her head to look at her husband he shook his head nobetter we left them with the langdons his own harshly carved face got harsher yet the yanks wont take pity on us because weve got em along maude next yank officer who knows what pitys about will be the first if were going to persuade them to let alexander go well have to make a case like we were in court she nodded once jerkily and then sat still again the wagon jounced on toward rosenfeld the ruts in the road didnt fit the width of the wheels any more us trucks had cut their own ruts outside of town us soldiers inspected the wagon as carefully as they had when the whole mcgregor clan came into rosenfeld the day alexander was seized finding nothing the soldiers let the wagon go on as usual these days yankees far outnumbered canadians on rosenfelds few streets their trafficwagons trucks a swarm of honking fordstook priority over civilian vehicles too mcgregor hitched the wagon as soon as he could put a feed bag on the horses head and walked toward what had been the sheriffs office and jail but now confined not drunks and burglars but men guilty of nothing worse than wanting to be free of the smothering embrace of the united states outside the entrance stood two armed sentries in greengray one of them patted down mcgregor the other spoke to maude come with me maam we have a woman next door to search you when she made as if to balk the sentry said maam if you arent searched you dont go in those are the orders i have and i cant change em back quivering with indignation she followed him you arent trying very hard to make friends for yourselves are you mcgregor said to the remaining sentry the fellow shrugged better safe than sorry maude returned in a couple of minutes looking even more furious coming than she had going she must have satisfied the searcher though for the sentries opened the door and stood aside to let her and her husband make their petition to the occupying authorities captain hannebrink sat at a desk filling out forms but for his uniform he might have been a postmaster like wilfred rokeby or perhaps a bank teller but hed seemed soldierly enough and to spare out at mcgregors farm he set down his pen now and got to his feet mr and mrs mcgregor he said polite enough even if his minions werent good morning captain arthur mcgregor said he hated having to crawl before any man hed worked like a plow horsehed worked harder than his plow horsebefore the war but hed been free no hed thought hed been free it was just that the governmentthe government hed frequently despisedhad held trouble at arms length from him then it couldnt do that any more and the regime under which he now lived made trouble as close as a punch in the eye he might not have crawled for himself for alexander for his only son he would crawl what was pride worth set against your boy he began again captain hannebrink sir by now you must know alexander didnt have anything to do with that bomb on the train tracks i must know it the american officer shook his head here sit down both of you ill hear what you have to say the chairs to which he pointed were hard angular and functional us army issue as out of place in the office as his sharp american accent he let arthur mcgregor do the fussing for his wife accurately surmising she would not want him pushing the chair about for her when she was as comfortable as she could be he sat back down himself all right tell me why i must know that because of what you done to the other boys you caught mcgregor blurted his lips skinned back from his teeth in a snarl of anger at himself he hadnt meant to say it like that saying it like that made him think about how harsh the occupying authorities really were captain hannebrink steepled his fingers the penalty for sabotage against the united states army is death mr mcgregor he said we have made that very plain it cannot come as a surprise to anyone not now boys mcgregor said thickly you shot boys they were playing a mans game im sorry to say if theyd succeeded what they would have done to our train would have been no different because they were young hannebrink said this way perhaps other boys here in manitoba will come to understand that this is not a bully romantic lark this is a war and will be waged as such he didnt look particularly fearsome he was on the lean side with sandy hair mild gray eyes and a long thoughtful face only his uniform and his waxed kaiser wilhelm mustache said he wasnt a canadian somehow that very plainness made him more frightening not less licking his lips arthur mcgregor said but you didnt shoot alexander that must mean you know he didnt have anything to do with it because because if you had even the slightest suspicion you would have dragged him out against a wall given him a blindfold and sent him home to me in a pine box for burial but he couldnt say that to the american your sons case is not clearcut i admit as much hannebrink said it is possible he did not know about this particular explosive device he held up one finger as if expecting mcgregor to interrupt possible i say by no means proven there appears to be no doubt he associated with these subversives and saboteurs theyre his friends maude mcgregor burst out captain theyre boys hes known as long as hes been on this earth and besides where in canada will you find any boys that age who dont conversations with captain hannebrink had a way of breaking down in midsentence this one should have broken down a few words sooner hannebrink fiddled with one point of that absurd upjutting mustache then finished for maude where will i find canadian boys that age who dont despise the united states and everything they stand for there are some mrs mcgregor i assure you of that his matteroffact confidence was more chilling than bluster would have been and arthur mcgregor feared he was right some people had to be on the winning side no matter what and the usa looked like the winning side right now bootlickers mcgregor thought but that did not help alexander mcgregor said you cant blame him for what these others tried to do why cant i hannebrink returned canadian law recognizes the concepts of an accessory before the fact and of concealment of knowledge of a crime to be committed youve never claimed you had anyone who said alexander knew about this only that he knew some of the boys you say did it arthur mcgregor said stubbornly is that enough to go on holding him of course it is captain hannebrink answered i assume anyone who consorts with saboteurs and says nothing about it either is a saboteur himself or wants to be one you dont want reasons to let my boy go maudes voice went shrill you just want an excuse to keep him in an iron cage when he hasnt done anything arthur mcgregor set a bigknuckled bluntfingered hand on his wifes arm that doesnt help he said mildly if maude lost her temper here it wouldnt just be unfortunate it would be disastrous captain hannebrink said mrs mcgregor i can understand how you feel but can you she said if wed invaded your country and dragged your son away to jail how would you feel wretched im sure he answered though he didnt sound as if he meant it he went on please let me finish the point i was trying to make you still do not seem to fully understand the situation you are in occupied territory mrs mcgregor the military administration of the united states does not need any excuses to confine individuals we have the authority to do it and we have the power to do it maude stared at him as if shed never imagined he would put it so baldly and mcgregor stared too catching as his wife had not quite done what lay behind the american captains words hoarsely he said you dont care whether alexander had anything to do with that bomb or not youre going to keep him locked up anyhow i did not say that mr mcgregor no you didnt captain did you but you meant it and thats worse if you ask me mcgregor got to his feet maude rose with him uncertainty on her face he took no notice of it he took no notice of anything but his contempt and that was big as the world but then what do you care what canuck trash thinks im sorry we wasted your timeand ours i had chores i could have done instead of coming here he walked out onto the street maude following maybe captain hannebrink stared at his back he didnt turn to see nellie semphroch was about to cross the street to visit mr jacobs the cobbler when the guns started roaring north of washington dc as if drawn by a lodestone her head turned in that direction she nodded in slow cold satisfaction for a while washington had been too far south of the front line to let her hear much artillery fire then the rumble had been distant like bad weather far away now it was guns unmistakably guns and louder it seemed every day a confederate dispatch rider trotted past her mounted on a bay gelding whose coat gleamed in the hot june sun he tipped his slouch hat to her taken all in all the rebs were a polite lot that made her distrust them more not like them better flies buzzed in the street as she crossed she flapped with a hand to drive them away there were fewer than there had been ten years before say what you would about motorcars they didnt attract flies she opened the door to mr jacobs shop the bell above it chimed jacobs looked up from the butterysoft black cavalry boot to which he was fitting a new heel the wrinkles on his face which had been set in lines of concentration rearranged themselves into a smile good morning nellie he said setting down his little hammer and taking from the corner of his mouth a couple of brads that hadnt interfered with his speech at all its good to see you today its good to see you any day its good to see you too hal she answered she didnt view him with the relentless suspicion she aimed at most of the male half of the human race for one thing he was at least fifteen years older than she for another hed never tried to get out of line with her up till the year before they hadnt even called each other by their christian names would you like some lemonade he asked i made it myself he sounded proud of that hed been a widower for a good many years and took pride in everything he did for himself id love some thank you nellie said he went into the back room and brought it out in a tumbler that didnt match the one sitting by his last nellie sipped she raised an eyebrow its very good lemonade and it wastart and sweet and cool and full of pulp for which i thank you he answered dipping his head in what was almost a bow his courtly antique manners were another reason why he set off no fire bells of alarm in her mind i am going to fill my glass again would you like another half a glass she answered i had a cup of coffee a couple of minutes before i came over here did you he chuckled drinking up your own profits eh he went into the back room again returning with his glass full and nellies as shed asked something less than that after giving it to her he asked and what do you hear in the coffeehouse these days before nellie could reply a young confederate lieutenant came in picked up his boots and bustled out again without looking at her once that suited her fine once he was gone she answered the question that had sounded casual but wasnt theyve been talking about strengthening the bridges over the potomac i dont know why it cant be for anything really important they keep going on about barrels and tanks not guns or trucks or wagons maybe theyre bringing beer up for their men maybe they are it would be fine if they were jacobs muttered something his bushy gray mustache swallowed aloud he said anything you hear about tanks and barrels would beinteresting all right nellie knew he wasnt going to tell her anything more than that ignorance was her best protection though she already knew too many secrets guilty and otherwise but jacobs had connectionsabout most of which she was also ignorantback to the us government whereas she was no more than one of his sources of news she assumed that meant he knew how to run his business another confederate officer came in the owner of the boot on which the cobbler was working the fellow glowered you said that was going to be ready today he growled so i did sir jacobs answered and it will be i didnt say it would be ready first thing in the morning though as soon as you can the reb said my unit is heading north this afternoon and i want these boots ill do all i can jacobs said if you come back about halfpast eleven this one should be all fixed up shaking his head unhappily the confederate left nellie would have bet hal jacobs knew to which unit he belonged and that the information about its movements would soon be in us hands and jacobs had his own way of harassing the enemy wont it be a shame when some of the nails i put in go through the sole and poke the bottom of his foot what a pityhes made me hurry the job the bell rang again nellie wondered if it was the reb too impatient to wait for eleventhirty it wasnt it was edna that meant something was wrong except for a couple of times to get shoes fixed edna didnt come in here ma edna said without preamble theres a rebel major over across the street says hes got to talk to you right now you go tell him ill be right there nellie said when edna had gone she gave mr jacobs a stricken glance what do i do now it depends on what he wants replied the cobbler who wasnt only a cobbler i know you will do your best come what may whatever happens remember that you have more friends than you know cold comfort nellie nodded composed herself and went back across the street the major was waiting for her outside the coffeehouse which she did not take as a good sign when she first came up to him he said mrs semphroch you are acquainted with william gustavus reach it was not a question she wished it had been yes i know him some she said through ice in her belly so cold she thought it would leave her too frozen to speak at all part of it was fear for herself part fear for mr jacobs and part maybe the biggest part fear of what edna standing not five feet away would hear and learn he came by this place every so often she made her lip curl last time he came by he was trying to steal things when they dropped bombs on us that night the acquaintance goes back no farther than that the confederate major was one of those smart men who think themselves even smarter than they are how much did he know how much had reach spilled how much could she say without spilling more to edna she picked her words with care doing her best to sound careless i knew him a long time ago a little you might say but i hadnt set eyes on him from before my daughter here was born till he showed up again that was all true every word of it it helped steady her uhhuh the reb looked down at his notebook you are not and never have been his wife edna stared at nellie nellie stared too in astonishment commingled with relief maybe shed come out of this in one piece after all i hope to jesus im not she exclaimedmore truth i hope to jesus i never was and i surely hope to jesus i never will be if i never see him again in all my born days itll be too soon uhhuh the confederate major said again well if you had been his wife and werent any more you might say the same thing but i reckon he didnt say exactly what he reckoned but it didnt seem like anything bad for nellie maybe you can tell me what sort of friends he has then next friend of his i know about will be the first nellie said edna giggled the major started to smile then stopped as if remembering he was on duty he said this here reach tells more stories than uncle romulus and thats a fact some of them maam we have to check he chuckled were going to send him to a place where nobody listens to his stories for a long long time if you think im going to miss him major you can think again nellie sounded as prim and righteous as she did when taking the high line with edna the rebel tipped his hat to her and went on his way that wasnt so bad ma edna said way he was asking after you though heaven only knew what he wanted youre right nellie said you dont know how right you are she went back across the street to the shoerepair shop the bell jangled mr jacobs looked upwarilyfrom his work her enormous smile said everything that needed saying he set down the little hammer came around the counter and took both her hands in his to her astonishment she leaned forward and kissed him full on the mouth she hadnt done that with a man since well before her husband died his arms went around her and he kissed her too she enjoyed it that hadnt happened since well before her husband died either some good out of bill reach after all she murmured to herself hal jacobs stiffened out of who he barked his voice too loud his mouth too near her ear she explained sure hed misheard he sagged away from her his face pale as whitewash i wondered what was wrong he gasped hadnt heard from him in too long bill runsran maybeour whole organization here and hes caught good god good god nellie said too for very different reasons all at once she wondered if she was backing the wrong side not much further now lucien galtier told his horse as he rode up the fine americanpaved road toward riviereduloup in the back of the wagon several hens clucked but they were not a true part of the conversation he and the horse had been discussing things for years the hens role though they did not realize it was strictly temporary off to the east perhaps a quarter of a mile away a steam whistle shouted as a train hurried up toward the town tabernac galtier muttered under his breath a quebecois curse the soldiers on the train no doubt would cross the st lawrence and then try to push on toward quebec city the americans worse luck were making progress too for the artillery from the north bank of the river sounded farther off than it had when the campaign was new the newspapers extolled every skirmish as one bonaparte would have admired clumsy propaganda in a province that had never reconciled itself to the french revolution but anyone who believed all the newspapers said deserved nothing better than he got the whistle screamed again the horse twitched his ears in annoyance the chickens squawked and fluttered in their cages no they were not suited for serious talktoo flighty cannon by the riverbank started going offwham wham wham the horse snorted the chickens went crazy lucien galtier raised a dark eyebrow those are quickfiring guns he told the horse the kind they use when trying to shoot down an aeroplane and so through the cannons roar he picked up a rapidly swelling buzz then he spotted the winged shapes before the war he had never seen an aeroplane here now were two at once flying hardly higher than the treetops they both carried bluewhitered roundels on their wings and flanks the red was in the shape of a maple leaf there what did i yell you lucien said to the horse and not just any aeroplanes but canadian aeroplanes he reined in to watch in front of the pilots machine guns hammered he wondered how the men managed to fire through the propellers without shooting themselves down however they did it they shot up the troop train spun in the air like circus acrobats and then shot it up again then still low they streaked back toward the free side of the st lawrence galtier expected the train to streak toward riviereduloup instead it came to a ragged halt maybe the aeroplanes had killed the engineer and the brakeman was doing what he did best maybe they had filled the boiler with so many holes it was either kill the pressure inside or explode it could even beboth galtier said not altogether unhappily soldiers started spilling out of the train some of them came running his way he scowled and thought himself a fool for having stopped to watch the spectacle but if he tried to leave now those soldiers would not be pleased with him and they had rifles frenchie hey frenchie they shouted as they got closer bring your wagon on over here we got wounded mauvais tabernac lucien snarled no help for it though as he pulled the wagon off the road and bounced toward the track he felt a curious mixture of joy at having the enemies of his country wounded and sorrow at having young men who had never personally done him wrong wounded the chickens did not approve of the rough ride he was giving them be still you fools he told them for the first time including them in hishe groped for a word in my salon he thought pleased with himself this will keep you alive a little longer ahead soldiers in greengray were sometimes helping out of the train sometimes carrying from it other soldiers in greengray extravagantly splashed with red how many can you hold a captain called to lucien as he drew near four maybe five yes it could be the farmer had replied exposure had improved his englishto a point when he turned to indicate the chickens and their cages in the wagon bed he was reduced to a helpless wave and a single word but here the american captain dug in a trouser pocket and tossed something to galtier who automatically caught it that ought to cover them he looked down to see what he had a twentydollar us goldpiece he took off his hat in salute oui monsieur merci monsieur the american could simply have had the chickens thrown out onto the ground hed expected the boche americain to do just that instead the fellow had given him more than a fair price for them lucien jumped down and piled the cages in a wobbly pyramid then hurried to help the americans land their comrades in the space thus vacated a service for a service he thought here pal an unwounded us soldier said careful with herb here hes a damn good fellow herb is as gently as he could lucien arranged the damn good fellow so he could sit against the side of the wagon herb had a rough bandage rapidly soaking through with blood on his right leg he also had a streak of blood running down his chin from one corner of his mouth he must have bitten through his lip against the pain the horse snorted and tried to shy uneasy at the stink of blood one of the american soldiers caught his head and eased him back toward something approaching calm there was no earthly reason americans should not be good with horses nonetheless lucien felt almost as betrayed as if his wife had been unfaithful with a man who wore greengray we came past a hospital back there didnt we the captain asked i thought i saw it through the window yes sir galtier answered it is in fact on my land the american didnt notice the resentment with which he said that well the fellow had paid him one surprise of a day was plenty with two nothing would have seemed certain any more in the memory of the one surprise galtier added and my daughter works as a nurses helper there im afraid weve given her more work to do the captain said to which lucien could only nod the wagon was already packed tight with wounded some moaning some ominously still more lay on the ground their unhurt comrades were doing what they could for them but most obviously had little skill lucien pointed to the road there is an ambulance from the hospital it goes to riviereduloup to pick up the blessed the captain looked confused lucien realized hed made a mistake using a french word for an english one with the same sound but a different meaning he corrected himself the wounded he doesnt need to go that far not now he doesnt the captain said soldiers were waving to the ambulance as galtier had done before it pulled off the road and came jouncing over the rough ground toward the tracks the driver and his attendant scrambled out of the machine the attendant shook his head what a mess he said yeah the ambulance driver scowled he couldnt have been more than seventeen or so not with that unlined face but was dark and handsome and looked strong as a bull this is what you do you die he sounded worldweary beyond his years you do not know what it is about you never have time to learn lets get em on the stretcher and into the bus the attendant said yeah the driver said again but then he recognized galtier he nodded you are nicoles father nestce pas his french was bad but few americans spoke any yes lucien answered in spite of himself hed come to know some of the people at the hospital bonjour ernest not a bon jour for them the ambulance driver said his broad shouldersalmost the shoulders of a prizefighterwent up and down in a shrug we will take them back we will do what we can for them up in riviereduloup and elsewhere along the st lawrence the antiaircraft guns started banging away again lucien noticed that only in the back part of his mind till he heard the buzz of aeroplane engines jesus fucking christ an american screameddoubly a blasphemy for galtier then the man in greengray said something even worse here they come again whether they were the same two aeroplanes or two others lucien never knew all around him soldiers scattered some diving for cover under the halted train others running as far away from it as they could lucien stood there foolishly as the machine guns began chewing up the dirt close by the pilots did not try to shoot up either his wagon or the ambulance near it he was and remained convinced of that but they were flying fast and didnt miss by much the captain whod given him the goldpiece spun and toppled like someone with no bones at all the top of his head shot off fresh cries of pain rose from every direction roaring just above his head the aeroplanes streaked away a couple of americans fired their rifles at them it did no good they were gone galtier looked around at carnage compounded a moan that stood out for anguish even among all the others made him turn his head the young strong ambulance driver lay beside the soldier he had been about to help now he was wounded too his hands clutched at himself lucien shivered and made the sign of the cross maybe if god was kind he had been wounded near there but not there the ambulance attendant whose name galtier did not know came over to him and the injured driver were going to have to bandage that and get him back to the hospital he said to which lucien could only nod the attendant stooped beside the driver come on kid you got to let me see that in the end lucien had to hold the fellows hands away from the wound while the attendant worked the driver writhed and fought he wasnt altogether conscious but he was as he looked strong as the devil hanging onto his hands turned into something just short of a wrestling match lucien hadnt intended to look as the attendant cleaned and bandaged the wound but his eyes drawn by some horrid fascination of their own went to it he winced and wanted to cross himself again there indeed he and the attendant got the driver into the back of the ambulance with another wounded man thanks for the help the attendant said not at all galtier hesitated with this blwounddo you think he can will he be able to he ran out of english and nerve at the same time if hes lucky the attendant said understanding him anyhow if hes real lucky mind hell be able to just do it he climbed into the ambulance and drove it back toward the hospital galtier followed at his necessarily slower pace he said nothing at all to the horse klaxons hooted everywhere on the dakota sam carsten threw his mop into a bucket and ran for his battle station hed expected the call even before the battleship fished its aeroplane out of the waters of the pacific officers had been bustling around with the look that said they knew something he didnt the aeroplane must have spotted something out there ahead of the fleet and sent word back by wireless and out here south and west of the sandwich islands the only thing to spot was the enemy the limeys carsten gasped to hiram kidde when he ducked into the forwardmost starboard fiveinch gun sponson them or the japs kidde agreed the gunners mate rubbed his chin taken em damn near two years but they finally figured they could come out and play with the big boys now we got to show em they made a mistake on account of if we dont the sandwich islands are up for grabs again hed been in the navy his whole adult life he might not have been able to order units around like an admiral but he had no trouble figuring out the way tactics led into strategy lieutenant commander grady stuck his head into the sponson all present and accounted for asked the commander of the starboardside secondary armament yes sir kidde answered loaderhe nodded at carstengun layers shell jerkers were all here uh sir who are we fighting grady grinned looks like one hellacious fleet of british battleships over the horizon he answered along with all their smaller friends i dont expect they sailed out of singapore just to pay their respects his face clouded by what the pilots say theyre at least as big a force as we are theyre playing for keeps no doubt about it so are we sir kidde said well be ready grady nodded and hurried away his shoes ringing off the steel of the deck we dont have the whole sandwich islands fleet out here on patrol with us carsten said unhappily if the limeys smash us up and push past us kidde shrugged chance you take when you join the navy if they smash us up and push past us thing we have to make sure of is that we do some smashing of our own the sponson had only small vision slits for laying the gun even those had armored visors to protect against shell splinters in action the visors were up now carsten looked out through one of the slits as the dakota swung into a long sweeping turn the patrolling fleet was going into battle formation the line of half a dozen battleships anchoring it with smaller swifter cruisers and destroyers supporting and screening them he felt a rumble through the soles of his feet thats the big turrets moving he said unnecessarily luke hoskins one of the shelljerkers made an equally unnecessary comment theyve spotted the limeys then he already had his shirt off against the exertions that were to come even now with him doing nothing sweat gleamed on his muscleetched torso carsten peered through the vision slit again looking for smoke on the horizon he saw none but the fire director for the main armament up in the armored crows nest enjoyedif that was the worda view far better than his all at once a great column of water fountained up into the sky about half a mile from the dakota sam might not have been able to see the british ships but the director surely could because they could see him hell of a big splash he said that wasnt surprising either at a range like this only a battleships big guns had a chance of hitting a moment later the dakotas main armament salvoed in reply the noise was like the end of the world here we go hiram kidde said he sounded if not happy at peace with himself and with the world he was getting ready to do the job he did better than anything else in the world odds are were gonna sit here with our thumbs up our asses all day long too hoskins grumbled anybody think were gonna get close enough to the limeys to really use secondary guns listen if we could sink em from a hundred miles away and they never came close to hitting us id be happy as a clam carsten said nobody in the hot crowded sponson argued with him in a thoughtful voice kidde said that wasnt a broadside we fired at the limeys just the forward turrets wed better swingand sure enough the dakota was again heeling through the water in another turnor theyll cross the t on us at a range short enough to hurt us bad carsten grimaced and he wasnt the only one if the enemy crossed your path and fired broadsides at you while you could answer only with your forward guns he was sending you twice the weight of metal you were giving back every admiral dreamt of crossing the t and every one had nightmares about its being crossed on him more splashes rose these closer to the dakota if somebody dropped an elephant into the pacific from a mile up it might make a splash like that shrapnel rattled off the armored sides of the battleship carsten whistled softly wouldnt care to be up on deck right now he said the rest of the gun crew made noises showing they agreed capn kidde said its going to get worse before it gets better too nobody argued with that either hard standing around here carsten said waiting for something to happen or for us to get close enough to the limeys to shoot at them i feel like im along for the ride but im not doing anything to earn my keep he looked out through the vision slit again some of the cruisers had started firing their main armament guns of a range not that much longer than those he served his turn would come before too long and then as he watched one of the cruisers the missoula took a direct hit from what had to be a battleship shell its turrets went up one after the other like the most spectacular fourth of july fireworks display hed ever imagined when bare seconds after the hit flame reached the main magazine the whole ship exploded in a spectacular fireball one of the cruisers big guns hung suspended on top of the flames for what had to be close to half a minute but when the flames and smoke finally cleared only roiled water remained nothing else was left to show where six or seven hundred men had beenno boats no wreckage nothing jesus sam said and looked away imagining the same thing happening to the dakota was all too easy kidde kept peering out of his slit you can see the limeys all right he said wont be long nowthe same thought carsten had had a minute or so earlier as the main armament thundered again lieutenant commander grady stuck his head in to say pick your own targets boys ships movements will be to give the main armament the best possible firing opportunities us small fry down here we have to take whatever we can find he hurried off again not much later kidde whooped with glee sure as hell thats a british cruiser out there he said pointing he stared into the rangefinder and twiddled with the controls i make it about twelve thousand yards he said and shouted orders to the gun layers who swung their cranks to shift the fiveinch gun to bear on the foe fire for effect the gunners mate yelled grunting luke hoskins grabbed a heavy shell and passed it to carsten who slammed it into the breech dogged it shut and nodded to kidde the chief of the gun crew yanked the lanyard the cannon roared and jerked cordite fumes filled the sponson short kidde announced watching the splash as sam coughing got the casing out of the breech and threw it down to the deck with a clang pete jonas the other shelljerker passed him a new round ten seconds after the first one it was on its way no more than half a dozen rounds had gone out before kidde whooped to announce a hit and then another one and then another hit announced itself it felt as if god had booted the dakota right in the tail all at once she swerved sharply and missed colliding with the next battleship in line the idaho by what seemed bare inches what the hell pete jonas burst out we just lost our steering hiram kidde said matteroffactly goddamn limeys got lucky he looked out to see where they were headed and his next words were much less calm lord have mercy were steaming straight for the british line of battle straight was not the operative word the dakota was swinging through an enormous circle rudder must be jammed hard to port carsten said weve got to keep moving best way we can though if were dead in the water were dead they passed a burning us cruiser afterwards sam figured that did more good than harm the fire that had been directed against the less heavily armored vessel now fell on the obviously out of control dakota at the time it was a distinction he could have done without what do we do if we get right in among em he asked that being the worst thing he could think of sink kidde answered which was very much to the point but not what carsten wanted to hear the gunners mate added hurt as many of em as bad as we can before we go down with nothing better to do they kept firing as they spun within eight or nine thousand yards of the british line of battle smoke enveloped the enemy battleships some the smoke of damage more from the big guns the ships carried shells from those big guns and from the enemies secondary armament rained down on the dakota sam lost count of how many times the ship was bracketed seawater from near misses rained down on her too and fragments pattering like deadly hail and every so often she would shake when another shell struck home damagecontrol partieseveryone not serving a gun or the enginesdashed along the corridors fighting fire and flood thank god were turning away kidde said peering out through the vision slit that meant that for the time being his gun didnt bear on the british fleet a chance to take it easy carsten thought but then the gunners mate let out a hoarse vile exclamation we got more ships bearin down on us from the north he stared at them out there in the distance his voice cracked in anger those arent limeystheyre japs i dont care who they are luke hoskins said well smash em up methodically as if they were a pair of machines he and pete jonas took turns passing shells to carsten capn kidde yelled like a wild man when they started scoring hits on the japanese the limeys now theyre good he said till the slanteyed boys messed with us the only fight they ever picked was with spain hey i can lick my grandmother easy enough too but that dont mean im a tough guy carsten heard that but paid it little mind he was a machine himself a sweating machine coughing in the fumeladen air but doing his job with unthinking accuracy and perfection load close wait for the round to go get rid of the case load close shells kept falling around and sometimes on the dakota were they british or japanese they didnt leave calling cardsnot calling cards of that sort anyhow from not far away lieutenant commander grady screamed for sand to douse a fire nothing exploded so sam supposed the fire got doused the guns in the turrets kept thundering away so did all the weapons of the secondary armament that would bear on the foe christ on his cross kidde said were going around through our own fleet again he was right carsten got glimpses of other ships with spouts from near misses splashing up around them and still others aflame but the us ships were shooting back too smoke from the guns smoke from the fires and smoke from the stacks all dimmed the bright sunshine of the tropical pacific are we winning or losing sam asked damned if i know capn kidde answered if we live and we make it back to honolulu we can find out in the papers he barked laughter then coughed harshly and if we dont live what the hell difference does it make anyway luke hoskins came up with another good question we ever going to get this beast under control again weve done one whole circle just about and now with the fiveinch gun screened from the enemy by the bulk of the ship sam took his place at a vision slit beside hiram kidde he saw theyd come round behind most of the american fleet andhe grimaced in dismay looks like were going to swing toward them again he said kidde whistled between his teeth it does dont it well that means the gunll bear again get your ass back there sam if they take us out it aint gonna be like we didnt give em something to remember us by yeah carsten said and then you know i wouldnt mind that much if they remembered some other guys instead pete jonas handed him a shell he slammed it into the breech newsboys shouted their papers as sylvia enos walked from her apartment building to the trolley stop battle of the three navies read all about it extra uss dakota in circle of death american fleet crushes the japs and limeys off sandwich islands sylvia paid her two cents and bought a boston globe she read it on the way to the canning plant as often seemed true in the war the headlines screamed of victory while the stories that followed showed the headlines didnt know what they were talking about the us fleet hadnt crushed those of the two enemy empires any more than the german high seas fleet had crushed the royal navy in the north sea the month before the papers had shouted hosannas about that too till it became obvious that even after the fight the bulk of the german navy couldnt break out to help the us atlantic fleet against the british and the french and the rebs in the pacific though what seemed to be a drawn battle worked for the united states not against them as it had on the other side of the world where the germans hadnt been able to break out into the atlantic the british and japanese hadnt been able to break in toward the sandwich islands which remained firmly in american hands though the globe hadnt been the paper whose headlines screeched loudest about the dakota its account of the fight did prominently mention the battleships double circuit straight into the guns of the opposing fleets the valiant vessel sustained twentynine hits the reporter said nine definitely from the enemys largecaliber guns eleven definitely from smaller shells and nine that might have come from either although drawing thirtysix feet of water at the end of the battle as opposed to thirtyone at the outset the dakota and the heroes aboard her also inflicted heavy damage on the ships of the foe and miraculously suffered only fourteen killed and seventeen wounded a tribute to her design to her metal and to the mettle of her crew sylvia left the newspaper on the trolley seat when she got out and hurried over to the plant let someone else have a free look shed wondered why the navy in its wisdom had sent george to the mississippi rather than the open sea now she thanked god for it the dakota had got off lightly as far as casualties were concerned but what about the cruisers and destroyers and battleships that had gone to the bottom with all hands or near enough to make no difference going down with all hands could happen to a monitor too sylvia made herself not think about that coming up the street toward the factory was isabella antonelli sylvia waved to her friend good morning she called good morning mrs antonelli answered seeing her though did not take sylvias mind as far away from the war as she would have liked isabella antonelli wore black from head to foot with a black veil coming down from her hat over her face in her imperfect english she said all this talk of the big navy fight i think of you i think of your husband i pray he is all right she crossed herself hes fine yes he wasnt anywhere near this fight out on the ocean thank god sylvia said thank god yes mrs antonelli said they walked into the plant and punched their time cards together as sylvia did whenever she talked about the war with her friend she felt faintly guilty that george still lived while mr antonelli had met a bullet or a shell somewhere up in quebec the blackbordered casualty lists the papers printed every day showed how easily it could have been the other way round she welcomed the mesmerizing monotony of the line that sent cans into her labeling machine and then out again if she concentrated on the work she didnt have to think about the waralthough she wouldnt have been here without the war she would have been at home with george jr and mary jane was what she had now better or worse having george awayand in harms waytipped the balance of course suppose george were homeor home as often as he was when he went out on his fishing runs what then the children sometimes drove her mad even so she missed them fiercely every moment she was away from them mr winter came limping down the line to see how things were going he smiled at her she nodded back good morning mrs enos the foreman said smiling to show off his bad teeth how are you this morning your husband wasnt in the big battle the papers are talking about i hope im fine thank you mr winter she answered my husband too so far as i know hes on the mississippi not in the pacific thats right you told me i just remembered he was in the navy is all winter shook his head in chagrin whether real or put on she couldnt tell then he went back to business which relieved her machine behaving all right it seems to be yes with someone else sylvia might have joked that saying it was working well would make it break down the thought was in her mind but she kept it there the less she had to do with mr winter outside of things that were strictly business the better she liked it he nodded to her thats fine then with another nod he headed over to the machine isabella antonelli ran hello bella how are you this morning the paste reservoir on sylvias machine ran low just then she had to bend down pick up the bucket of thick white paste and refill the reservoir all without missing a beat on the three levers she had to pull for every can of mackerel feeding through to be labeled while she was doing that she felt like a juggler with too many balls in the air it also distracted her from the conversation the foreman and isabella antonelli were having she couldnt have heard all of it anyhow not over the unending clatter and rumble of the line that moved the cans ahead and the racket of the machines along the way but she might have heard some she wanted to hear some shed never noticed mr winter using a shortened version of isabellas name before did that mean he hadnt done it before or that she hadnt noticed like everyone else at the canning plant isabella antonelli had taken off her hat when she started work that was all the more necessary for her what with the veil depending from the hat before heading toward the next machine on the line mr winter chucked her under the chin said something sylvia didnt catch and made as if to kiss her on the cheek but didnt he was laughing when he left her station sylvia concentrated on her own machine with a fury whose intensity startled her and was only made worse because it was so futile she jerked the levers so hard she jammed the machine which shut down the whole line till she could clear it mr winter came over at a limping trot thought you said it was going good he said you shut us down it costs the owners money they dont like that mrs enos they dont like that even a little bit im sorry she lied it was behaving fine till a minute ago she used a screwdriver to lever a tin can out of the works let me just check she pulled the lever that had started the trouble it functioned smoothly now you can start things up again all right he gave her a grudging nod you fixed it fast enough i will say that cans started flowing once more restraining the anger shed taken out on the labeling machine made her stomach hurt she was glad when the lunch whistle blew picking up her dinner pail she fell into step beside isabella antonelli it was hot and muggy outside the factory building and the view was only of another canning plant across the street but that still meant cooler weather and a prettier prospect than inside they sat down on a bench sylvia had a fish sandwichleftovers from the night beforeand mrs antonelli some sort of funnyshaped noodles in tomato sauce after theyd eaten for a while sylvia asked is he bothering you who isabella was intent on her food they had only half an hour before they went back to work him mr winter the foreman i saw him what he did this morning thats not right remembering sylvia got angry all over again to her own mortification a certain amount of relief accompanied the anger hes not bothering me thank god was the nasty little thought somewhere near the bottom of her mind recognizing it for what it was only made her more furious both at the foreman and at herself mr winter isabellas eyes grew wide for a moment then to sylvias surprise she laughed oh that no that is nothing much i do not worry about it he is a lonely man mr winter and i now i am lonely too she set down her fork and touched the sleeve of the black dress but sylvia began she stopped not knowing how to go on if god forbid something had happened to george she wouldnt have been able to look at a man for years she was sure of it she was so sure of it she hadnt imagined anyone else could be different isabella antonelli said i do not think anything will come of it if anything does come of it that would not be so bad for a moment she looked altogether pragmatic he is a catholic i have found out is he have you sylvia didnt scratch her head but she felt like it the more you looked at the world the more complicated it got the white man in the munitions plant hiring office scribbled something on the form in front of him then looked across the table at scipio well boy you sound like youll do he said in the sharp accent typical of columbia south carolina why dont you let me have your passbook so we can get this here all settled right and proper scipios heart leaped up into his throat hed expected the demand no negro in the csa could have failed to expect the demand since the start of the war things were supposed to have loosened up that was how it had looked when he was the butler back at marshlands anyhow god only knew what the aftermath of the rebellion had done toward tightening things again though god knew and he was about to find out donning what he hoped was an ingratiating smile he said aint got none suh i used to yes suh but i plumb lost it in the ruction i bet you did the clerk said with a thin smile you talk like a nigger from further down on the congareethat right nero yes suh scipio said nero was one of the commonest names negro men bore he wondered what the white manwhose desk bore a little placard proclaiming him to be mr stauntonwould have thought had he suddenly started his other way of speaking he didnt intend doing anything so foolish talking like an educated white might give him away and would surely get him tagged as uppity he couldnt afford that not if he wanted work lets see your hands staunton said suddenly trying not to show any reluctance scipio displayed them that unpleasant smile flashed across the clerks face again not a field niggera house nigger i reckon and you dont have a passbook my my what were you doing these past few months that hit too close to the center of the target scipio said a minute ago suh you says you wants to hire me now you talkin like i was one o dey bad niggers raise all de ruction he wanted to flee only a wellfounded suspicion that he wouldnt make it outside the door kept him standing where he was oh ill hire you staunton said he lowered his voice for niggers without passbooks though we got a special arrangement have to get you a new book right lots of patrollers around these days thats a fact yes suh scipio said again now he stood at ease once more staunton wasnt going to betray him just shake him down how much i gots to pay you git de new book he also spoke quietly aint you a smart nigger by the way the clerks pale eyes sparked that was more warning than compliment half your pay the first month staunton said greed evidently overcoming suspicion end of the month you be a good boy you get yourself a book understand yes suh the repetition was getting monotonous scipio let out a mournful sigh not much left fo me at the start of the war a dollar and a quarter a day would have been good money for a negro and half that survivable for a month wages and prices had gone up a good deal the past two years though nigger without a passbook aint gonna get a better deal no place else staunton said and that odds on was true scipio sighed again hed be drinking water and eating cornmeal mush for the next month no two ways about itand that with sleeping in the cheapest flophouse he could find after marshlands even after the hectic life as part of the ruling council of the congaree socialist republic it had all the earmarks of a thoroughly joyless existence god damn the reds he muttered nobody had bothered to listen to him though hed warned again and again that the uprising would lead only to disaster having acquired a fair smattering of a classical education at marshlands he found himself wishing cassandra were a masculine name he would have used it for an alias instead of nero mr staunton heard what he said and interpreted it his own way god damn the reds is right nero he said werent for them wouldnt hardly have to worry about passbooks at all not the way things were going we wanted bodies so bad we didnt care but now its gonna cost you money to get fixed up right on account of what they did too bad boy he spoke with the soppy condescension that seemed to be as close as a confederate white could come to showing sympathy for a black when do i start scipio asked tomorrow morning seven oclock the clerk answered he shoved the form across the desk at scipio and handed him a pen put your mark right on the line here well get you a time card made foremanll punch it for youyou dont need to worry about pickinit out just so you know to tell him youre nero number three scipio placed an x on the line the clerk indicated by what he saw of the form his spelling and handwriting were considerably better than stauntons he didnt aim to show that the less the white man knew about him the better he liked it but even though hed written an x the way hed taken the pen as if his hand was accustomed to it made the clerks eyes narrow house nigger staunton said half to himself you read and write some dont you boy some yes suh scipio answered cautiously damn it why couldnt he have dealt with a dull bored white clerk rather than an alert grasping one but staunton visibly decided not to make an issue of it go on get out of here he said you aint here at seven sharp tomorrow dont ever come round again neither he pushed his chair back from his desk and swiveled so he could put scipios paperwork in a file cabinet that was the first time the negro had the chance to see his right leg was missing from halfway down the thigh after that scipio got out of there in a hurry he had a couple of dollars in his pocket from odd jobs hed done on farms and in little towns before he decided the big city was safer as he walked along columbias busy streets he wondered if hed made a mistake probably not he decided negroes were on the streets and a lot of them looked as ragged as he did soldiers tramped along the streets too some of them regulars in butternut some recalled militia in oldfashioned gray that made them look like policemen they didnt seem to be checking blacks papers just showing themselves to keep trouble from breaking out columbia had seen trouble during the red insurrections it was a city of fine and stately homes and shops many of them dating from before the war of secession here and there a block would have a house missing like a man with a missing front tooth a couple of places in town whole blocks were missing even the rubble cleared away the negroes might have lost but theyd put up a fight much good it did them scipio thought gloomily he ducked into a store whose sign forthrightly proclaimed cheap clothes and bought a pair of dungarees and a couple of collarless cotton shirts he wouldnt be able to afford any new clothes for the next month not on sixtytwo and a half cents a day he wouldnt a bowl of thin stew cost him another fifteen cents and a mattress in a tiny airless cubicle a quarter on top of that he was left with the munificent sum of half a dollar with which to face the world it was wednesday night payday would be friday he had enough for a bed tomorrow night and for some bread or mush to keep the hole in his belly from getting any worse sighing he tried to sleep on that uncomfortable bed in that uncomfortable roomlet waking up in time to be at the munitions plant was not the problem sleeping at all before then was when dawn began showing through the small rectangular window that wouldnt open he gave up put on the dungarees and one of the shirts hed bought the evening before and then discovered he had to pay the flophouse proprietor a dime to watch the clothes he had left so theyd be there when he got back dayold bread he thought and sighed again nero number three eh all right youre on time boy the foreman said when he got to the factory grudging approval but approval the white man punched his card into the clock then took him back into the factory they stack the crates of empty shells here at the end of this line the fellow said pointing you haul em over there where they pick em up to be filled you got that yes suh scipio said several crates already stood there i do em one at a time by hand suh less you got a servant to do em for you thats what you do by jesus the foreman said i wanted me a butler idve hired a nigger wearin different clothes he laughed at his own joke scipio luckily managed to keep his face straight dont mind workin suh he said aint what i mean jus thinkin that you give me a hand truck i could do mo work in de same time the foreman laughed again first time i ever heard of a nigger wanting to do more work stead of less he rubbed his chin it aint the worst idea i ever heard though tell you whatyou do it this way for today well see what happens tomorrow i got to talk with a couple people first yes suh scipio said again if they think its a good idea im going to take the credit for it was what the white man meant scipio couldnt do anything about that he strode over to the crates picked one up and carried it to where the foreman had told him to put it it was heavy the rough wood bit into his hands the edge of the crate struck his thighs halfway between knee and hip hed be bruised there by eveninghell hed be bruised there by noon he walked back and got another crate the foreman nodded satisfied and went back to supervising checkin a negro in good wellmade work clothes picked up the crate scipio had set down the two black man stared at each other scipio spoke first he had to speak first before the other man used his true name how you is jonah he said you member ol nero eh jonah had been a field hand at marshlands he and his woman had gone into columbia looking for factory work not long after the war started and not even anne colleton had been able to get them back nero he said now after a brief thoughtful pause yeah i member you good nero so now we is workin together again is we dis world a small place scipio said solemnly he wished it hadnt been quite so small if jonah felt like betraying him he could theyd got on well enough at the plantation but there was always the distinction between house nigger and field nigger and jonah might well have heard of the role hed played in the congaree socialist republic if like a good many negroes he disapproved of the uprising then jonah smiled and said you come home fo supper wid me tonight nero letitia she glad to see an ol friend tank you scipio said i do dat it would get him fed and let him save what little money he had left and it meantlord how he hoped it meantjonah wasnt going to turn him in to the confederate authorities he picked up another clanking crate of shell casings it hardly seemed to weigh a thing the hall was packed the hot muggy air would have been thick enough to slice even had it been empty a small forlorn electric fan did overmatched battle against the heat of too many bodies against the fact that a lot of those bodies hadnt bathed quite so recently as they might have and against enough cigar cigarette and pipe smoke to make flora hamburger think of poison gas coughing a little she turned to maria tresca theyve come out no two ways about it she said maria nodded that works for you not against you she said the regulars would sooner see herman bruck with the nomination even after remembrance day she sniffed the smoky air turned the sniff into a cough louder than floras theyre reactionaries thats what they are how can they be reactionaries and socialists at the same time my sister angelina never was when they think of it theyre progressive flora said with a shrug you have to think about your ideology if you dont think about it you havent got one but if you dont think about your social attitudes its not that you dont have any its just that yours are the same as your neighbors she sighed and if your neighbors are petty bourgeoisie and proletarians who aspire to the petty bourgeoisie maria trescas face darkened into a frown in that case they might as well be democrats no flora shook her head thats not the problem the problem is making them think about social issues when they do think instead of feeling theyre sound enough they have to stop taking those concerns for granted thats all or else the revolution when it comes will sweep them away with it maria said sometimes i think youre too gentle flora my sister was the same way and look what it got her angelina tresca had died in the remembrance day riots the year before if they cannot adapt they deserve to be swept away maria was as full of revolutionary consciousness as anyone flora knew frighteningly full sometimes sometimes the uprising comes too soon flora said look at the confederacy the proletariat failed therenothing but banditry left now race mystified the white proletarians splitting the laboring class maria returned that wont happen here in the united states when the workers rise up against the trusts and the capitalists theyll all rise together and overthrow the rotten system she sounded messianically certain up on the platform at the front of the hall the chairman rapped loudly for order slowly saul masliansky got some small semblance of it when it didnt come fast enough to suit him he rapped again this time as if firing a gun be quiet there he shouted first in yiddish then in english do you want to caucus or do you just want to talk with this crowd thats about even money flora said with a smile you should have accepted somebody besides masliansky maria tresca said not smiling back he favors herman i know everyone who could chair this caucus favors herman as far as i can tell flora answered but saul is honest when he sees what the people want he wont thwart them ha maria said darkly hes assistant editor for the daily forward hes going to go right on favoring bruck because herman got everything he knows about socialism straight out of the newspaper that was so unfair and at the same time so delicious that flora couldnt help giggling shed expected to be too nervous here to see straight let alone to speak well and now she wasnt any more she hoped the delightful flighty feeling would last hes honest she said again ive seen him admit hes wrong how many others who might have done the job can you say that about were not going to have a caucus if you people cant keep quiet saul masliansky said like a schoolteacher confronting a classroom full of hooligans he didnt look like a teacher or like an editor either with an embroidered vest and a high pale forehead what he looked like was a professional gambler he played his trump card with the air of a gambler pulling an ace out of his sleeve too do you want to hear the candidates weve agreed were all going to support whichever one we choose so picking the better one strikes me as a pretty good idea anybody who thinks different can go outside to talk anyone who thinks different can geh in drerd maria tresca said flora laughed again maria had acquired an excellent often scurrilous command of yiddish mr chairman somebody called i move that when we pick we pick by secret ballot second herman bruck shouted you keep quiet masliansky barked at him candidates arent members of the caucus you cant second you talk to us and thats all do i hear a proper second he did a moment later the motion passed on a voice vote member or not flora shouted against it if you cant stand up and be counted at a caucus when can you she demanded youre rightand youre wrong maria said herman thinks secrecy will work for him but i think hes wrong more people will go against the bigwigs if they arent looking over their shoulders maybe flora said saul masliansky plied his gavel once more will the contenders please come forward he said there he goes selling his paper again some wit shouted and got a laugh flora made her way up to the platform so did herman bruck in a dark gray suit that shouted respectability at the world had flora been respectable in the same sort of way she wouldnt have presumed to seek the congressional nomination in the first place herman nodded to her he took her more seriously than he had before her remembrance day speech but not so seriously as he would have taken say saul masliansky masliansky after all was a man not someone hed pestered to go to the cinema with him the chairman said we tossed a coin to see who would talk to you when our esteemed comrade mr herman bruck here won the toss he chose to speak first herman bruck friends myron zuckerman gave our district the best years of his life bruck said and won sympathetic applause from everyone who revered zuckermans memorywhich meant from everyone in the hall i aim to go to philadelphia to do my best to fill his shoes to keep the fourteenth ward as it has been at the forefront in the fight against the trusts and i hopealevaito work with the next president of the united states of america senator eugene v debs of indiana the socialists national convention wouldnt come until next month but debs nomination to face tr was a forgone conclusion again herman bruck got loud cheers flora did her best not to let that worry her hed been applauded for invoking zuckermans name and again for invoking that of debs she wondered when hed say anything about himself that deserved cheers as far as she was concerned he never did that didnt mean he didnt get applause only that he was breathtakingly conventional in every position he took he might as well have said i agree with what all the other socialists think half a dozen times and then sat down after a whileafter what seemed to flora a very long whilehe did sit down saul masliansky said and now miss flora hamburger will tell you why she thinks herman bruck has been talking nonsense for the past twenty minutes he grinned at her it wasnt quite the introduction shed expected but it would serve she could make it serve though that meant junking the opening shed worked out in advance she decided to take the chance herman bruck doesnt talk nonsense hes a good socialist if you choose him i will support himthats what the caucus is all about but she took a deep breath herman bruck is safe is being safe what the socialist party the party of revolution stands for i dont think so he tells you what weve done in the past he tells you what hell do in the future if you choose him as your candidate the one is just the same as the other if we elect people who will go on doing the same things are we radicals or are we reactionaries the talk with maria before shed come up here was paying dividendsan alarmingly capitalistic thought for a wouldbe socialist candidate if you want life to go on as it always has if you dont want to work for radical change in this country if you dont want peace between us and our neighbors you might as well vote for a democrat if you want to let teddy roosevelt know we dont intend to let war mean unending oppression of the proletariat youll choose me she embroidered on that theme for a while then returned to the other as i say herman bruck is a sound man he is a safe man i think hes sound and safe enough to lose this november if you want someone to run hard and do everything she can to get this seat out of trs clutches youll vote for me today and youll vote for me again in the fall she stepped back she thought she got as much applause as herman bruck had more she couldnt tell saul masliansky said now we fight it out we have a waiting room for the two of you we have two waiting rooms in fact if youd rather its all right flora said we arent enemies herman bruck nodded they didnt say much to each other in the waiting room flora sat in a hard chair under one of the electric lamps hanging from the ceiling bruck smoked a cigarette and another and another through the closed door flora listened to the shouts from the caucus she wished she were out there she and bruck werent members so she couldnt be after what seemed like forever the door opened she and herman bruck both sprang to their feet facing masliansky with the same eager anxiety fathers in a hospital maternityward waiting room showed when the doctor came in but only one of them would get to keep this baby like the one in the biblical story of solomon it was indivisible mazeltov flora the caucus chairman said bruck stubbed out his last cigarette under the heel of his gleaming shoe mazeltov he echoed anything i can do you know i will he managed a joke something rare for him thats true even though you wont go out with me thank you flora felt lightheaded talk like that more often and i might but nowshe could hardly believe itlets put this seat back where it belongs i am godalmighty sick of troop trains jefferson pinkard announced to anybody who would listen as the one on which he was riding rumbled west through texas toward the front line which lay somewhere east of lubbock nobody said anything as best jeff could tell nobody had the energy to say anything it was hot and muggy outside that meant it was hotter and muggier on the train every window that would open was open the breeze that came in was like the breath of hell the occasional cinder or tiny bit of coal blowing in with the breeze only adding to the resemblance pinkard looked outside texas as far as he could see was nothing but miles and miles of miles and miles it had been green and lush when the troop train pounded out of arkansas some of the men who sounded as if they knew what they were talking about said parts of it were as swampy and wet as louisiana full of alligators and who could say what all else this part of texas wasnt like that if god had taken an iron about the size of south carolina and pressed everything here down flat that might have given the countryside its look it was as hot as if it had just been ironed too they called it prairie but wasnt the prairie supposed to be green with grass this was yellow at best more often brown i never left home till they conscripted me jeff went on after a while way things look here i aint never going to leave again once the wars over neither he sighed birmingham now birmingham is green all the time even in winter most of the grass stays green does it ever even get green here i dont know why you complain so much amigo hip rodriguez said from the seat behind him this land here this is better than what i was farming better pinkard awkwardly turned around to stare at the little sonoran how in blazes could this be better than anything it is very easy as rodriguez made his points he ticked them off on his fingers it is good flat land not mountains like where i come from it has not so much calorheat it gets more wateryou can see maybe you can see pinkard said stubbornly looks dry as the desert the israelites walked through to me rodriguez laughed in his face you do not know what a desert is if you call this a desert only two things kept jeff from starting a fight then and there one was that he was in the army so hed get in trouble the other was that he really didnt know what a desert was like next to alabama land what they had here was pretty appalling he tried to picture in his mind the kind of land that would make west texas look good mountains he could imagine but land that was hotter and drier than this if this wasnt hell that would have to be the train chugged to a stop outside a little town called post to jeff pinkards jaundiced eye the town as they rolled through it seemed as sunbaked and defeated as the country surrounding it the wooden buildings hadnt been painted or whitewashed for years and most of the timber was more nearly gray than brown or yellow even the bricks seemed faded from their proper bright oranges when pinkard grunting and sweating under the weight of his kit came out of the car in which hed been ensconced so long and so uncomfortably he heard artillery off in the distance when hed been fighting the negroes of the black belt socialist republic that had been an encouraging sound his side had the guns and the enemy didnt it wasnt going to be like that here captain connolly addressed the formedup company we are going to stop the damnyankees men not only are we going to stop them we are going to throw them back into new mexico where they belong that got a few yips and cheers from the men but not many it was too hot they were too tired connolly went on this isnt going to be the kind of fighting they have on the other side of the mississippi too many miles for that and not enough men filling them if we dig trenches they go around and the same the other way not a lot of railroads around here either nobody can keep big armies supplied away from the tracks so were going to drive the yankees back toward lubbock and we are going to have detachments out to make sure they dont get around us while were doing it that last is what the particular task of this company will be any questions nobody said anything the captain didnt even give the order to march he just started marching and the men followed not only the company but a couple of regiments worth pinkard and his companions were somewhere in the middle of the column the dust was of a slightly redder shade than the butternut of his uniform it got in his nose it got in his eyes it got in his mouth so his teeth crunched whenever they came together he wasnt sure whether this had been a road before the war started it was a road now a road defined by marching men and by the ruts of wagons and those of motor trucks it led to a bridge over a river that didnt look wide or deep enough to need bridging if that poor thing was in alabama he said to stinky salley theyd ship it back to its mama on account of its too little to show itself in public were not in alabama any more salley replied with his usual annoying precision or maybe you hadnt noticed oh put a sock in it stinky pinkard answered too weary even to threaten doing any of the drastic things salley so richly deserved the captain came by just then making sure everybody in the companyless a couple of men whod passed out overcome by the heatwas in good shape jeff called to him sir what river is this unless the map they gave me is a liarand god knows its possible way the hell out herethis is the double mountain fork of the brazos connolly answered answering the next question before pinkard could ask it he went on from what they say its supposed to have a lot more water in it in the wintertime couldnt hardly have much less pinkard said the bridge when he got to it looked to have been there a while it wasnt a recent erection by the confederate army engineering corps that argued the road had been there a while too he wondered where it ended up going as far as he could tell it was a road to nowhere they camped a little north of the double mountain fork try as he would jeff couldnt see the mountains that were supposed to have given the fork its name the ground was a little higher up ahead but so what he supposed that in these parts anything high enough to serve as a watershed got reckoned a mountain night fell it didnt get any cooler not so far as pinkard could tell he ambled over to a chow wagon the negro cook was serving up stale bread tinned beef and coffee reckon id do just about anything for some of emilys fried chicken right about now he said mournfully examining the unappetizing supper hey soldier youve got food said sergeant albert cross a veteran with the ribbon for the purple heart above his left breast pocket believe me timell come when youre glad youve got anything ever carve a steak off a mule three days gone he didnt sound as if he was joking he didnt look as if he was joking either sergeants seemed to have had their sense of humor surgically removed when they were children pinkard ate what was set before him he unrolled his blanket and lay down on top of it the next thing he knew the sun was shining in his face the force of which he was a part resumed their march not long after sunrise well take that high ground stinky salley declared in his best impression of the secretary of war and then well defend it from the damnyankees when they show up from ahead tiny in the distance came the crackle of rifle fire deploy from column into line by the left flankmove captain connolly shouted the soldiers moved awkwardly because they hadnt had enough training in such maneuvers before they got thrown into action against the red rebels out ahead through the dust of the march pinkard saw men on horseback blazing away at the advancing confederates yankee cavalry he realized as connolly had said the land was wide hereabouts cavalry had room to maneuver as it didnt farther east he didnt see the field artillery with the horsemen not even after it started shelling him he heard a whistle in the air and then a crash somewhere close by a moment later he heard screams another whistle another crash more screams get down sergeant cross screamed jeff was already on his belly wondering how the negroes in georgia had fought on without guns to give as they received at cross order he and his comrades started shooting at the us cavalrymen nothing to worry aboutjust a skirmish the sergeant said pinkard supposed he was right and found the prospect of a big battle even less appealing than supper the night before paul mantarakis looked around most of what he saw was mountains baking under a savage sun the rest was waterless valley full of boulders and cactus and nothing any man in his right mind could possibly want to own let alone want it badly enough to take it away from the poor fools unfortunate enough to be in possession of it at the moment when he said that out loud gordon mcsweeneys big fair head went up and down in agreement amen the scotsman said the empire of mexico is welcome to it for all of me you ought to take another couple of salt tablets gordon paul said you look like a lobster thats been in the pot too long for once he was thankful for his swarthiness even here in baja california all he did was go from brown to browner back in the normal world of the usa he dimly remembered the whiter you were the more breaks you got here all you got was sunburn and heatstroke captain wyatt tramped past them he wasnt cooked quite so badly as mcsweeney but he was suffering too he said if we take this miserable stretch of land away from the mexicans well be able to keep an eye on the confederate pacific coastif the rebs have any pacific coast left once the war is done thatd be fine sir mantarakis said but once weve got bases here how do we keep them supplied no railroads except the one we built ourself no roads either not unless you call what were on a road this isnt just a road sergeant captain wyatt said this is damn near the road he paused to swig from his canteen the water it held if it was anything like what paul had was bloodwarm and stale wyatt went on we cut across the peninsula here to santa rosalia and then we can look across the gulf of california at the rebs in guaymas a shame and a disgrace that the rebs still are in guaymas gordon mcsweeney observed well youre right about that lord knows captain wyatt said but they are and from everything ive heard its not much easier fighting over in sonora than it is here he made a sour face and of course were starved for everything here because were so far west the war on the other side of the mississippi is the big top were just the sideshow something glinted for a moment high on the side of the conical mountain ahead mantarakis pointed to it saying sir i think the mexicansor maybe its the rebs who knowshave an observation post way the hell up there up on the slope of the volcano of the three virgins you mean wyatt said paul nodded the captain shrugged i would sure as the devil if i were in their shoes i didnt see anything show me again where you think its at after mantarakis pointed the captain nodded a little bit above that crag there he shouted for a runner gave the fellow the location mantarakis had spotted and told him pass it on to the field artillery maybe a howitzer can reach him from here if thats no good well just have to get used to them keeping an eye on everything were doing mantarakis said havent seen much in the way of real fighting since we got down here not that i miss it he added hastily but are these mexicans any good they wont be as good as the mormons were ben carlton put in course nobodys going to be as good as the mormons were unless i miss my guess but if they were all that bad wedve already licked em something to that captain wyatt agreed but weve been fighting the terrain as much as the empire of mexico and there are some rebs too helping their pals but if you ask me paul didnt ask the company commander he didnt have a chance to ask the company commander a whistle in the air made him throw himself to the ground without consciously thinking he needed to do that a shell burst maybe fifty yards away he had his entrenching tool out and was busy digging himself a foxhole before the second shell came down where are they coming from somebody shouted dont see any flash or anything got to be a trench mortar paul yelled back they must have put a couple of them on these hills figured theyd drop some bombs on us trouble is we dont have any trenches he felt naked trying to fight without one too ill lay odds youre right sergeant captain wyatt said the mexicans dont have any money to speak of they cant afford real artillery in a place like this though what theyve got is plenty good it was in paul mantarakis opinion better than plenty good shells or bombs or whatever they were kept falling on the americans the ground under a few inches of sandy dust was hard as a sergeants heart that paul thought such things proved hed come up through the ranks he couldnt get the foxhole deep enough to suit him and then somebody shouted here come the bastards resentfully he threw down the entrenching tool and set his rifle against his shoulder the enemy wasnt playing fair how was he supposed to kill them without getting hurt himself if they wouldnt let him dig in properly trench mortars up on the hilltops might have been mexicans like any american he thought of mexico as backwards and corrupt and bankrupt if the emperor had been able to pay his bills he wouldnt have had to sell chihuahua and sonora to the csa and when the united states had fought mexico back before the war of secession theyd actually won so paul in spite of what captain wyatt had said expected any soldiers bold enough to charge to be confederates propping up their allies but he was wrong these men wore a khaki lighter than confederate issue so light it was almost yellow in this terrain it gave better protection than greengray they wore widebrimmed straw hats too not felts or steel derbies and their shouts yipped like coyotes howls they werent the cougar screams the rebs used for battle cries mantarakis fired one of the first who did several mexicans went down he didnt think they were all hit they were taking cover too a bullet kicked dust into his face he shivered despite the heat a miss was as good as a mile or so they said but what did they really know whoever they were fire was coming at the americans from the front and from both flanks that wasnt good that was how you got shot to pieces that was also probably why after most of two years of war the americans hadnt got to santa rosalia yet lets get moving mantarakis shouted to his squad we stay here theyre going to chop us to bits not without a pang of regret he quit the unsatisfactory foxhole hed dug and headed off to the right to see if he couldnt do something about the flanking fire coming from that direction his men followed him hed known of officers who found out too late they were moving all by themselves most of them hadnt come back from moves like that rifle bullets buzzed past him clipped branches from the chaparral through which he ran and made dust spurt up again and again he noted all that only peripherally what he did note with glad relief was that the mexicans hadnt brought any machine guns forward with them maybe machine guns were like proper artillery too expensive for them to afford he fervently hoped so he dove behind a sunwizened bush snapped off a couple of rounds to make the enemy keep their heads down and then got moving again he came cautiously around a yellow boulder that might have been there since the beginning of timeand almost ran into a mexican soldier doing the same thing they stared at each other the mexican had two cartridge bandoliers crisscrossed over his chest which made him look like a bandit his bristly mustache and the black stubble on his chin only added to the impression paul saw the mexican very distinctly as if a sculptor had carved him and the entire scene behind him into a sharpedged simulation of reality the man seemed to raise his rifle with dreamlike slowness though pauls swung to bear on him no more swiftly they both fired at essentially the same instant time speeded up then the mexican let out a startled grunt and reeled away blood coming from a small hole in the front of his uniform and a huge gaping exit wound about where his left kidney wasor had been with that hole in him he was surely a dead man he didnt know it yet though he still held his rifle and tried to aim it at paul mantarakis discovered his left leg didnt want to hold him i cant have been shot he thoughti dont feel anything falling heavily onto his side kept him from getting shot again for the mexicans bullet cracked through the place where hed been then he fired once more and the enemy soldiers head exploded in red ruin paul tried to get up and discovered he couldnt he looked down at himself red was soaking through the dust on the inside of his trouser leg seeing his own blood flooding out of him made him understand he really had been hit it also made the wound start to hurt he clamped his teeth together hard against a scream sergeants down somebody shouted off to one side of him he did an awkward threelimbed crawl back behind the shelter of that boulder then he detached his bayonet and cut the trouser leg with it before fumbling for the wound dressing in a pouch on his belt his hands didnt want to do what he told them hed barely managed to shove the bandage against the hole in his leg when a couple of us soldiers grabbed him got to get you out of here sarge one of them said got to get us all the hell out of here the other added damn mexicans got us pinned down good well lick em paul said vaguely his voice sounded very far away as if he were listening to himself along a tunnel he wasnt hot any more either a long time ago hadnt they bled people who had fevers he tried to laugh though no sound came out sure as sure he wouldnt have any fever now one of the men supporting him grunted just as the mexican had and crumpled to the ground a few paces farther on the other soldier said can you help any sarge wed move faster if you could do something with your good leg getting no reply he spoke again louder sarge he stooped letting his burden down behind another of the strangely shaped rocks that dotted the valley when he got up again he ran on alone anne colleton felt trapped living as the only white person at what had beenand what she was fiercely determined would again bemarshlands plantation with the remnants of her field hands was only part of the problem though she made a point of carrying a small revolver in her handbag and preferred not to go far from the tredegar rifle when she could help it you couldnt tell any more not these days that was part of the problem the red uprising had shattered patterns of obedience two hundred years old the field hands still did as she told them the fields were beginning to look as if she might have some kind of crop this year no matter how late it had been started but she couldnt use the negroes as she had before shed taken their compliance for granted no more now they worked in exchange for her keeping the confederate authorities from troubling them for whatever they might have done during the rebellion it was far more nearly a bargain between equals than the previous arrangement had been but only part of her feeling of isolation was spiritual the rest was physical and perfectly real shed made trips into st matthews and into columbia trying to get the powers that be to repair the telephone and telegraph lines that connected her to the wider world shed had promises that they would be up two weeks after her return to the plantation shed had a lot more promises since what she didnt have were telephone and telegraph lines god damn those lying bastards to hell she snarled staring out along the path out toward the road out toward the whole wide world where anything at all might be happeningbut if it was happening how could she find out about it shed prided herself on her modernity but the life she was living had more to do with the eighteenth century than the twentieth beside her julia stirred don fret yourself none miss anne she said her hands rested on the broad shelf of her belly before long she would have that baby if she knew who the father was she hadnt said so anne ground her teeth julia would have been ideally suited to the eighteenth century or to the fourteenth century for that matter she let things happen to her when they did she cast around for the easiest way to set them right and chose that better to be actor than acted upon anne said more to herself than to her serving woman shed always believed that though shed had scant experience of being acted upon till the red revolution cast her into the hands of the military having gained the experience she was convinced shed been right to loathe it she looked over toward the ruins of the marshlands mansion the cottage in which she was living now had belonged to cassius the hunter from what shed heard hed had a high place in the negroescongaree socialist republic hed been a red right under her nose and shed never suspected that ate at her too she hated being wrong even more galling was having been wrong about scipio who was also supposed to have been a revolutionary leader i gave him everything she thought education fine clothes the same food i ateand this is the thanks he gave me in return hed vanished when the revolt collapsed maybe he was dead if he wasnt and she found him she swore shed make him wish he were and the ford she was driving these days made as unsatisfactory a replacement for her vanished vauxhall as the nigger cottage did for her vanished mansion she hated the balky farting motorcar the only thing she would have hated worse was being without one altogether an automobile rattled past on the road kicking up a trail of red dust as it went it was she saw an armored car with a couple of machine guns mounted in a central turret resistance still sputtered in the swamps by the congaree otherwise that armored car would have been of far more value shooting down damnyankees its proper task julias eyes followed the armored car till it disappeared behind a stand of trees despite her broad lips her mouth made a thin hard line she swore up and down that shed never been a rebel that she hated everything the reds stood for annes opinion was that she protested too much wherever the truth lay there julia did not take kindly to seeing such deadly machines out hunting black men that was also true even of the negroes who had anne thought genuinely disapproved of the socialist uprising anne sighed life kept getting harder a couple of minutes later a party of horsemen turned off the road and onto the path leading up tothe ruins of marshlands two of the three riders had the look of superannuated soldiers and carried carbines across their knees the third the postman wore a tredegar slung on his back anne walked toward him nodding as she did so good morning mr palmer she called with the telephone and telegraph out of commission the postman was her lifeline to the wider world he swung down off his horse and touched the brim of his hat with a forefinger producing a pencil and a printed form he said mornin to you miss colleton got a special delivery you got to sign forand quite a special delivery it is too ah thank you maam he passed her the envelope and then the rest of the days mail that done he gave her another halfsalute remounted and urged his horse up from walk to canter the two armed guards rode off with him their eyes hard and alert richmond anne said noting the postmark on the envelope before she spotted the return address in the upper lefthand corner in a typeface that might have come straight off a roman monument residence of the president of the confederate states of america her head went up and down in a quick decisive nod about time gabriel semmes got off his backside and wrote to me who it from miss anne julia asked the president anne answered and the negro womans eyes got big and round anne tore the envelope open the letter was in semmes own hand which partly mollified her for not having heard from him sooner my dear miss colleton the president of the csa wrote let me extend to you my deepest personal sympathies on the loss of your brother and the damage to your property during the unfortunate events of the recent past unfortunate events anne snorted as if the two words added up to some horrible curseand so maybe they did before hed been elected gabriel semmes had made a name for himself as a man who went out and did things not a typical politician anne had thrown money into his campaign on that basis but if he called an insurrection an unfortunate event maybe she would have been better served spending it elsewhere she read on as you no doubt know these unfortunate events have adversely affected our ability to resist the aggression of the united states of america which seek to reduce us once more to the state of abject dependency existing before the war of secession to meet their challenge we shall have to utilize every resource available to us i should hope so anne said as if the president were standing there before her she was sure she knew what would be coming next some sort of higher taxes which she would be asked to support in the name of continued confederate strength and independence she looked around marshlands she didnt know how she could pay higher taxes she didnt know how she could pay the taxes already due one way or another she would have to manage she understood that if the choice was between paying more and having the damnyankees win she wouldsomehowpay more with the yankees having gassed jacob and with tom still at the roanoke front how could she do anything less her eyes returned to the letter for that reason i have introduced into the congress of the confederate states of america she nodded and stopped reading for a moment yes gabriel semmes was perfectly predictable a bill authorizing the recruitment training and employment against the united states of america of bodies of negro troops these to serve under white officers and noncommissioned officers the reward for their satisfactory completion of service or for their inability to do so because of wounds to be the franchise and all other rights and privileges pertaining to full citizenship in the confederate states of america intermarriage being the sole exception thereto good god anne said taxes shed expected this no she felt as if shed been kicked in the belly the negroes rose up in bloody revolt and semmes proposed to reward them for it he did indeed go forth and do things and she wished to high heaven hed been content to hold still he continued i am soliciting your support for this measure because i know that you judge the continued independence of the country we both love to be of primary importance with all else subordinated to it now we are come to a crisis the likes of which we have never known one that calls for a supreme effort from every man woman and child in the confederate states white and black alike anything less would be a dereliction of duty from all of us i hope and trust you will use your not inconsiderable influence both within your circle of acquaintances and with your congressional delegation to let us turn back the ravening hordes of american huns your obt servantand a florid signature good god anne said again i should have backed doroteo arango miss anne julia knew nothing of politics unless perhaps red politics and cared less never mind anne carried the rest of the mail into the cottage julia followed her she sorted through it separating out bills requests for money and time for charitable organizations that these days would have to go unanswered advertising circulars that would make good kindling for the fireplace but were otherwise worthless and at the bottom of the stack a letter from tom she opened that one eagerly she wondered what tom would think of having nigger troops put on confederate butternut no she didnt wonder she was perfectly sure shed never credited her brother with a whole lot of sense but how much sense did you need to see folly dear sis tom wrote just a note to let you know im alive and well not a scratch on methey do say that if youre born to hang nothing else can hurt you anne snorted again her brother was about the least likely man to go to the gallows she could imagine she read on it has been lively i will say the damnyankees have come as far asa censor had cut out the name of the placewhich we never expected them to do the trouble is theyre using these armorplated traveling forts prisoners callanother censors slice denied her the knowledge of what they were called though she could not for the life of her see whyand theyve gained a lot of ground because of it artillery will take them out so will brave soldiers but its hard being brave with one of those things bearing down on you this time the censor damn him had cut out a whole sentence when she was allowed to resume reading what her brother wrote he said if they keep throwing more and more machines at us i dont know where well come up with the men to hold them back i hope to get leave before too long and will come home to have a look at marshlands i am sure you are whipping the old place back into shape tom was always sure of that till now his confidence had always been justified nowanne didnt want to think about now her eyes went to the last couple of sentences who would have dreamt the damned niggers could raise so much cain if id thought they could do half so much id have sooner had them shooting at the damnyankees so we could get some use out of them but even though everything else is turned upside down from before the war i still love you and ill see you soontom miss anne julia said when anne stood there motionless reading the letter over several times hush anne colleton replied absently after a bit she put the letter down and picked up the one from the president of the confederacy she read through that letter twice too her breath whistled out in a long sigh you all right miss anne julia asked sounding for once very much like the concerned body servant shed been till not long before no anne said not even close shed misjudged her brotherand if she couldnt tell what tom was thinking these days how could she trust her judgment on anything else the short answer was she couldnt she sighed again even louder this time maybe gabriel semmes isnt a complete utter damn fool after all maybe she tried to make herself sound as if she believed it it wasnt easy george armstrong custer stood at the edge of the road by a sign that had an arrow saying kentucky pointing north and another saying tennessee pointing south a photographer snapped several pictures thesell make bully halftones general he said splendid my good man splendid custer replied grandly major abner dowling felt ready to retch that road sign was as resurrected as lazaruseverything hereabouts like everything everywhere the rake of war passed had been stomped flat when it came to getting his nameand better yet his photographin the papers custer was not a man to let mere rude facts stand in his way dowling would have thought hed had the sign made up special for the occasion but that order would have gone through him so custer must have come up with a real one instead the photographer put down the camera and pulled out a notebook and pencil he doubled as a reporter to what do you attribute your success in this springs campaign general he asked before custer could reply a barrel came rumbling down the road heading south into tennessee another followed then another everybody except the drivers rode on top of the machines not inside them men had died from heat prostration inside barrels trying to fight in this hideous summer weather kentucky had been bad tennessee promised to be worse custer pointed to the machines there is your answer sir the barrels have filled rebel hearts not only with fear but also with a good healthy respect for the prowess of the american soldier and for the genius lying behind what i call with pardonable pride oldfashioned yankee ingenuity i have always insisted that machines as well as men will make the differenceare you all right major dowling yes sir sorry sir dowling said must have been the dust the barrels kicked up or maybe those stinking exhaust fumes i couldnt breathe for a second or two there i hope youre better now custer said doubtfully you sounded like a man choking to death where was i oh yes barrels i custer barreled on dowling took out a pocket handkerchief and daubed at his sweaty forehead and streaming eyes custer disapproved of the aeroplane he disapproved of the machine gun though hed risen to prominence in the second mexican war because hed had a few attached to his command he disapproved of the telephone and the telegraph he undoubtedly would have disapproved of the telescope had it not been invented before he was born but barrelshe approved of barrels barrels to him remained cavalry reborn cavalry proof against everything machine guns could do since hed grown up in the cavalry hed transferred his affection to these gasolineburning successors and custer being custer never did anything by halves when he fell in love he fell hard to prosaic dowling barrels were bully infantry support weapons past thathe failed to share custers enthusiasm custer had any number of enthusiasms he did not share that for custer being perhaps the largest but even dowling was prepared to admit the barrels had done some good the first few times the rebs saw them theyd panicked they were good soldiers as one of their sincerest foes dowling admitted as much even the best soldiers though would run if the alternative was dying without having the chance to hit back at their enemies they werent panicking quite so much now they were starting to figure out ways to blow up barrels too the armored machines had proved vulnerable to artillery fire though artillery had trouble hitting moving targets even if the movement was no swifter than the barrels mechanized waddle still dowling had thought hed grow old and die in kentucky and here he was in tennessee or at least on the border next stopnashville custer declared waving his staff as if he were a train conductor dowling wished he thought it would be so easy general what will your men do if they come up against black troops in confederate uniform the reporter asked ill believe that when i see it custer answered here for once dowling agreed with him completely he went on if it does happen it will be only one more sign that the rebels are scraping the bottom of the barrelheh heh the frogs are padding their lines with african savages these days so i suppose the rebs might give their homegrown niggers gunsnot that they havent grabbed guns of their own already to use on the whites who now talk about using them against us eryes the fellow with the camera and notebook hadnt bargained for a speech he came back to the question hed really asked but how will your soldiers respond to them if they are enlisted custers drooping mustache and even more drooping jowls made his frown impressively ugly how will they respond to them he repeated not caring for the fact that his earlier answer hadnt satisfied the man i expect theyll shoot them in great carload lots thats how greatcarloadlots the reporter scribbled furiously oh thats good sir thats very good theyll like thatitll probably get a headline do you think so all of a sudden the general commanding first army was sweetness and light once more even dowling thought it was a pretty good line and he was not inclined to give his commander much credit for such things the reporter asked a couple of more questions custer having succeeded with one joke tried some others all of which fell flat they fell so flat in fact that the reporter put away his notebook picked up his camera and departed faster than he might otherwise have done custer as usual was oblivious to such subtleties puffing out his flabby chest he turned to dowling and said i think that went very well of course you do his adjutant thought it was publicity it was as usual hard to go wrong with an answer of yes sir and now back to headquarters i want to prepare the orders for our next attack against the rebs positions yes sir dowling said again custer was taking a more active interest in the campaign these days partly dowling supposed because libbie was still with him and partly because like a child with new christmas toys he was playing with the barrels to find out what all they could do when he got back to the building doing duty for headquarters these daysa whitewashed clapboard structure with the legend general store camp hill simes proporders got delayed for a while someone had brought in a wicker basket full of ripe red strawberries and a bowl of whipped cream custer dug in with gusto pinkish juice dribbling down his chin and bits of clotted cream getting stuck in the peroxided splendor of his mustache since major dowling wasnt shy about enjoying the bounty either he refrained from even mental criticism of the general where did we come by these custer asked after hed eaten his fill little town called portland sir said captain theodore heissig one of the staff officers just south of the tennessee line they grow em in bunches no no custer said bananas grow in bunches unlike the man with the notebook and camera the staff officers were obliged to find all his jokes funny or to act as if they did dowling bared his teeth in what bore at least some resemblance to a grin once the strawberries were all disposed of custer walked over to the map and examined it with less satisfaction than he might have shown considering the amount of progress first army had made since the confederate states were distracted by their own internal turmoil and especially since barrels had begun to make trenches something less than impregnable we need more help from the navy he grumbled how long have they been stuck just past this miserable clarksville place weeks seems like sir theyre saying they need army help to go farther captain heissig said balderdash custer boomed a fine bouncing exclamation that sprayed little bits of cream onto the map sir i dont think it is abner dowling said gingerly trying as he so often had to do to lead custer back toward some vague connection to military reality the rebs have mined the cumberland heavily and theyve got big artillery south of the river zeroed on the minefields the navys lost too many monitors to be very eager to push hard any more then what the devil good are they custer demanded if they cant get where we need them they might as well not be there at all that conveniently ignored several facts some small some immense but custer had always been good at ignoring facts he didnt like he rounded on the luckless captain heissig i want you to arrange cooperation on our terms captain and i want you to do it by this afternoon ill do my best sir the young captain said youll do it captain or this time next week youll be chasing redskins and bandits through the parts of the sonoran desert we were supposed to have pacified a year and a half ago custer said he meant it too as the luckless captain heissig had to know his staff had the highest turnover of any commander of an armys there were timesa lot of timeswhen commanding a battalion in the sonoran desert would have looked very good to dowling but custer worse luck didnt threaten to ship him out he just used him as a whipping boy dowling sent poor captain heissig a sympathetic glance misery loved company cincinnatus nostrils dilated as he approached the kentucky smoke house when the wind was right you could smell the barbecue all over covington even when the wind was wrong as if was tonight the irresistibly savory smell made spit flood into peoples mouths for miles around and when you walked into apicius barbecue place you felt certain you were going to starve to death before you got your pork or your beef smothered in the hot spicy sauce that made the smoke house famous and spun on a spit over a hickory fire even if you werent coming in for the food as cincinnatus wasnt you wanted someyou wanted that splendid sauce all down your shirtfront was what you wanted blacks ate at the kentucky smoke house so did covingtons whites unwilling to let their colored brethren have such a good thing to themselves and so did yankee soldiers and administrators a man who kept his ears open there would surely learn a lot lucullus apicius son was turning the spit in the main room the carcass of a pig went round and round above the firepit however much his mouth watered cincinnatus ignored the prospect of barbecued pork that lucullus was working the spit meant apicius had to be in one of the back rooms and apicius was the man hed come to see but when he headed for the back rooms felix apicius other son stood in front of him to bar the way pas already in there talkin with somebody he said be a good idea if you see him later whos he talkin to that i aint supposed to know nothin about cincinnatus answered scornfully be a good idea if i see him now i been drivin all over creation the whole day long i dont got to do none o this you know i could go home to my wife and my little boy dont get to see them often enough way things are im goinin felix was a couple of years younger than lucullus he hadnt quite got his full growth and he hadnt quite acquired the arrogance that would have let him tell a grown man no and get away with it he looked toward lucullus for support but lucullus kept basting that pig with a longhandled brush when cincinnatus took a step forward felix scowled but moved aside cincinnatus knew which back room apicius was likely to usewhy not hed been in there himself often enough the fat negro barbecue cook looked up in startlement when the door opened so did the man with whom hed been bent in intent conversation all at once cincinnatus wished hed paid attention to felix the man with whom apicius had been talking was tom kennedy im gonna have to give my boy a good kick in the slack o his britches apicius said and then to cincinnatus this time well come in and shut that thing behind you fore people out front start payinmore heed to whats goinon in here than they should ought to to kennedy he said sorry mister tom didnt spect wed get interrupted could be worse kennedy said cincinnatus and me weve known each other for a long time and weve done a deal of work together you know about that i suppose his tone wascautious was the word on which cincinnatus finally settled cincinnatus had put firebombs into us supply dumps over much of central kentucky hed gone right on doing that after conroys general store burned down he didnt like doing it but he thought it would be wise the confederate underground hadnt troubled him so he supposed hed made the right choice buildings did sometimes burn down without firebombs after all or seem as if they did there had in fact been a fire in a livery stable down the block from the general store a couple of nights later well all right youre here apicius said roughly he slid down on the bench he was occupying to give cincinnatus room to sit beside him what you got to say that wont keep for nothin but cincinnatus didnt say anything not right away he kept an eye on tom kennedy kennedy had used apicius and his sons to help spread confederate propaganda in occupied kentucky cincinnatus didnt know whether kennedy knew apicius headed a red cell in covington till he found out he wasnt going to say anything to let kennedy in on the secret the war between the reds and the confederate government was liable to continue here in this land neither of those two sides controlled kennedy said i was just telling apicius here about what i told you months ago would come truemore rights for negroes in the csa on account of the war and on account of the goddamn uprising you did tell me about that mr kennedythats a fact cincinnatus said i own i didnt reckon you knew what you was talking about but it do look like you did got to get through the congress before its real and the congress dont move what anybodyd call real quick apicius observed i think congress will move quicker here than you figure kennedy said you read the papers apicius shook his head felix does and lucullus not me all i knows is how to cook meat till it fall off the bone into yo mouth and how to sandbag cincinnatus thought maybe apicius was illiterate if he was he had the remarkable memory people who couldnt read and write often developed details never slipped his mind the display of ignorance didnt impress kennedy either you know whats going on he corrected himself impatiently you know the confederate states need all the help they can get against the usa and you know that if that means giving negroes more theyll do it reckon i do know that the cook said question is do i care the csa is a pack o capitalists and oppressors an de usa is a pack o capitalists and oppressors too why the devil does we care what the devil happens to one pack o capitalists and imperialists or the other cincinnatus knew he was staring apicius chuckled tom kennedy chuckled too a little selfconsciously they both started to talk at the same time with a wave of the sort hed probably learned as a boy back in slavery days the black man deferred to the white kennedy said when youre underground things are different down in mississippi id hang apicius from the first branchwell the first really big branchi could findif he didnt bushwhack me first up here we both worry about the usa more than we do about each other he nodded to cincinnatus i know who im working with and i know whos working with me too was that a warning about conroys store what else could it be but if kennedy had drawn his own conclusions about thatcincinnatus wondered why he was still breathing in that case apicius said that dont mean what i said beforehand dont hold you got to remember that mister tom most of the black folks who think about politics at all we is marxists we is oppressed so bad what else can we be the war you got its an imperialist war why shouldnt we sit by and let the capitalists shoot each other full of holes cincinnatus wondered how long the cook had been a red to talk that way if he couldnt read the words kennedy answered because whoevers left on top is going to lick the tar out of you if you do you arent strong enough to go it alone youve seen that if you couldnt lick the csa when we had one hand and half of the other one tied behind our backs youll never do it you cant fight not well enough you have to deal who says we didnt lick the csa apicius asked quietly the us soldiers they down in tennessee these days you think you ever gonna see soldiers in butternut back on the ohio dont hold your breath mister tom the yankees can put soldiers on every railroad track and streetcorner in this state that doesnt mean they can run it kennedy would have been more impressive if he hadnt sounded as if he were whistling in the dark it dont matter nohow apicius said in the long run mister tom it dont matter atall the revolution gonna come in the csa and the revolution gonna come in the usa not all the soldiers in the world can stop it on account of its the way things gonna work out everywhere in the world you kin fight it an go under or you kin be progressive an make yourself part of the risin power o the proletariat if the yankees werent holding us both down kennedy said apicius nodded his heavyjowled face calm and certain cincinnatus had seen that look before most often on the faces of preachers convinced of their own righteousness than anywhere else he wondered if apicius really knew what he was talking about if the united workers of the world were so strongif the workers are so strong he said more thinking aloud than intending to criticize why didnt they all say two years ago they didnt want to go out and kill each other instead of lining up and cheering and waving their flags but disagreeing with both of them at the same time he did the same thing the us invasion of kentucky had done he got apicius and tom kennedy to unite against him though for divergent reasons why because theyre patriots thats why kennedy said and theyll go on being patriots too even the colored ones when they find out they have something worth fighting for apicius shook his head they fight on account of they is mystified into thinking country and race count for more than class the capitalists got them fooled is why they go off cheerin nothing counts for more than country and race kennedy said with conviction although cincinnatus had worked with the confederate underground he did not think of himself as tom kennedys political ally but he had the feeling kennedy was right here you could usually tell a mans race just by using your eyes you could usually tell a mans country just by using your ears to hear how he talked set against those basics the idea of class seemed as fragile as something made from spun sugar as if to cleanse himself of agreeing with a white man against a black and if that wasnt race in action what was it cincinnatus said some of the states in the usa i hear tell they already let their colored men vote kennedy accepted the challenge without flinching he had nerve no doubt of that sure they do cincinnatus they dont have enough blacks to worry about you think the white men of kentucky are going to feel the same way apicius smiled a nasty smile maybe that dont matter none maybe the yankees they only think about who wants to do things for them and about who they reckon they cant noway trust maybe when the war is over maybe only the black folks in kentucky gets to vote how you gonna like that there mister tom kennedys face showed how well he would like that he said thered be an uprising so fast itd make your head swim and you know what apicius a lot of the damnyankee soldiers would join it too cincinnatus thought about lieutenant kennan would he back whites against blacks and against his own government he might but kennan wasnt the only kind of yankee there was not all of them would he said with as much certainty as kennedy had shown not long before not all of them would not by a long shot what are you doing here then kennedy asked you like the yankees so well why arent you with them because i saved your neck mr kennedy once upon a time cincinnatus answered that made kennedy shut up it also made cincinnatus wonder if he was on the right sideany of the right sidesafter all which surely was not what the white man had had in mind lucien galtier led his family into the biggest church in riviereduloup for sunday morning mass more often than not he and they worshiped in stmodeste or stantonin both of which were closer to his farm and both of which had priests less inclined to fawn on the american occupiers than was father pascal every so often it is interesting to hear what the good father has to say he remarked to his wife as they and their children filed into a pew and took their seats he speaks very well it is not to be doubted you have reason marie agreed in fulsome tones no informer could have taken their words in any way amiss that was fortunate since they were surely under suspicion for having failed to collaborate with father pascal and the americans as fully as they might have done even in the midst of war peace filled the churchor did its best to do so the buzzing roar of aeroplane motors pierced the roof the aeroplanes were flying north across the st lawrence to drop bombs or shoot at the soldiers defending unconquered quebec from the invaders lucien had neither seen nor heard aeroplanes flying south since the ones that had shot up the american troop train more from that than from the improbabilities the newspapers published these days he concluded that the defenders of the province were having a hard time you could not tell as much from father pascals demeanor here he came up the aisle toward the altar flanked by altar boys in robes of gleaming white the procession was not so perfectly formal as it might have been for the priest stopped every few rows to greet someone with a smile or a handshake he beamed at lucien and his family good to see you here today my friends he said before passing on lucien nodded back not so coldly as he would have liked part of that was simple caution part his reaction however involuntary to father pascals genuine charm he scowled down at his hands once the priests back was to him he would have respected father pascal as a foe more easily had the man not pretended an amity that had to be false the mass however was the mass no matter who celebrated it the sonorous latin that lucien understood only in small snatches bound him understood or not with worshipers all over the world and extending back in time to the days of christ himself even in father pascals mouth it made the farmer feel a part of something larger and older and grander than himself once the prayers were over father pascal returned to french to address the congregation my children he said adding with a roguish smile for you are the only children i shall ever have my children i know that many among you are upset and disturbed in your hearts at the travail france is suffering in this great war that covers the whole of the earth i do not blame you for this feeling on the contraryi share it with you he set both plump pink wellmanicured hands over his heart for a moment the woman in the pew in front of lucien sighed at the gesture galtier suppressed the urge to clout her in the head it wouldnt knock sense into her and would get him talked about father pascal went on but although france is the mother from which we have all sprung i must remind you painful duty though it is that the france of today the france of the third republic has cut herself off from the ways and traditions we proudly maintain you must understand then that her punishment is surely the will of god hes right that woman whispered loudly to her husband every word he says is true and you cannot deny a one of them her husbands head went up and down in an emphatic nod now lucien wanted to clout both of them he needed a distinct effort of will to hold still and listen as the priest kept spinning his seductive web the france we know today is not the france that sent our ancestors forth to this new world father pascals voice dripped regret this is the france that murdered its king that disestablished our true and holy catholic church that made the blessed pope a spectator as bonaparte set the crown on his own head that has lost her moral compass such a country i believe needs to be reminded of where her true duties and obligations lie once she has been purged in the fire of repentance then perhapsi pray it shall be soshe will deserve our respect once more a couple of women including the one in front of lucien broke into sobs at the iniquities of modern france he was more inclined to dwell on the iniquities of father pascal and to wonder how much the american major quigley had bribed him and in what coin i also note for your edification my children that in the united states all religions truly are treated as being equal father pascal said you have surely seen for yourselves that the occupying authorities have in no way interfered with our worship here in riviereduloup or in the other regions of la belle province that they have liberated from the english at that galtier sat up very straight he made a point of glancing over to his two sons to make sure they did nothing foolish georges laughed silently but not with the goodnatured laughter that was his hallmark charles was tightlipped with anger neither one fortunately seemed ready to raise an outburst nor did his wife or nicole his three younger daughters thoughhe caught their eyes one by one his warning might have been silent but it got through father pascal continued the protestants the presbyterianshe loaded the names with scornin ottawa and all through ontario are surely just as glad to have you to have us gone from their midst gone from their protestant dominion well god will have an answer for them too if not in this world then in the world to come now lucien was the one who had to struggle to keep silent its not like that was the shout he wanted to raise looking around the church he saw several men of roughly his own age also seeming discontented they were the ones who had been conscripted into the canadian army served their terms and who had done so enough years before that they were not recalled to the colors when the war began not until the americans had overrun this part of quebec no one who had served in it could doubt the army ran more nearly according to the wishes of the english than those of the french that was hard to resent with more canadians being of english blood than french but any man of either stock who buckled down and obeyed his superiors would get on well and veterans knew that too whether father pascal did or not the priest said we have survived more than a century and a half of rule by protestants who despise and fear us france has suffered for more than a hundred years under one godless regime after another accommodating ourselves to the freedom we shall have in the united states and to the chastisement of the erring mother country should not be difficult or unpleasant for us my children we shall do well and france if god is kind will return to the ways of truth abandoned so long ago he is a beautiful man the woman in front of lucien said to her husband who nodded again he sees the truth and he sets it forth as if he were writing a book for us to read and then to galtiers alarm marie said he is a very persuasive man is he not lucien had to study her face carefully before noticing one eyebrow a hairs breadth higher than the other he sighed in relief for a moment hed feared father pascal had seduced his wifeno other word seemed to fit very persuasive yes lucien said he did his best to sound fulsome in case that idiot woman or anyone else within earshot proved a spy people filed up to receive communion from father pascal as he bent to let the priest place the wafer in his mouth lucien had to remind himself that a cleric was not required to be in a state of grace for the sacrament he administered to be efficacious to believe otherwise was to fall into the donatist heresy galtier could not recallif he had ever knownwho the donatists were or where they had lived staring at sleek prosperous father pascal though he wondered if they hadnt been better theologians than the church proclaimed them on his tongue the body of christ tasted like ashes when the last communicant had taken part in the miracle father pascal said the mass is over go in peace he again abandoned the ritual latin for french to add and pray there may be peace here in our province and all over the world as galtier and his family were leaving they passed major quigley who stood waiting outside the church nodding to lucien as if to a friend he walked over to the rectory next door no doubt to speak with the priest who was doing so much for his cause some of the americans nicole said hesitantly as the wagon made its slow way back to the farm some of the americans are very nice people this is what you get for working in the hospital charles snapped at his sister lucien had had similar fears but held up a hand if we quarrel among ourselves on whom can we rely he asked both his daughter and his son looked abashed i have raised them well he thought with no small pride he went on i agreesome of the americans are very nice people my opinion however is that all of them without exception would be nicer still were they back in america you have reason father nicole said lucien had to fight to keep from crowing all the way back to the farm still commanding the battery that had been jeb stuart iiis still a sergeant likely to be a sergeant till the day he died jake featherston knew that day was liable to be close at hand the army of northern virginia maintained its presence on this side of the monocacy but that was for the most part because the yankees had been pushing harder elsewhere in maryland not because confederate defenses were strong here and now the united states were pounding in this sector too shells burst all around the battery a couple of men were down the worst of it though wasnt explosions or flying splinters the worst of it was that the yankees were firing a lot of gas shells along with their high explosives come on jake shouted to the men of his own gun pound those yankee trenches theyre gonna swarm like bees any minute even when he did shout his words sounded hollow and muffled the gas helmets confederate soldiers were wearing these days did a better job of protecting lungs and especially eyes from poison gas than had the chemicalsoaked gauze pads that had been the original line of defense against the new and horrid weapon but wearing a helmet of rubberized burlap that covered your entire head and neck was a torment in its own right the more so as days got ever hotter and muggier jake rubbed at the glass portholes of the helmet with a scrap of rag that didnt help the round windows werent so much dirty as they were steamy and the steam was on the inside of the gas helmet he could have taken off the helmet then the portholes would have been clean of course then he would have been poisoned but if you were going to worry about every little thing the yankee barrage dropped back into the frontline trenches be ready yall featherston shouted theyre going to be coming out any he didnt even get the chance to finish the sentence the us soldiers swarmed out of their trenches and rushed toward the confederate lines the us bombardment didnt ease off till they were within fifty yards of those lines jake gave the enemy reluctant credit for a very sharp piece of work there even before the damnyankees guns stopped pounding the confederate trenches though men in butternut were pouring machinegun fire into their foes the barrage was liable to kill them but if they didnt keep the us soldiers out of their trenches they were surely dead the battery poured shrapnel into the yankees advancing across nomansland shortening the range as the soldiers in greengray drew closer to the confederate line shell casings lay by the breech of the gun in the same way that watermelon seeds were liable to lie by a negro sleeping in the sun signs of what had been consumed dirt fountained up from every explosion men fountained up too or pieces of men others dove for the shelter of shell holes old and new for a moment the attack faltered jake had watched a lot of attacks both yankee and confederate falter generals had a way of asking men to do more than flesh and blood could bear be ready to lengthen range in a hurry he called to his gun crews when they run we want to hurt em as bad as we can so they dont try this shit again in a hurry but then a cry of alarm and despair rose not from the ranks of the yankees but from the confederates trenches men started running away from the front straight toward jake featherstons guns barrels michael scott shouted with the gas helmet he had on jake couldnt see his face but he would have bet it was as pale as whey the damnyankees got barrels there were only three of them belching out grayblack clouds of exhaust as they lumbered forward with a clumsy deliberation that put featherston in mind of fat men staggering out of a saloon but like fat men not so drunk as to fall down they kept on coming no matter how clumsy they looked machinegun bullets struck sparks from their armored hides but did not penetrate them they had machine guns too and poured a hail of bullets of their own on confederate positions that kept on resisting where those machinegun bullets proved inadequate they used their cannon to pound the foes into silence they were jake saw deadly dangerous weapons of war they were also even more deadly dangerous weapons of terror rumors about them had raced through the confederate army weeks before this their first appearance on the front here seeing that they were nearly as invulnerable as rumor made them out to be most of the men thought flight the best if not the only answer that armor of theirs it doesnt keep shells out jake said theyre not going any faster than a man can walk and every damn one of ems as big as a battleship we dont fill em full of holes we dont deserve to be in the first richmond howitzers he felt the sting of that himself as far as the powers that be were concerned he didnt deserve to he an officer in the first richmond howitzers when his life lay on the line though pride took second place at his shouted orders all the guns in the battery took aim at the barrels despite the encouraging words hed used he quickly discovered hitting a moving target with an artillery piece was anything but easy shell after shell exploded in front of the barrels or far beyond them if i was a nigger id swear they were hexed michael scott growled if you were a nigger featherston began and then stopped he didnt know how to finish the thought hed fought that very gun with two negro laborers up in pennsylvania after a yankee bombardment had killed or wounded everyone in the crew but him the fire he and nero and perseus delivered had helped drive back a us assault on the trenches in front of the battery yet the two blacks had sympathized with the red revolt enough to desert the battery when it began and he hadnt seen them since he wondered if theyd managed to get their hands on any guns and turn them against their confederate superiors he doubted hed ever know but he was sure that if not for the negro uprising the war against the usa would be going better now blacks were mostly back to work yes but you couldnt turn your back on them not the way you had before that made them only half as useful as they had been before the red flags started flyingand that meant the war against the united states was still feeling the effects of the uprising well pay em back one of these days jake said he had no more time in which to think about it one of the barrels was clumsily turning so that its cannon bore on his gun barrels couldnt stand hits from artillery hed told his gun crew as much and hoped for the sake of his own neck he was right he didnt need anyone to tell him guns out in the open couldnt do that either flame spurted from the muzzle of the cannon inside the traveling fortress the shell was short fragments clattered off the splinter shield that was all the protection his gun crew had nothing got through nobody got hurt he knew perfectly well that that was luck left half a degree he shouted and the muzzle of the howitzer swung ever so slightly he yanked the lanyard the gun roared so did he hit we hit the son of a bitch smoke poured out of the barrel hatches popped open all over the ungainly machine men some carrying machine guns and belts of ammunition dove out of the hatches and into whatever cover they could find the gun crew raked the area where they were cowering i hope we kill em all and i hope they take a long time dying michael scott said savagely at featherstons orders his gunners also sent several more rounds into the burning barrel to make sure the damnyankees couldnt salvage it another barrel had stopped on the open ground between two trenches jake didnt know why it had stopped he didnt care either what difference whether it had broken down or its commander was an idiot it made an easy target nothing else mattered soon it was burning too seeing the seemingly invincible barrels going up in flames put fresh heart into the confederate infantry that had been on the point of breaking the men in butternut stopped running and started shooting back at the us soldiers in their trenches the last surviving barrel made a slow awkward turnthe only kind it could makeand lumbered away from the battery of field guns that had treated its comrades so roughly its tail carried a twomachinegun sting but jake had never been so glad to see the back of anything all the guns in the battery sent shells after the barrel no one was lucky enough to score a hit on it its going featherston said thats good enough for now far as im concerned if it comes back tomorrow well worry about it tomorrow meantime lets see if we can make the damnyankees sorry they ever made it into our trenches before long the us soldiers in the confederate positions were very unhappy the battery showered them with both gas and shrapnel the troops theyd driven back counterattacked aided by reinforcements hurrying across the monocacy on bridges the yankees hadnt been able to knock down the us soldiers did hold on to the first couple of lines of trenches but that wasnt enough of an advance to make the battery change site glumlooking yankee prisoners filed back toward the monocacy bridges their hands high in the air once the fighting had eased officers came out to examine the burnedout hulks of the barrels one of them was major clarence potter on his way back to army of northern virginia headquarters he stopped for a couple of minutes at jake featherstons battery im given to understand we have your guns to thank for those two ruined behemoths he said yes sir thats right featherston dropped his voice they wont promote me for it but i did it any way you could have gotten us a barrel in working order not one thats been through the fire potter asked he held up a hand that wont get you promoted either sergeant but it will help our cause sir if those barrels had kept running theyd be visiting you about now not the other way round jake answered we got any more men back of the line sir one more attack and we can push the yankees all the way back where they started from but the intelligence officer shook his head lucky we were able to throw in as much as we did now he was the one who spoke quietly if we dont get more men in arms be they white or black well be reduced to standing on the defensive all along the line and thats no way to win a war black soldiers featherstons lip curled you know they can fight potter said you of all people should know that hed heard about the use to which jake had put perseus and nero yes sir i do know that jake said but ill be damned if i think they ought to get any kind of reward for trying to overthrow the government in the middle of the war thats what giving em guns and giving em the vote would be they stabbed us in the back somebodyanybodydoes that to me ill make him pay some of the faces in his mind when he said that were black some were white and plump and prosperous the faces of soldiers and bureaucrats in the war department in richmond jonathan moss peered down at the battlefield in dismay the advance through ontario toward toronto had been slow and brutally expensive but it had been a continuous advance one enemy defensive line after another had been stormed and overwhelmed now for the first time american troops were in headlong desperate retreat from the air they looked like ants fleeing a small boys shoe that was in effect what they were a handful of bigger shapes moved on the ground grinding through american barbed wire and into the us trenches son of a bitch moss said and the wind blew his words away the limeys and canucks have barrels of their own they looked different from american barrels of which hed seen one or two he flew lower for a better look figuring that the more he could put in his report the better it would be that battalions of american infantrymen were getting much more intimately acquainted with the barrels advancing on them than he could in an aeroplane never once crossed his mind the lower he flew the stranger the enemy barrels looked they were forwardleaning rhomboids with tracks going all the way around the outside of their hulls he wondered why the canucksor was it the limeyshad settled on such a stupid design till he saw a barrel climb almost vertically out of a trench into which it had fallen however odd the setup seemed it had its merits instead of mounting a cannon in the nose like us barrels the ones currently pushing back the american infantry carried two one on each side mounted in sponsons whose designif not the actual pieces of forged iron themselveshad been taken from the secondary armament of warships some of the barrels mounted machine guns in one or both sponsons instead of cannon i wonder whose are better theirs or ours moss said he had no way to tell at the moment american barrels still being thin on the ground and used mostly to spearhead longplanned attacks none was anywhere nearby to challenge the machines the enemy was hurling at the poor bastards down in the trenches moss dove on the barrels machine gun blazing he walked his tracers across one another a third as far as he could tell they did the massive machines no harm he cursed himself for a fool american barrels were armored to hold out enemy machinegun fire whatever you could say about the canadians and the british they werent stupid theyd do unto the usa as theyd been done by themselves he cursed his stupidity for another reason as well the advancing foe loosed a storm of lead at his martin onedecker ground fire had shot him down once already now again he heard the thrumming pop of bullets tearing through canvas clang that bullet hadnt torn through canvasit had hit something metal his eyes flicked over the instrument panel everything looked all right if he was lucky the bullet had ricocheted off the side of the engine block without breaking anything if he wasnt lucky hed find out soon enoughmost likely at the moment he could least afford to that clang though was an urgent reminder that he couldnt afford to linger indefinitely down here he pulled back on the stick the nose of his fighting scout rose as moss gained altitude tom innis made his own firing run on the advancing enemy perhaps profiting from his flightmates experience he didnt try to shoot up the barrels men were always more vulnerable banking toward the american linesor what had been the american lines before the attackmoss watched men in khaki dive for cover he whooped with glee and shook his fist in the slipstream but not all the british and canadians tried to shelter themselves from innis gun they shot back at him as ferociously as they had at moss and a streak of smoke began streaming back from toms engine cowling get out of there moss shouteduselessly of course get out of there while you can he looked around for dud dudley and phil eakertheyd have to shepherd innis back toward the aerodrome hed be a sitting bird if the canadians or british pounced on his crippled bus he swung the onedecker back toward the west the smoke wasnt getting better it was getting worse climb damn you moss yelled to him as if he could hear the more altitude he gained the farther hed be able to glide when his engine quit moss knew all about that the hard way innis had to know it too but the martin didnt get any higher off the deck the only reason for that moss figured was that it couldnt get any higher off the deck and that meant his flightmate was in trouble moss bared his teeth in an anguished grimaceit wasnt just smoke streaming back from the engine now it was flame too the slipstream blowing in moss face made it hard for him to close his mouth again the slipstream also blew the flames back toward tom innis he beat at them with his fist and arm they spread faster than he could knock them down land it moss screamed land it god damn you he wasnt cursing his friend he was cursing fate without a doubt the most dreadful fate any airman could face better to yank out your pistol and put one through your head than go down in a burning crate as far as he was concerned that was especially true if you were going down in a burning crate from say fifteen thousand feet if you were only a couple of hundred feet off the ground when your aeroplane caught fire you had a chance to put it down and get the hell out before you roasted too you had a chance the trouble was every yard of territory here abouts was as cratered as the surface of the moon the usa had had to blast the canucks off the land before advancing through it and then even after having had it taken from them the canadians and the limeys had shelled it to a faretheewell to make sure the americans didnt enjoy owning it with a healthy aeroplane tom innis would have had more choices of course with a healthy aeroplane he wouldnt have needed to land in the first place he did the best he could steering for a meadow that still had some green grass mingled with the brown of earth thrown up from shell blasts come on come on moss whispered his hand trying to move on the joystick as if he were landing his own aeroplane despite smoke and flames and what had to be mortal fear innis got the martin down you didnt need much in the way of ground to kill all the speed and hop out come on moss said again as he buzzed overhead taxi taxi the martin nosed down into a shell hole and flipped over it kept right on burning nobody came out of it nobody was going to come out moss knew that if the fire hadnt killed tom getting the engine and machine gun slammed back into his chest would have done the job infantrymen in greengray ran toward the crash moss and his flightmates kept circling above it some of the infantrymen their faces small pale ovals looked up at them and shook their heads no luck it was over moss felt empty inside as he flew back toward the aerodrome it could have been me echoed in his mind again and again it nearly had been him not so long before what was the difference between the way hed put his damaged aeroplane down and how tom innis had done it luck nothing more you didnt like to think you were alive for no better reason than dumb luck was he an ace by dumb luck too when only three returned where four had set out the mechanics on the ground didnt need a handbook to figure out what had happened what went wrong one of them asked quietly dud dudley was the flight leader that meant he had the delightful job of telling them the surviving fliers went into shelby pruitts tent the squadron commander looked up from his paperwork his mouth twisted dammit he said and then mastering himself all right give me the details dudley did that too when he was through moss spoke of the enemy barrels spreading havoc through the us lines that had seemed the most important news in the world when hed spotted them now he had to flog his memory to come up with details hardshell pruitt took notes he had to be a professional about the business of slaughter too he asked his questions both about innis demise and about the barrels then he said all right boys i dont expect the three of you will be doing any flying tomorrow dont worry about morning roll call either come to that youll be recorded as present dismissed if that wasnt an order to head for the officers club and get smashed it might as well have been moss would have headed there anyway dudley and eaker matched him stride for stride news traveled fast through the aerodrome when the negro behind the bar saw them come in he set a bottle of whiskey a corkscrew and three tumblers on the bar nodded and said not a word it was almost as if he stood at the bedside of a patient whose chances werent good as suited his station as flight leader dud dudley carried the bottle moss picked up the glasses that left the corkscrew for eaker who brought it over to the table as if glad to have something to do dudley used the corkscrew tilted the bottle and poured all the glasses full well heres to tom he said and drained his without taking it from his lips when it was empty he let out a long sigh i always thought the ornery son of a bitch would be doing this for me not the other way round yeah the whiskey burned in moss throat and in his stomach he could feel it climbing to his head he went out the way youd figure if he was ever going to go he wanted to hit the canucks and limeys one more lick thats a fact dudley filled the tumblers again he was a wolf when he drove a bus nothing else but never saw a man who just aimed himself at the enemy and fired himself off like that best straightout aggressive pilot i ever saw moss agreed and luther was the best technical flier i ever saw and theyre both dead and were alive and what the hell does that say about the way the world works its a damn shame eaker said the whiskey was already slurring his speech but he attacked the second glass as singlemindedly as tom had ever shot up a target not fair not fair hed joined the flight as luther carlsens replacement now another set of personal goods would have to be cleared from the tent somebody else new would be sleeping on inniscot theyd have to point tom out in the pictures on the wall and explain what kind of a man hed been it wouldnt be easy any of it god damn the canucks anyhow moss said if theyd just rolled over when the war started we wouldnt be in this mess in the first place thats right eaker said then we could have thrown everything weve got at the goddamn rebs and that would be the war over and done with right there yeah and if the russians hadnt invaded germany when things got started france would have gone down the drain and kaiser bill would have won his war too moss said but instead weve gotthis he waved a hand to encompass this it was the hand holding the glass of whiskey fortunately hed already drunk most of it a little spilled on the table and on his trouser leg but not much he started to pick up the bottle to fill the tumbler once more its empty dud dudley said youre right it is moss stared at it how did it get empty so fast before he could get up and do anything about that the bartender brought over a fresh bottle moss nodded his neck felt loose thats better how did it get empty so fast eaker echoed he sounded even more surprised than moss had as if there werent the slightest connection between his stumbling speech and that poor dead bottle it got empty the same way we did moss said it got empty the same way the whole stupid world did rapidly getting drunk as he was he couldnt tell whether that was foolish maundering or profound philosophy the next day hung over and wishing he was dead he couldnt tell either and the day after that climbing into his onedecker for another flight above the trenches he still didnt know night lay like a cloak over the bonefish ahead one quarter roger kimball called from his perch atop the conning tower ahead one quarteraye aye sir answered ben coulter the helmsman his voice floating up the hatchway to the skipper if we bring this off sir tom brearley breathed kimball made a sharp chopping motion with his right hand cutting off his exec we are going to bring this off he said no ifs ands or buts i dont care how many mines the damnyankees have laid in chesapeake bay i dont care how many shore guns theyve got watching from maryland we are going to pay them a visit if they arent glad to see us too damn bad yes sir brearley said the only thing he could say under the circumstances after a few seconds he went on its a shame the usa pushed down so far toward hampton roads youre right about that kimball said if we were holding onto both sides of the mouth of the bay as tight as we ought tothingsd look a lot better if that was so i tell you there were at the moment any number of ways in which the war could have looked better from the confederate point of view kimball wasted little time worrying about them theyd given him the job of penetrating as far up the chesapeake bay as he could and doing as much damage as he could once he got there and he aimed to follow his orders to the letter softly under his breath he let out a snort as if theyd hand this assignment to ralph briggs sir his executive officer said never mind tom kimball answered woolgathering thats all and maybe theres more to old ralph than i give him credit for anyway hed never expected to see briggs back in the csa till the war ended not when hed had his submersible torpedoed out from under him and been fished out of the drink by the damnyankees who did him in but briggs had managed to break out of the prisonerofwar camp where theyd stowed him and to make it through enemy lines or rather to make it through some country so broken it had no real front line and back into confederate territory if he could run a submarine as well as hed run his own escape he might yet make a captain to be reckoned with tom brearley coughed calling kimballs attention back to the hereandnow sir were passing between smith island and crisfield thank you tom kimball said i guess well have to start paying attention then wont we even in the midnight darkness his grin and brearleys answering one were broad and white the usa had run steelmesh nets from point lookout on the western shore of chesapeake bay over to smith island and then again from the island to crisfield on the bays eastern shore precisely to keep confederate raiders like the bonefish from coming up and making nuisances of themselves in the bays upper reaches they backed up the nets with minefields and patrol boats from everything the confederacy had been able to learn though the damnyankees had concentrated their efforts on the wider stretch of water west of smith island their ruling assumption seemed to have been that nobody was crazy enough to try to run a boat through tangier sound up at the northern end of the sound only a mile or two of water separated the mainland from bloodsworth island the nets would tangle a submersible that dove and the guns would put paid to one that didnt kimball whistled tunelessly between his teeth do i look like a crazy man to you tom he asked no more so than usualsir brearley answered which made kimball laugh out loud best way to run through the nets he said is to take em on the surface and slide through halfway between two buoys he peered through his clandestinely imported german binoculars trying to spot the buoys to which the nets were attached and laughed again this is a trick weve learned from the huns mind its how they slip through the english obstacles in the channel brearley didnt have binoculars but he did have sharp eyes there sir he pointed ahead and to starboard sure enough a buoy bobbed there in the light chop kimball swept the binoculars to port till he found the next buoy supporting the net he grunted in satisfaction wont even have to change course he said and then called down the hatch all ahead full all ahead fullaye aye sir the diesels that powered the bonefish roared as the submarine sped up kimball hoped they didnt roar so loud as to draw the attention of guns and searchlights on the shore or on smith island his lips pulled back from his teeth maybe the yanks werent so far wrong when they figured only a crazy man would try tangier sound through brearley said his voice rising in triumph kimball felt triumphant himself with one set of buoys behind him at his order the diesels throttled back now that he was in the sound the trick he figured was to act as if he owned the place all right weve got the minefield coming up next he said we have to steer along the chain of islands here right close to shore well be in good shape then if the damnyankees hadnt done any minelaying since the csa got their latest reports and if no mines had come loose and drifted into her path the bonefish would be in good shape kimball had to take the channel slowly though to give himself the chance to stop and withdraw if he or a sailor at the bow spotted a spiked sphere bobbing in the sea that meant the submersible hadnt passed the bloodsworth island gap by dawn shall we dive sir and spend the day on the bottom brearley asked that wont be much fun but well do nothing of the sort kimball declared i want you to take down the naval ensign mr brearley and go to the flag locker for a us flag sir the exec said in some alarm going under false colors is technically legal if we run up the true ones before we start to fight kimball said but thats not what i want mr brearley i want you to replace the naval ensign with the national flag and then i intend to go through the channel as if i had every right to do so ill bet you a stonewall the damnyankees see what they expect to see not one thing more he wasnt betting a fivedollar confederate goldpiece he was betting his life and the lives of the boats complement but tom brearley once he got the idea didnt argue any more down came the naval ensign which like the confederate battle flag on land displayed st andrews cross in blue on red both looked as they did for the same reason the csas stars and bars too closely resembled the usas stars and stripes for them to be readily distinguished at any distance normally that confusion was dangerous every once in a while it could be exploited flying the stars and bars the bonefish made for the narrow passage between bloodsworth island and marylands eastern mainland kimball made no effort to avoid being seen on the contrary he sailed along as if he had every right in the world to be where he was field glasses were surely trained on him from the land guns could have been at a moments notice no one fired he crossed the net as he had the one before but with even greater panache this is astonishing sir tom brearley breathed kimball shrugged they see a submersible out in the open they look at the flag they see red white and blue nobodyd be stupid enough to do what were doing and so he looked north toward the mainland he saw a few gun positions close by the shore and there were surely others he didnt see farther inland ones mounting bigger guns the horizon dipped and swooped as he swung the field glasses around to examine bloodsworth island the day was rapidly lightening he could see men in white us uniforms close by the edge of the sea he waved in their direction one of them was peering at him with field glasses too the fellow waved back you know what its like kimball said chuckling its like seducing a woman he thought of anne colleton for a moment warmth tingled through his loins then he returned to the subject at hand you let her see that theres any doubt in your mind about what youre going to do all that happens is you get your face slapped for your trouble but if shes sure youre sure hell her corsets off and her legs are open before she worries about whether its right or wrong or purple yes sir brearley said nothing but reverence in his voice they were past the nets now the sun came up red as fire in the east all the guns that could have turned them to crumpled smoking metal lay silent silent go below tom kimball said following his exec down into the bonefish a moment later he dogged the hatch after him take us down to periscope depth he ordered ben coulter his voice relaxed and easy to the rest of the crew he went on well go down nice and slow no rush about submerging now its going to be like were putting on our show for the damnyankees out therethis is how a submersible dives boys of course ill always love you darling tom brearley said sounding very much like a successful seducer sliding out the door kimball laughed out loud and clapped him on the shoulder youre learning tom youre learning the sailors didnt quite know what their officers were talking about but it sounded dirty that was plenty to get them laughing too the bonefish slid away from the dangerous narrow waters of tangier sound out into chesapeake bay here behind the nets and the minefields everything was clear kimball saw plenty of fishing boats through the periscope but didnt waste fish on them or rise to sink them with gunfire he wanted bigger preyhe hadnt taken these risks for fishermen and he got his reward steaming along came an ocean monitor a bigger version of the river craft the usa and csa both used basically one battleship turret mounted on a raft it couldnt get out of its own way but in these confined waters was deadly dangerous to anything those big guns could reach sneaking up on it was hardly tougher than beating a twoyearold at football the first torpedo perfectly placed just aft of amidships would have been plenty to sink the monitor the second a couple of hundred feet farther up toward the bow made matters quick and certain too easy sir brearley said as the long steel tube echoed with cheers you gonna make us throw her back then kimball demanded no sir the exec answered hell no sir he didnt ask how kimball planned to extricate the bonefish from chesapeake bay now that belatedly the yankees knew she was there he might have done that before but not now he figured kimball would find a way i figure i will too kimball thought getting it in is the tough part once you manage that pulling out afterwards is easy major irving morrell wondered why he in particular had been saddled with two officers from americas allies maybe someone on the general staff back in philadelphia remembered his service there and reckoned he could show visiting firemen how the war was fought on this side of the atlantic and maybe too someone on the general staffcaptain abell came to mind among other candidatesremembered his work there and hoped he would wreck his career once and for all by botching this assignment if abell or someone like him had had that in mind morrell thought he would be disappointed though the german officer belonged to the imperial general staff both he and his austrian counterpart gave every sign of being good combat soldiers they seemed very much at home squatting by a campfire sketching lines in the dirt with a stick to improvise a map im glad both of you understand my german morrell said in that language we all study it at west point of course but ive used it more for reading than speaking since it is not so bad not so bad at all said major eduard dietl the austrian of the duo a dark man thin to scrawniness with an impressive beak of a nose your teacher was a bavarian i would say yes thats so morrell agreed captain steinhart was born in munich here in the united states i feel surrounded by bavarians said the german officer captain heinz guderian he was shorter and squatter than dietl with a round clever face he went on the us uniform is almost the exact color of those the bavarians wear his own tunic and trousers were standard german imperial army fieldgray a close match for dietls pikegray austrian uniform neither differed much in cut from that which morrell wore the german uniform had served as the model for those of the other two leading alliance powers dietl sipped coffee from a tin cup this is such aspacious land he said waving his hand oh i know i think any land spacious after heinz and i crossed the atlantic by submersible but the train ride across the usa and up into canada to reach the front hereamazing he is right guderian agreed west of russia europe has no such vast uncrowded sweeps of territory and these mountains dietl waved again now at the canadian rockies the carpathians are as nothing beside them he spoke with the air of a man accustomed to comparing peaks one to another unsurprising since he wore the edelweiss badge of a mountain soldier himself sighing he went on almost i wish the italians had thrown away their neutrality theyve always wanted to everyone knows it but they never have dared no nerve damn them fighting in the alps would be like this i think fighting is not a sport fighting is for a purpose guderian said seriously the idea would be to break out of the mountains and into venetia and lombardy belowif there were a war of course morrell thought that would be more than austriahungary could manage still fighting the russians and the serbs as she was but he held his peace dietl struck him as a man like himself happiest in the field maybe guderian had worn red stripes on his trousers a little too long and then the german officer said besides you cant conduct a proper pursuit in the mountains get around the enemy and smash him upthats what the whole business is about morrell revised his earlier assessment dietl said the problem of pursuit is the basic problem of this entire war the foe retreats through territory not yet devastated and toward his own railheads while you advance over country that has been fought in and away from your own sources of supply no wonder we measure most advances in meters not kilometers barrels help this problem by making breakthroughs possible once more guderian said barrels help but theyre not enough not by themselves morrell said theyre too slowhow can you have a breakthrough at a slow walk how can you outrun the retreating enemy when youre not running once the barrels force a hole in the enemys defenses we need something faster to go through the hole and create the confusion that really kills guderian smiled some people would say cavalry is the answer some people will say the earth is flat too morrell said he made a quick sketch of a sailing ship falling off the edge the german and austrian observers laughed he went on with machine guns and rifles cavalrys no answer at all we need better machines faster machines i can see why they called you to philadelphia major guderian said you have the mind of a general staff officer you impose yourself on the conditions around you you do not let them impose themselves on you is that what i do morrell said faintly bemused he was a man without strong philosophical bent his chief concern was to hit the enemy as hard as he could and as often as he could until he didnt need to hit him any more someone on the canuck side of the line had the same idea canadian artillery which had been quiet for the previous several days suddenly sprang to life morrell threw himself flat on the ground so did dietl so did guderian he might have spent most of his time in amongst the maps but he knew how to handle himself in the open air too along with the bombardment came a great crackle of rifle fire off to morrells right trained on the british model the canucks made formidable riflemen they were quick and accurate and every shot of theirs counted and by the sound of what was going on over there they had found the weak spot in morrells line hed posted one company rather thinly over a long stretch of woods hed reckoned almost impassable the canadians seemed intent on showing why almost was a word that didnt belong in warplanners dictionaries guderian and dietl were both looking at him all right we have come into the field to observe the american army and to observe this man he could all but hear what they were thinking he now finds himself in difficulty how does he respond runners morrell shouted and the men came over to him some running some crawling along the ground for shells were still dropping thick and fast an american machine gun started banging away there on the right and he let out the briefest sigh of relief that was where hed posted sergeant finkels squad and the canadians would have a devil of a time shifting him if he didnt feel like being shifted and sure enough shouts of dismay said the canuck advance had suddenly run into a roadblock morrell snapped orders half of captain spadingers company to pull out of line and contain the damage the same for the machinegun company from captain halls company the rest of the units not under immediate assault will counterattack aiming to pinch off the neck of the canadian advance i will lead this counterattack personally the runners hurried away morrell smiled gaily at the observers will you join me gentlemen neither of them hesitated running doubledover ignoring his bad leg morrell got to halls company bare moments after the runner hed sent the machinegun men were already on their way off to the east to shoot up any canadians who burst out of those not quite impassable woods dietl and guderian both breathing hard flopped into foxholes captain hall said i dont think well have any trouble holding them sir they cant come too far ich will nicht nur zu morrell snarled in exasperation and switched from german to english i dont want to hold them i want to drive them back to hurt them he pointed northeast if their artillery is alert theyll slaughter us sir hall said i dont think they will be morrell answered theyd better not be theyve got this bombardment laid on to cover an attack whod be cuckoo enough to move forward when theyre putting pressure on us he didnt give the company commander any chance to argue he also didnt give himself any chance to think twice lets go he scrambled to his feet and ran for the canadian lines springfield in his hands his men followed whooping like red indians hed gained them a couple of major advances toward banff by allout audacity they were willing to believe he could buy them one more for close to thirty seconds the canucks left behind in their trenches were too intent on their comrades push to pay much attention to what the americans were doing off to the west that was about fifteen seconds too long before a machine gun started mowing down the oncoming men in greengray they were within grenade range of its position it fell silent more grenades flew into the canadian trenches the americans followed as morrell leaped over the parapet a canadian aimed at him from pointblank range he braced himself for another wound christ not that leg again he thought i dont want to be on crutches or in a wheelchair for the rest of my life blow my brains out and get it over with the canuck fired the bullet went wild for the fellow in khaki had taken a wound of his own in the instant that he pulled the trigger morrell finished him with the bayonet then looked over his shoulder to find major dietl there with a pistol in his hand danke schon he said bitte the austrian answered with such hapsburg formality that morrell expected him to click his heels he didnt he leaped down into the trench instead cleaning it of canadians was the ugly business it always seemed to be dietl held his own at one point though he observed these foes of yours are in greater earnest than the russians and have discipline of a sort the serbs have never imagined the canadians are good soldiers morrell agreed the confederates too come to that having driven the canucks back his men turned their fire on the canadian detachment that had gone ahead caught between two forces some of the canadians went down some threw down their rifles and threw up their hands in surrender and some the hard cases dug in among the pines and firs and spruces to make the americans pay a high price for them morrell paid the price having made the coldblooded judgment that he could afford it when the fighting had died away to occasional rifle shots the americans were still holding the trenches from which the canadian attacking party had jumped off very nicely done captain guderian said you used the enemys aggressiveness against him most astutely coming from an officer of the imperial general staff thats quite a compliment morrell said you have earned it major it will be reflected in my report and mine dietl agreed morrell grinned more pleased with the days work itself than with the praise it had garnered but not despising that either i wonder if favorable action reports from german and austrohungarian observers cancel out the utah fiasco he thought and looked forward to finding out reggie bartlett examined the trench line just outside of duncan sequoyah with something less than awe and enthusiasm lord he said feelingly dont they teach people around here anything about digging in you listen good bartlett said sergeant pete hairston his new squad leader just on account of they gave you a pretty stripe on your sleeve for bustinout othe damnyankeesprisoner camp that dont mean you know everything there is to know where were you fighting before the yankees nabbed you i was on the roanoke front bartlett answered hairstons lanternjawed face the face of a man whod acquired three stripes on his own sleeve more by dint of toughness than any other military virtue changed expression more cautiously he asked how long you put in there from a few weeks after the war started till the yanks got me last fall bartlett said with no small pride anybody whod spent almost a year and a half fighting between the blue ridge mountains and the alleghenies could hold his head high among soldiers the world over hairston knew that too shitfire he muttered all the fighting in sequoyahs nothin but a football game in the park you put it next to the clangin and bangin back there he hadnt bothered asking about reggies previous experience till now after a moments thought he went on but i reckon thats why this here aint like you expected it would be we aint got the niggers to dig all the fancy trenches like i hear tell they got back there and even if we did we aint got the soldiers to put in em i see that bartlett said i surely do it horrified him too though he saw no point in coming out and saying so the sergeant was rightthere werent enough trenches not by his standards a lot of what they called trenches here were only waistdeep too so you might not get shot while you crawled from one foxhole to another then again of course you might there wasnt that much barbed wire out in front of the lines to keep the us troops away either and as hairston had said there werent that many confederate soldiers holding the position such as it was the sergeant might have picked that thought out of reggies mind aint that many damnyankees up here neither he said they put four or five divisions into a big push reckon theyd be in dallas week after next he laughed to show that was a joke or at least part of a joke course they aint got four or five spare divisions layin around with dust on em any moren we do anif they did theyd use em in kentucky or virginia or maryland just like we would this heres the ass end o nowhere for them same as it is for us not quite the ass end of nowhere reggie said liking the sound of the phrase i saw those oil wells when i came up through duncan yeah they count for somethin or the brass reckons they do anyways hairston admitted you ask me though you could touch a match to this whole goddamn state of sequoyah blow it highern hell an i wouldnt miss it one goddamn bit on brief acquaintance with sequoyah bartlett was inclined to agree with the profane sergeant to a virginian these endless hot burning plains were a pretty fair approximation of hell or at least of a greased griddle just before the flapjack batter came down somewhere high up in the sky an aeroplane buzzed reggies head whipped round in alarm for the briefest moment half of him believed he wouldnt see any manmade contraption but the hand of god holding a pitcher of batter the size of richmond hairston said well take you out on patrol tonight start gettin you used to the way things are around here it aint like virginia ill tell you that aint nothin like georgia neither his voice softened reggie hadnt been sure it could he asked that where youre from yeah im off a little farm outside of albany hell the sergeants face clouded over probably nothin left of that no more anyways by what i hear tell them niggers tore that part o the state all to hell and gone when they rose up bastards you think about things it aint so bad not havin that many of em around maybe not reggie had been in the yankee camp all through the red negro uprising the us officers had played it up and the newcaught men had gone on and on about it but it didnt feel real to him it was he supposed like the difference between reading about being in love and being in love yourself hairston stuck his head out of the foxhole and looked around in a way that gave bartlett the cold shivers do that on the roanoke front and some damnyankee sniper would clean your ear out for you with a springfield round but nothing happened here the sergeant finished checking the terrain then squatted back down again yanks are takinit easy same as us all right sarge reggie shook his head i am going to have to get used to doing things different out here he didnt think hed ever get used to exposing any part of his precious body where a yankee could see it when he wasnt actually attacking as promised hairston took him out into nomansland after the sun went down nomansland hereabouts was better than half a mile wide hed counted on a couple of hundred yards of it back in virginia but seldom more than that going on patrol did have some familiar elements to it he and his companions crawled instead of walking and nobody had a cigar or a pipe in his mouth but it was also vastly different from what it had been back in the roanoke valley for one thing some of the prairie and farmland north of duncan hadnt been cratered to a faretheewell for anotherdoesnt stink so bad bartlett said in some surprise you havent got fourteen dead bodies on every foot of ground back in virginia seemed like you couldnt set your hand down without sticking it into a piece of somebody and bringing it back all covered with maggots ive done that said napoleon dibble one of the privates in the squad puked my guts out too i tell you i puked my guts out too the first time bartlett agreed but it wasnt quite agreement not down deep by the way nap dibble talked hed done it once reggie had lost track of how many times hed known that oozy yielding sensation and the sudden stinking rush of corruption that went with it by the time the damnyankees captured him having it happen again hadnt been worth anything more than a mild oath something swooped out of the black sky and came down with a thump and a scrabble only a few yards away hissing an alarm reggie swung his rifle that way to his amazement sergeant hairston laughed at him aint nothin but an owl droppin on a mouse bartlett dont they got no owls up on the roanoke front i dont hardly remember seeing any reggie answered theyve got buzzards and theyve got crows and theyve got rats dont hardly remember seeing micerats ran em out i guess hated those bastards theyd sit up on their haunches and look at you with those beady little black eyes and youd know what theyd been eating and youd know they were figuring theyd eat you next napoleon dibble made a disgusted noise ignoring him bartlett finished the one good thing about when the yankees would throw gas at us was that itd shift the ratsfor a little while gas hairston said thoughtfully havent seen that more than a time or two out here havent missed it any neither and thats a fact you run up against any of those whatdoyoucallemsbarrels no ive just heard about those and seen em on a train after i got out of the yankee camp bartlett answered they hadnt started using them by the time i got captured they have em out here aint seen any yet the sergeant said like i told you this is the ass end of the war those armored cars now ive seen some of those but a trenchll make an armored car say uncle dont like em anyways nap dibble said to which the other members of the squad added emphatic if lowvoiced agreement not too far awayfarther than the owl that had frightened reggie but not all that muchsomething started screaming he froze was it a wounded man a crazy man a woman having a baby right out in the middle of nomansland coyote sergeant hairston explained laconically scares you out of a years growth the first time you hear one dont it lord yes reggie knew his voice was shaky his heart pounded too fast for him to feel more than mildly embarrassed crazy coyotes were something he hadnt had to worry about back on the roanoke front and then from up ahead he heard a noise he did recognize the metallic click of a bayonet against a rock he stiffened and stared around for the nearest shell hole into which to dive the other members of the patrol looked around too but not with the tightlipped intensity they would have shown back in virginia softly pete hairston called that you toohey yeah its me who the hell else is it gonna be a yankee voice came floating out of the night the accent was different from the one ralph briggs had tried to get reggie to learn but it wasnt like anything that had ever been heard in the csa toohey went on your damn artillery dont ease up youre gonna run into a patrol where the sergeant dont feel like doin any business cept shootin you rebs chance we take in this here line o work hairston answered you got what you said you was gonna have sure as hell do something in a jug sloshed suggestively toohey went on what about youse guys several of the men in hairstons squad passed the sergeant their tobacco pouches he went forward by himself and exchanged a few lowvoiced words with the us soldiers when he came back he didnt have the tobacco any more but he was carrying the jug the yanks withdrew they were pretty quiet but not quiet enough to have kept star shells from going up on the roanoke front and machine guns and mortars from chasing them back to their lines things were different out here is that what i think it is there in the jug bartlett asked pointing sure as hell is hairston answered hard to get popskull around these parts all sorts of indians here in sequoyah and they all got chiefs that hate the stuff so what we do is we swap smokes for it with the damnyankees tobacco they got is so bad its a cryin shame napoleon dibble added we got to fight the sons of bitches sure but that dont mean we cant do a swap every now and then when we aint fightin wont change how the war turns out one way or tother he laughed a loud senseless laugh reggie didnt think he was very bright i suppose youre right reggie said slowly but what does lieutenant nicollis that his namethink about it hairston stared at him the whites of the sergeants eyes glittered in the starlight you out of your mind bartlett who the devil you think set this deal up in the first place reggie didnt say anything he couldnt think of anything to say all he could do was try to figure out exactly what they thought the war was all about out here in the west here they come chester martin threw himself into a shelter dug into the forward wall of the trench a split second before the confederate shells started landing the earth shook fragments hissed through the air he sniffed anxiously wondering whether the rebs were throwing gas and he needed to pull his mask on over his head he didnt think so he wasnt the only one in the shelter he was lying on top of specs peterson in a position that would have been a hell of a lot more enjoyable had specs been a perfumed whore instead of a badtempered private who hadnt been anywhere near soap and water any time lately theyve been shellinus like bastards the past couple weeks peterson bawled in his earnot much as sweet nothings went yeah theyoof martins rejoinder was rudely abridged when somebody dove in on top of him making him the squashed meat in a threeman sandwich peterson in the role of the lower piece of bread didnt much care for it either everybody thrashed around till nobody was kneeing anybody too badly at which point two more soldiers came scrambling into the hole in the ground it couldnt hold five men but it did amazing how you can pack these shelters when its a choice between packing em and getting blown to cats meat out there said corporal paul andersen one of the latest arrivals yeah martin said again now what we got to do is we got to synchronize our breathing you know how the officers are always synchronizing their watches when we go over the top if we all breathe in and out at the same time maybe we all really can squeeze in here hell maybe the rebsll drop a big one right on top of us specs peterson said then we wont have to worry about breathing at all no more martin and andersen stuck elbows in him which had the twin virtues of giving them more room and making him shut up martin took advantage of the extra room to draw a deep breath like i was saying before half the division jumped on me i figure the reason the rebs are shelling us so hard is on account of they aint got no barrels theyve moved a hell of a lot of artillery forward to shoot at the ones we got when they come upand to make life miserable for us poor bastards in between times makes sense sarge andersen said wish it didnt but it does a big shell a sixincher or maybe even an eight did land almost on top of the shelter then dirt rained down between the boards holding up the roof some of the boards themselves cracked with noises like rifle shots that sent more dirt spilling down on the soldiers can i claw my way out if i get buried martin wondered even inside the shelter shielded from the worst of the blast he felt his lungs trying to crawl out through his nose get too close to a big one and the blast would kill you without leaving a mark on your body with commendable aplomb andersen picked up where hed left off we came up with the barrels i thought that first morning we were going to win the war then and there but even if the rebs dont have any theyve sure as hell figured out how to fight em same with gas earlier you notice though peterson said the rebs aint makin many attacks these days not like they were doin before we made it over to this side o the roanoke costs us more when we got to go to them instead of the other way round we got what we came for martin said we got the iron mines course we cant use em much because their longrange guns still reach most of em and we got the railroad too course theyve already built new track further east and slid around the part of the valley we took away from em aint it great when were winnin the damn war andersen said that drew a profane chorus from the men stuffed into the shelter with him a few minutes later the confederate barrage abruptly stopped it didnt do anything to ease chester martins mind sometimes the rebs would really stop sometimes theyd stop long enough for people to come out of their shelters and then start up again to catch them in the open and sometimes no matter what specs peterson said theyd send raiders over the top hoping the us soldiers would stay huddled in the bombproofs what to do for this shelter it was his call he was the sergeant here out he shouted they start shelling again we jump back in people spilled out by the way things worked martin was the next to last one to make it out into the trench every muscle in his body twanged with tension if the rebs were going to open up again it would be right aboutnow when the moment passed without fresh incoming shells he breathed a little easier back behind the us lines artillery came to life answering the confederate barrage let the big guns shoot at the big guns paul andersen said long as they leave me alone i dont care and thats the gods truth amen chester looked around the trenches and sighed got us some spadework to do looks like to me high explosive and steel and brass had had their way with the landscape blowing big holes in the trenches knocking down stretches of parapet and parados and incidentally knocking a couple of vital machinegun positions topsyturvy here and there up and down the line wounded men were shoutingsome wounded men were screamingfor stretcherbearers heading toward one of those shouting men martin rounded the corner of a firebay stepped into a traverse and was confronted by a mans leg or that portion of it from about the middle of the shin downward still standing erect foot in shoe the rest of the man nowhere to be seen a little bloodonly a littleran down from the wound to streak the puttee hed seen too much these past nearly two years put a man in a place where he grew acquainted with horror every day and it ceases to be horrible for him it becomes part of the landscape as unremarkable as a dandelion puffball he reached out with his own foot and kicked the fragment of humanity against the traverse wall so no one would stumble over it poor bastard paul andersen said from behind him wonder who he was dont know martin answered whoever he was he never knew what hit him hell of a lot of worse ways to go than that and jesus aint we seen most of em about then by the noise a couple of other men came on the wounded soldier for whom theyd been heading hed found one of those worse ways andersen sighed yeah he said and stood against the wall a few feet away from the severed foot to relieve himself sorry he muttered as he buttoned his fly didnt feel like holding it till i got to the latrine damn shelling probably blew shit all over the place anyway i didnt say anything chester martin told him you got any makings paul im plumb out yeah i got some the corporal passed him his tobacco pouch he rolled a cigarette in a scrap of newspaper pulled out a brass lighter flicked the wheel and got the smoke going ahh thanks he said after a long drag hits the spot he looked around sort of feels the way it does after a big rainstorm you know what i mean peacefullike yeah andersen said again quite unselfconsciously a couple of rifle shots rang out but they were three four hundred yards away nothing to worry about might as well finish taking stock of what they did to us this time all things considered the company had got off lucky only a couple of men had died and most of the wounds were hometowners not the sort where the fellow whod taken them begged you to shoot him and put him out of his anguish and where if you did nobody ever said a word about it to you afterwards martin had seen his share of wounds like that talking with the other soldiers in his squad he said you see one like that its your share for a lifetime and then some yeah specs peterson laughed you want to hear something stupid sarge back before the war started i was thinkin about lettin my beard grow out on account of i couldnt stand the sight of blood when i nicked myself with a razor thats pretty stupid all right martin agreed which made specs glare at him in what might have been mock anger and might have been real he went on you too cheap to pay a barber to do it for you those boys they make damn sure they dont cut you too cheap hell peterson came back where you from sarge toledo martin answered you know that yeah youre right i forgot peterson said all right toledo thats the big city me im off a farm in the western part of nebraska the barber in the little country town he was so drunk all the time its a wonder he never cut anybodys throat and i was ten miles outside of town and we aint never gonna have the money for a flivver so how the hell am i supposed to get a barber to shave me damned if i know martin answered so blood doesnt bother you any more that right specs peterson snorted what do you think martin inspected him he was even filthier than he had been before the dive into the shelter and had unkempt stubble sprouting on cheeks and chin frowning sadly martin said so why the hell havent you shaved any time lately i was going to this morning sarge honest but the rebs started shelling us behind his steelrimmed spectacles peterson raised an eyebrow you may have noticed oh yeah martin snapped his fingers you know i knew something was goin on then but i couldnt quite remember what paul andersen threw a clod of dirt at him in the trenches though it passed for wit the dakota steamed out of pearl harbor standing on deck sam carsten said you know somethin vic this ship puts me in mind of the old joke about the threelegged dog the wonder is she goes at all yeah well i aint gonna argue with you you know what im saying vic crosetti answered scratching his hairy arm ill tell you something else too shes as ugly as a threelegged dog right now yeah sam agreed mournful for a couple of reasons for one thing if hed scratched himself half as hard as crosetti was doing hed have drawn blood from his poor sunburned hide for another the dakota really was ugly these days what shes really like is a guy who took one in the trenches and he ends up with a steel plate in his head got enough steel plates to eat a whole steel dinner off of crosetti said whereupon carsten made as if to pick him up and fling him over the rail bad pun aside though the description was accurate enough not all the damage the dakota had taken in the battle of the three navies was repaired parties were still patching strengthening refurbishing some of the damage wouldnt be fixed probably till the war was over but the battleship could make twenty knots and fight and the japanese and the british hadnt disappeared off the face of the earth ugly or not juryrigged or not she was going back out on patrol i just hope the steering holds us carsten said vic crossetis bushy eyebrows went up and down why the hell do you want that didnt you think it was fun charging the whole damn british fleet all by ourselves nobody else had the balls to try anything like that the other guys they stayed in line like good little boys and girls you want to stand out from the crowd is what you want to do when they shoot you if you stand out its not as bully as it would be otherwise carsten said crosetti laughed then he got busy in a hurry swiping a rag against the nearest stretch of painted metal sam imitated him without conscious thought if somebody near you started working for no obvious reason hed spotted an officer you hadnt commander gradythe fat stripe where a thin one had been before got sewn onto his cuff after the battle of the three naviessaid never mind the playacting carsten he sounded amused as sailors knew the nasty ways in which officers minds worked so officers had some clues about how sailors operated grady went on you come with me ive got some real work for you aye aye sir sam answered as he followed the commander of the starboard secondary armament he knew without turning his head when vic crosetti would put down the rag and light himself a smoke he also knew the little dago would be grinning like a monkey because sam had had to go do something real while he got to stand around a little longer grady said were trying to get the numberfour sponson into good enough shape so we can fire the gun if we have to yes sir carsten said doubtfully the numberfour sponson had taken a hit from somebodys secondary armament whether british or japanese nobody knewnobody had been taking notes and the shell hadnt left a carte de visite except for smashing the sponson to hell and gone that is nobody had come out of there alive thinking about it gave sam the horrors it could have been the numberone sponson easy as not i think they can do it grady said in fact they damn near have done it but the gun mount still isnt quite right and theres not a lot of room in there what with all the other repairs theyve had to make i want somebody familiar with a sponson as its supposed to be to pitch in with some good advice for them yes sir sam said again uh sir so you know capn kidde has forgotten more about sponsons than ill ever know hes still helping with the rebuilding of the numbertwo on the port side that got it worse than this one he suggested you for the duty all right sir carsten answered he didnt know whether kidde was mad at him and wanted to keep him hopping or whether the gunners mate was putting him in a spot where he could shine for the higherups a little of both maybe that was capn kiddes way if he did this right hed look good where looking good could really help him if he fouled up hed pay for it he ducked through the hatchway commander grady didnt follow he had other fish to fry even the bulkhead around the hatchway showed the damage the sponson had taken it was a mass of patches and welds none of them smoothed down or painted over there might be time for that later there hadnt been time for it yet inside the sponson was even more crowded than it had been when the gun crew filled it during the battle of the three navies a bunch of men in dungarees turned their heads to stare at sam one of them said you must be the guy commander grady was talking about yeah im sam carsten loader on the numberone gun this side carsten pointed toward the bow good the fellow in dungarees nodded then you know how one of these damn things goes when its working right he jabbed a thumb at his own chest pleased to meetcha sam by the way im lou stein these here lugs are dave and mordecai and bismarck and steve and cal and frank and herman sam spent the next couple of minutes shaking hands and wondering how the hell he was going to keep the repair crew straight in his head the only one he knew he wouldnt forget was mordecai whod lost a couple of fingers in some kind of accident and whose handshake was strange because of it he couldnt have had any trouble with tools though or they wouldnt have let him do his job at the same time as sam was sizing up the repair crew he was also sizing up the sponson it was even more cramped than it would have been otherwise because theyd welded steel plates inside the inner curve to cover up the damage the entering shell had done they hadnt covered quite all of it above the new steel a dark reddish brown stain still marked the inside of the armor plate carsten tried not to look at it it might easily have come from a loader he shook himself got to get down to business he thought commander grady said you were having some kind of trouble in herei mean besides all this stuff he waved at the roughly welded steel slabs he wouldnt have wanted to serve this gunmight as well put toilet paper between him and enemy gunfire as that thin metal but then again the armor plate over it didnt look to have done the best job of protecting the sailors in here either mordecai said damn gun wont traverse the way its supposed to it gets all herkyjerky about a third of the way through the arc here ill show you he demonstrated sure as hell there was one point at which the fiveinch gun would not hold a target steadily thats pretty peculiar all right carsten agreed acts like theres a kink in the hydraulic line some kind of way dont it thats what we figured too lou stein said but if there is we sure as hell aint been able to find it those things are armored after all they shouldnt kink if i hadnt done all the things i shouldnt do my mama would be a happier lady today sam answered which made the repair crew laugh he went on besides in this mess how the devil can you tell which way is up anyhow he waved his hand the plate on the inner curve of the armor wasnt the only new raw repair not by a long shot it wasnt other rectangular plates of metal covered damage to the roof and to the deck as soon as the words were out of his mouth he wondered if this crew had done all that quick rough work if they had hed just stuck his foot in his face but mordecai said tell me about it why dont you let me go under there and take a look carsten said got a flashlight i can borrow stein wore one on his belt hiram kidde would have wanted one like it it had the size and heft to make a hell of a billy club the door that let sam down below into the mechanism that moved the gun worked stiffly the metal in which it was set had been bent and imperfectly straightened with the door open so he could call to the repair crew above he said run it through there would you they did he shined the flashlight on as much of the hydraulic line as he could see damn doesnt look like anything wrong here thats what we thought mordecai answered youre doing everything exactly the way we did it am i all right stubbornly carsten traced the hydraulic line from the gun back to where it ran behind the steel door through which hed come behind the doorhe whistled tunelessly between his teeth wondering if lou or bismarck or any of them had done it before him he shut the door he whistled again louder a peeledback strip of steel from the shell hit had been pushed between two links of the flexible armor the hydraulic line wore you couldnt see that from above because the hasty repairs to the deck hid it and you might not be able to see it when you came down here either because you literally shut the door on it but when the gun moved to that particular position the line moved and the steel pinched off the flow of hydraulic fluid lucky it never pierced the hose in the armor sam muttered he opened the door again lou you want to come down here and take a look at this ill be a son of a bitch lou stein said when carsten showed him what hed found jeez i wish it had pierced the line then we would have found out what the hell was wrong well we can fix it anyhow a cutting torch made short work of the offending metal mordecai used it with as much assurance as if hed had ten fingers not eight he said sam we get back to pearl everybody on thishere repair crew will buy you a beer this ones been makin us crazy for a while let me tell you look behind the goddamn door what do they call it hiding in plain sight yeah sam chuckled hell any sailor who doesnt want to work knows how to do that he and mordecai grinned at each other whats the matter ma edna semphroch asked lord you ought to be dancing out in the street at how bully things are but youve done nothing but mope the past month she dried a last cup and set it in the cupboard weve got more money than i ever thought id see in all my born days and we havent seen hide nor hair of that awful bill reach since the rebs hauled him off i dont miss him neither he gave me the horrors she shuddered i dont miss him either nellie semphroch answered she was drying silverware and threw a fork into the drawer with unnecessary violence i wish to god id never set eyes on him she waited for edna to start prying again about who reach was who he had been and what hed meant to her shed fended off those questions for months now what edna would learn if she got the true answer would not only make her wilder it would also probably make her despise nellie but for once edna took a different tack tonight she said is mr jacobs across the street all right you aint been over there for a while now and you were going every few days for a long time if edna had noticed that had some alert confederate intelligence officer noticed it too nellie grimaced she wondered if she even cared she dried a teaspoon as far as i know hes fine she answered doing her best to sound unconcerned indifferent edna looked at her out of the corner of her eye were you sweet on him ma she asked in a tone that invited womantowoman confidences is that what it is were you sweet on him and you had a quarrel weve never had a quarrel nellie snapped all pretense of indifference vanishing before she could try to keep it the irony was that she had discovered she was sweet on hal jacobsand he on herbare moments before she discovered he was working for bill reach whom she still loathed with the deep and abiding loathing that clung to every part of her life before shed met ednas father too clever for her own good edna noticed the hot denial at once both for what it said and for what it didnt its all right ma it really is she said tolerantly you know i wouldnt mind if you found somebody pas been dead so long i dont hardly remember him anyways and mr jacobs seems nice enough even if she stopped he seems nice enough even if hes old and not very handsome nellie could read between the lines too she sighed edna wanted license for herself and was consistent enough maybe even generous enough to grant the same license to everyone else even to her mother that nellie might not want it never occurred to her but then she didnt know nellie had had far too much license far too young nellie hoped she would never find out you really ought to make up with him ma edna said i mean she stopped again this time she didnt amend anything she didnt need to amend anything nellie could figure out what she meant youre not getting any younger youre not going to catch anything better maybe i will nellie said with another sigh she hadnt brought hal jacobs any information gleaned at the coffeehouse since she found out to whom hed been giving it one reasonone big reasonthe place flourished as it did was that his connections helped it get food and drink hard to come by in hungry confederateoccupied washington dc if she didnt do anything for him why should he do anything for her ill do this for you and youll pay me off nellie thought how was that different from the sweaty bargains shed made in little narrow rooms back when she was too much younger than edna damned if i know she muttered what did you say ma edna asked nothing the coffeehouse had become so popular with the rebels theyd probably help keep her in supplies if the shoemaker across the street didnt but that felt like an illicit bargain too they hadnt been the kindest nor the gentlest occupiers and a good many of them frequented her place for no better reason than the hope of seducing edna nellie was sure of that too and to make matters worse who could guess how long the confederates were going to hold on to washington if she aligned herself with them now what would the reckoning be when the united states reclaimed their capital she thought that was going to happen and perhaps not in the indefinite future oh the confederates bragged about and made much of what a submersible of theirs had done in the chesapeake bay but was that anything more than a pinprick when you measured it against the hammering us forces were giving the rebs in maryland she didnt think so you ought to go over there ma edna said hes a nice man tomorrow nellie didnt often yield an argument to her daughter but most of their arguments were about what edna was doing not about what she was doing herself she turned off the gaslight in the kitchen its late lets go on up to bed the next morning she did cross the street to mr jacobsshop dirt and gravel had been shoveled into the hole the us bomb made in the street the rebs werent going to be bothered with proper pavement she kicked at the gravel watching the little stones spin away from her shoe she wished she could kick a lot more things it was early she tried the doorknob anyway she wasnt surprised when it turned in her hand hal jacobs didnt sleep late the bell above the door chimed the shoemaker stood behind the counter a hammer in his hand his eyes widened a little beneath bushy eyebrows his smile showed teeth not too bad not too good hello he said and then more warily widow semphroch that he didnt use her christian name said hed noticed how shed not been in lately you can still call me nellie hal she said he nodded good morning nellie he said he coughed a couple of times i was afraid i had offended you the last time you were here afraid hed offended her by kissing her she meant no thats all right she answered as she had with edna she spoke before shed fully figured out what she should have said claiming offense would have given her the perfect excuse for having avoided him now she couldnt use it she found a question of her own what have you heard about bill reach he made a face in prison in a confederate prison as a burglar this had to do with you didnt it she found she didnt like him scowling at her but after a moment he went on but you knew him some time ago is that not true he looked at her with mixed kindness and suspicion i kind of knew him yes you might say so nellie bit her lip she wouldnt have recognized reach now any more than she would have recognized any of the other men shed kind of known but hed recognized her and presumed on oldacquaintance i thought he was just a tramp and i thought but she couldnt say that you thought perhaps he did not want to treat you as a lady should be treated jacobs said nellie nodded grateful for the graceful phrase the cobbler sighed he did have an eye for pretty women i sometimes worried it would get him in trouble i did not think it would get him into this sort of trouble i wish to heaven hed left me alone nellie said which was nothing but the truth why he had to come around after all these years no one is perfect hal jacobs tugged at a stray curl of gray hair that had slid over the top of one ear you really must dislike him very much why do you say that nellie asked in lieu of screaming i hated him i still hate him the same way i hate all the other men who used me and all the men who want to use edna too because if you were not embarrassed to come here for what we did the only other reason you would not come herethe only other reason i can think of anyhowis that you dislike bill reach well yes that probably had something to do with it nellie admitted if bill reach was an angel id think hard about rooting for the devil hal jacobs looked distressed but you must not say this without him the united states would not know half of what weve learned of the doings of the enemy from the atlantic to the mountains without me you wouldnt know half of that stuff nellie returned with no small pride i admit it jacobs said i have been very worried here i he had to break off then because a confederate corporal brought in a marching boot with a broken heel kin i have it this afternoon he drawled weuns is amovin out of here tomorrow ill have it for you sir i promise by two oclock jacobs was no doubt noting the regimental number and state abbreviation the corporal wore on his collar word that that regiment was on the move might well head for philadelphia before this afternoon confirming that the shoemaker waited till the soldier was gone and then said as you see widnellie i have my own sources of information yes i see that she said and i see youre managing to use em without having anything to do with bill reach as far as im concerned you can go right on doing that if he rots in jail i wont shed a tear what did he do to you to make you hate him so jacobs asked nellie set her jaw and said nothing the shoemaker let out a long sad sigh whatever it was he does not deserve these feelings you have about him he kept track of everything sorted it out put pieces of the puzzle togetherif any one man kept the rebs from reaching the delaware and bombarding philadelphia he is the one a few hundred thousand soldiers had something to do with it too i think nellie answered tartly she looked down at the dingy rug on the dingy floor of the shoemakers shop most important thing ive heard in the past week is that the rebs think theyre going to be getting barrelsor maybe plans for barrels im not sure whichfrom england sometime soon i think theyre talking about barrels anyway sometimes they call em tanks instead thats what the english call them jacobs said worth knowing i suppose we should have expected as much he did not sound very surprised or very interested maybe he wasnt maybe he just didnt want her to know how important her information was then he inclined his head in what was almost a bow part of the oldtime courtliness she enjoyed with him i hope you will come in again on such matters and if you wish to come in for other reasons i want you to know i am always glad to see you nellie felt her cheeks grow hot he meant he wanted to kiss her again shed liked it when hed kissed her before she wasnt used to being kissed any more or to enjoying it when she was he might even have meant he wanted to do more than kiss her the idea didnt disgust her as much as she thought it should flustered she said well have to see and hurried out of there as fast as she could go a confederate major stood outside the door to the coffeehouse ah here you are he said tipping his cap i looked inside but i didnt see anyone thats odd nellie opened the door for him the bell jingled merrily please sir come in my daughter should be here she raised her voice edna coming ma edna called from upstairs and came down as fast as anyone could have wanted get the major here his coffee and whatever else he wants nellie said severely if were open for business i want you down here ready to work we lose customers if you arent yes ma im sorry ma edna hurried over to the rebel what can i get for you today sir cup of coffee and a friedegg sandwich the major answered to nellie he added its all right maam dont you worry about it i do worry about it nellie said and its not all right but she let it drop edna had the coffee on the table for the major in jig time and was frying eggs and slicing bread with practiced efficiency the bell jingled again a couple of lieutenants came in one of them leered disgracefully at edna nellie made a point of serving that pair herself breakfast business was slower than usual though after an hour or so had gone by the place was for the moment empty nellie took advantage of that for a trip to the bathroom when she came out edna was setting a cup of coffee in front of lieutenant nicholas h kincaid the big lieutenant nodded to nellie morning maam he said polite as usual good morning she answered coolly she wished he wouldnt come around here he wanted to do more than leer at edna hed made that plain and she young and foolish as she was wanted to let him nellie shook her head that wouldnt happen not if she had anything to do with it suddenly she stiffened she hadnt heard the doorbell ring she should have heard it the bathroom door was thin she usually heard customers come in when she was in there if she hadntif she hadnt edna had been upstairs before and probably kincaid had too did edna look smug she did without a doubt she did she looked like a cat that had fallen into a pitcher of cream and lieutenant kincaidas always his eyes followed edna still that gaze was different now he didnt look as if he wondered and dreamt of what she was like under her clothes he looked as if he knew nellies hands balled into fists edna saw that and laughed silently nellie wanted to throw a cup at her daughter but what could she do she couldnt prove a thing edna had made sure of that all in a rush for the first time in her life nellie felt old arthur mcgregor came in from the fields the sun was at last dipping toward the northwestern horizon hed been up since it rose or a little before manitoba summer days were long he thanked god for that otherwise he wouldnt even have come close to doing all the things he had to do if he wanted to bring in a crop he couldnt do them all not now with the long days he could come close as he walked in julia came out of the barn ive taken care of the livestock pa she said she was thirteen now shooting up fast as a weed tall as her mother or maybe even taller he shook his head in bemusement she wasnt a little girl any more where had the time gone thats good he told her thats very good one more thing i dont have to worry about and ive got plenty i know she answered seriouslyshed always been serious no matter how little mcgregor sometimes thought shed used up all the seriousness in the family so that her sister mary ended up with none julia went on i know i cant do as much as alexander could but im doing all i can i know you are her father told her the whole family was doing all it could in spite of themselves his wide shoulders slumped when the damned americans had arrested alexander hed known at once how big a hole it would leave in the family what hed realized only gradually was how big a hole not having his son left in the daily routine of the farm he made himself straighten you did what you had to do or as much of it as you could possibly do his nostrils twitched whatever mas cooking in there it sure smells good chicken stew julia said mcgregors eyes went to the chopping block between the barn and the house the stains on it were fresh and the hatchet stood at an angle different from the way it had this morning he smiled and nodded at his older daughter good he said sticks to the ribs the inside of the farmhouse as always was spotless immaculate mcgregor wondered how maude managed to keep it that way shed taken on extra work too with alexander gone the weeding in the potato patch for instance was in her hands because no one else had time for it and here came mary a rag in her hand a look of fierce concentration on her face the tip of her tongue peeking out of the corner of her mouth whenever she saw dust on anything she pounced on it like a kitten pouncing on a cricketand looked to be enjoying herself like a kitten too pa she said indignantly you didnt wipe your feet very well im sorry he said and meant it maude would have given him a hard time about that too he went back out and did it better seeing that hed satisfied marywho would have let him know if he hadnthe walked past her into the kitchen his wife looked up from the stew she was stirring you look worn to a nub she said worry in her voice so do you arthur mcgregor answered they smiled at each other wanly he poured water from a pitcher over his hands and splashed some onto his face maude handed him a towel with which to dry himself that was all the washing he did finding time for a bath even once a week wasnt easy supper soon maude said good walking in from the wheatfields mcgregor had thought he was too tired to be hungry the first whiff of stew convinced him otherwise he was ravenous as a wolf and his stomach empty since dinner long long before was growling like one too he sat down in a chair in the front room to wait and pulled out a copy of ivanhoe with which to spend those few minutes the first rest hed had since dinner too the book was old the binding starting to work loose from the pages it had come out here with him from ontario and felt more like a companion than a novel he sighed hed found himself in a world harsher and more merciless than the one sir walter scotts hero knew over the stew maude said biddy knight came by in the buggy this afternoon while you were out working did she mcgregor said i hope there werent any americans on the road to see her not least because hed known biddys son alexander was in the rosenfeld gaol now but biddy had a harder burden than that to bear her boy was dead executed by yankee bullets what did she want social call his wife answered lightlytoo lightly her husband would take it kindly if you dropped in on him one of these days dont know that i want to mcgregor as usual was blunt if the americans know we visit those people it wont do alexander any good maude nodded julia looked angryshed been angry at the americans since the day they invaded for once something got past mary who was playing with the wishbone but mcgregor hadnt been so blunt as he might have been he feared jimmy knights father was cooking up some kind of scheme to hurt the americans and wanted him to be a part of it he didnt aim to join any plots however much he despised the united states and everything they stood for us soldiers could kill his son any time they chose that was a powerful argument in favor of prudence when maude said maybe youre right he just nodded whenever his wife and he saw things the same way they werent likely to be on the wrong track while the womenfolk washed dishes he indulged himself in the luxury of a pipe it wasnt much of a luxury not with the vile us tobacco henry gibbon had to stock these days but it was better than nothing mcgregor sighed for lost virginia and north carolina leaf as he paged through ivanhoe scott made war feel glorious nothing like the squalid reality that had roared past the farm the kitchen went dark kerosene was in short supply these days too no lamp ever burned in an unoccupied room lets go outside then upstairs to bed maude said marys yawn was big as the world mcgregor was the last to use the outhouse by the time he got back in his younger daughter was already snoring saxons he muttered as he pulled off his boots saxons in a country the normans stole from them what are you talking about his wife said but she was puzzled for only a moment oh thats right youve been reading ivanhoe again he nodded and undid his overalls they were old and hardly blue at all any more the fabric softened by many washings conformed perfectly to the shape of his body living in a land that had been theirs and then somebody took it away how did they stand it how could they maude sighed youre going to break your heart arthur if you dwell on things you cant do anything about getting alexander home we can do something about that maybe we can i pray to god every night we can but getting canada back thats too big for the likes of us it shouldnt be he declared but half of thatmore than halfwas sir walter scott speaking through him and he was wise enough to understand as much if he hadnt been maude would have nailed it down tight if you dont think so why didnt you want to go see poor jimmy knights father sounds like hes going to try to do something stupid he finished for her she nodded he hadnt meant it for a joke and she hadnt taken it for one she blew out the lamp plunging the bedroom into blackness no moon not tonight and no town close by either sometimes when all the guns up at the front were going at once that glow would flicker on the horizon the northern lights of death but the guns were quiet tonight too or as quiet as they ever got still in his union suit mcgregor slid under the covers afterwards he didnt know whether he first reached for maude or she for him after being married so long after working so hard every day desire was a flame that guttered and sometimes guttered low but it had never quite gone out and like any guttering flame sometimes flared high too neither one of them undressed they were almost as formal with each other as they would have been with strangers he kissed her carefully knowing he hadnt had time to shave in the past couple of days knowing also he would rasp her face raw if he wasnt careful his hand closed on her breast through the cotton nightshirt she wore she sighed he squeezed her nipple it stiffened against the soft fabric he did the same with her other breast they were still firm after nursing three childrenand in any case in the darkness she was always a bride and he a bridegroom ever so glad to be out of his uncomfortable fancy suit and the top hat hed never had on a day of his life before or since he reached under the hem of the long nightshirt her legs slid apart for him his hands were hard with endless labor and sheshe was softer there than anywhere else of themselves her legs drifted wider when her breath began to come short and quick he stopped what he was doing and unbuttoned the union suit with fingers clumsy not only from work but from desire he poised himself above her the mattress rocked ever so slightly she was nodding urging him to hurry something she would never have done with words she gasped when he entered her and soon shuddered beneath him he went on intent on what he was doingand also too tired to be able to do it quickly she began to gasp again her arms tightened around his back her hips moving no matter how unladylike motion at such times was she let out a small involuntary moan at about the same time joyous fire poured through him he rolled off her almost at once and set his underwear to rights good night she said turning onto her side to get ready to sleep good night he answered they always said that he kept wondering if there shouldnt be something more but if there was more their bodies had said it for a little while he hadnt thought about anything not even alexander but making love didnt make trouble go away it just shoved the trouble to one side he brooded but not for long sleep shoved trouble to one side too in the morning though the sun would rise the trouble would still be there george enos slapped at a mosquito he killed ithe squashed it flat smearing red guts across his forearm that means its bitten somebody wayne pitchess said thats blood in there of course its bitten somebody for gods sake enos rolled his eyes you think i squashed it because it was throwing pillows at me the punishment lay at anchor a few miles beyond clarksville tennessee george didnt like lying at anchor he looked to the south to the hills below which the cumberland flowed somewhere out there the rebs were liable to have a gun waiting to start throwing shells at the river monitor and a moving target was harder to hit than a stationary one what worried him more than anything else was that monitors regularly tied up here so regularly that the localsthe colored locals anyhowhad run up a couple of shanties by the riverside to cater to yankee sailors needsor their desires anyhow if you were off duty and if your commanding officer was in a good mood you could row over to the shanties eat fried chicken or roast pork drink some horrible homemade rotgut that tasted as if it should have gone into a kerosene lamp instead of a human being or get your ashes hauled in the crib next door george had eaten the food which was pretty good hed drunk the whiskey and awakened the next morning with a head that felt like the punishments boiler at forced draft he hadnt laid his money down for any of the colored women not yet the sailors who had gone into the shabby little makeshift whorehouse came out with stories of how ugly the girls were that hadnt stopped a lot of them from going back that was another reason he wished the punishment would go upstream or down he didnt want to be unfaithful to sylvia or the top part of his mind didnt but hed been away from her and without a woman for a long time now if he went over to one of those shacks for some pork ribs and had himself a glass or two of that godawful bad whiskey maybe he wouldnt care how ugly the whores were supposed to be or how much he missed sylvia sometimes you just wanted to do it so badly you he found himself fondling the curve of the water jacket on his machine gun as if it were sylvias breastor for that matter the breast of one of the colored women in that shack he jerked his hand away from the greengray painted iron as if it had become redhot or as if everyone on the monitor could see what was on his mind he went back to work stripping and cleaning the machine gun with the same dogged persistence he might have shown trawling for haddock in the north atlantic he wished he were trawling for haddock in the north atlantic or would have wished it had the ocean not been full of warships and commerce raiders and submarines all of which looked on a fishing boat as a tasty snack and keeping the machine gun in perfect order didnt only distract him from thoughts of sylvia though when he thought on how hed rubbed the cooling jacket it hadnt distracted him much had it it also made his coming through a fight alive more likely he approved of that but as the sun began to slide down the sky in the afternoon three men made for one of the punishments boats to improve their outlook on life one of them called to george come on have a few with us the deck officer was standing close by moltke donovan was a freshfaced lieutenant who took his duties very seriously one of those duties was keeping his men in top fighting trim and that meant every now and then letting them go off on a toot lieutenant kelly would probably have said no his replacement smiled and said go ahead enos that machine guns in better shape than when they tore it out of its crate yes sir george said if not happily then without sackcloth and ashes too he set down the rag stuck the little screwdriver into a loop on his belt and hurried for the boat as he clambered in one of the other sailors said i know you got money in your pocket on account of you were lucky last night lucky hell enos said indignantly that was skill grover nothing else but skill my foot grover retorted anybody who draws three cards and comes out holding a flush shouldnt play poker with honest people you ought to go looking for wallets instead said in a different tone of voice that would have been an invitation to brawl as things were it was only rueful mourning over lost cash george said well all right maybe i was lucky laughing they rowed across the cumberland to the waiting shacks they tied up the boat at a bush by the edge of the river there being no other wharf till the war this hadnt been a place where anyone stopped but it was a place where people stopped now george smelled ribs cooking in some kind of spicy sauce he hadnt known he was hungry but he knew it now he scrambled out onto the mud of the riverbank and hurried toward the shack good day to you gentlemens said the colored fellow who ran the place his name was othello he grinned showing white teeth all the whiter for being set in a black black face got me some barbecue cookin best you gwine find this side o the kentucky smoke house he spoke as if that were some kind of touchstone maybe it was but it didnt touch george still he said all i know about kentucky is that were on this side of it and all i know about that meat is that it smells better than anything that ever came out of the galley to that grover and the other two sailorsalbert and stanleyadded loud profane agreement othello grinned again and served up great slabs of sizzlinghot meat barbecue wasnt something enos had known back in boston but he thought it was something he could get used to othello had rags for napkins and sometimes eked out his mismatched battered china with box lids none of that mattered this pig died happy george declared and again no one argued with him you boys want somethin to wash that there down othello asked looking sly cumberland water wasnt so bad next to the water of the mississippi cumberland water was pretty damn fine but the jars the cook displayed though theyd come out of the cumberland and were dripping to prove it hadnt been in there to fill with water only to keep cool grover shook his head god only knows why we drink that panther sweat he said i could get the same feeling hittin myself in the head with a hammer six or eight times and itd be cheaper taste better too stanley said but when othello set a jar on the rickety table around which the sailors sat nobody asked him to take it away nobody threw the cups and mugs he gave them at him either they paid him poured the deadlypale whiskey and drank it down jesus george wheezed when he could speak again another mug of that he thought and he was liable to know jesus face to faceand in the mood hed be in hed probably want to wrestle he drank the second mug jesus didnt appear and he didnt die tomorrow morning he might want to but not now a colored woman walked into the shack all she wore was a thin cotton shift when she was standing between anybody looking at her and a source of light the shape of her body was easy to make out boys she said if you done spent all your money here my friends and me we is gonna be powerful disappointed in yall othello laughed george didnt know whether he got a rakeoff from the whores whod set up shop next door but that laugh made him think so mehitabel i left em with somethin he said you kin git yo share he made no bones about being there for any other reason than skinning the men from the punishment or any other us river monitors that came by and if the confederate navy made it back to this stretch of the cumberland hed skin them too mehitabel placed herself so she was displayed to best advantage george wished he hadnt let that second mug of whiskey char its way to his stomach he wasnt thinking about sylvia now any more than a stallion thought of anything when you put him in with a mare in season he got up from the table the other sailors shouted bawdy advice rolling her big hips the whore led him out of one shack toward the other in broad daylight she might as well not have been wearing that shift she sure as hell wasnt wearing anything underneath it georges heart drummed in his chest his breath whistled in his throat that was what he thought at first with rotgut half stunning his senses but he knew the sound of incoming shells in his gut not just in his head which wasnt working very well right then he threw himself flatnot on top of the whore but to the ground the roar of the explosions stunned him mehitabel screamed like a cat with its tail in a door dirt flew as shells smashed into the soft ground south of the cumberland great columns of water leaped from shells landing in the cumberland and to georges horror two enormous columns of smoke and flame sprang from the punishment as one shell struck her near the stern the other square amidships more shells walked across the cumberland toward him some of the water they kicked up splashed down onto him and onto mehitabel plastering the thin shift to her rounded contours enos didnt care about that he didnt care about anything except approaching death and the fate of his crewmates the shells stopped falling before they reached the north bank of the cumberland he looked out toward the punishment the river monitor was burning and sinking fast a moment later as flame reached the magazines it stopped burning and exploded mehitabels mouth was open as wide as it would go which meant she had to be screaming but george couldnt hear a thing the heat of the fireball scorched his face when at last it faded twenty feet or so of the bow of the punishment stuck up out of the river like a tombstone the rest of the monitor was gone a couple of bodies and a few pieces of bodies floated in the water food for the snappers stanley and albert and grover came out of the shack where theyd been drinking they looked as bad as enos felt he suddenly realized he wasnt drunk any more horror and terror had scorched the whiskey out of him he also realized looking at his crewmates that they were the only four yankee sailors in hostile country and that none of them carried anything more lethal than a belt knife absurdly he wished he hadnt wasted so much time on that machine gun when all it turned out to be good for was getting blown up get into bed this minute do you hear me sylvia enos snapped at george jr punctuating her words with a whack on his fanny as nothing else would have that convinced him she meant what she said good night mama he exclaimed and planted a large wet kiss on her cheek he hurried off into the bedroom humming an artillery march sylvia looked down at the palm of her hand it still stung which meant his behind had to sting too he hadnt even noticed except that the swat had reminded him of what he needed to do she stared after him was she raising a little boy or training a horse mary jane had peacefully gone to bed an hour before by the haggard look on brigid conevals face when sylvia had picked up her children the reason mary jane was peaceful in the evening was that shed raised hell all afternoon and worn herself out doing it it wasnt even nine oclock yet an hour to myself sylvia thought i can read a book i can write a letter i can just sit here and think about how tired i am that last sounded particularly good to her shed sat for about five minutes when someone knocked on the door that should have been the signal for george jr to come bounding out of the bedroom demanding to know what was going on but he didnt only soft steady breathing came from there not a little boy well hed been raising hell all afternoon too he must have run down as soon as his head hit the pillow sylvia laughed to herself as she walked to the door try as she would she had the devil of a time getting any peace and quiet here was somebody wanting to borrow some molasses or salt or to tell her the latest scandal of the apartment house or to give her some cookies ora little community in its own right the building was a busy place she opened the door standing there was no one she knew but a youngster a year too young to do a proper job of raising the downy fuzzy excuse for a mustache he had on his upper lip he wore a green uniform darker than the army greengray with brass buttons stamped wu mrs enos he said and at her automatic nod went on telegram for you maam numbly she accepted the envelope numbly she signed for it numbly she closed the door as the delivery boy hurried away and numbly she opened the envelope with shaking fingers it was as shed feared from the navy department regret to inform you she read and a low moan came from her throat that your husband able seaman george enos is listed as missing in explosion of uss punishment no further information available at this time you will be informed directly should he be found or confirmed lost the printed signature was that of the secretary of the navy she stared at the telegram till the words were only shapes on paper shapes without meaning without sense but it did not help the meaning had already been imparted and lay inside her mind like an icy spear piercing and freezing everything it touched she crumpled the flimsy yellow sheet of paper she felt crumpled used and used up and thrown away by something bigger than herself something bigger than the whole country something eating the world it was blind and sloppy and it would not stop until it had its fill her body knew what to do her mind did not fight it when it set the alarm on the clock by the bed undressed itself and lay down it tried to make itself go to sleep too it knew how tired it was but her mind had something to say about that and said it loud and emphatically she lay and lay and lay mind spinning useless like a trolley wheel on an icy track convinced she would not sleep at all she closed her eyes to look at the darkness inside her eyelids instead of the different darkness of the ceiling she tried to guess when it was four when five when six and time to rise she jerked in horror when the alarm went off she had fallen asleep after all she wished shed had a moments forgetfulness on first getting up but no she knew as she had after the telegram arrived she let her body do what needed doing and roused her children fed them breakfast and took them over to brigid conevals apartment almost without conscious thought are you all right dearie mrs coneval asked her husband was in the army you look a bit peaked you do itsnothing sylvia said she kissed her children and left for work brigid coneval stared after her shaking her head mechanically sylvia boarded the trolley mechanically she rode to the right stop mechanically she got off mechanically she punched in and mechanically she headed for her machine the mechanism broke when she saw isabella antonelli or rather when her friend saw her sylvia isabella exclaimed recognizing the dazed haggard face staring at her for what it was your husband your giorgio is he missing sylvia forced the word out through numb lips i gotthe telegramlast night she started to cry she should have been working already im sorry but she dissolved again isabella antonelli came over and wrapped her arms around sylvia as sylvia might have done for mary jane had her little daughter broken a favorite doll oh my friend isabella said i am so sorry he is gone missing sylvia said the telegram said missing i will pray for you isabella answered she said nothing more than that missing was a forlorn hope and one all too likely to sink on the sea of truth she knew that sylvia knew it too she would not have admitted knowing it not if her own life depended on that admission mr winter came limping along to see that the day shifts run was beginning as it should when he saw the two women huddled together between their machines he hurried over to them here whats this he asked his voice not angry but not calm either for him the line came first everything else afterwards whats going on sylvia tried to answer and could not calmlywith the sort of calm that comes from having experienced too much rather than not enoughisabella antonelli spoke for her her husband he is missing she hears last night from the department of wars sylvia didnt bother correcting her oh i am sorry to hear that the foreman said and sounded as if he was telling if not the whole truth then at least most of it he studied sylvia do you want to go home mrs enos no sylvia answered quickly if she went home they would find a substitute for her and they might keep the substitute too but that was not the only reason she spoke as she did id rather be here as a matter of fact it will help me take my mind off off she didnt go on going on would have meant thinking about what she most wanted not to think about mr winter gnawed at his mustache i dunno he said but isabella antonelli gave him such a reproachful look that he softened all right mrs enos well see how it goes had he not been interested in sylvias friend as something more than an employee he might have decided differently sylvia noted that enough to be amused by it and then got angry at herself for letting anything amuse her she went to her machine and began pulling levers she hoped desperately to fall into the routine that sometimes overtook her so that half the day would go by without her consciously noticing it to her disappointment it didnt happen her body did what it had to do pulling her three levers loading labels filling the paste reservoir and her mind ran round and round and round like a pet squirrel in a wheel when she went home she said nothing to brigid coneval the irishwomans green eyes glowed with curiosity though surely the whole floor and probably the whole apartment building knew by now that shed got a telegram in the night but explaining to mrs coneval would have meant explaining to george jr who like any little pitcher had enormous ears she sometimes marveled that he could hear anything what with all the noise he made but here he did george is only missing sylvia told herself fiercely i dont have to say anything till i know for certain time enough then she did her best not to let her demeanor show either of her children anything was wrong that she was even more tired than usual from having slept so badly the night before probably helped rather than hurt her cause the evening passed quietly not too far from normal four days went by like that sympathy replaced curiosity in brigid conevals face its a brave front you put up mrs enos she said having drawn her own conclusions when sylvia only shrugged mrs coneval nodded as if shed received all the answer she needed sylvias mood veered from despair to fury with many stops in between shed expected a second telegram hard on the heels of the first either letting her know george was well ormore likely she fearedvery much the reverse either way she would have known how to respond she couldnt respond to nothing though it left her adrift on a chartless sea her work was not all it might have been mr winter proved more forbearing than shed expected youre doing the best you can mrs enos i can see that he told her was he saying that because he was a veteran himself and a widower too and so knew what suffering was like or because he had an ulterior motive if george really was lost with no way to be sure she cautiously gave him the benefit of the doubt another four days went by sometimes life seemed almost normal sometimes sylvia thought she was losing her mind sometimes she hoped she would press step press step press go back to the beginning and begin the cycle anewshe had succeeded in immersing herself in the rhythm of her machine when another western union delivery boy interrupted her mrs enos he said holding out a yellow envelope they told me at your apartment house where you was at maam she signed the sheet he had on his clipboard he got out of there in a hurrytelegraph delivery boys were not welcome visitors not in wartime cans began to stack up as sylvia pulled none of her three levers she opened the envelope yes from the navy departmentwho else isabella antonelli came hurrying over to her she didnt notice again she was reading my pleasant duty to inform you your husband able seaman george enos confirmed as uninjured survivor of loss of monitor uss punishment to be reassigned leave possible she read but did not notice the secretary of the navys name god hears my prayers said isabella who had been looking over her shoulder good heavens sylvia exclaimed the line all at once life stretched out ahead of her again small things mattered waving the telegram like a banner she hurried back to deal with all the cans that had stacked up mr winter never said a thing this west texas country would be wonderful terrain for tanks stinky salley said several of the confederate soldiers gathered around the campfire looked at him you mean barrels dont you jefferson pinkard said at last i prefer to use the name our allies have given them salley said loftily with his usual fussy precision let the damnyankees call them what they will oh give it up stinky pinkard said everybodys calling the damn things barrels us and the yanks both that does not make it proper salley returned any more than it is proper to call me stinky rather than my given name proves my point doesnt it jeff said and got a laugh from his squadmates stinky salley glared but he spent a lot of time glaring it would be good country for barrels except only for one thing hip rodriguez said holding one finger up in the air what the devil do you know about it you damn greaser salley said with a snort its perfect country for tanks he kept on using his word regardless of what anyone else did waving a hand he continued its flat its wide openits ideal rodriguez looked at him expressionlessly i gonna tell you two things he said in his uncertain english as he had before he held up one finger it aint no perfect country for barrels on account of aint no train stations close to here nowhere barrel got to run by itself barrel breaks down everything ive heard about them damn things hes right sergeant albert cross said bastards break down if you look at em sideways gracias with considerable dignity the sonoran soldier inclined his head to the noncom then he undid his bayonet from his sheath and made as if to clean his nails with it looking straight into salleys face he went on i tell you the second thing now you call me a damn greaser again i cut your fucking throat his voice was flat and emotionlessnot so much a threat as a simple statement of how the world would be salleys pale eyes went wide his mouth formed a startled o he turned to cross sergeant did you hear that i heard it the noncom answered i heard you too if i was you id watch the way i ran my big mouth he noisily sipped coffee from his tin cup salley stared at hip rodriguez as if hed never seen him before maybe he hadnt not really sonorans and chihuahuans and cubanscubans without black blood in them anyhowhad a curious place in the csa better off than negroes but not really part of the larger society either cut off from it by swarthiness language and religion but a sonoran with a weapon in his hand was not something to take lightly stinky salley kept quiet after thathe made a point of keeping quiet after that instead of making cornmeal into little loaves rodriguez wet his share and shaped it into patties he fried in lard and wrapped around his tinned rations pinkard and a couple of other soldiers in the squad were doing that too beans and beef went down easier and tastier pinkard took a bite out of histortilla hip called a cornmeal pattythen said in a low voice you shut him up sharp rodriguez shrugged if you step on a scorpion when he is small he dont get no bigger yeah jeffs eyes slid to stinky salley the exclerk still didnt look as if he knew what had hit him that pinkard thought wasnt so good stinkyd done well enough against us soldiers out at a distance but when rodriguez delivered his warning hed folded up in a way it was just stinkys problem but in another way it warned of a weakness in the squad and that was everybodys problem off in the distance a rifle barked pinkards head came up as a watchdogs would do at the sound of someone walking past his house another shot followed also a long way off then silence he relaxed rodriguez swigged from his canteen and wiped his mouth on his sleeve hed already put the bayonet away having made his point with it you know what he said to pinkard i miss my esposa how you say esposa jeff my woman my your wife pinkard said si my wife rodriguez pronounced the word with care i go to sleep in the night i see my wife in a sueno not knowing or not caring that wasnt english he went on when i wake up all i see is soldados feosugly soldiers sueno was something like dream jeff realized hip rodriguez sighed i do better i stay to sleep he glanced over toward pinkard you got a wife yes jeff yeah i wish i was home with her too pinkard was amazed at how little hed thought of emily since he got his notice from the conscription bureau and reported for duty now that she flooded into his mind he understood why hed done his best to block the memoriesthey hurt too much when set alongside the squalid reality of the life he was living fleas and lice and fear and mutilation and stinks andhe turned away from the campfire a scowl on his face if he werent here if he hadnt got that damned buffcolored envelope he could have been in emilys arms right now making the bedsprings creak her breath warm and moist on the skin of his neck her voice urging him on to things he hadnt imagined he could do or else rising to a cry of joy that must have made bedford cunningham and all his other neighbors jealous dear god she loved to do it courteous as a cat more courteous than most curious confederates would have been hip rodriguez left him alone with his thoughts for a few seconds jeff was glad of that and then all at once he wasnt back before the government put him in butternut and stuck a rifle in his hands hed matched emily stroke for stroke given her everything shed wanted in the way of loving now he wasnt there any more shed grown used to making love all the time would she be looking for a substitute he shivered regardless of how hot and muggy the evening was in his imagination he could see her thrashing on the bed withwhom the face on the male form riding her didnt matter it wasnt his own that was enough and bad enough his fists bunched this is all moonshine he told himself fiercely hed never had any reason to believe emily would want to be unfaithful to him if ever two people loved each other emily and he were those two but hed never been away from her before and she didnt just love him she loved love and he knew it moonshine dammit moonshine when he hadnt said anything for some little while rodriguez quietly asked you are lonely amigo you bet i am pinkard said aint you i am lonely for my esposa my wife i am lonely for my farm i am lonely for my village where i go to drink in the cantina i am lonely for my proper food i am lonely for my lengua where i can talk and i dont got to think before i say every word i am lonely for not being nowhere near these yanquis who try of killing me si i am lonely jeff hadnt thought of it like that even though the filthy picture in his imagination wouldnt go away he said sounds like i got it easy next to you maybe life is hard rodriguez shrugged and after life is done then you die he shrugged again what can anyone do it was a good question it was when pinkard thought about it a very good question if there were any better questions out there he had no idea what they might be you do the best you can is all he answered slowly and then looked around at the hole in the ground in the middle of nowhere he was currently inhabiting if this here is the best i can do i been doin somethin wrong up till now i also think this very thing rodriguez said with a smile then i think what they do to my compadres who do not come into the army when it is their time beside that this is muy bueno yeah you try and dodge conscription they land on you with both feet pinkard yawned exhaustion was landing on him with both feet he spread his blanket under himtoo hot to roll himself in itand smeared his face and hands with camphorsmelling goo that was supposed to hold the mosquitoes and other bugs at bay as far as he could see it didnt do much good but he was happier with it in his nostrils than with what he smelled like after god only knew how long since his last bath the next morning captain connolly got the company moving before sunup the promised drive on lubbock hadnt happened nobody was saying much about that but nobody was very happy with it either trying to build a front to keep the damnyankees from moving deeper into texas wasnt the same as throwing them out of the state when they had no business there what can anyone do hip rodriguezs question echoed in jeffs mind so did his own answer you do the best you can is all if the best the csa could do was keep the usa from pushing deeper into texas the war wasnt going the way everybodyd figured it would when it started the yankees were extending their line northward too texas jeff thought wearily as he tramped through it had nothing but room the invaders kept hoping they could get around the confederates flank and the job for the boys in butternut was convincing them they couldnt a brisk little fire fight developed both sides banging away at each other from little foxholes they scraped into the hard earth as soon as the bullets started flying neither us nor cs forces were there in any great numbers it was almost like a game though nobody wanted to be removed from the board hold em boys captain connolly yelled helps on the way firing at a muzzle flash jeff figured the yankees commander was probably shouting the same thing one of them would prove a liar after a moment jeff realized they both might prove liars but captain connolly had the right of it a battery of threeinch howitzers came galloping up behind the thin confederate line and started hurling shrapnel shells at the equally thin yankee line the us soldiers without artillery of their own and not dug in to withstand a bombardment sullenly drew back across the prairie the confederates advancednot too far not too fast lest they run into more than they could handle we licked em jeff said and hip rodriguez nodded pinkard took off his helmet to scratch his head victory was supposed to be glorious he didnt feel anything like glory he was alive and nobodyd shot him he fumbled for tobacco and a scrap of paper in which to wrap it right now alive and unshot would do barracks swelled tucson new mexico far beyond its natural size in one of those barracks sergeant gordon mcsweeney sat on a cot wishing he were someplace anyplace else i want to get back to the field he murmured more than half to himself ben carlton heard him mcsweeney outranked carlton but as cook the latter enjoyed a certain amount of license an ordinary private soldier even a veteran would not have had rather be here than that damn baja california desert he declared and you can take that to church mcsweeney shook his head he was big and tall and fair with muscles like rocks a chin and cheekbones that might have been hewn from granite and pale eyes that looked through a man not at him he said a soldiers purpose is fighting if i am not fighting i am not fulfilling my appointed purpose in life if he did not do that his infinitely stern infinitely just god would surely punish him for it in the days to come carlton would not be silenced to hell with my appointed purpose if the damn fool who appointed me to it gets his brains out o the latrine bucket sendin us down there with no support or nothin that was murder and thats all it was he stuck out his own chin which was nowhere near so granitic as mcsweeneys go ahead and tell me im wrong i dare you from most men to most men that would have been an invitation to fight gordon mcsweeney reserved his wrath for the men on the other side a fact for which his mates had had a good many occasions to be thankful god predestined our failure for reasons of his own he said now ben carlton looked as if he had bitten into something that tasted badsomething he cooked himself then mcsweeney thought damn me to hell if i can see how gods will had anything to do with poor paul bleedin to death like a stuck pig way the devil out in the middle of the desert carlton said mcsweeneys gaze fixed on him as if over the sights of a springfield god will surely damn you to hell if you take his name in vain his expression softened ever so slightly paul mantarakis as i saw was a brave man for all that he was a papist he werent no catholic carlton said he was whatever greeks areorthosomething he called it he carried with him a rosary of beads which condemns him of itself a pity i admit for he was a man of spirit mcsweeney spoke with the assurance of one who knew himself to be a member of the elect and thus assured salvation carlton gave it up theres worse men than paul as are still breathing in and out he said such is gods will mcsweeney answered only a fool and a blasphemous fool at that would question it be assured the unjust shall have their requital he got left alone after that which suited him well enough even in the crowded trenches of western kentucky he had been left alone a good deal he knew why a man of fixed purpose naturally confounded the greater number who had none but drifted through life like floating leaves going wherever the current chanced to take them god anchored him and anchored him firm that he used the time to make sure his flamethrower was in good working order also helped ensure his privacy few in the company seemed eager to associate either in the field or away from the fighting with anyone who carried such horror on his back in the field the enemy made flamethrower operators special targets so mcsweeney could see the sense in staying away from him even if it filled him with scorn back here he shrugged if the men gave in to superstition how could he stop them after evening mess call the soldiers gossiped and smoked and gambled till lights out mcsweeney read the book of kings an island of rectitude in the sea of sin all around then one of the men in his squad shouted goddammit after losing a poker hand he thought he should have won thou shalt not take the name of the lord in vain hansen mcsweeney said glancing up from the small type of the bible yes sergeant sorry sergeant private ulysses hansen said hastily he was not the smallest nor the weakest nor the least spirited man in the regiment but his sergeant not only outranked him but also intimidated him he kept his language circumspect thereafter in the morning mcsweeney inspected the persons and kits of his squad with his usual meticulous care when hed reported to captain schneider the infractions hed found the company commander raised an eyebrow and said sergeant cant you learn to let some of that go you gig men for things that arent worth noticing sir they are against regulations mcsweeney answered stiffly i understand that sergeant but schneider looked exasperated for the life of him gordon mcsweeney could not understand why he stood at stolid attention not showing his perplexity schneider was a brave soldier and not altogether ungodly he might perhaps have been numbered among the elect after a pause to marshal his thoughts he went on a smudged button or a speck of dust on a collar wont cost us the war these are real soldiers remember not west point cadets sir i did not invent the infractions mcsweeney said all i did was note them and report them to you youd need a magnifying glass to note some of them schneider said mcsweeney shook his head no sir only my eyes schneider looked unhappier still could you stand the kind of inspection youre giving your men sir i hope so mcsweeney answered if i fail i deserve whatever punishment you care to inflict on me now the captain shook his head you dont get it sergeant i dont want to punish you for small things i dont want you making your men hate you so much they wont follow you either sir they will follow me mcsweeney spoke with a calm absolute confidence whatever else they may feel about me theyre afraid of me i dont doubt that captain schneider muttered perhaps more to himself than to mcsweeney but he shook his head again that wont do im afraid a us noncom or officer whose men hate him or fear him ends up with a wound from a springfield not a tredegar gordon mcsweeney considered that whoever would do such a thing would surely spend eternity in hell as may be schneider said thats not the point the point is to keep your men from wanting to shoot you in the first place if they would only do that which is required of them we would not have this problem mcsweeney said captain schneider sighed sergeant have you ever even once in your life considered the wisdom of tempering justice with mercy no sir mcsweeney answered honestly shocked i believe you schneider said the one thingthe only thingill give you is that you hold yourself to the same standards as everyone else that time a couple of days ago when you reported yourself for not polishing the inside of your canteen cupthat was a first for me i tell you but what did i do about it nothing sir mcsweeneys voice reeked disapproval captain schneider either didnt notice or pretended not to thats right thats what im going to keep on doing when you bother me with tiny things too sergeant i order you not to report trivial infractions to me until and unless they constitute a clear and obvious danger to the discipline or safety of your squad do you understand me no sir mcsweeney said crisply all right then sergeant i am going to leave you with two quotations from the good book then i want you to concentrate on the lessons in john and matthew with an abrupt aboutface schneider stalked off gordon mcsweeney knew the scriptures well but those were not verses he was in the habit of studying so he had to go and look them up he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her he read in john the verse in matthew was even shorter and more to the point saying judge not that ye be not judged he stared out the door through which captain schneider had departed the captain as far as he was concerned had the letter without the spirit if god chose to urge mercy that was his affair could a man not so urged by the lord afford such a luxury mcsweeney didnt think so he was in any case by temperament more drawn to the old testament than to the new the children of israel now had been proper warriors god had not urged them to mercy but to glorify his name by smiting their foes and their prophets and kings had obeyed and had grown great by obeying against such a background what did a couple of verses matter jesus christ hadnt always been meek and mild either hadnt he driven the moneychangers from the temple they hadnt been doing anything so very wrong trivial infractions captain schneider would have called their business and thought jesus should have left it alone mcsweeney flipped back a few pages in the book of matthew and grunted in satisfaction chapter verse he murmured and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell he looked at the men in his squad none of them dared meet his eye would any have the nerve to shoot him under cover of battle he shook his head he didnt believe it not for a moment would they leave him in the lurch when he attacked maybe they would his glance flicked to the flamethrower anyone who carried one of those infernal devices was on his own anyhow justice mcsweeney said and gave a sharp nod only the wicked feared justice and with reason for they deserved chastisement thus the united states would chastise their seceded brethren and chastise as well the wicked foreigners who had made secession possible god wills it mcsweeney thought for all the world like a crusader before the walls of jerusalem and jerusalem would fall he would make it fall and break anyone and anything standing in the way achilles smiled at cincinnatus a smile that showed one new tooth in a wide wet mouth the baby said something wordless but joyful cincinnatus smiled back to elizabeth he said hes in a happy mood this mornin aint he his wife smiled back wanly why shouldnt he be happy he can sleep as long as he wants an he can wake up whenever he please an hes still too little to know his ma cant do likewise i heard him there in the middle of the night cincinnatus said digging into the ham and eggs elizabeth had made he sounded happy then too he was happy she said rolling her eyes which were still streaked with red he was so happy he wanted to play he didnt want to go back to bed not for nothin he didnt did you she poked achilles in the ribs he thought that was the funniest thing in the world and squealed laughter when he did his mother visibly melted all the same she said what i wanted to do was give him some laudanum so hed go back to sleep and i could too she yawned achilles squealed againeverything was funny this morning no sooner had cincinnatus shoveled the last fluffy scrambled egg into his mouth than someone knocked on the door he grabbed for his mug of coffee and gulped it down while hurrying to let in his mother hows my little grandbaby she asked cincinnatus was still swallowing from the kitchen elizabeth answered mother livia he must be sleepin while you got him on account of he sure dont do none o that in the nighttime he jus like his father then cincinnatus mother said she turned to him you was the wakinest child i ever did hear tell of without taking a breath she went on in a different tone of voice looks like its fixin to storm out there storm somethin fierce does it cincinnatus looked outside himself his mother was right thick dark clouds were boiling up in the northwest over ohio and heading rapidly toward covington the air felt still and heavy and damp he reached into the pocket of his dungarees and pulled out a nickel gonna ride me the trolley down to the docks gettin pretty ladeda aint you his mother said trolley here trolley there like you got all the money is to have pretty soon you gwine buy youself a motorcar aint that right wish it was cincinnatus said and gave her a kiss as he hurried out the door when the csa had ruled covington a motorcar for a black man would have been out of the question unless he wanted to be branded as uppityand perhaps literally branded as well under the usamaybe such a thing would be possible if he got the money together maybe it wouldnt too the rain began just before he got to the trolley stop which wasnt particularly close to his house one stop served the entire negro district near the licking river he remembered the complaints hed heard about routing the track even so close to his part of town when the trolley car rattled up he threw his nickel into the fare box and sat down in the back the yankees hadnt changed the rules about that sort of thing they had rules of their own not quite so strict as those of the confederacy but not tempered by intimate acquaintance either he sighed if your skin was dark you had trouble finding a fair shake anywhere lightning flashed thunder boomed rain started coming down in sheets the trolley filled up in a hurry as people who usually would have walked to work decided against it today whites started moving back into the negro section one by one cincinnatus and his fellow blacks gave up their seats and stood holding the overhead rail none of them complained not out loud men down from the usa ousted them as casually as did native covingtonians water sprayed up from the trolleys wheels as it slid to a stop near the wharves cincinnatus and several other negro men leaped down and ran for their places the others were all roustabouts theyd be drenched by the time the day was through cincinnatus didnt expect to be much better off for one thing it was almost as wet inside the cab of a white truck as it was outside for another hed be outside a good deal of the time certainly while loading and unloading his snarling monster and probably while fixing punctures as well morning cincinnatus lieutenant straubing said when he splashed into the warehouse that served as headquarters for the transportation unit wet enough out there to suit you sure enough is suh cincinnatus answered as usual his color seemed not to matter to straubing he still had trouble believing that could be true but had seen no evidence to make him suppose it was an act either the lieutenant looked troubled cincinnatus we have a problem and i think we could use your help to solve it what kind of problem you talking about sir the negro asked expecting it to be something to do with the bad weather and what it was doing to the schedule and to kentuckys miserable roads lieutenant straubing looked even less happy a sabotage problem im afraid he answered just then an enormous clap of thunder gave cincinnatus an excuse for jumping which was just as well because he would have jumped with an excuse or without one straubing went on an unhealthy number of fires have broken out in areas weve served please be on the alert for anything that seems suspicious yes suh ill do that cincinnatus said knowing everyone would be on the alert for him a distinctly alarming notion straubing said damned if i can figure out whos playing games with us either maybe its the redshe didnt say anything about niggers as most whites us or cs would have doneor maybe its confederate diehards whoever it is hell pay when he gets caught yes suh cincinnatus said again he deserve it he shut up after that not wanting to draw the us lieutenants attention to himself part of that of course was simple selfpreservation part of it too was not wanting the one white man whod ever treated him like a human being to be disappointed in him if the united states had produced more men like lieutenant straubing cincinnatus never would have worked to harm them as things were im letting everyone know straubing said if youve seen anything if you do see anything dont be shy i wont suh cincinnatus wondered if he could buy his own safety by betraying the confederate underground the trouble was the only man whose whereabouts he knew for certain was conroy no that was one trouble the other was that here in covington confederates and reds worked hand in hand hed betray apicius and his sons along with the men who waved the stars and bars some things cost more than they were worth more drivers white and black came dripping into the shed straubing spoke to them all cincinnatus wondered how good an idea that was everyone would be eyeing everyone else now and anyone who had a grudge against anyone else would likely seize the chance to have the occupation authorities put the other fellow through the wringer lets move out the lieutenant said at last weve got a cargo of shells the artillery is waiting for weather like this theyre going to be waiting a while longer said one of the drivers a white man cincinnatus knew only as herk lieutenant straubing was a born optimist a man who treated blacks and whites the same way had to be a born optimistor a damn fool cincinnatus thought darkly even the yankee soldier did not contradict herk all he said was weve got to give it our best shot out they went cincinnatus was glad he hadnt had to buck the heavy crates of shells into the bed of the white truck himself he wondered when hed get home again not as in at what time but as in on what day the front kept moving south that meant an everlonger haul from covington if he was lucky the roads would be terrible and not too crowded if he wasnt lucky theyd be terrible and packed and he might not get home for a week right from the start he had the feeling he wouldnt be lucky the trucks acetylene headlamps didnt want to light and once they finally did hissed and sputtered as if about to explode he had to crank the engine half a dozen times before it turned over one of those fruitless tries it jerked back on him and he yanked his hand off the crank just in time to keep it from breaking his arm unlike some the truck had a windshield and a wiper for it it thrashed over the glass like a spastic mans arm now two or three times quickly now all but motionless the idea was good as far as cincinnatus was concerned it needed more work even on the paved streets of covington the white seemed to bang unerringly into every pothole nor was cincinnatus the only one with that complaint a couple of trucks limped toward the curb with punctures changing an inner tube in the rain was not something he looked forward to with delight so thick were the clouds it seemed more like twilight than advancing morning cincinnatus stuck close to the rear of the truck in front of him and saw in his mirror the headlamps of the next white to the rear just behind him he thought of elephants in a circus parade each grasping the tail of the one in front with its trunk paved road ended about twentyfive miles south of covington before the war it had ended at the city limits yankee engineers were pushing it on toward the front for reasons of their own the difference between pavement and dirt was immediate and appalling muck flew up from the back tires of the white in front of cincinnatus coating his trucks headlamps and splattering the windshield the wiper blade smeared more than it removed swearing cincinnatus slowed down spacing between trucks got wider as other drivers did the same thing then they came upon what had to be at least a divisions worth of infantry heading south along the road drivers in the lead trucks squeezed the bulbs on their horns for all they were worth that was supposed to be the signal for the infantrymen to get out of the way even in good weather the soldiers in greengray didnt take kindly to moving onto the shoulder with the rain they barely seemed to move at all the whites splattered them as readily as one another curses rang in cincinnatus ears as he crawled past and through the marching men the trucks sped up again once they finally got beyond the head of the infantry column a little farther along they had to go onto the shoulder a pair of bogged barrels plugged the road tight as a cork in a bottle cincinnatus hoped hed reach the next fuel depot before his truck ran out of gas a noise like a gunshot made him jump in his seat the truck slewed sideways it wasnt confederates or reds puncture he said resignedly and pulled off the road to fix it by the time he scrambled back into the cab of the truck he was soaked from head to foot and all over mud he felt as if hed been wrestling somebody three times his size hed put a board under the jack before he tried using it it had done its level best to sink into the ooze board and all the ordeal was almost enough to make him wish he were back at the docks he shook his head i aint that stupid he said gunning the engine to try to catch up with the rest of the convoy he did too soon enough no one could make any sort of time through the mud he managed to get more gasoline before he stopped dead putting everything together the trip wasnt so bad as hed expected only goes to show i dont expect much he thought the raiders hit the convoy a little south of berea one moment cincinnatus was contentedly chugging along not far from the rearother fellows whod had to stop for one breakdown or another had fallen in behind him the next an explosion up ahead made him stamp on the brake as the truck skidded to a stop rifle and machinegun fire rang out from the side of the road stitching down the convoy toward him he had no gun he carried nothing more lethal than a clasp knife without a moments hesitation he dove out of the cab and away from the white as fast as he could go that proved smart flames started licking up from under the hood in spite of the rain a bullet or two must have smashed up the motor cincinnatus just watched those flames for a moment then with a moan of fright he crawled farther away from the truck not to escape the bullets still flying but to get away from the the flames spread rapidly with a soft whoomp the gas tank went up setting the whole truck ablaze a minute or so after that the fire reached the artillery rounds in the bed at first a couple of them exploded individually and then with a great roar the whole truckload went up cincinnatus had been on his hands and knees the blast knocked him facedown into the mud shell fragments and shrapnel balls slashed the air around him some of them fell hissing into puddles of rainwater close by as other trucks began exploding he tried desperately to put more distance between himself and them he heard screams from drivers who hadnt been able to get away and rebel yells from the raiders still shooting up the convoy the explosions though kept the raiders from coming after him or so he thought till a shape wallowed toward him he grabbed for his little knife knowing it would do no good against a rifle but then stopped that you herk he asked not sure he recognized the filthy dripping driver but the white man nodded yeah how the hell do we get out of this dunno cincinnatus answered he started laughing herk stared at him eyes wide and shining in his dirty face cincinnatus explained we got us the chance to find out though very solemnly herk nodded again very solemnly abner dowling peered south through his field glasses toward the wooded hills north of the little tennessee town called white house he stood under a greengray canvas awning so the hot august rain didnt splash down onto his lenses but the rain cut down on visibility nonetheless masking those hills from clear observation what little he could see he didnt like he turned to general custer sir the rebs have that line as fortified as all getout theyre not going to be easy to shift not even a little bit yet shift them we must and shift them we shall custer said as usual mixing desire and ability he raised his field glasses to his face holding them with one shaky liverspotted hand that line in front of white house is the last one they can hold to keep our artillery out of range of nashville once it goes down we commence bombarding the city he let the binoculars fall down on the leather strap holding round his neck so he could rub his hands in anticipation i understand that sir dowling said the trouble is im very much afraid the confederates understand it too that is a formidable position they have therenot only high ground but wooded high ground so we have trouble pinpointing their dispositions he had no trouble pinpointing custers disposition it was petulant the general commanding first army said i intend to bombard that area until every tree in it has been made into toothpicks and matchsticks toothpicks and matchsticks he repeated relishing the rhyme yes sir dowling said working to remind custer of reality we lost a good deal of ammunition when that convoy was ambushed last week true custer said you will of course note that although those munitions were intended for my force that shocking breach of security occurred in an area under general pershings jurisdiction not mine of course sir his adjutant agreed where selfpreservation was concerned custer had a keen enough grasp on reality dowling went on however that may be though the ammunition is not here andhe pointed toward the dark treeclad rolling hillsthats not good country for barrels no country is good country for barrels in this rain well send them in anyhow custer said which was just like him hed found a weapon that worked once so hed keep right on using it regardless of whether circumstances warranted such use he continued and we have plenty of ammunition even without that which was lost and no doubt our soldiers will make up with their courage any minor deficiencies in the preliminaries translated into english that meant a hell of a lot of young americans were about to get shot a good many of them unnecessarily custer had already fought a lot of battles like that in western kentucky and advanced at a snails pace the pace of a snail whose trail was blood not slime dowling said it might be wiser to hold off a bit sir until the weathers more favorable and we have better reconnaissance major we have been fighting for two years and more now custer replied would you not say we have already seen a sufficiency of delay without giving dowling a chance to answer he said i expect the bombardment to commence tomorrow morning and to continue until the rebel positions are pulverized at which point we advance barrels and infantry both what custer expected custer got that was the advantage of being a lieutenant general the next day the guns began to roar dowling didnt envy the artillerymen serving them in the mud again no one asked his opinion he watched explosions wrack the confederate hilltop lines first army had a lot of guns and a lot of ammunition even without what the raiders had blown up they pounded the positions north of white house with high explosive and shrapnel and gas custer watched too with the delight of a small boy at a fireworks show give it to em he said hoarsely give it to em by jingo as dowling had foreseen the confederates understood perfectly well what the unending barrage implied their own guns pounded the us trenches in the wretched weather accurate counterbattery fire was next to impossible because the us artillery had and could gain no exact notion of the rebel guns positions the us artillery preparation went on for five days by the end of that time as custer had desired the hills were no longer treecovered seen through dowlings field glasses they resembled a closeup photograph of an unshaven man whod survived a bad case of smallpox all over craters and old eruptions with now and then as if by afterthought something straight sticking up from one of them it was easy to imagine that every confederate in those hills had been blown to kingdom come it was especially easy for custer to imagine as much weve got em now he told dowling in the middle of it preening like a cock pheasant the lord has delivered them into our hands and our soldiers have only to storm forward and capture whatever demoralized wretches chance to remain alive i hope youre right sir dowling said but in the big fights in pennsylvania and maryland and even the ones first army had in western kentucky the defenders ended up with an advantage all out of proportion to their numbers thats why were laying on the artillery preparation custer looked at his adjutant as if hed just crawled out from under a flat rock never in the history of the planet had any place on the face of the earth been bombarded like those hills there only a wet blanket would think otherwise dowling sighed custer had reckoned him a wet blanket since the earliest days of their association that hed proved right more often than not had done nothing to endear him to the general commanding first armyon the contrary this was one of the times dowling devoutly hoped he was wrong custer had laid on one hell of a bombardment and maybe it would be good enough to wipe out the foe maybe it went on for two more days till the artillerymen were as near deaf as made no difference even when the us soldiers swarmed out of their trenches and rushed for the ruined woods the barrage kept on now dropping down on where intelligence thought the rebels had their frontline trenches some of the americans unrolled telephone wire as they advanced others carried signal flags in case the wires broke as they so often did from under that camouflaged awning custer and dowling watched the troops dowling saw sparklike points of light begin to spurt here and there in the woods we didnt get quite everyone sir he said leftover dust to be swept away by the broom of the infantry custer said grandly a broom five miles wide major confederate artillery started falling in nomansland us troops got hung up in the belts of barbed wire not even the titanic american barrage had been able to tear up more and more confederate machine guns muzzle flashes winking like malign eyes filled with horrible amusement opened up on the us soldiers stuck out in the open every so often a runner or a staff officer would bring news of the progress the attack was making by the time the news reached custer and dowling it was old and stale whats the slowdown dowling demanded too many phone lines broken by the rebel artillery sir answered a lieutenant who didnt seem to realize he was bleeding from a wound in his upper arm too many runners getting shot before they can make it back too and the goddamn rebel snipers are concentrating on our signalers its worth your life to stick up a banner custer moved blue counters on a map we are making progress he insisted we need to send in the reserves to take advantage of the gains the first wave has carved out in went the reserves for all they gained the ground might as well have swallowed them up the ground had swallowed too many of them up and they would never rise from it again toward evening custer committed more reserves once we break the hard crust and reach the softness it protects they are ours he said the third wave of reserves went in the next morning a couple of hours slower than they might have the rebs had been dislodged from most of their forward trenches and from some of the secondary trenches as well the line though still held and the cost sir dowling said late that second afternoon weve lost almost a divisions worth of dead and twice that many wounded how long can we go on like this as long as it takes custer replied all summer if we need to by the end of summer dowling feared first army would be down to battalion size the question he supposed was whether the confederates opposing them would have any men left at all even if they didnt was that a victory could the us survivors go on and take nashville which was after all the point of this entire exercise custer seemed to entertain no doubts if you hammer the anvil long enough major it breaks dowling didnt answer he had blacksmiths in his family and knew what custer might not if you hammered the anvil long enough it broke all right but it was the hammer not the anvil he wondered if he should try explaining that to the general commanding first army after a moment he shook his head general custer hadnt been in the habit of listening to him before why would he start now major irving morrell said what weve got going now is the big push toward banff the last thing we want to do is go straight at the place the canucks are set up and waiting for us to try it if we do theyll slaughter us we have to make them watch the cape the way the bullfighters do in the empire of mexico if they keep their eyes on the cape they wont notice the sword captain heinz guderian nodded this is sound doctrine major deception deception by all means he spoke in german which not only morrell but also his officers understood thanks captain morrell turned an ironic eye on the german staff officer i thought youd have headed back to philadelphia along with major dietl guderian shrugged dietl goes back to a real war so he has no compunctions about leaving this one if i go back to germany i go back to fighting at a desk with machine pencil and largecaliber typewriter his eyes sparkled if i am to make my life as a soldier i intend to be a soldier not a clerk in a fieldgray uniform fair enough morrell took a map from one of his pockets lets have a look at exactly what weve got here guderian and morrells own companygrade officers huddled close to him captain karl spadinger pointed to the map what do these it markings stand for he asked the abbreviation means indian trail morrell answered shows what kind of country were operating in and well have the devils own time doing anything with the canadians watching ustheyre bound to have observers here on this peakhe pointed toward pigeon mountainand its almost two miles high how are we going to fool them then captain charlie hall asked if they know were coming theyre going to bake us a cake he had a gift for the obvious morrell had long since seen that but what was obvious to him would also be obvious to the canadians whats obvious morrell observed isnt always true guderians head bobbed up and down he got it so did captain spadinger so for that matter did lieutenant jephtha lewis halls tanned handsome face was still blank rather sourly morrell decided that made him perfect for leading half the attack he had in mind if its own commander didnt understand it the canadians were sure to be fooled but no he decided after a brief hesitation sending hall in blind would surely get him killed he was liable to get killed anyway his role would be expensive and so morrell condescended to explain youll take your company and most of the machine guns around to the east of the mountain there dont do anything in particular to keep from drawing attention to yourself as soon as you get opposition i want you to plaster it with rifle fire and those machine gunsmake it seem as if youre in charge of the whole battalion while youre keeping the canucks busy the rest of us are going to be sneaking up one of these indian trails to see if we can slide past the observer without getting observed captain halls eyes widened what a good idea sir he exclaimed im glad you like it morrell knew his voice was dry but he couldnt help it it didnt matter hall no more noticed the tone than he had figured out what lay in morrells mind before the battalion commander put it in words of one syllable for him morrell kept sergeant finkels machinegun squad the rest went on the diversionary move since he was leaving himself with only one gun he chose the best guderian had seen that too the sergeant there should be an officer he observed quietly is he held back because he is a jew maybe a little morrell answered he holds himself back too though hed rather deal with the machine guns himself than with men who would be dealing with machine guns if you know what i mean i know exactly what you mean guderian said nodding those are indeed the ones who make the best noncommissioned officers once he judged captain halls force well begun on its diversionary move morrell led the rest of the battalion north and west on narrow trails through the thickest woods he could find he strung the men out so that even if the canadians up on pigeon mountain should spot them they would have a hard time judging how many us soldiers were on the march he tramped along at the head of the column map in one hand compass in the other hoping the two of them could guide him his boots scuffed almost soundlessly through a carpet of needles fallen from the tall dark conifers all around their resinous aromatic scent filled his nostrils you are a lucky man major captain guderian said to have escaped being chained behind a desk i think so anyhow morrell said some people want to coop themselves up with stoves and electric lamps and telephones and typewriters you need those people too if youre going to win a war but i am not any of them this for me is better guderian was on the point of replying when gunfire broke out off to the east it was a good deal of gunfire the germans head went up like a hounds on taking a scent the canadians attention has been drawn i should say nothing like machine guns to do that is there soon we see how much attention they are paying over on that side of the mountain they cant have a whole great swarm of men themselves morrell said theyre trying to hold off the usa all across their country and were bigger than they are even if were fighting the confederacy too one hopes they cant guderian answered morrell grinned the foreigner was as dry with him as hed been with captain hall unlike hall though he was alert enough to the world around him to realize as much he was sure the canadians had pickets in the woodshe would have in their shoes he didnt run into any of them for quite a while though as the trees hid him from pigeon mountain they also hid the mountain from him that meant he had no choice but to navigate by the map which he didnt fully trust if it was even close to right he was almost to decent terrain that would take him straight toward the railroad lineand toward the last line of canadian defenders in front of it just when hed begun to think hed used the indian trails so cleverly as to evade every picket the canucks had posted a rifle shot rang out up ahead the bullet zipped past his head before he heard the report from the rifle that had sent it on its way he was burying his face in those fragrant needles before a second bullet drilled through the space where his body had been map and compass went flying when he dove as he grabbed for his springfield he shouted get em fast dont let this look big he fired in the direction from which the shots had come his men dashed into the woods on either side of the trail the little battle that followed was a lot like fighting indiansrunning from tree to tree ambushes small desperate stands of resistance after ten or fifteen minutes no one was shooting anymore morrell hoped the canucks were dead and hadnt been able to send runners back to announce he and his soldiers were on the way the racket of the fight was liable to have done that for them now we push it morrell called as the americans moved forward once more if the canucks know were here we dont want them to have time to get ready for us hed rescued the mapthat was precious god only knew where the compass had landed he commandeered captain spadingers twenty minutes later the us force burst out of the woods there in the distance was the railroad running alongside the ghost river a train tiny as a toy chugged west but between him and the object of his desire lay rifle pits and trenches with canadians in them he shouted for sergeant finkel quiet and competent the noncom and his crew had kept up with everyone else setting up the machine gun on its tripod was a matter of moments one gun wasnt much to cover the advance of a battalion but it was what morrell had if nothing else it would make the canucks however many canucks there were keep their heads down some of the time fire and move morrell yelled fire and move as they often had before his men ran toward the canadians in small groups flopped down and fired so their comrades could sprint past them then moved up again when those comrades took cover the canucks fought hard but as hed hoped their lines werent so full as they might have been sergeant finkel engaged at long range some men trying to rush back from the east when the first us soldiers started jumping down into the canadian trenches morrell refrained from following them long enough to shout for a runner he told the men get back to division hq and tell em to send reinforcements after us from where we are all we have to do is hold and we can mortar that railroad line to hell and gone tell em to push it too the canucksll try and throw us out well hold on here as long as we can bent low at the waist to make himself a small target the runner dashed back the way hed come morrell figured his men would have to hold on by themselves for most of a day he figured they could do it too and thenand then the canadians would have only one pass left through the rockies and that one higher and farther north and less usable through the winter than either of the two that would be lost to them one more nail in the coffin he muttered but that wasnt quite rightit was one more stroke of the saw that was cutting the country in half he nodded as pleased with his metaphor as he was with his victory brakes squealing the train pulled into the richmond and petersburg railroad depot richmond the conductors shouted again and again all out for richmond anne colleton shook her head in mingled scorn and bemusement after the train had rattled over the long bridge across the james river people would have to be idiots not to know it was coming in to the capital of the confederate states but then a lot of people were idiots shed seen that often enough shed grown rich then richer because of it and shed grown poorer because of it too since blacks proved no more immune to the disease than whites porter she called stepping out of the compartment a negro with a hand truck came hurrying up despite the black uprising that tone of imperious command got results the colored fellow piled her trunksnot so fine as the ones shed had before the marshlands burnedonto the dolly and followed her out of the pullman coach onto the smoky noisy platform that served as gateway between train and world once out there she stuck two fingers in her mouth and let out a piercing whistle shed learned from her brothers taxi she yelled imperious

handing her into the car fords hotel she answered he had hardly put the cab into gear before she found a question of her own why arent you in uniform maam i got hit once in the shoulder and once here he took his left hand off the wheel for a moment it was encased in a leather glove three of whose fingers were unnaturally full and stiff they decided theyd had as much of me as they could use so they let me go very well she answered as he drove north toward capitol square she saw plenty of other such expended men on the street men on crutches with one trouser leg pinned up men who had no legs in wheelchairs men with an empty sleeve or a hook doing duty for one hand men with a patch over one eye and a couple of men with black silk masks who kept a hand on a companions shoulder so they could

chemical stinks anne could not name the driver coughed a couple of times when it got particularly ripe then spoke as if in apology place stinks like one of those miserable us cities dont it maam it had better anne said sharply we need weapons and men both and we have to make the weapons because the sea war wont let us import them you know about these things the cabbie said respectfully hed turned left on canal street for a block then gone up seventh to grace where he turned right and went on till he came to ninth which abutted capitol square there he waited and waited and waited till he finally found the chance to turn left and go on for half a block and then to turn right onto capitol street when he got to eleventh heslowlyturned left again and went past the bulk of fords hotel to the entrance which was at the corner of eleventh and broad a negro in a uniform fancier than any a general wore took charge of annes luggage she paid the fare adding a tip of the same size the taxi driver took off his cap with his good hand and bowed to her stay well she told him maam he said i used to cuss about traffic till the first time i got shot now it dont worry me nonenot even a little bit no servants maam the desk clerk asked do you see any anne demanded julia was not long delivered of a baby girl no one else who remained at marshlands seemed suitable as a traveling companion and she had not wanted to hire a servant she had enough trouble trusting negroes she knewor thought she knew flushing the clerk gave her a big bronze key with the number stamped onto it an arthritic elevator took her the bellman and her cases upstairs the room was large and fancy with thick carpets landscapes on the walls elaborately carved tables and a great profusion of lacework doilies and maroon plush upholstery it was no doubt intended to impress the daylights out of the prosperous businessmen and lobbyists who usually stayed here and no doubt succeeded the exhibition of modern art anne had put together just before the war broke out had been the antithesis of everything the room stood for looks more like a whorehouse than a hotel room she remarked as she tipped the bellhop he let out a scandalized giggle and fled anne unpackedafter living for months in a refugee camp she could still see having a room to herself as a luxurious waste of spaceand went downstairs for supper the restaurant was as spectacularly overdecorated as the room but they did a fine job on crab cakesthe boast of best in the csa on the menu didnt seem misplacedso she had little cause for complaint the bed was comfortable enough too after a pullman any bed that didnt sway and rattle seemed splendid the next morning she looked at the gray linen dress shed intended wearing and shook her head she hadnt seen how wrinkled it was the night before or she would have had it pressed she chose a maroon silk instead after breakfast in the hotel she hailed a cab the executive mansion she said crisply the driver a sensible man did not bother pointing out that the building was only two blocks north and one east from where shed got in what the damnyankees still disparagingly called the confederate white house also stood near the top of shockoe hill anne had no intention of arriving there as draggled and sweaty as a housemaid the cab labored up the hill to the corner of clay and twelfth where the driver let her out she reckoned the quarter fare and dime tip money well spent armed guards patrolled the grounds of the mansion behind a wroughtiron fence whose points were not only decorative but looked very sharp a white man who wore formal attire but carried himself with a military bearing examined her letter of invitation and checked her name off on a list before allowing her to proceed i am not an assassin she remarked half annoyed half amused i know that maamnow the fellow replied anne colleton seldom yielded anyone else the last word but made an exception here as shed expected she had to wait before being admitted to president semmespresence a negro servant offered her coffee and cakes dusted with powdered sugar she ate one then prudently checked her appearance in the mirror of her compact wouldnt do to see the president with sugar on my chin she thought after most of an hourhalf an hour past the ninethirty for which her appointment was scheduledanother servant led her into gabriel semmes office since the man who walked out past her was the secretary of war she did not think the president had delayed meeting her to be inconvenient president semmes certainly received her with every sign of pleasure so very good of you to come up from south carolina he said and moved the chair across from his desk slightly to suggest that she sit in it here pleasemake yourself comfortable can i have the staff bring you anything no thank you she answered lets get straight down to business shall we however you like of course he answered he looked like a confederate politician or rather the apotheosis of a confederate politician in his early fifties handsome ruddy a little beefy with a mane of gray hair combed straight back from his forehead a mustache and a little chin beard that was almost pure white the absence of tobacco stains from that beard was enough almost by itself to place him outside the common herd he went on i wont beat around the bush with you miss colletoni need your help on this bill to arm our negroes and use them against the usa any time a politician said he wouldnt beat around the bush you were well advised to keep your hand on your wallet youll have to show me things are as bad as you said in your letter inviting me here she told him the press certainly does not make them out to be so desperate have you ever heard of any war in the history of the world where the press did not make things out to be better than they were gabriel semmes returned if you look at papers in the usa during the war of secession and the second mexican war you will see they thought they were winning each time until almost the moment of their overthrow as may be she said i am not yet convinced she did not tell him what her brother tom kept saying in his letters politicians were not the only ones who learned to hold their cards closebusiness taught the same lesson president semmes said a glance at the map will show you much of the trouble we have lost ground against the usa almost everywhere and our remaining gains in maryland are threatened our latest effort to reclaim western texas failedthere is no other word they hammer us on every front we do have some counterstrokes in the offing and we have thus far managed to avoid losing anything vital but that cannot continue forever we are under more pressure than our allies in europe and have little prospect of aid from them we hurt the yankees worse than they hurt us in every fight is that not so anne said thats one reason why we stand on the defensive so much yes we do by a ratio of close to three to two semmes answered each us conscription class though outnumbers our corresponding class of whites by about three to one add in the negroes and the deficit shrinks to about two to one better actually for we would be calling up several conscription classes of blacks at once anne pursed her lips thoughtfully but not all the us soldiers are used against us she pointed out many of them go into the fight against canada that helps even the numbers somewhat somewhat yes for now president semmes agreed but even with troops from britain aiding themthey have the advantage of the northern routethe canadians i tell you in confidence are in a bad way how long we can rely on them to continue siphoning off yankee resources i cannot say beyond what he asserted beyond what the papers asserted which thanks to censorship was liable to be the same thing she didnt know how things stood with canada would he lie for political advantage alone probably but she could check what he said with her senators and the congressman from her district the men he wanted her to influence he would know that therefore he was likely to be telling the truth or most of it the other question is she said as much to herself as to him what will the confederate states be like with negroes as citizens is that better or is losing as we are miss colleton i always thought you were on the side of modernity of progress of change president semmes said a shrewd shot that proved heor his advisorsknew her views well and if we lose can we stay as we are or would we face another round of red upheaval that was another good question the answer seemed only too obvious too try to freeze in the mold of the past or take a chance on the future if you didnt gamble how were you going to win but when she thought about what blacks had done to marshlands and to her brotheri hate this she said quietly so do i the president of the confederate states replied ill do what i can anne said trying not to see the disapproving look on dead jacobs face well better the damnyankees should have gassed a negro than poor jacob if you looked at it the right way theyd killed him before the negro uprising could finish the job from the bottom of my heart i thank you and your country thanks you as well president semmes said he rose and bowed to her then went on now that we know ourselves to be in agreement perhaps you will accompany me to a ceremony where your presence will surely serve as an inspiration to the brave men we honor roger kimball was bored the ceremony should have started at half past ten he drew out his pocket watch it was closer to eleven almost imperceptibly he shook his head civilians could get away with nonsense like that for a naval officer it would have meant trouble at least maybe a courtmartial not only was he bored he was hot too theyd run up an awning so he didnt have to stand in direct sunshine but it didnt cut the heat much or the humidity at all he felt as if he were melting down into his socks the only advantage he found to sweating so much was that he wouldnt have enough water left in him to need to take a leakprobably for the next three days out on the lawn old people sat in folding chairs and looked at him and the other hunks of uniformed beef on display under the awning ladies fanned themselves some of their male companions used straw hats to make the air move by the way the old folks were turning red in the vicious sunshine they needed the awning worse than he and his companions did off to one side of the awning a band struck up dixie kimball came to attention maybe that meant things really would get rolling now the negro musicians were in black cutaway coats and black trousers they didnt have an awning either he wondered how they could play without keeling over he shrugged they were just niggers after all a woman walked quickly forward to take a seat near the front rogers eyebrows came to attention as the rest of him had at the national anthem unlike most of the audience she was anything but superannuated her maroon silk dress clung tightly to her rounded hips and daringly short revealed trim ankles under her hat her hair shone in the sun but it shone gold not silver next to kimball an army sergeant murmured through unmoving lips the president ought to pin her on my chest instead of a medal yeah he whispered back then he stiffened far beyond the requirements of attention christ on a crutch thats anne colleton you know her the sergeant said microscopically roger nodded the army man sighed either youre a liar navy or youre one lucky bastard ill tell you that and then recognizing him too anne waved not too obviously but unmistakably the sergeant sighed again you are a lucky bastard here came president gabriel semmes all sleek and clever to present their decorations kimball noticed him only peripherally hed had a note from anne when she was stuck in that refugee camp but nothing since he hadnt been a hundred percent sure she was still alive and found himself damn glad to discover she was president semmes made a speech of which he heard perhaps one word in three the gist of it was with bravery like that which these heroes had displayed the confederate states were surely invincible roger kimball didnt believe that for a minute semmes didnt believe it either or why was he pushing that bill to put guns in the hands of black men a flunky brought the president a silver tray with dark blue velvet boxes stacked on it reporters scribbled as semmes read out the deeds of the heroes he was honoring one of the awards was posthumous a confederate cross for a private whod leaped on a grenade to save his pals kimball wasnt up for a cc himself semmes would pin an order of the virginia on him the next highest award a navy man could get to earn the confederate cross and live through it you had to be brave lucky and crazy all at the same time without false modesty he knew he was brave and hed been lucky but he hadntquitebeen crazy up there in chesapeake bay the sergeant standing there next to him had won a confederate cross pgtb austin without concern for his own safety climbed onto the top of a us traveling fort president semmes said not calling it a barrel and threw grenades into the machine through its hatches until fire forced the crew to flee whereupon he killed three with his rifle wounded two more and accepted the surrender of the rest sergeant austin the audience applauded photographers snapped away as austin went up to get his medal kimball nodded to himself brave lucky and crazy sure enough his own turn came a moment later after hearing what the army man had done he felt embarrassed to accept even a lesser decoration the president shook his hand and told him what a splendid fellow he was he already knew what a splendid fellow he was so he didnt argue the medal a tiny gold replica of the confederacys first ironclad hanging from a red white and blue ribbon did look impressive on his chest he went back to his place under the awning and waited for the rest of the medals to be awarded then as hed expected the men whod won them got the chance to mingle with guests and reporters he wondered if anne colleton would still give him the time of day he wasnt a big fish not in this pond if she wanted heroes she had her pick here but she came straight up to him maybe she wants an ornery soandso he thought takes one to know one congratulations she said and shook his hand manfashion im glad to see you here and well same to you he answered the feel of her flesh against his sent a charge through him as if hed touched a bare wire he watched her face her pupils got bigger her nostrils flared ever so slightly she wanted to be alone with him too heat different from that of richmond august filled him last i got a look at you you were seeing how fast you could get away from the charleston docks i did fine halfway to marshlands her voice turned bitter then my car got stolen rebels reds kimball said youre lucky they didnt kill not reds anne broke in soldiers our soldiers oh i suppose they needed it against the uprising but she didnt go on out of the corner of his eye he saw men gathering around them drawn to anne colleton like moths to a flame he knew how good a comparison that was too but he was no moth he had fire of his own so he told himself anyhow quickly while he still had the chance he asked where are you staying fords she answered would you like to celebrate your medal by having supper with me there tonight cant think of anything id like better he said he could in fact think of several things but those were things you did not things you talked about half past six he asked and when she nodded he drifted away as if she were just someone in the crowd he happened to know he showed up at the hotel a couple of minutes early she was waiting in the lobby and again had drawn a crowd some of the officers were of considerably higher rank than lieutenant commander all the civilians looked more than prosperous everyone stared after kimball and anne when they went off to the dining room her hand on his arm he grinned over at her i could get used to this he said a tiny vertical crease appeared between her eyebrows dont she said more seriously than hed expected if people think of you because of whoevers with youso what make them remember you for yourself he thought about that then nodded i started on a little farm ive come this far on my own ill go farther if i can thats the way to look at it she agreed any one of those fat lawyers back there would love to take care of my affairsand you can take that any way you like i wont let them i run my life no one else that had the sound of hard experience behind it and also perhaps a note of warning fords hotel did right by its dinner spread wouldnt hardly know theres a war on kimball said happily digging into almost forktender leg of lamb anne colleton stayed serious what do you think of president semmesbill she asked she didnt need to say which bill only one mattered now im against it he answered firmly as long as were holding our own or even anything close we should go on doing what weve been doing far as i can see were giving the darkies a kiss on the cheek right after they tried to up and knock our heads off she nodded slowly is that how most navy men feel kimball knocked back the whiskey in his glass its not even the way my exec feels all you hear these days is arguments what if we cant win the war cant hope to win the war if things keep on going as they have been anne said would you want to arm negroes then hung for a sheep or hung for a lamb you mean he shrugged unable to come up with a better answer if were that bad off putting rifles in niggers hands wont help us far as i can see and if we do that and we lose anyhow what will the country look like afterwards be a hell of a mess begging your pardonnot that it isnt already a point she said it may be the most serious point in opposition ive heard yet a colored waiter came up and cleared away plates after a tuttifrutti ice brandy a cigar for kimball and a couple of cigarettes for anne the waiter came back charge this to my room she told him and he dipped his head with practiced obsequiousness roger kimballs hand had been going to his wallet he scowled angry that shed accepted the bill before he had the chance im not broke he began i know she answered but for one thing i invited you to supper not the other way round and for another i promise i have more money than you do i know what naval officers make its my pleasure believe me werent you the one talking about making your own way when we came in here he asked unhappy still i didnt suggest annoying your friends by being stubborn when thats plainly foolish she said a touch of sharpness in her voice he subsided looking for a word hed heard a few times but had had little occasion to use gigolo he thought shes made me her gigolo tonight he seemed to have no choice but to accept that well all right gigolos had privileges of their own he remembered how she looked under that maroon silk and how she felt and how she tasted too if the ford hotel boasted a house detective he was good at making himself invisible kimball and anne went up to her floor and walked down the richly carpeted hallway to her room without interference she opened the door with her key leaned forward to brush his lips with hersand then said good night roger i hope you sleep well it was not an invitation to come in what the devil he said roughly weve been i know what weve been she answered we wont be not tonight the very first time we met you did a splendid job of seducing me her eyes glinted half amusement half remembered anger of her own and so tonight no call it a lesson never ever take me for granted maybe another time probably another timebut not tonight he wasnt that much bigger than she but he knew he was stronger with a lot of other women he would have picked them up thrown them on the bed and taken what he wanted if he tried that with hereven if he succeeded because he knew shed fight like a wildcathe figured she was liable to stab him or shoot him as he left you are a bitch he said reluctantly admiring i know she knew all right and she was proud of it he seized her jerked her chin up and kissed her hard he figured shed fight that too but she didnt her body molded itself against him when the kiss broke though she pushed him away she was laughingand panting a little so was he thanks for supper he said and tipped his hat he strode down the hall toward the elevator without a backward glance out on the sidewalk a drunken artillery sergeant walked right into him watch where youre going you goddamn medalwearing son of a bitch the fellow snarled by the way his mouth twisted he was looking for a fight wherever he could find one kimball didnt feel like fighting which since he hadnt got laid surprised him im an officer he warned meaning the sergeant would catch special hell if he fought with him watch where youre going you goddamn medalwearing son of a bitch sir the sergeant said laughing kimball peeled off a fivedollar note he hadnt spent at supper and pressed it into the noncoms hand before that hand could close into a fist the sergeant stared go on get drunker on me kimball said he slapped him on the back then headed off to his barracks close by the james jake featherston gaped in owlish disbelief at the banknote that had magically appeared in his hand even if the fellow whod given it to him was a navy man he had until the grayback pressed it on him wanted to smash his face not only was he an officer he was a decorated officer jake knew damn well he deserved to be an officer he also knew he deserved several medals not just one and am i gonna get em he asked the empty air around him sure i amsame time as i get promoted he laughed a loud raucous bitter laugh he wasnt holding his breath he ambled around capitol square like a sailing ship tacking almost at random that was how he felt too he wasnt going anywhere in particular just letting his feet and the crowds in the streets take him wherever they would half seriously he saluted the statues of washington and albert sidney johnston in the square theyd know how to take care of a soldier he muttered to himself muttering did no good complaining out loud did no good either hed seen that when he went to major clarence potter maybe if he walked into the capitol itself and started screaming at congressmen and generals he shook his head which made the world spin alarmingly no good no good it was late he didnt know how late it was but it was late no congressmen working in the capitol now by jesus theyd all be in bed with their mistresses and the generalsthe generals would be in bed with jeb stuart jr he laughed the truth in that hurt though if the powers that be in the confederate war department hadnt been sucking up to the father of his late brave stupid company commander they would have given him his due but they did suck up they hadnt given it to him and they damn well never would bastards he said sons of bitches the words were hot and satisfying in his mouth the way the whiskey had been at that saloonthose saloonsearlier pretty soon he figured hed go looking for another saloon he was sure hed have no trouble finding one around him richmond didnt so much ignore the war as take it in stride he wandered south and east away from capitol square plenty of soldiers and sailors on leave clogged the sidewalks and the streets themselves making people in buggies and motorcars yell at them to get out of the way they didnt want to get out of the way not with so many women to look for so many stores open so late so many saloons most of the men in civilian clothes were negroes featherston glowered at them they were out celebrating as hard as the white people they had their nerve he thought here white men went out to fight and die and all the blacks had to do was stay home and have a high old time stories of lazy niggers his overseer father had told him ran through his head he had no doubt every goddamn one of them was true too a big buck in a sharp suittoo sharp for any negro to deserve to wearbumped into him watch it you ugly black bastard he snarled sorry suh the negro said but he wasnt sorryjake could see it in his eyes if people had been paying better attention the whole red uprising would have been nipped in the bud when the fellow didnt get out of the way fast enough featherston shoved him hard the blacks hand closed into a fist as he staggered a fierce joy lit jake so you want to play do you he said genially and gave the black buck a knee square in the balls the fellow went down as if hed been shot jake wished he had shot him he wished he could shoot all of them brushing his hands together he headed off down the street leaving the negro writhing on the pavement behind him no one said boo he was about to cross franklin street a good way down from capitol square when military policemen blocked the way he felt like cursing them too but that would land him in jail and he still had a couple of daysleave before he had to go back to the maryland front so he stood and watched as a long column of soldiers tramped past farther up the street people were laughing and cheering a hell of a racket was coming from somewhere up there too jake craned his neck a moment later he laughed and cheered too four barrelsnobody whod faced the yankee version said tanksrumbled toward him battle flags painted on the front and sides they looked different from the ones the usa manufactured featherston wondered whether the csa had built them or theyd somehow been imported from england however that was he was damn glad to see them give em hell he shouted and a soldier riding on top of one of them waved his way he yelled again let the damnyankees know what its like by jesus had he been in the infantry he probably would have shouted even louder the barrels were so heavy their wraparound tracks tore up the concrete surface of the street theyd probably come through town to build morale sure built mine jake thought more soldiers followed young seriouslooking men intent on keeping step theyd learn what was important and what wasnt pretty damn quick jake knew that having been born and raised in richmond he also knew which railroad station the men and barrels were heading for the richmond and danville he wished theyd been coming up to maryland but the roanoke front was probably the next best place for them grudgingly he admitted to himself that the roanoke front might have been the best place to send them the yanks were in virginia there as opposed to fighting them on their own soil farther north and east to celebrate the chance of throwing the damnyankees out of his own state jake went into a saloon and poured down whiskey to celebrate that whiskey he had another one and then another when he came out of the saloon hed spent a good piece of the note that navy man had given him and when he came out he didnt need to turn his head sharply to make the world revolve off in the distance he heard or thought he heard a lowpitched droning rumble more barrels he shook his head and almost fell over the troop trains pulling out no this wasnt a train noise it was real though he hadnt been sure of that before but he was now it sounded likeaeroplanes his face twisted in slowwitted puzzlement if it is aeroplanes its a hell of a lot of em he said thinking out loud he wondered why the confederacy would put so many aeroplanes in the sky so late at night damn foolishness he mumbled the part of his mind that functioned at a level below conscious thought came up with the answer sweet suffering jesus its the yankees he exclaimed a moment before the first antiaircraft gun outside the confederate capital began pounding away at the intruders he knew too well how futile antiaircraft fire often turned out to be at night hitting your target was even harder and the united states had put a hell of a lot of aeroplanes in the air theyd bombed the front theyd bombed confederateoccupied washington till now they hadnt done much to richmond all that evidently was about to change featherston dove under a bench at a trolley stop the first shelter he spied with so many lights on in the confederate capital the bombers had targets to dream of most of the explosions sounded as if they were close to capitol squaremost but not all the damnyankees seemed to have plenty of bombing aeroplanes to carpet the whole city from under the bench featherston watched a sea of feet and legs mens and womens both running every which way like chickens with their heads cut off he said and then raised his voice to a shout take cover dammit they didnt listen to him nobody listened to him civilians paid him no more mind than soldiers ever had and when the bombs started falling all around the civilians of richmond found out that they should have paid attention just as the confederate brass should have listened when he tried to tell them pompey was no damn good crummp crummp for him the bombing of richmond was like being under a mediumheavy artillery bombardment except it didnt last so long it wasnt that he had no fearanybody who wasnt afraid when things were blowing up nearby was crazy and mrs featherston had raised no fool but he like most of the soldiers in town had faced such horrors before his chiefest wish was to be able to shoot back for civilians thoughfor negroes for women for the old and the youngthe raid had to seem like the end of the world screams rose into the night those of the panicked side by side with those of the injured then secondary screams went up as the panicked discovered the injured and the dismembered and the dead civilians had no notion of what high explosives and sharpedged fragments of flying metal could do to the human body courtesy of the yankees they were learning bombs or no bombs somebody had to do something to help jake got out from under his bench as if he were leaving a dugout to serve his howitzer under fire he passed by a groaning black man to bandage a cut on a white womans head more bombers roared past up above he could hear them but couldnt see them nohe could see one for smoke and fire were trailing from it getting brighter every second the antiaircraft guns ringing richmond werent entirely useless then only pretty much so the stricken bomber nosed down and dove it seemed to be coming right at him he flattened himself out on the street absentmindedly knocking down the woman hed just bandaged too the bombs the aeroplane hadnt had the chance to drop exploded when it crashed a block away he got picked up and slammed down again right on top of the woman it wasnt anything erotic he scrambled off her the houses where the bomber had crashed were burning furiously through the chaos he heard the fire alarm bell from capitol square it made him throw back his head and laugh thanks for the news he shouted thanks for the goddamn news never would have known it without you i dont like it paul andersen said peering across nomansland toward the confederate lines those bastards are too damn quiet yeah chester martin took out his entrenching tool and knocked some bricks that had probably been part of a chimney out of the way if he had to flatten out in a hurry he didnt want to land on them one thing about the roanoke front is they never give anything up cheap and they always hit back any way they can you got that right andersen nodded emphatic agreement this past while though martin went on they havent been counterattacking they havent been shelling usmuchtheyve just been sitting there whenever they do things they havent done before i dont like it its liable to mean theyll do something else they havent done before and thats liable to mean yours truly gets his ticket punched andersen nodded again two years o this shit and hardly a scratch on either one of us either im leading a charmed life and youre all right too on account of you hang around with meor else its the other way round you know what i dont want to find out which yeah me neither martin said weve seen a hell of a lot of people come and go he scowled he didnt want to think about that too many men dead in too many horrible ways somebodys observation aeroplane buzzed overhead it was too high up for martin or anyone else on the ground to tell whether it belonged to the usa or the rebels that didnt stop specs peterson from raising his springfield to his shoulder and squeezing off a couple of rounds at it what the hell you doing martin demanded what if its on our side who gives a damn peterson retorted i hate all those flyboy bastards ward be a lot cleaner if they werent up there spying on us if its a reb good riddance if its one of our guysgood riddance too martin reminded himself the aeroplane was too high for rifle fire to have any chance of hitting it if specs wanted to work out some anger by blasting away at it why not and evidently it belonged to the csa anyhow us antiaircraft guns opened up on it puffs of black smoke filled the air all around the biplane like every other small boy ever made martin had tried catching butterflies in flight with his bare hands the antiaircraft rounds had about as much luck with confederate aeroplanes as hed usually had going after butterflies every once in a while though every once in a while hed caught one and every once in a while antiaircraft guns knocked down an aeroplane he let out a yell thinking this was one of those timessomething red and burning came out of the aircraft and hung up there in the sky then he swore in disappointment so did paul andersen its only a flare the corporal said yeah martin said ruefully i really thought theyd nailed the son of a bitch he eyed the observation aeroplane with sudden suspicion what the hell are they doing shooting off flares theyve never done anything like that before a moment later the confederates gave him the answer the eastern horizon exploded with a roar that he thought would have made the famous krakatoa volcano sound like a hiccup one second everything was quiet as it had been for so long the next hell came down on earth along with everybody else in the trenches he scrambled for the nearest bombproof he could find some limey cartoonist had drawn one where a soldier was saying to his buddy well if you knows of a better ole go to it the rebs had got the slogan from the limeys and us soldiers from the rebs for anybody on either side whod ever been in a trench it summed up what life under fire was like men started banging on empty shell casings which meant the rebs were throwing gas along with all their other lovely presents trying to fumble a gas helmet out of its canvas case when he was jammed into a dugout with twice as many soldiers as it should have held was not one of the things chester martin enjoyed most but he managed somebody who couldnt manage started coughing and choking and drowning for good air but martin couldnt do anything about that except curse the confederates he couldnt even tell who the poor bastard getting poisoned was the bombardment went on for what felt like forever it covered miles of the front the rebs didnt stick to the trenches right up against the barbed wire either they gave it to the us positions as far back as they could reach and they had more heavy guns firing along with their damned threeinchers than had been so during the first year of the war during a lullwhich is to say when the rebs were going after us guns rather than frontline troopsmartin shouted to paul andersen well now we know why they were so goddamn quiet for so long andersen nodded mournfully they were savin it up to shoot off at us all at once a couple of miles to the west something blew up with a thunderous roar loud even through the surrounding din there went an ammo dumpstuff we aint gonna be able to shoot back at em yeah and its a shame too martin frowned next question is are they just shelling the hell out of us or are they going to come over the top when all this lets up thats a good one andersen said no way to know till we find out before long martin became sure in his own mind the confederates were coming theyd never laid on a bombardment like this one before he heartily hoped theyd never lay on another one either andersen reached the same conclusion get ready for the hundred and fortyfirst battle of the roanoke or whatever the hell this one is he said they both laughed back when the war was new theyd joked about how many battles this valley had seen theyd seen all of them small and big alike martin had the feeling this was going to be one of the big ones sneaky as usual the rebels halted their barrage several times only to resume a few minutes later catching us defenders out of their shelters and slaughtering them the real attack though was marked by long bursts of machinegun fire from the confederate trenches supporting the soldiers who were moving on the us lines up martin screamed up up lets get em hed come up before and counted himself lucky not to have been killed now he stood in the wreckage of the trench line blinking like a mole or some other animal not used to the light of day the barrage had blown most of the parapet to hell and gone and a lot of the wire that had stood in front of it too he could look out across nomansland at the confederate soldiers running toward him if he could see them they could see him he dropped to one knee and started shooting specs peterson did the same thing beside him but then pointed off to the left and hollered barrel a barrel it was but not a us barrel martin hadnt known the rebs had any of their own they were picking a good time to spring the surprise too he watched the ungainly contraption go into a trench and climb out the other side it looked to climb even better than the ones made in the usa though it seemed to carry fewer guns as far as he could tell the one specs had spotted was the only one close by he wondered how many of the stinking machines the confederates had altogether getting up and trying to find out didnt strike him as the best idea hed ever had he shoved a fresh clip into his springfield peered over the sights to find a reb to shoot at and the bullet caught him in the left arm just below the shoulder aww shit he said loudly without that hand supporting it the muzzle of the springfield dropped he fired a round into the dirt almost at his feet sarge is hit specs peterson shouted he quickly wrapped a bandage around the wound then tugged martins good arm over his shoulder lets get you the hell out of here sarge yeah martin knew he sounded vague everybody said a wound didnt hurt when you first got it as far as he was concerned everybody lied his arm felt as if hed had molten metal poured on it he knew too many people in toledo to whom that had happened he tried to wriggle the fingers of his left hand but couldnt tell whether he succeeded or not getting him the hell out of there turned out to be hell of its own kind the confederate bombardment had pasted the communications trenches along with everything else plenty of other wounded men were trying to get to the rear too and plenty of men who werent wounded as well jesus peterson said struggling through the chaos all around the whole fucking line is coming to pieces martin was less interested than he might have been putting one foot in front of the other so he wasnt a dead weight took all the concentration he had the bandage specs had slapped on him was red and dripping somewhere back toward the rear a couple of men with red cross armbands took charge of him go back to your unit private one of them said to peterson if i can find it specs answered if theres anything left of it good luck sarge he turned around and trotted toward the sound of the fighting before martin could answer he spoke to the stretcherbearerswho bore no stretcherinstead how is it hed meant his wound but they had other things on their mind its a hell of a mess sergeant one of them answered as they helped him stumble westward away from the firing they drove a hell of a lot of barrels through up to the north and down south of us too with those bastards on their flanks a lot of our infantry just caved in as if to demonstrate the truth of that several unwounded soldiers trotted past them a military policeman shouted a challenge several shots rang out martin didnt see the panicked soldiers coming back his way which meant theyd shot first or best and were still running its a disaster is what it is the second stretcherbearer said theyre liable to push us all the way back to the rivermaybe over it for gods sake even through the blazing agony of his wound that got through to martin the usa had spent two years and lives uncounted to drive the confederates back to the roanoke river and then over it if they lost all that in one battle he stumbled just then jarring his arm hed only thought he hurt before the battered landscape turned gray before his eyes he tasted blood from where his teeth had bitten down too hard on a scream whatever hed been about to say disappeared burned away by shrieking nerves when they got him to the field hospital the stretcherbearers exclaimed in dismay because it was dissolving like lots wife in the rain evacuation somebody yelled somebody else added were gettin the hell out before the rebs overrun us by luckand maybe because since he wasnt on a stretcher he didnt take up much roommartin got shoved aboard an ambulance jouncing west over the shellpocked track toward the river was a special hell of its own he couldnt look out only at the other wounded men shoehorned in with him maybe that was a blessing of sorts he couldnt see how many confederate shells were falling on the road how many others throwing up water from the roanoke river as they searched for the bridge engine roaring flat out the ambulance sped across the driver whooped triumphantly when he got to the other side made it he of course was still in one undamaged piece martin couldnt decide whether he was glad he hadnt been blown up or sorry flora hamburger stood on a little portable stage in front of the croton brewery on chrystie street the brewery was a block outside the fourteenth ward but still in the congressional district whose boundaries didnt perfectly match those used for local administration she thought she would have come here even had it been outside the district the associations the brewery called up were too perfect to ignore two years ago she called out to the crowd two years ago from this very spot i called on president roosevelt to keep us out of war did he listen did he hear me did he hear the will of the people the farmers and laborers who are the united states of america no people shouted back to her some in english some in yiddish it was a proletarian crowd women in cheap cotton shirtwaists men in shirts without collars and wearing flat cloth caps on their heads not bourgeois homburgs and fedoras or capitalist stovepipes no flora agreed two years ago the socialist party spoke out against the mad specter of war did teddy roosevelt and his plutocratic backers heed us did they pay the slightest attention to the call for peace no people yelled again too many of the womens shirtwaists were mourning black no flora agreed once more and what have they got with their war how many young men killed she thought of yossel reisen who hadnt had the slightest notion of the ideological implications of the war in which hed joinedand who would never understand them now how many young men maimed or blinded or poisoned how much labor expended on murder and the products of murder is that why troops paraded through the streets behind their marching bands they wanted victory someone shouted the someone was herman bruck strategically placed in the crowd hed borrowed clothes for the occasion the fancy ones he usually wore being anything but suited for it victory flora exclaimed bruck was doing everything he could to help her beat the appointed democrat that she had to give him victory this time it was a question a mocking question she looked around as if she thought she would see it close by where is it washington dc has lain under the confederates heavy hands since the first days of the war we have won a few battles but how many soldiers has general custer thrown away to get to tennessee and how many battles were shown to be wasted when the confederates only two weeks ago drove our forces back to the roanoke river how can anyone in his right mind possibly claim this war is a success applause poured over her like rain two years ago when shed urged the people here not to throw the united states onto the fire of a capitalist imperialist war shed been ignored or booed even in the socialist strongholds of new york city now people had seen the result of what theyd cheered to the skies having seen it they didnt like it so well she went on my distinguished opponent mr miller will tell you this war is a success why shouldnt he tell you that its made him a success he was a lawyer no one had ever heard of till governor macfarlane pulled his name out of a top hat after congressman zuckerman died and sent him off to philadelphia to pretend to represent this district friends comrades you know i wouldnt be standing here today if myron zuckerman were alive no i take that back i might be standing here but id be campaigning for him not for myself but i tell you this if you remember what congressman zuckerman stood for youll send me to philadelphia this november not a fancypants lawyer whos made his money doing dirty work for the trusts more applause loud and vigorous in preparation for her speech party workers had done a fine job of sticking up election posters printed in red and white on black all over the brewery the synagogue across the street and even the school at the corner of chrystie and hester the democrats had more money and more workers which meant they usually put up more posters and hired people to tear down the ones the socialists used to oppose them not this time though and no hulking soldiers circle goons lurked to break up the rally either as the fighting heated up more and more of themthe younger oneshad been called into the army they so loudly professed to love and as the remembrance day riots of slowly faded into the past the lid on new york city politics slowly loosened socialists elsewhere in the country were using government repression in new york as a campaign issue too embarrassment was often a good tool against the minions of the exploiting class a couple of caps went through the crowd before long they jingled as they passed from hand to hand party workers talked that up come on folks give what you can this is how we keep the truth coming to the american people this is how we beat the democrats this is how we end the war flora descended from her platform a couple of menboys ratherand a couple of solidly built women who looked like factory workers disassembled it and hauled it off to the wagon on which it had come from socialist party headquarters conscription had hit the party as hard as anyone else herman bruck made his way out of the crowd flora wondered how and why hed been lucky enough to stay in gabardine and worsted and tweed and out of the greengray serge most men his age wore her brother david was in greengray and from his latest letter about to be shipped off to one of the fighting fronts if the war went on long enough the same thing would happen to isaac who was two years younger so how had herman escaped it wasnt as if he had a job in an essential industry on the contrarya lot of socialist activists had been conscripted in spite of employment in industries related to the war asking him would have been rude but she almost asked anyhow before she could he said that was a fine speech hearing you out in the crowd instead of being up on the platform with you i see how you came to be our candidate i think youll win she knew he had an ulterior motiveseveral ulterior motives some personal some politicalfor speaking as he did but she was no more immune to flattery than any other human being ever born thank you she said i think i will too the bad news in the war does nothing but help us it reminds the people that we opposed the fighting from the start and that we were right when we did brucks mouth twisted down her record on opposing the war was sounder than his but then a sly glint came into his eye when they do elect you youll have the salary of a capitalist a year what will you do with all that money any notion of asking him why he wasnt in the army flew out of her head shed thought about winning the election and about taking her seat in the house of representatives up till that moment she hadnt thought about getting paid for her services herman bruck was right was a lot of money ill be able to make sure my family doesnt want for anything she said at last he nodded thats a good answer wouldnt it be wonderful if all the families herehis wave encompassed the entire districtdidnt want for anything nu thats why youre running the sly look returned to his face and now youll have another reason to say no when i ask you out what would a rich and important lady see in a tailors son flora snorted one thing i see in a tailors son is someone who nags like a grandmother if i ask you out maybe youll say no but maybe also youll say yes herman answered if i dont ask you out how can you possibly say yes she had to laugh as she did so she was more tempted to let him persuade her than she had been for a long time this didnt seem to be the right place though not with the crowd drifting away after the rally and here came a couple of policemen looking like oldtime us soldiers in their blue uniforms and forage caps all right miss hamburger youve had your speech one of them said in brisk tones no one gave you a bit of trouble during it or before it and ill thank your people not to give me trouble now no trouble because of what she asked warily the cop didnt answer a couple of his friends came down chrystie street one of them twirling a nightstick on the end of its leather strap and then a shiny new white truck the same sort the army used pulled to a stop in front of the croton brewery instead of being greengray it was painted red white and blue democratic party of new york city said the banner stretched across the canvas canopy another smaller banner below it read daniel miller for congress out of the back of the truck jumped half a dozen men in overalls a couple of others handed them big buckets of paste longhandled brushes and stacks of freshly printed posters on the front of every one was millers smiling face half again as big as life and the slogan help tr win the war vote millervote democratic into the buckets went the brushes matteroffactly the work crew went about the business of smearing fresh paste over floras posters that had gone up only the day before she stared in mute outrage that did not stay mute long they cant do that she snarled at the policeman oh but they can miss hamburger he answered respectful enough but not giving an inch they will its a free country and we let you have your posters and your speech and all but now its our turn up went daniel millers posters one after another free country flora said bitterly some of the last of the crowd shed drawn were hanging about watching with anything but delight as her message was effaced if she shouted to them theyd resist these paperhangers new york city had seen political brawls and to spare since the rise of the socialists but after remembrance day the year before could she contemplate another round of riots another round of repression dont even let it cross your mind the cop said he had no trouble thinking along with her well land on the lot of you like a ton of bricks and hell will freeze over before you get yourself another peaceable rally i promise you do you mean we the police or we the democratic party she demanded the policeman just stared at her as if the two were too closely entwined to be worth separating in fact that wasnt as if coppers could harass the socialists and so could democratic agitators and hooligans her party could return the favor but only on a smaller scale she glanced at herman bruck if he was ready to raise hell to keep the democrats from silencing her posters neither his face nor his body showed it maybe hed avoided the army by the simple expedient of being afraid to fight or maybe she admitted to herself hed simply done a good job of figuring out how likelyor how unlikelythey were to succeed here democrats are free she told the policeman socialists and republicans and other riffraff are as free as the democrats let them be he stared steadily back at her a big stolid man doing his job and doing it well and not worrying about the consequences of it maybe in honest truth not even seeing that those consequences were bad inside half an hours time daniel millers posters had covered every one of hers flying was beginning to feel like work again jonathan moss eyes went back and forth up and down flicking to the rearview mirror mounted on the side of the cockpit he looked back over his shoulder too again and again it was the one you didnt see whod get you sure as hell he still felt out of place flying to the right of dud dudley that was tom innis slot in the flight no one elses or it had been but tom was pushing up a lily now with a rookie pilot named orville thornley sleeping on the cot that had been his thornley got endless ribbing because of his first name but he didnt seem to be the worst flier whod ever come down the pike a good thing too moss said his eyes still on the move the limeys had managed to sneak a few sopwith pups across the atlantic and if you were unlucky enough to run up against one of them in a martin onedecker odds were the war department would be sending your next of kin a telegram in short order a pup was faster more maneuverable and climbed better than the bus he was riding and the british had finally figured out how to do a proper job with an interrupter gear just thinking about the pup was plenty to make him grimace good thing they dont have very many of em here he said itd be a damn sight better if they didnt have any at all damn navy asleep at the switch again that was not fair he knew it wasnt fair he didnt care the atlantic fleet had been built to close the gate between britain and canada and to help the high seas fleet open the gate between germany and the usa it hadnt managed to do either of those things among them the british the french and the confederates made sure none of the atlantic was safe for anyone at any time and the germans remained bottled up in the north sea too bad moss thought too damn bad he looked down the front over which he flew was quiet now nobody doing much of anything the canucks and the limeys had run out of steam after pushing the us line four or five miles farther from toronto and the army hadnt yet tried pushing back it was as if the mere idea of having had to fall back so startled the brass they hadnt figured out what to try next dud dudley waggled his wings and pointed off toward the west lets go home he meant and swung his fighting scout into a turn moss wasnt sorry to get away from the line not if that meant another run where he didnt meet any pups a year before the enemy had been terrified of the martins and their deadly synchronized guns now for the first time he understood how the fliers on the other side of the line had felt no sooner had the thought crossed his mind than a single aeroplane dove at his flight from the rear machine gun spitting flame through the prop disk he threw the joystick hard over and got the hell out of there the flight exploded in all directions like a flock of chickens with a fox in among them tracers stitched their way across orville thornleys bus it kept flying he kept flying and he was shooting back too but jesus jesus how could you keep your gun centered on the other guys aeroplane when he was thirty miles an hour faster than you were the short answer was you couldnt the longerbut only slightly longeranswer was if you couldnt you were dead moss maneuvered now to help his flightmate trying to put enough lead in the air to distract the limey bastard in the pup from his chosen prey he couldnt keep a bead on the enemy aeroplane everything theyd said about it looked to be true if it wasnt doing hed eat his goggles you couldnt make a martin do if you threw it off a cliff and climbthe enemy pilot came out of his dive and clawed his way up above the us machines as if theyd been nailed into place and here he came again yes he still wanted thornley hed probably picked him for easy meat last man in a flight of four would be either the worst or the least experienced or both the kid was doing his best but his best wasnt good enough the pup got on his tail and clung chewing at him moss fired at the limey but he was a few hundred yards off unable to close farther and he didnt think he scored any hits thornleys singledecker went into a flat spin and plummeted toward the ground below smoke trailing from the engine cowling moss didnt see thornley doing anything to try no matter how uselessly to bring the aeroplane back under control no time to worry about that now anyway the pup was like a dragonfly darting everywhere at once spitting fire at the american aeroplanes from impossible angles bullets punched through the canvas of the fuselage none of them punched through moss none of them started a fire for which he would have got down on his knees and thanked godbut he had no time for that either and then as swiftly and unexpectedly as it had appeared the terrible pup was gone darting back toward the enemy lines at a pace that would have made pursuit impossible even had the shaken americans dared to try maybe the bus had run low on fuel that was the only thing moss could think of that might have kept it from destroying the whole flight what would have stopped it it had the american aeroplanes outnumbered one against four landing was glum as it always was after losing a flightmate what happened one of the mechanics asked pup moss said laconically the fellow in the greasy overalls bit his lip they really as bad as that worse one word at a time was hard enough more would have been impossible along with dudley and phil eaker moss went into shelby pruitts office the squadron leader looked up at them he grimaced as the mechanic had he asked what happened to thornley instead of answering directly dudley burst out god damn it to hell when the devil are we going to be able to sit our asses down in an aeroplane thatll give us half a chance to go up there and come back alive not one of these flying cart horses that isnt fast enough to go after the canucks and isnt fast enough to run away from em either all of that came out in one long impassioned breath on the inhale dudley added sir major pruitt looked down at his desk the flight leader had told him what he needed to know pup he said it was not a question yes sir moss spoke this time one pup against the four of us those aeroplanes are very bad news sir how many do the canucks have like dud says how long till we get something that can stand up to them they dont have many pruitt said we know that much they arent manufacturing them on this side of the water either not yet anyhow what do you suggest we do gentlemen only go up in squadron strength so we can mob them when we come across them moss and his flightmates looked at one another what that meant was they werent going to get an aeroplane that could stand up to the pup not tomorrow they werent and not the day after either slowly dud dudley said that might help some sir wed pay a bundle for every one we brought down but we might bring some down sure enough once they ran out of em thingsd be like they wereexcept wed be missing a hell of a lot of pilots i wish i could tell you you were wrong but i dont think you are pruitt said shaking his head and itll all be wasted effort too if the limeys get another shipload of em over here the germans now the germans have aeroplanes that can match these pups and whatever the froggies are throwing at em we were supposed to get plans for some of em i hear but the submersible that set out with them didnt make it across the atlantic these things happen and how many of us are going to end up dead because they happen moss burst out the question had no exact answer it didnt need one the approximate answer was quite bad enough eaker said what do we need the germans for anyway why cant we build our own aeroplanes good as any in the world we invented them i know we did pruitt answered up till the start of the war ours were as good as anybodys too but the germans and the french and the british theyve all been pushing each other hard as they could ever since the guns started going off the rebs and the canucks havent done that to us not to where weve needed to come up with a new kind of fighting scout every few months because the old ones would get shot down if we kept flying em what do they call it survival of the fittest thats right weve got to worry about it now dud dudley said i know we do pruitt answered this time next year if the wars still going i expect well have aeroplanes to match anything the kaisers building once we know we need to do something we generally manage a lot of people are going to end up shot to pieces because philadelphia was slow getting the message moss said thornley was a good kid he had the makings of a good pilotif hed had a decent bus to fly and if the fellow in the pup had decided to go after me instead of him i dont even run this whole aerodrome let alone the bureau of aeroplane production hardshell pruitt got up from his swivel chair which squeaked he led the three survivors of dudleys flight to the officers club threw a quartereagle down on the bar and carried a bottle of whiskey over to a table as moss started to drink he looked over at the photographs of fliers dead and gone one more to put up he thought and then wondered whether orville thornley had had a photo taken since he joined the squadron moss didnt think so thornley hadnt been here very long moss gulped down his drink if he tried hard enough maybe he could stop thinking about things like that maybe he could stop thinking at all when lucien galtier came in from the fields the sun was going down as summer slid into fall it set ever sooner rose ever later the air hadnot quite a chill but the premonition of a chillit hadnt held even a couple of weeks earlier pretty soon frost would fern across the windows when he got up in the morning marie came bustling out of the farmhouse to meet him before he came inside she didnt usually do that automatically he began to worry any change in routine portended trouble a lifetimes experience and a cultural inheritance of centuries warned him that was true so did his wifes face what is it now he asked her and picked the two worst things he could think of have we had a visit from father pascal while i was cultivating or is that the american major quigley was here no neither of those for which i thank le bon dieu marie answered but it is all the same something of which i wish to speak to you without having any of the children hear she looked down to make sure none of their numerous brood was in earshot lucien did the same thing of course our trying to keep them from hearing but makes them try the more to hear he said again from long experience but what is it that you would keep a secret from them not from all of them not quite marie took a deep breath when she spoke the words tumbled out all in a rush nicole just came home from the hospitalshe did not look at the big building the americans had run up on galtier land she made a point of not looking at itand she she she asked permission of me to bring to supper tomorrow night one of the doctors who works there osti lucien said softly once and once only he stomped a booted foot on the ground i knew it would come to this did i not say it would come to this when she went to work at that placehe not only did not look at the hospital he refused even to name iti knew it would come to this his name is odoull marie said pronouncing the unquebecois appellation with care he speaks french nicole says and he is himself a member of the holy catholic churchso she assures me he is himself a member of the united states army lucien retorted since that was manifestly true marie could only nod her husband went on the people in ottawathe protestants in ottawahad the courtesy more or less to leave us alone the americans merely by their coming are taking from us our patrimony i did not tell nicole yes and i did not tell her no either marie answered i told her i would tell you and that you would decide galtier opened his mouth to declare that he had already decided and that the answer was and would always be no before he did so though he cast a quizzical eye on marie she knew everything hed said and knew it at least as well as he did more cautiously than hed expected he asked why did you not say no on your own behalf marie let out a long sigh because i fear the americans will remain here in quebec for a long time to come and i do not believe we shall be able to make it as if they do not exist and because i do not believe that nicole would come to know any fondness for a man who is wicked even if he is an american and because one supper here in front of the lot of us is not the end of the world and it could even be that seeing thisman odoull here in our own place not at the other one where she works would be the best way to convince her he is not the proper one yes i had good reason to be cautious lucien thought aloud he said and if i still believe this should not be then it shall not be of course his wife replied at once she was always properly submissive and she usually got her way she would get her way this time too it could even be galtier said in a speculative voice that seeing all of her family will have a chilling effect on this dr odoull he smiled remembering this is often true when a man who is not serious meets a young ladys family you have reason marie answered smiling too let us go in now and tell nicole she may bring him then very well lucien said it wasnt very well or anywhere close to being very well but he seemed to have no good choices whatever in that he thought of himself as a tiny version of the entire province of quebec nicole squealed when marie told her lucien could not make himself do anything more than nod she might invite the doctor for supper georges said ah so i am to have an american brotherinlaw nestce pas nicoles face turned the color of fire she threw a potato at him it thumped against his ribs grinning still he said i am wounded the doctor must cure me and thrashed about on the floor charles his older brother said nothing not with words but the look he sent lucien said father how could you galtiers shrug showed how little true choice he had had nicoles three younger sisters couldnt seem to decide whether to be horrified or fascinated by the news galtier went through the next days work as if he were a machine wound up to perform its tasks without thought his mind had already leapt to the evening and to the meeting with the american odoull in his mind he ran through a dozen a score of conversations with the man whether any of them would have anything to do with reality he had no idea but he played them out all the same he looked up in some surprise to see the sun near setting time to go in he realized on most days a welcome thought but today one so much the opposite that he looked around for more chores to do talking with the american in the privacy of his own mind was one thing talking with the man in the real world was a different far more daunting prospect he wiped his boots with special care even so he knew he brought the aromas of the farmyard into the house with him how could he help it knowing he could not help it knowing he was not the only one on the farm who did it he thought nothing of it most of the time now now there in the parlor sat a tall skinny stranger in town clothes he was talking with nicole and doing what looked to be his gallant best not to be upset at having her brothers and sisters stare at him he sprang to his feet when lucien came in so did nicole father she said formally i would like to introduce to you dr leonard odoull leonard this is my father monsieur lucien galtier i am very pleased to meet you sir odoull said in good french the parisian accent with which hed learned the tongue overlain by the rhythms of the quebecois with whom hed been working galtier took that as a good sign a sign of accommodation he could not imagine major quigley sounding like a quebecois if he stayed in this country a hundred years odoulls hands were pale and soft but not smooth the skin on them was chafed and reddened and cracked in many places some of those cracks looking angry and inflamed doctors had to wash often in corrosive chemicals to keep their hands free of germs as for the rest of the doctor he looked like an irishman fair skin with freckles sandy hair almost catgreen eyes a dimple in his chin so deep a plow might have dug it he was unobtrusively sizing up galtier as the farmer examined him i do thank you very much for letting me come into your home he said i know it is an intrusion and i know it is ahe cast about for a wordan awkwardness for you as well he was frank lucien liked him the better for that well we shall see how it goes he said i can always throw you out after all father nicole exclaimed in horror but one of odoulls gingery eyebrows lifted he knew galtier hadnt meant that seriously again against his will galtiers opinion of the doctor went up marie served up potatoes and greens and ham cooked with prunes and dried apples lucien got out a jug of applejack hed bought from one of the farmers nearby he hadnt expected hed want to do that odoull though even if he was an american seemed a man of both sense and humor he also made appreciative noises about maries cooking which caused her to fill up his plate once more after hed demolished his first helping the second disappeared as quickly georges made a show of looking under the table where does such a scrawny fellow put it all he asked i have a secret pocket like a kangaroo odoull answered gravely georges blinked unused to getting as good as he gave when supper was done and the womenfolk went off to wash and dry the american handed cigars to lucien and charles and georges lucien poured more apple brandy for them all salut he said raising his glass and then experimentally before drinking je me souviens i will remember the motto of quebec in the face of many difficult times this one more than most he was not surprised to see that leonard odoull understood not only the words but also the meaning behind them the american doctor drank the toast then said i understand how hard this is for you and i thank you again for being so hospitable to an outsider galtier had had enough applejack by then to loosen his tongue a little he said how can you understand down deep and truly you are an american an occupier not one of the occupied my homeland is also occupied odoull answered england has done more and worse for longer to the irish than she ever did to quebec he spoke now with absolute seriousness my grandfather was a starving boy when he came to the united states because all the potatoes died and the english landowners sold the wheat in the fields abroad instead of feeding the people with it we are paying back the debt the irish rebellion has not thrown out the english galtier said no but it goes on and ties down their men odoull replied it would be better if the us navy could bring more arms to them but boats do put in at little beaches every now and then in spite of what the british fleet can do to stop them and machine guns arent so big and bulky you say this here to a country that might rise in revolt against the united states as ireland has against england even with applejack in him lucien would have spoken so openly to few men on such brief acquaintance fewer still among the occupiers but while the doctor might disagree lucien did not believe he would betray him to the authorities odoull said you will be freer with the united states than you ever were in canada it has proved true for the irish it will prove true for you as well this i believe with all my heart charles who usually kept his own counsel said few countries invade their neighbors for the purpose of making them free we came into canada to beat the british empire odoull answered blowing a smoke ring they and the rebels stabbed us in the back twice but i think truly you will be better off outside the empire than you were in it if we left canada if we left the british empire of our own will then it could be you are right lucien said anyone who forces something on someone and then says he will be better for ityou will i hope understand me when i say this is difficult to appreciate it could be you said the same thing when your mother gave you medicine when you were small odoull replied yes it could be lucien said with dignity he continued but monsieur le docteur you are not my mother and the united states are not quebecs mother if any country is it is france all right i can see how you would feel that way m galtier odoull got to his feet i do thank you and your wife and your enchanting family for the fine supper and for your company as well is it possible that i might come back again one day drink some more of this excellent applejack and talk about the world again and we might even talk of other things as well if you will pardon me one moment i would like also to say goodbye to nicole she was one of the other things the american would want to talk about galtier knew he felt the pressure of his sons eyes on him almost to his own surprise he heard himself saying yes this could be next week perhaps or the week after that until the words were out of his mouth he hadnt fully realized he approved of the doctor in spite of his country and his ideas well he thought the arguments will be amusing nother day done praise de lord jonah said when the shiftchanging whistle blew i see you in de mornin nero see you then scipio agreed he was very used to his alias these days sometimes even thinking of himself by it he wiped his sweaty forehead on the coarse cotton canvas of his shirt another day done indeed and a long one too the white foreman stuck his card in the time clock to punch him out of work he trudged from the factory onto the streets of columbia a free man even after three months or so at the munitions plant he had trouble getting used to that idea his time was his own till he had to get back to work in the morning hed never known such liberty not in his entire life as house servant and later as butler at marshlands hed been at the white folks beck and call every hour of the day or night as a member of the governing council of the congaree socialist republic hed been at cassius beck and call no less than at miss annes before now now he could do as he pleased if he wanted to go to a saloon and get drunk he could if he wanted to chase women he could do that if he wanted to go to a park and watch the stars come out he could do that toothough columbia still had a ten oclock curfew for blacks and if he wanted to go back to his apartment and read a book he could also do that and not have to worry about getting called away in the middle of a chapter he walked into a restaurant not far from the factory ordered fried chicken and fried okra and cornbread washed it down with chicorylaced coffee and came out full and happy nobody knew who he was nobody cared who he was oh every now and then he still saw wanted posters for the uncaptured leaders of the congaree socialist republic and his namehis true namestill appeared among them but that hardly seemed to matter it might have happened a lifetime before to someone else altogether had cassius understood that desire to escape the revolutionary past it probably would have been enough for him to want to liquidate scipio out in the swamps by the congaree cassius and his diehards kept up a guerrilla war against confederate authority even yet every so often the newspapers complained of some outrage or another the rebelsthe papers commonly called them banditshad perpetrated but the papers talked much more about the bill to arm negroes under debate up in richmond people talked about it too both white and black the talk had only intensified once it cleared the house and got into the senate more than half of the black men scipio knew were for it as best he could judge fewer than half the whites in columbia were how much his judgment was worth he had trouble gauging when he got back to his apartment building he let out a heartfelt sigh of relief now that he no longer had to pay half his salary to the white clerk whod hired him he could afford something better than the dismal flophouse where hed endured his first nights in columbia the place was shabby but clean with gas lights and a bathroom at the end of the hall it had cockroaches but not too many and his own astringently neat habits gave them little sustenance coming up the corridor from the bathroom the mulatto woman who had the apartment across the hall from his smiled evenin nero she said evenin miss sempronia he answered he thought she was a widow but he wasnt sure he didnt pry into the business of others not least because he couldnt afford to have anyone prying into his that smile though and others hed got from her made him think he wouldnt have to run very fast if he decided to chase her he went into his own apartment and closed the door after him it was getting dark early these days though hed left the drapes open he had to fumble to find the matches hed set on the shelf near the gaslight he struck one and got the lamp there going that gave him the light he needed to start the lamp above his favorite chair since the apartment boasted only one chair that made the choice easier than it would have been otherwise but it was comfortable so he didnt complain if the upholstery was battered well so what this wasnt marshlands i am however not the tiniest bit dissatisfied with my present circumstances he said softly in the starchy whitefolks voice he hadnt used more than a couple of times since the red uprising broke out he smiled to hear himself now that he wasnt used to it any more that accent struck him as ridiculous on the rickety pine table beside the chair lay a battered copy of flauberts salammbo hed picked up for a nickel he opened it almost at random and plunged in he wondered how many times hed read it more than he could count on his fingers he was sure of that most literate negroes in the csa had read salammbo a good many times the story of the revolt of the army of darkskinned mercenaries against carthage after the first punic war struck a chord in the heart of the most peaceable black man he grimaced and sighed that revolt had failed too he kept reading anyhow when the cheap loudly ticking alarm clock hed bought said it was a little past nine he carried a couple of towels and a bar of soap down to the bathroom one thing years of being a butler had done made him more fastidious than most factory hands white or black in the csa the weather was still warm enough for him to find a coldwater bath invigorating how hed feel about that when winter came around he didnt want to think next morning the alarm clocks clatter got him hopping out of bed heart pounding as if confederate soldiers were bombarding the apartment house he dressed made himself coffee breakfasted on bread and jam and made a sandwich of bread and tinned beef to throw in his dinner pail thus fortified he walked the half a mile to work the dinner pail brushing his left thigh with every step he took a lot of black men in overalls and collarless shirts and heavy shoes were on the street he might have been invisible among them some like him went bareheaded some wore homemade straw hats as if they still labored in the fields some wore cloth caps like most white factory hands not many white factory hands were left though supervisors youngsters not yet ripe for conscription wounded veterans no longer fit for the front and a few others with skills or pull enough to keep them out of butternut here and there men who worked in his plant waved to him and called out his nom de travaille mornin nero how you is nero the broader he made his congaree patois in answer the happier the other workers seemed hed seen that back at marshlands too it saddened himhis fellows were locking themselves away from much that was worthwhilebut he also understood it greetings flew thick and fast as he lined up to punch in hed made his own place here and felt no small pride at having done so mornin solon he said with a wave how you is artaxerxes a good mornin to you hadrian the foreman said apollonius already took off nero so i reckon you got yourself a few crates to haul there ill do it was all scipio said to which the white man nodded the fellow who worked the night shift slid out of the factory as fast as he possibly could every morning one day hed slide out too fast and have the door slammed in his face when he came back it wasnt as if the bosses couldnt find anyone to replace him sure enough several crates of empty shell casings waited to be hauled to the belt that would take them to the white women who filled them and installed their fuses and noses scipio loaded two onto a dolley and pushed it over to jonah who stood waiting to receive it when he hurried back to do more jonah shook his head dat apollonius he one lazy nigger he observed you nero you does yo work good tank you scipio said jonah as usual sounded faintly surprised to admit that no doubt because he remembered scipio from his softhanded days as a butler none of the thenfield hands had ever realized how much work scipio actually did at marshlands because so much of it was with his head rather than his hands or his back he was ready to admit headwork was easier but it was still work back and forth back and forth he got no credit for the dolly but it helped lift carry push lift carry push his hands and his muscles had hardened he didnt go home every night shambling like a spavined horse any more he knew a certain amount of pride in that he was stronger than he had been and sometimes tempted to get into fights to show off his new strength he resisted that temptation along with most others fighting might make him visible to the whites of columbia which was the last thing he wanted working with his body left his mind curiously blank he listened to what was going on around him to the clatter of the lines to the chatter of the people working them and after a while to the foreman out front are you sure you want to go back there its a dirty smelly place and parts of it are dangerous too what with the explosives and fuses and suchlike the words werent far out of the ordinary the tone was the foreman normally master of all he surveyed here sounded deferential persuasive that more than what he was saying made scipio notice his voice in the first place a moment later he understood why the foreman sounded as he did the reply came with the unquestioning uncompromising arrogance of a confederate aristocrat i am a stockholder and not a small stockholder in this corporation i have the right to see how its operations function you may guide me or you may get out of the way and let me see for myself the choice is yours scipio dropped at jonahs feet the crate he was hauling the shell casings clanked in their plywoodpartitioned pigeonholes do jesus scipio exclaimed in a horrified whisper dat are miss anne i knows it jonah answered looking at least as discomfited as scipio felt regardless of what his passbook had said he could do jonah had left marshlands for his factory job two years earlier his position was less desperate than scipios but far from what he would have wanted before scipio could make up his mind whether to hope he wasnt recognized or to flee anne colleton came in the foreman trailing after her and still trying ineffectually to slow her down as scipio knew anyone who tried to slow her down was bound to be ineffectual this area here maam the foreman said still not grasping how outgunned he was is where the casings come off the line over yonder and go to get filled over here is it anne said she nodded to the negro laborers good day scipio jonah then without another word she headed off into the filling area the two negroes looked at each other she knew who they wereshe knew and she hadnt done a thing about it that worried scipio more than anything else he could think of sylvia enos knew how drunk she was she rarely touched whiskey but shed made an exception tonight she was ready to make exceptions about lots of things tonight she giggled good thing im not going anywhere she said and giggled again i couldnt get there not going anywhere at all her husband agreed george had drunk more than she had but showed it less the whiskey wasnt making him laugh either it was just making him very certain about things his certainty had swept her along too so that she lay altogether naked beside him even though the children couldnt have been in bed more than fifteen minutes themselves if george jr came in right nowwell that would be funny too whiskey was amazing stuff all right sylvia ran her hand over georges chest the hair there so familiar and so long absent from his chest her hand wandered lower ladies didnt do such things ladies in fact endured it rather than enjoying it when their husbands touched them if george gets angry ill blame it on the whiskey she thought as her hand closed around him oh he said more an exhalation than a word nor was that the only way he responded to her touch is that what you learned in the navyhow to come to attention i mean she said he laughed then without even being asked she slid down and took him in her mouth ladies not only didnt do such things they didnt think of such things a lot of ladies had never heard of or imagined such things since she hadhis flesh was smooth and hot the whiskey she thought again being inexperienced in such things she bore down more than she should have and had to withdraw choking a little if they hadnt been married if she hadnt wanted him as much as he wanted her what followed would have been a rape as it was she wrapped her arms and legs around him while he plunged above her and whispered endearments and urged him on he shuddered and groaned sooner than she would have liked which was she supposed a disadvantage of doing as shed just done instead of pulling free though he stayed in her in an amazingly short time he was hard again the second round was almost as frantic as the first but kindled by that first time she felt all thought go away just as he spent too always like a honeymoon coming back to you after ive been away at sea he said a smile in his voice ive been at sea a long time this timeand i never even saw the ocean sylvia didnt answer right away she felt lazy and sated at peace with the world even if the world held no peace but the body had demands other than those of lust and love let me up dear she said and regretfully he rolled off her she regretted it too when he came out nothing good ever lasts that seemed to say she pulled the chamber pot out from under the bed and squatted to use it some of his seed ran out of her too that she did not mind it made getting pregnant less likely she got back into bed george stood and used the chamber pot too then lay down beside her in the darkness once more i got the telegram that said you were missing she said and she didnt couldnt go on with words instead she clutched him to her even tighter than when his hips had pumped him in and out of her as if he were the piston of a steam engine and she the receiving cylinder he squeezed her too i hid in the woods with my pals till another boat got down there to see if anybody had lived through the explosion they were the brave ones cause the rebs had that spot zeroed none of the shells hit though and we rowed out to them and they got us away from there four she said wonderingly four out of the whole crew luck george answered fool luck we were up at this colored fellows shack on the riverbank charlie white would have killed anybody who kept a place that dirty and they made the whiskey right around there you drank it you could run a gaslight on your breath i had a glass and some foodplace was dirty yeah but they cooked better than anything our galley turned outand i had some more whiskey and then i went outside and thenthe rebels dropped two right on the punishment remembering made him shiver what did you go outside for sylvia asked she meant the question casually to stand next to a tree was the answer shed expected or something of that sort george stiffened in her arms and not in the way shed found so enjoyable oh just to get a breath of air he said and she knew he was lying what did you go outside for she repeated and tried to see his face in the darkness no good he was only the vaguest blur he stayed unnaturally still a little too long was that the glitter of his eyes opening wide to try to see her expression too it wasnt anything he said at last where the whiskey had made her giddy and then randy now it made her angry what did you go outside for she said for the third time i want you to tell me the truth george sighed when sylvia breathed in as he breathed out she could smell and taste that theyd been drinking together sober he might have found a lie she would believe or else might have been able to keep his mouth shut till she got sick of asking questions hed managed that every now and then he sighed again there was another place next to this saloon or tavern or whatever you call it i was going over there but i never made it i hadnt taken more than a couple of steps that way when the shelling started another place she echoed george nodded a gesture she felt instead of seeing well why didnt you say so she demanded what kind of place was all at once she wanted to push him away from her as hard as she could you were going to a her hiss might have been more deadly than a shout yeah i was he sounded ashamed that was something a small something but not nearly enough he went on i didnt get there sylvia i swear to you its the only time i was gone that i was going that way id been away so long and i didnt know when id be back or if id ever be back he laughed which enraged her till he went on i guess god was telling me i shouldnt do things like that even once and i let you her voice was cold as the ice in the hold of a steam trawler she hadnt just let him touch her shed wanted him to touch her shed wanted to touch him she couldnt say that her body had fewer inhibitions than her tongue did her tongueshed had that part of him in her mouth and she thought shed throw up she gulped as if fighting back seasickness nothing happened george said she believed him she wanted or part of her wanted to think he was lying that would have given her all the more reason to force him away from her had he been telling the truth when he said that was the only time hed gone toor towardsuch a place again she thought so but she wondered if it mattered when you got down to the bottom of things still in that frozen voice she said something would have happened wouldnt it yes i guess it would he answered dully he wasnt trying to pretend that was something too try as she would she had trouble keeping the flame of her fury hot being apart from him had been hard on her too and shed known he wasnt a saint before she married him you were pretty stupid do you know that she said i thought so myself he answered quickly eagerly a man splashing in the sea grabbing for a floating spar if i hadnt had that second glass of whiskey i never would have done it whiskey gets you into all sorts of trouble doesnt it she said not quite so frosty now makes you go after women you shouldnt makes you talk too much when youre with the woman you should he laughed in relief feeling himself slide off the hook his thumb and forefinger closed on her nipple even in the dark he found it unerringly sylvia twisted away he wasnt that forgiven yet i was plenty stupid he said which not only agreed with what shed just said but had the added virtue of likely being truer than im sorry i hope to heaven this terrible war ends soon so you can come home and spend the rest of your days with me sylvia said and she added to herself so i can keep an eye on you shed never thought shed need another reason for wishing the war over but george had given her one he understood that too i hope theyll really send me out to sea this time he said then ill be away from everythingeverything in a dress he meantfor months at a time sylvia nodded george didnt mention what happened when sailors came into a port after months at a time at sea maybe he was trying not to think about it maybe he was hoping she wouldnt think about it if so it was a forlorn hope boston was a navy town more than one sailor had accosted sylvia on the street she did not imagine her husband was a great deal different from the common lot of men had she so imagined he would have taught her better he clutched her to him i dont want anybody but you he said now you dont she thought he gave proof with more than words that he did want her with a small sigh she let him take her he was her husband he had come home alive out of danger he hadnt quite she didnt think been unfaithful to her so she told herself but where only the speed of his explosion the first time had kept her from joining him in joy where she had done just that the second time and been as eager even as wanton then as ever in her life now though she tried though she strained though she concentrated pleasure eluded her george didnt notice somehow that hurt almost worse than anything hed told her in a while she supposed hed want a fourth round too have we got any more whiskey she asked arthur mcgregor tramped through the snow toward the barn the harvest was in and just in time freezing weather had come early this year but the livestock still needed tending he shook his head alexander should have been out here helping him but alexander still languished in the rosenfeld gaol if he ever got out sometimes now hours at a time would go by when mcgregor didnt think of his sons being freed every fiber of him still hoped it would happen how could it not happen he thought the only thing the boy did was hang about with a few of the wrong people and let his tongue flap loose not one in a hundred would be left free if you locked up everybody who did that he didnt count on it or expect it as he had right after alexanders arrest though scar tissue was growing over the hole the extraction of his son from the family had left he fed the horses the cows the pigs the chickens he forked dung out of the stalls he gathered eggs storing them inside his hat the hens pecked at his hands the way they always did when he robbed their nests the rooster couldnt have cared less all he had eyes for was his harem as splendid to him as the ottoman sultans bevy of veiled beauties mcgregors breath smoked as if hed just lighted a cigarette when he left the barn the first inhalation of cold outside air burned in his lungs like cigarette smoke too after a couple of breaths though he felt all right once winter really came down hed feel as if he were breathing razors whenever he stuck his head out of any door off to the north artillery coughed and grumbled it was farther away than it had been halfway through the summer when canadian troops and those from the mother country had pushed the yankees south from winnipeg but not south to rosenfeld mcgregor said sadly winnipeg still held though so long as winnipeg held and toronto and montreal and quebec city canada lived the americans had claimed torontos fall a good many times lies all lies what theyre good for mcgregor told the air and started back toward the farmhouse with the eggs as usual the northsouth road that ran by the farm was full of soldiers and guns and horses and trucks on the move most of the traffic heading north toward the front what went south was what didnt work any more ambulances full of broken men trucks and horses glumly pulling broken machines the more of those mcgregor saw the better he reckoned his countrys chances and here came an automobile jouncing along the path toward the farmhouse the motorcar was painted greengray even had it not been he would have known it for an american vehicle who but the americans had gasoline these days as if it had not been there mcgregor brought the eggs in to maude trouble coming he said his wife didnt need to ask him what he meant automobiles were noisy things and you could hear their rattle and bang and pop a long way across the quiet prairie americans mary said fiercely sticking her head into the kitchen lets shoot them you cant say that little one not where they can hear you mcgregor told his younger daughter you cant even think it not where they can hear you marys nod was full of avid comprehension she had an instinctive gift for conspiracy the war had brought out young in her as a hothouse could force a rose into early bloom the automobile sputtered to a stop a door slammed then another booted feetseveral pairs of booted feetcame stomping toward the door shall we open it maude whispered mcgregor shook his head as quietly he answered no well make em knock they have to know were herewhere else would we be itll annoy them by such tiny campaigns was his war against the invaders fought marys eyes glowed she understood without being told the uses of harassmentbut then she had an older brother and sister damn canucks said one of the american soldiers outside mcgregor nodded once mary giggled soundlessly quiet that was a voice mcgregor recognized captain hannebrink all the farmers pleasure at annoying the occupiers changed to mingled alarm and hope what was the man who had arrested alexander doing here he hadnt come out to the farm since the day of the arrest maude knew his voice too what does he her voice cut off in the middle of the question hannebrink was knocking at the door it was an utterly ordinary knock not the savage pounding it should have been with a car full of american ruffians out there stories said they used rifle butts not here not today mcgregor went to the door and opened it the captain nodded politely enough behind him the three private soldiers came to alertness they had rifles even if they hadnt used them as door knockers hannebrink didnt say anything not right away what is it mcgregor asked as silence stretched from behind him mary asked are you going to let my brother go hush maude said and pushed mary back to julia hissing take care of her and keep her quietnot an easy order to follow captain hannebrink coughed mr mcgregor i have to tell you that over the past few days we obtained information confirming for us that your son alexander mcgregor was in fact an active participant in efforts to harm united states army occupying forces in this military district and that he should therefore be judged as a franctireur information mcgregor said not taking in all of the long cold dry sentence at once what kind of information i am not at liberty to discuss that with you sir hannebrink said stiffly he scratched at the edge of his kaiser bill mustache careful not to disturb its waxed perfection means somebodys been filling your head up with lies and you dont have to own up to that or say who it is mcgregor said the american shrugged as you know sir the penalty for civilians resisting in arms the occupying forces is death by firing squad behind mcgregor julia gasped he heard maude stop breathing through numb lips he said and youre going toshoot him you cant do that captain there has to be some kind of appeal of hannebrink held up a hand mr mcgregor i regret to have to inform you that the sentence was carried out in accordance with us army regulations at hours this morning your sons body will be released to you for whatever burial arrangements you may care to make mary didnt understand father julia said in a halting voice she wasnt sure she understood and desperately hoped she didnt maude set her hand on mcgregors arm she knew so did he they shot him at sunrise he thought dully before sunrise it would have been dark and chilly even before they wrapped a black rag over alexanders bright laughing eyes tied him to a post or stood him up against a wall or did whatever they did and fired a volley that made him one with the darkness and ice forever the american soldiers behind captain hannebrink were very alert mcgregor would have bet theyd had this duty before and knew hell could break loose if it is any consolation to you sir the captain said he went bravely and it was over very fast he did not suffer mcgregor couldnt even scream at him to get out they had alexanders body the body that the yank said had not suffered but was now dead take it mcgregor said stumbling over the words take it to the presbyterian church hell go in in the graveyard there julia shrieked so did maryshe knew what the graveyard meant she sprang for captain hannebrink as she had for the us officer in rosenfeld when hed wanted to arrest her father mcgregor grabbed her and held her he didnt know what those narroweyed soldiers behind hannebrink might do to an attacker even an attacker who was a little girl and he didnt want to find out i shall do as you request captain hannebrink said as i told you sir i deeply regret the unfortunate necessity for this visit somebody went out and told you one more lie captain and you piled it on top of all the other lies you heard and it finally gave you enough of a stack so you could shoot my boy the way youve been looking to do all these months mcgregor said we do not believe it was a lie hannebrink said and i dont believe you mcgregor said now get out of my sight if i ever set eyes on you again maudes hand tightened on his upper arm and brought him a little way back toward himself mr mcgregor i understand that you are overwrought now the us officer said trying to be kind trying to be sympathetic and only making mcgregor hate him more on account of it he turned to his soldiers come on boys weve done what we had to do lets go all the men walked back to the ford hannebrink got in so did the private soldiers one at a time ever so warily when one cranked the engine back to life another covered him mcgregor wondered how often theyd been fired on after delivering that kind of news some people after hearing it wouldnt much care whether they lived or died he didnt much care whether he lived or died himself but he did care about maude and julia and mary his family all the family he had left he turned back to his wife tears were running down her face he hadnt heard her start crying he was crying too he suddenly realized he hadnt noticed that start either they clung to each other and to their daughtersand to the memory of their son alexander maude whispered her faced pressed against his shoulder alexander he echoed slowly his mind raced ahead look ahead look behind look aroundif you didnt look at where you were you wouldnt have to think about how bad things were here at the focused moment of now he saw alexander laid to rest in the churchyard the grass there already sere and brown he saw past that his son had saidhad no doubt said up until the very moment the rifles firedhed had no part in the things he was accused of doing mcgregor believed him someone had lied then someone had lied to bring him to death before sunrise someone probably whose son really had done the things alexander stood accused of doing and wanted to see the mcgregors suffer along with him no matter how unjustly whoever it was mcgregor figured he could find him sooner or later an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth and the americans had believed the lie they must have known it was a lie but they hadnt shot anybody lately and maybe they needed examples to keep the canadians quiet whatever their reasons he vowed they werent going to keep him quiet theyd shot alexander for a franctireur he hadnt been one mcgregor was sure of that down to the marrow of his bones but in shooting him theyd made themselves a franctireur all right im twenty years out of the army he murmured maude stared at him she would know what he was thinking he didnt care not now he didnt hed forgotten a lot of things over half a lifetime or so if he had to use them again though he expected theyd come back soon enough having wished that after so long in river monitors he might go back to sea george enos was repenting of his decision he had gone to sea in fishing boats since before the time when he needed a razor going to sea in a destroyer was an altogether different business as he was discovering day by day its like youve ridden horses all your life and they were the horses the brewery uses to haul beer barrels to the saloon he said to andy conkling who had the bunk under his then one day they put you on a thoroughbred and they tell you youll do fine because what the hell its a horse conkling laughed at him he had a round red face and a big kaiser bill mustache so that he put george in mind of a clock with its hands pointing at ten minutes to two he said yeah she does go pretty good dont she you might say so enos answered a new england understatement that made his new friend laugh again to back it up he went on she cruisesjust idles along mind youat fifteen knots no boat ive ever been on could do fifteen knots if you tied down the safety valve and stoked the engine till it blew up not brewery horses conkling said mules maybe donkeys yeah george said and the ericsson gives us what going flat out thirty knots just under at the trials some other boats in the class made it but shell give twentyeight easy conkling told him fifteen felt plenty fast to enos he stared out at the atlantic racing past under the destroyers keel the uss ericsson was a bigger more stable platform than any steam trawler hed ever sailed displacing over a thousand tons but the waves hit her harder too and besidesyouve got to remember im just off a river monitor after that any ocean sailing is rough business those things are snapping turtles andy conkling said disdainfully this here is a shark from what enos had seen and heard deepsea sailors had nothing but scorn for the rivermonitor fleet from what hed seen aboard the punishment the monitors didnt deserve any such scorn trying to convince shipmates of that struck him as a good way to waste his breath he kept quiet in a thoughtful tone of voice conkling went on of course this here is a little shark thats why we need to be able to run so damn fast to get away from the big sharks on the other side yeah enos said again he looked out across the endless sweep of the atlantic once more that was no idle sightseeingfar from it spotting smoke on the horizonor worse a periscope perilously closemight mean the difference between finishing the cruise and sliding under the waves as smoking refuse the limeys are out there looking for us too you bet your ass they are chum conkling said they dont want us running guns to the micks they dont want it in a really big way if they can theyre gonna keep us from doing it i know about micks enos said coming out of boston id damn well better know about micks if the ones on our side of the ocean cant stand england what about all the poor bastards over there living right next to it no wonder they rose up no wonder at all at all conkling said winking to make the brogue hed put on seem funnier he set a finger by the side of his nose and no wonder the good old kaiser and us we all got to give em as big a hand as we can hell of a mess over there if half what you read in the papers is true george said though that was by no means guaranteed shooting and sniping and bombs on the bridges and the ulstermen massacring all the catholics they can catch and the catholics giving it right back to em and more limeys tied down there every day sounds like englands got to do it now andy conkling made himself sound serious as if he were a navy department bigwig back in philadelphia they let the irish go and we or the germans put men in there thats curtains for the king and they know it damn well i dont know it enos said the kaiser cant supply soldiers in ireland when the germans send guns to the irishmen they have to do it by submarine and look at us sneaking in like were going to bed with somebody elses wife dont suppose we can go at it any other way not in englands back yard say youre right conkling replied i dont think so but say you are how come englands making such a big todo over something that cant happen a lot of times people make a big todo over things that didnt happen for about the hundredth time george wished he hadnt had to tell sylvia where hed been going when the punishment was wrecked i was drunk when i went and i was drunk when i told her he thought that tells me i shouldnt get drunk she still blamed him for what he hadnt done she probably wouldnt have been much angrier if he had gone and done it which made part of him wish he had only part though mehitabel looked back on in memory rather than at with desire wasnt much smoke poured from the ericssons four stacks george thought the design was ugly and clumsy but nobody cared what a sailor thought the destroyer picked up speed fairly leaping over the ocean getting close to wherever were going conkling remarked yeah george answered nobody bothered telling sailors much of anything either ireland the crew knew but only a handful knew where theyd stand off the coast of the emerald isle officers and petty officers went up and down the deck be alert one of them said we need every pair of eyes weve got another added a third a grizzled cpo growled if we hit a mine on account of one of you didnt spot it ill throw the son of a bitch in the brig that drew a laugh from conkling and a moment later after hed worked it through one from enos as well he said if theyve laid mines how the devil can we spot em going as fast as we are the monitor i was on just crawled along the mississippi and we had a sweeper go in front of us when we thought the rebs had mined the river turtles conkling said again that didnt answer georges question after a few seconds he realized the question wasnt going to get answered that probably meant you couldnt spot mines very well when you were going full speed ahead an imperfectly reassuring idea land ho somebody shouted george stared eastward sure enough in a couple of minutes he saw a smudge on the horizon too big for a smoke plume and too steady to be a cloud after a moment he realized that if he could see land people on land could also see the ericsson someone might be tapping on a wireless key or cranking a telephone even as he stood on the deck in which case the boat would have visitors soon moved by that same thought andy conkling murmured the limeys on shorell take us for one of their own always have before whether that was expectation or mere pious hope george didnt know he did know it was his hope pious or not landing parties to the boats a petty officer shouted enos hurried to the davits he had more practice in small boats than most of the men aboard the ericsson and less experience on the destroyer herself that made him a logical man for the landing party each boat had a small gasoline engine in the stern and each was packed with crates that bore no markings whatsoever enos scrambled up into a boat steer between loop point and kerry head the petty officer told him and his five comrades ballybunions where youre going on the south side of shannonmouth past the lighthouse youll know the place by the old castlea big square gray ugly thing im told not hardly what you think of when castle goes through your head your chumsll be waiting for you a little west of the castle good luck hoists lowered enos boat and two more into the sea they rode low in the water those crates werent stuffed with feathers george got the motor going and steered for the distant land jesus said one of the sailors in the boat with him a big squarehead named bjornsen i feel naked in something this small italians go fishing out of t wharf back home every day in boats smaller than this george said crazy damn dagos bjornsen muttered and fell silent should have taken along a line and some hooks enos said might have brought back something the cooks could have fried for our supper he peered down into the greengray sea wonder what they have in the way of fish over here that sparked another couple of sentences from bjornsen fish is one thing i just hope they havent got any cooked goose loop point boasted a lighthouse enos hoped nobody was staring down from it with a pair of field glasses if somebody was staring down from it with a pair of field glasses he hoped his boat and the two chugging along behind it looked enough like little local fishing boats to draw no notice the land was low and muddy and not particularly green in spite of irelands fabled reputation here and there george spotted stone houses with turf roofs they looked little and cramped and uncomfortable a small step up from a sodbuster shack out on the prairie he wouldnt have wanted to live in any of them a petty officer named carl sturtevant had a map theres the cashen river inlet he said pointing to a stream that as far as george was concerned wasnt big enough to deserve to be a river a couplethree miles to ballybunion ballybunion castle had at some time in the distant past had part of one wall blown out of it making it worthless as a fortification enos saw it only in the distance closer some men were waving cloth caps to signal to the boats there they are he said happily yeah those should be our boys sturtevant agreed if those aint our boys were in a hell of a lot of trouble shit if the limeys were wise to us they wouldnt waste time with no ambush said bjornsen a born optimist theyd haul a field piece out behind a haystack wait till we got close and blow us so high wed never come down he glanced at those anonymous crates one hit would do the job up brown i calculate the men in baggy tweeds came trotting toward the boats out from behind a haystack came not a british field gun but several carts weve got more toys here than they can haul away in those george said as his boat beached thats their worry sturtevant said he and the other sailors enos among them started unloading the crates god bless you one of the irishmen said his comrades were lugging the americans presents to the carts he had a present himself a jar with a cork in it have a nip o this lads quickly the jar went from sailor to sailor the whiskey tasted different from what george was used to drinking but it was pretty good he took a long pull when he swallowed he felt as if hed poured lava down his gullet the irishmen didnt water it to make it stretch further as bartenders were in the habit of doing wise in the ways of the sea the irishmen helped the sailors shove the boats back into the water some calling thanks in brogues so thick enos could barely make them out free of the crates the boats bobbed like corks he headed out to sea once more out toward the ericsson how about that sturtevant said we just bit the king of england right in the ass now all we have to do is see whether we got away with it george said he wished the boat would go faster will you look at that crazy son of a bitch vic crosetti burst out sam carsten looked the sandwich islander in question was indeed crazy as far as he could tell the fellow was skimming over the waves toward shore standing upright on a plank maybe nine or ten feet long and a foot and a half or two feet wide why the devil doesnt he fall off and break his fool neck sam said you wouldnt even think a monkey could do that let alone a man yeah youre right crosetti said but i aint gonna let him hear me call him a monkey hed break me in half that was undoubtedly true the surfrider who came up onto the beach with the plank on his head was a couple of inches above six feet and muscled like a young god which was all the more evident because he wore only a dripping cotton loincloth dyed in bright colors hey pal carsten said and tossed him a dime thats a hell of a ride you had there crosetti coughed up a dime too thank you both very much gentlemen the fellow said like a fair number of his people he talked like an educated englishman which made it hard to treat him like a nigger his skin was only a couple of shades darker than crosettis anyhow where did you learn to do that anyway sam asked the moment the words were out of his mouth he realized hed been stupid too late to do anything about it then of course that was the way the world worked the native laughed at him it wasnt a snotty laugh it was a friendly laugh maybe because the surfrider was a friendly guy maybe because he knew better than to get himself in trouble squabbling with the us navy both sam judged the fellow said having grown up here in honolulu with the sea as my neighbor so to speak it was a sport i acquired as a boy i confess i can see how surprising it might appear to those born in other climes other climes yeah carsten said while vic crosetti did his best which wasnt any too good to keep from snickering as always every inch of sams flesh the sun touched was cooked red and juicy how come you talk so damn fancy crosetti asked this is how english was taught to me the sandwich islander said with another shrug since you americans came here i have learned the language may be spoken with a number of different accents havent heard anybody here whos got quite as much mush in his mouth as you do crosetti said was he looking for a fight in spite of denying it before he hadnt had that much to drink yet he and sam had only just come on leave from the dakota the surfrider sighed you must understand gentlemen that under the previous administration my father was assistant minister for sugar production thus enabling me to acquire rather better schooling than most of my contemporaries sam needed a moment to realize that under the previous administration meant when the british ran the show he needed another moment to realize something else your father was assistant whatdoyoucallit and you took our dimes christ on his cross i bet you can buy and sell both of us and hardly even notice youve done it it may be so but for one thing we hawaiianswe prefer that to sandwich islanders if it matters to youhave discovered expediency to be the wiser course in dealing with the occupying authorities had i refused your money you might have thought i was insulting you with results unpleasant for me the fellows smile revealed large gleaming white teeth and besides you both chose to reward me for my skill out of what i know to be your small pay especially in wartime acts of kindness and generosity should not be discouraged lest they disappear altogether off the face of the earth whew carsten couldnt remember the last time anybody had done that much explaining you ought to be a chaplain uh john liholiho at your service the surfriders bow could have been executed no more smartly had he been wearing top hat cutaway and patentleather shoes rather than gaudy loincloth and bare feet and with whom have i had the pleasure of conversing carsten and crosetti gave their names crosetti plucked at sams sleeve whispering listen do you want to spend the time chewing the fat with this big galoot or do you want to get drunk and get laid we got a fortyeight vicdont have to be back on board ship till day after tomorrow sam answered also in a low voice god knows its easy to find a saloon and a piece of ass in this town but when are you going to run across another real live aristocrat ahh you want to be a schoolteacher when you grow up crosetti snarled in deeply unhappy tones but he didnt leave he hooked his thumbs into the pockets of his tropical white bellbottoms and waited to see whether sam could make standing on the beach banging his gums with a native more interesting than a drunken debauch john liholiho peered over toward the jutting prominence of diamond head while the two sailors talked with each other the presumably british school hed attended had trained him in more things than an uppercrust accent he showed very plainly that he was not listening to a conversation not intended for him carsten wished most of the sailors he knew had a matching reserve instead of being snoops he didnt really know how he was going to make this more fun than getting lit up and having his ashes hauled either after a little thought he asked so how do you like it living under the stars and stripes the sandwich islanderno matter how he thought of himself that was how carsten thought of himfrowned you do realize of course that this is a question on which circumspection might be the wisest course for me seeing sam hadnt the slightest idea what circumspection was he translated his english into english i might be wiser to keep quiet or lie what am i going to do shoot you sam said laughing crosetti plucked at his sleeve again he shook off his pal liholiho gave him a serious look two friends of my fathers of whom i know for certain have suffered this fate it does give one pause on the other side of the coin the protectorate the british exercised over these islands was also imperfectly humane mr carsten would you prefer to be thought of as a bloody wog or a nigger since sam had been thinking of john liholiho as a nigger not ten minutes before he had to work as hard at keeping his face straight as when he was raising on a pair of fives in a poker game anybody called me either one of those things id punch him in the teeth yeah now vic crosettis attention was engaged i get called a fuckin dago or a wop thats bad enough people seldom call me these things to my face though i have heard nigger in a mouth or two since you americans came the surfrider seemed to have a british sense of precision too he went on what one is called however sometimes matters less than how one is seen if the powers that be reckon one a wog or a nigger one is not apt to be taken seriously regardless of the potential value of ones contributions thats too complicated for me carsten said thinking he should have headed out and got drunk after all but crosetti got it hes saying its like hes an ordinary sailor and hes trying to convince an admiral he knows what hes talking about john liholiho beamed at him mr crosetti i am in your debt you americans and our former british overlords do tend to look at race as if it were rank dont youyourselves being admirals by the very nature of things i shall have to use the analogy elsewhere a sandwich islander as near naked as made no differencewith whom would he use an analogy whatever an analogy was sam gathered it meant something like comparison but it was another word he didnt think hed ever heard before then carsten remembered that even though john looked like a savage he was a local bigwigs son that he had to think twice before the fellows station came to mind went a long way toward making his point for him dipping his head again the brownskinned man said and now if you will excuse me he turned and carrying his surfriding board trotted out into the pacific once in the water he climbed up onto the board lay on his belly atop it and used his arms to paddle farther from shore sam turned to vic crosetti all right now we can have all the fun we want to that didnt take real long and it was sort of interesting yeah sort of crosetti stared out at john liholihos receding shape i bet hes a limey spy he sure talks like a limey spy dont he he talks like a limey anyway carsten answered but so what even if he is a spy hows he going to get word off the island and if youre going to start seeing spies under every bed if i look under a bed crosetti said with great assurance its to make sure i can hide there if her husband comes home before hes supposed to both men laughed and headed into town to see what kind of damage they could do to the fleshpots there reggie bartlett trudged wearily into wilson town sequoyah seeing houses around him felt strange after so long on the prairie with no humanmade artifacts close by but the occasional oil welland the trenches and the shells and the other appurtenances of war lieutenant jerome nicoll called we got to hold this town boys aint a whole hell of a lot of sequoyah left to us and we have to hang on to what there is not let the damnyankees run us out of the whole state remember the germans dont hold all of belgium even now i aint seen any germans in sequoyah nap dibble said sweat cut ravines through the dust caking his face you see any o them damn huns reggie yankees is bad enough but them folks havent seen any germans nap bartlett answered hed long since figured out nap while a good fellow wasnt what anybody would call sharp when dibble lined up in front of the paymaster he signed his name with an x no wonder hed be on the lookout for germans smack in the middle of sequoyah we have to save this town lieutenant nicoll repeated a shell crashed down a few hundred yards off to the left arguing that the confederate soldiers didnt have to do any such thing bartlett would have been more impressed with the speech if the lieutenant hadnt said the same thing about duncan which had fallen several weeks before hed heard the same kind of speech on the roanoke front too there it had sometimes presaged a retreat like this one and sometimes a counterattack that left dead men piled high in exchange for retaking a couple of hundred yards of chewedup worthless ground nicoll tried something new pointing south he spoke in dramatic tones there are the people who depend on us to protect them as far as reggie could see the people of wilson town werent depending on the confederate army for any such thing a lot of houses already looked to have been abandoned more folksindians whites a handful of negro servants and laborerswere throwing whatever they could into buggies and wagons and hightailing it south toward the texas line sergeant pete hairston spat in the dust of the road if the damnyankees want a pack of damn redskins theyre welcome to em far as i can tell werent for the oil round these parts hell id give sequoyah to the usa and say youre welcome to it will you look at that bartlett pointed to a sidecurtained grocery wagon and to the tall graybearded man in a black suit and homburg who was instead of loading things into it selling things from it crazy jew peddler doesnt he know hes liable to get blown to hell any minute he raised his voice to a shout hey you hymie that got the peddlers attention he wasnt just big he looked strong and tough too in spite of those snowy whiskers vot you vant he asked his voice waryno matter how tough he was he had the brains not to argue with anybody toting a tredegar youd better get out of here before you get killed bartlett told him oh dot vot you talk about the peddler shrugged soon i go hairston made moneycounting motions business is good huh he laughed damn fool jew money aint worth your neck the jew muttered something under his breath reggie didnt think it was a compliment he didnt think it was english either which was likely to be just as well if he didnt understand it he didnt have to notice it that made something else occur to him hey hymie you sell a lot to the indians around here a lot yes the peddler answered is most of folk how do you talk to em bartlett asked the jew stared at him not following the question he tried again what language do you use when you sell to them oh the jews face lit with intelligence they speak henglish same like me reggie burst out laughing from what little hed seen of them most of the local chickasaws and kiowas spoke english better than the peddler go on get the hell out of here hairston said and the peddler not without a sigh or two of regret for business lost scrambled up into the wagon and rattled south out of wilson town almost the last one to leave it methodically the troops of lieutenant nicolls company began to dig in nap dibble said wish them niggers what was in this town wouldve stayed a bit they could have done this here entrenching for us back on the roanoke front we had us lots of nigger labor battalions reggie said as he made the dirt fly havent seen so much of that here out west aint that much of it sergeant hairston said like i been tellin you since you got here bartlett aint that much of anything except yankees reggie said yeah except them hairston agreed but they aint got any morenwell aint got a whole lot morenwhat we do cept maybe soldiers except reggie said again he dug and dug steady as a steam shovel the ground was the perfect consistency not so hard that he had to labor to force his entrenching tool into it not so soft or muddy that the edges of the trench he was digging started falling down into what hed already dug he flipped the dirt up in front of his excavations to form a parapet wish we had some more barbed wire he scooped out another couple of shovelfuls wish we had any barbed wire wish for sugarplums for christmas while youre at it sergeant hairston said oh we may get some wirewe had a good bit in front o duncan once wed stayed there a while but this here aint the roanoke frontthat kind of good stuff dont grow on trees here i just told you that a couple seconds ago dammit aint you listenin to me yeah sarge i always listen bartlett answered so mildly that hairston went back to digging for another stroke or two before giving him a dirty look reggie grinned back a grin that had occasionally softened even the yankee prison guards in west virginia he looked around not to see if the yankees were coming or the chickasaws getting the hell out but to spot his company commander now that the fightings picked up again whats the lieutenant going to do for his hooch damned if i know as if reminded of what hed traded to the men in greengray for lieutenant nicolls supply of whiskey hairston rolled himself a cigarette he sucked in smoke before going on hope nothin bads happened to toohey he aint a bad guy after another drag he chuckled crazy sayin that about one of those yankee bastards but its so i know what you mean sarge reggie replied fellow who captured me there in the roanoke valley he could have shot me and my pals easy as not i ever run into him once this damn war is over he can do all the boozing he wants ill buy till he cant even see let alone walk the sporadic yankee shelling had been falling short of wilson town so much so that the confederate soldiers had gone on about the business of digging in without pausing at the explosions a couple of furlongs to the north now suddenly the us gunners began to find the range hearing the hideous whistle of a shell that might have his name on it reggie dove headlong into the stretch of trench hed just dug the round hit behind him fragments and shrapnel balls hissed through the air one of the lead spheres with which the shell had been loaded drilled a neat hole in the dirt hed heaped up in front of the trench it would have drilled a neat hole in him too he got back up and started digging again a hoarse shout from the southern edge of town made him turn his head the jewish peddler didnt care for artillery close by he was getting his horses up to a gallop so he could escape wilson town in jig time others who had lingered the last few now delayed their departure no more reggie laughed look at em go he said pointing after a moment though it didnt seem funny if two guys are in a dangerous place and one leaves while the other stays which one of em is stupid hairston laughed too but singularly without humor thatd be funny bartlett if only it was funny you know what i mean yeah sarge i do wish to jesus i didnt bartlett looked out across the broad sequoyah prairie here come the damnyankees i dont think they think were ready for em yet yeah well if they dont theyre gonna be real sorry real fast hairston said the artillery fire supporting the men in greengray who trotted forward got heavier but it didnt turn into anything that would have been reckoned worse than harassment back in virginia here and there a confederate soldier shrieked or abruptly fell silent forever blasted from man to butchershop display in the blink of an eye but most of the cs troopers crouched down in the field fortifications theyd been digging and waited for the yankees to get closer so they could sting the enemy hard reggie wouldnt have wanted to be trudging through that yellowed autumn grass waiting for the machine guns to open up on him he wondered how much experience the damnyankees up there had were they brave men advancing into what they knew would be awful or raw fish too ignorant to tell they were heading for a fish fry in the end it didnt much matter theyd kill him or hed kill them war reduced everything to a brutal simplicity closer closera couple of confederate riflemen opened up on the yankees men in greengray started dropping most not because they were hit but to keep from getting hit others kept coming forward running now not trotting as if they knew they didnt have much time to do before they were done by raising his rifle to his shoulder bartlett picked one he pulled the trigger at the same time as the first machine gun began spraying precisely measured death at the us soldiers more and more of the men in greengray were falling and taking cover had little if anything to do with it a couple of hundred yards off to the left the second confederate machine gun joined its satanic chattering to that of the first more and more yankees toppled none of the foe got within a hundred yards of the position the confederates had chosen to defend as the attack finally broke down cold rain began falling on us and cs troops alike looking west reggie saw more and more clouds rolling his way he pointed in that direction and said looks like weve got ourselves a new commanding officer what are you talkin about pete hairston asked general winter bartlett answered hairston did a double take but then he nodded if the rain kept coming the way it looked as if it would nobody on either side would go anywhere fast not for a good long while maam lieutenant nicholas h kincaid loomed over nellie semphroch may i speak to you for just a minute maam what do you want nellie knew her voice was cold and did nothing to warm it speaking with the confederate officer whod seduced her daughter or so shed thought of it not that edna would have needed much seducing was the last thing she wanted whatever it is youd better make it snappy were goin to be busy very soon i expect yes maam i know that maam thats why i came here so early maam kincaid stood there holding his butternut slouch hat in both hands he kept twisting it every which way though he didnt seem to notice he took a deep breath held it so long he began to turn red and then blurted maam me and your daughter wed like to get married maam nellies head whipped around there stood edna stacking cups on the countertop by the coffeepots so she and nellie could serve a lot of coffee in a hurry ednas face wore what nellie could think of only as an idiot grin thats right ma she said and the grin got wider youre too young nellie said automatically im oldern you were when you got married her daughter retorted and i sure do want to marry nick there it was the first time shed called kincaid thatno the first time nellie had heard her call him that when she did he started grinning an idiot grin too and she was right nellie had been younger than edna was now when her name abruptly became semphroch her name had had to change abruptly edna are you in a family way she demanded lieutenant kincaid turned red the blush starting at his collar and rising all the way to his forehead edna indignantly tossed her head i am notno such thing she answered and i ought to know too when kincaid heard that he got even redder all right nellie knew when to beat a retreat shed been in a family way when she got married though she didnt think edna knew that the less edna ever found out about her unsavory past the better shed like it maam your daughter and i we really do love each other kincaid said earnestly well be happy together for the rest of our lives i know we will if i laugh at him hell get angry at me and so will edna nellie made herself hold her face still it wasnt easy hed managed to get ednas corset off her once maybe more than once nellie admitted to herself she didnt know for sure about that and both of them had liked what followed so they thought theyd be happy together forever nellie knew better shed learned better the hard way she wanted to pass on what shed learned but they wouldnt listen she knew they wouldnt listen the only way anyone learned those lessons was the hard way off in the middle distance artillery rumbled lately days didnt go byhours hardly went bywithout that sound in the air it reminded nellie of her second biggest problem with lieutenant nicholas h kincaid after his being a man edna she said as gently as she could hes a confederate do you want to go down there to live by the way she said down there she might have been talking about dropping into hell for a visit now edna turned bright red like every child in the usa since the war of secession shed been taught to think of confederates as the enemy with a capital e that hadnt worried her when kincaid started sniffing after her but maybe she hadnt faced even in her own mind all the implications of what marrying him would mean i love him she said defiantly you think you can stay here in washington the rest of your days nellie asked the artillery rumbled again louder this time how much longer do you think the csa can hold on here well hold washington kincaid said president wilson said it was our capital by rights and well keep it president semmes says the same thing so thats how itll be he thrust out his already prominent chin as if to stay the yankee hordes with the granite contained therein nellie thought about mentioning the jawbone of an ass but forbore what she did say was you confederates have said a lot of things that havent come true what makes you think thisll be any different dont you rag on him ma edna said shrilly when nellie heard that tone of voice from her daughter she knew the game was lost edna would do whatever edna intended doing and nothing and nobody would stop her my god nellie thought how am i going to explain this to mr jacobs the daughter of a spy for the united states running off and marrying a confederate officer hed never trust nellie again edna of course hadnt the slightest idea nellie was a spy for the usa a good thing too nellie thought shed never imagined life could get so complicated knowing it was weak she tried a new card suppose i say no kincaid didnt answer which told nellie the card was even weaker than shed thought hed seemed so polite shed hoped a refusal might make him go away edna did reply firmly ma wed run off nick knows this chaplainhe told me so kincaid blushed again but after a moment nodded edna went on you cant stop us and you know it you got to sleep sometime youd leave me to run the coffeehouse all by my lonesome nellie asked shifting with the changing breeze as adroitly as a politician its too much for one person its too much for two people sometimes hire yourself a nigger edna told her ma you know youre making good money you can hire a couple of niggers easy again that was probably true kincaid said edna honey when we get back down into my countryhe spoke as if to assure her the csa was far superior to this benighted northern landyou wont have to lift a finger youll have niggers doing all your work for you nellie did laugh then she couldnt help it niggers doing all your work for you edna on a lieutenants pay she said likely tell besides arent the confederate states buzzing like a hornetsnest about how niggers arent going to be like servants no more i dont reckon thatll come to anything lieutenant kincaid said he sounded none too confident though and he said not a word about how easy keeping negro servants on a junior officers pay would be that relieved nellie shed feared he would announce that his father owned a plantation stretching halfway across alabama and that what he got from the confederate war department was less than pocket change to him before the argumentthe losing argument nellie was convincedcould go on the door to the coffeehouse opened the bell above it chimed a fierce smile of triumph lighted ednas face ma she said sweetly why dont you go take care of mr reach there not five minutes earlier nellie had wondered how life got so complicated now she wondered if god had decided to show her she didnt know what complicated meant sure as hell there was bill reach folding himself into a chair at a table by the window he looked the same as he always had since hed returned all unbidden to nellies life dark unkempt clothes stubbled chin and cheeks bleary eyes as she went up to him she heard lieutenant kincaid say i never did fancy that fellow not from the first time i set eyes on him edna giggled i think hes one of mas old beaus nellies back stiffened hello little nell reach said when nellie reached his table edna giggled nicholas kincaid chuckled nellie steamed speaking very softly she said if you ever call me that again i will tell the confederate occupying authorities exactlyexactly do you hear mewhat you are those bleary eyes widened me im not anything much he said but the certainty that usually informed his gravelly voice was missing you heard me nellie whispered i dont ever want to see you round here again either in normal tones she went on now whatll it be cup of coffee couple fried eggs and buttered toast reach said his tone grudging he smelled of whiskey ill be right back nellie told him as she started frying the eggs and toasting the bread lieutenant kincaid said maam can you give me your answer maam he sounded plaintive as a calf calling for its mother no nellie snarled the rebel officer looked as if shed kicked him edna set a hand on his arm itll be all right nick dont you worry about it none shes just my mother she aint my jailer and she cant hold me back when i go with you not if i go with you nellie noted when i dont know what this world is coming to she said when children dont pay any attention at all to the people who brought them into this world in the first place edna didnt answer she kept staring at lieutenant kincaid as if shed just invented him nellie sighed and slipped a metal spatula under the eggs to turn them in the pan she repeated what shed said a moment before i dont know what this world is coming to lieutenant kincaid leaned over and pecked edna on the lips he set his hat back on his head tipped it to nellie and went out of the coffeehouse whistling dixie loudly and offkey isnt he wonderful no nellie snapped a couple of other confederate officers came in nellie pointed their way you take care of them she slid the eggs out of the frying pan took the toast from the rack above the fire in the stove spread butter on it poured coffee and carried bill reach his breakfast here you are thatll be a dollar ten he winced slightly but laid down a dollar and a quarter dont worry any about the change he said he spread salt and pepper liberally over the eggs before he began to eat then he looked up at her back in those days i didnt know you could cook too she glared do you think i wont turn you in she said in a low savage voice you better think again my daughter is going to marry a confederate officer and then to her helpless horror she began to cry are you all right ma edna came rushing over she looked daggers at bill reach whatd he do hearing that the two confederate officers jumped to their feet they were nothing if not gentlemen nellie waved everyone away its all right she insisted im justhappy for you thats all shed told edna a lot of lies for the foolish girls own sake after so many what was one more doubtfully edna retreated the rebs settled back into their seats in a halfapologetic mumble bill reach said hal told me not to come around here any more then why didnt you listen to him nellie said she sat down at the table with reach which made edna stare in surprise but succeeded in convincing the confederates nothing was wrong now that i found you i cant stay away from you reach answered he started to reach out to set his hand on hers but stopped when she made as if to pull away he sighed then coughed all these years all that water over the dam and i never forgot even a little of what we did and i knew it had to be the same for you she wanted to cry some more or maybe scream if hed been mooning after her since before edna was bornthat made him crazy was what it did try as she would she had trouble remembering him at all from those longago days just another face just another cockbut nowadays he was the usas numberone spy in washington she wondered if the people to whom he fed his information knew he was on or over the ragged edge he got to his feet tipped his battered black homburg and said ill see you again nellie one day before too long his walk to the door was slow and deliberate as if he was daring her to tell the rebs who he was he hadnt called her little nell she kept quiet but he hadnt taken any notice when shed told him to go away and stay away either what am i going to do she thought she had no more answer for that than for what is the world coming to sir the truck driver in greengray said to lieutenant straubing packing what should have been a title of respect with all the scorn he could it aint right us white men working alongside niggers he set hands on hips and glared at cincinnatus who happened to be the black man closest to him see here murray straubing said you will do as you are ordered or you will face military punishment then we will wont we boys murray turned for support to the new truck driverswell over half the unitwho had joined the transport company to replace the men killed wounded or captured in the confederate raid south of berea kentucky he was a little skinny bandylegged fellow with a narrow face a receding chin a beaky nose and a shock of red hair all in all he reminded cincinnatus of an angry chicken but he had backers the new men in the unit were fresh out of the usa a lot of them probably had never seen a negro before coming down to covington let alone thought of working alongside oneor rather a good many more than one dont want to maybe trust my life to a coon one of them said hear tell some of them get paid moren white men another added aint nobody can tell me thats proper cincinnatus looked over to herk the two of them had escaped the rebel raiders together and had shared what food they could steal and what miserable shelter they could find till they came upon a us outpost herk hadnt treated cincinnatus like a nigger then of course herk had needed him then now the white man stood silent as a stone when cincinnatus needed him you men are making a mutiny lieutenant straubing warned a courtmartial will take a dim view of that murray who had enough mouth for any three men laughed out loud no courts going to say anything but that white men are better than niggers sir and thats the truth under the tan hed got from going out with his trucks straubing turned pale cincinnatus heart sank his guess was that murray knew what he was talking about without much conscious thought cincinnatus and the rest of the black truck drivers bunched together the whites with whom theyd been driving stood apart from them those whites didnt go over with the new men who backed murray but they didnt support their colored comrades either reds are right cincinnatus thought bitterly csa and usa its the same thingwhites are so mystified they put race ahead of class thats your last word murray lieutenant straubing demanded tensely when the redheaded driver nodded straubing hurried out of the warehouse depot biting his lip a chorus of jeers rang out behind him as if chasing him away get you black boys hauling like mules the way god made you to murray said to the negro truck drivers the men at his back nodded dont know why you so down on us cincinnatus said we just doin our jobs makin our pay feedin our families doing white mans work murray snapped like lieutenant kennan he looked to be one of those us whites who hated negroes more savagely than any confederate did not least because he was so much less familiar with them than confederates were cincinnatus who had been driving a truck in the csa before the war broke out thought about pointing his old job out to the damnyankee but he didnt think it would help and kept quiet the door to the depot flew open in strode lieutenant straubing followed by a squad of soldiers carrying bayoneted springfields straubing pointed to murray arrest that man he snapped charges are insubordination and refusal to obey lawful orders two of the men in greengray stomped up to murray who looked comically amazed one of them grabbed him by the arm come on you he snapped murray perforce came straubings gaze traveled over the other new drivers anyone else he asked in a voice that held nothing but ice a couple of drivers stirred where they stood vasilievsky heintzelman you are under arrest too same charges as murray come on you two lugs one of the soldiers straubing had brought said when neither driver moved for a moment you wont like it if we have to come and get you i promise numbly their eyes wide with shock the two white men obeyed anyone else lieutenant straubing said again none of the new drivers moved or spoke as cincinnatus had seen other soldiers do they tried to disappear while standing in plain sight straubing nodded very well he turned to the men hed called take those three to the stockade murraythis fellow hereis the ringleader i will prefer formal written charges when i have the time which i dont right now these shenanigans are liable to make me late and i wont stand for that saluting the soldiers led murray heintzelman and vasilievsky out of the depot the three drivers looked as if they were standing in front of white trucks bearing down on them at thirty miles an hour none of them could have been more astonished than cincinnatus hed associated lieutenant straubings uncommon easiness on matters of race with a certain weakness evidently hed been wrong straubing glanced over toward the new truck drivers who hadnt been arrested as if they were puppets controlled by the same puppeteer they stiffened to attention if this sort of nonsense happens again straubing said pleasantly it will make me angry do you gentlemen want to find out what happens when i get angry no sir the drivers chorused good straubing said now that we understand that i am going to give you the idea behind what were doing here what were doing here is moving supplies from the riverside here down to the fighting front anything that helps us do that is good anything that hurts is bad if a man does his job i dont careand you wont careif he is black or white or yellow or blue if he cant or wont i will run him out of here if you are white and i order you to work with a negro who is doing his job you will do it if you are white and i order you to work beside a trained unicorn who is doing his job you will do that too again do you understand me yes sir the new drivers said in unison then lets get on with it lieutenant straubing said we are going to have to press harder than we would have thanks to this idiocy you would be safer blaspheming the holy ghost than you would tampering with my schedule as the drivers went off to their vehicles cincinnatus approached straubing and said thank you kindly suh the white man looked almost as nonplused as murray had when he was arrested i suppose youre welcome cincinnatus he answered after a moment but i didnt do it for you sir i understand that cincinnatus said i do you straubing broke in i wonder i did it for the sake of the united states army you negroes have shown you can do this job and if you do it white men dont have to and we can put rifles in their hands i would sooner have taken on more of you but this new contingent got sent to me instead well see what we can make of them uh yes sir cincinnatus said straubing was indeed a good deal less sentimental more hardheaded than hed reckoned the lieutenant went on and no one who deserves to keep his rank badges will let himself be disobeyed even for an instant is there anything else before you get to work no suh cincinnatus said maybe instead of being kindly and sentimental straubing was the most coldblooded human being hed ever met so coldblooded that he didnt even get excited about matters of race matters cincinnatus had thought guaranteed to stir the passions of every man white or black yankee or confederate cincinnatus went out to tend to his truck there a couple of vehicles over stood herk fiddling with the driversside acetylene lamp on his own machine he nodded to cincinnatus then went back to getting the reflector the way he wanted it he didnt even notice he hadnt backed cincinnatus and the other colored drivers when murray started running his mouth cincinnatus couldnt help scowling and then slowly his anger faded herk did his job he let cincinnatus do his job too and didnt fuss about that if he did so much did cincinnatus have any business expecting more i can hope cincinnatus mumbled that made herk look up from what he was doing but only for a moment cincinnatus sighed he might hope white men would treat him the same as they treated one of their own but a lifetime had taught him he had no business expecting it black roustabouts hauled crates from the wharves toward the line of trucks with them came lieutenant kennan raving at them to work harder harder nobody put kennan under arrest for abusing blacks but he was following us orders not disobeying them as murray had done if he might have got more work from his crew without the abusewho cared no one in authority that was certain with another sigh cincinnatus cranked his whites motor into rumbling life lieutenant straubing let him do his job too in the scheme of things that wasnt so bad it could have been worse and he knew it private ulysses hansen looked around once upon a time probably this was real pretty country he said not any time lately another privatesergeant gordon mcsweeney couldnt see whoanswered the whole squad with the exception of mcsweeney chuckled silence in the ranks mcsweeney said and silence he got all proper and according to regulation he looked around at what had been a northeastern arkansas pine forest and was now a wasteland of jagged stumps and downtumbled branches that it might once have been beautiful hadnt occurred to him he hadnt particularly noticed how hideous it was at the moment either it was country that had once held the enemy but was now cleared of him that was all no not quite all it was country that led to land the enemy still infested captain schneider came bustling along past the company as the soldiers trudged south and east schneider nodded toward gordon mcsweeney not so pretty as it used to be is it sergeant he said no sir mcsweeney answered stolidly the company commander outranked him and so could say whatever he pleased as far as mcsweeney was concerned schneider went on trouble is the damn rebs knew we were coming so they baked us a cake a whole bunch of cakes as a matter of fact sir mcsweeney said when his superior spoke directly to him he had to answer he regretted the necessity ever since their clash over the need to enforce all regulations to the fullestgospel to him but evidently not to schneiderhed feared the captain was trying to seduce him away from the straight and narrow path he had trodden all his life toward memphis schneider amplified they fortified all this delta country in eastern arkansas to a faretheewell and so here it is two years after the damn war started and were only getting to jonesboro now oh yes sir mcsweeney said matters military he would willingly discuss with his superior even if schneider was sometimes profane and of course since we stand on the far side of the mississippi we get half the resources of those east of the river general custers first army i recall dont talk about any of that schneider broke in it hurts too much when i think about it were not going to have an easy time up ahead either at jonesboro no sir i dont expect we will mcsweeney said he could see the confederate strongpoint without any trouble why not none of the timber was tall enough to block his view not any more the town sprawled along the top of crowleys ridge in most places not a feature worth noticing but here in this flat country high ground to be coveted whats the altitude here sir at jonesboro its feet captain schneider said thats too many you ask me and we lose even what little cover these woodsor whats left of emgive us too because it was farming country out to three or four miles in front of the town i see that also sir mcsweeney answered he raised his voice to call out to his men give way to the right for the column coming back the column coming back was made up of soldiers returning from the front line soldiers for whom mcsweeneys squad schneiders company were among the replacements they looked the way any soldiers coming away from the front line looked dirty haggard exhausted seemingly past the repair of sleep some managing grins as they thought about what theyd do now that theyd finally got relieved others shambling along with blank stares as if they hardly knew where they were that happened to some men after theyd taken too much shelling mcsweeney had seen as much though he didnt understand how could a man whom the lord had spared be anything but joyful one of the soldiers leaving the front pointed to the tank of jellied oil he bore on his back rebs catch you with that contraption pal they wont bother sendin you to no prison camp theyll just cut your throat for you and leave you for the buzzards they shall not take me alive mcsweeney spoke with great assurance he generally spoke with great assurance the soldier whod presumed to remark on the flamethrower stared shrugged and kept on marching noncoms left behind guided the company into the section of trench they would inhabit till taken out of line themselves i dont like this for hell captain schneider said not for hell i dont were right out in the open with whatever guns the rebs have up on that ridge looking straight down our throats and the men who were here before us were not careful enough about that either mcsweeney said for once he needed to give his squad no orders seeing the same thing he did every man jack of them had taken out his entrenching tool and was busy improving the shelter with which they had been provided mcsweeney turned to schneider i would wager the barbed wire will be as weak youre likely right sergeant schneider answered but im not going to stick my head up to find out not in broad daylight im not come tonight well send out a wiring partyif theres any wire to be had yes sir mcsweeney said i sometimes think philadelphia cares not at all whether the war on this side of the river is won or lost utah mattered to the powers that be because it was on the rail line to the pacific here he shook his head out of sight out of mind youll get a lot of people who do the real fighting to tell you the fools back in philadelphia are out of their minds schneider said with a grin when mcsweeney didnt grin back the captain frowned mcsweeney wondered why the wiring party did not go out that night a wiring party without wire was nothing but wasted effort ben carlton cooked up a stew inedible even by his own standards which were low the enemy seeks to wound us mcsweeney told him you should not carlton gave him a resentful stare aint like you could do better i admit it mcsweeney said you do the cook stared again this time in a different way aint never heard you admit nothin before however mcsweeney went on implacably as if carlton had not spoken i was not assigned to cook you were resentment returned to carltons face mcsweeney ignored it as he always did confident in his own rightness and righteousness no new wire came up to the front captain schneider swore mcsweeney sent carlton out to see if he could come up with any the man was a menace as a cook but an inspired scavenger when carlton had no luck mcsweeney concluded there truly was no wire to be had he went up and down the line making sure the machine guns were well sited only after that was done did he wrap himself in his blanket and go to sleep rebel artillery made sure he did not sleep late those guns up on top of crowleys ridge started shelling the us position a couple of hours before dawn gas somebody screamed in the middle of the unholy din mcsweeney donned his gas helmet as calmly and quickly as if he were practicing in front of a mirror be ready he yelled as soon as the first light showed in the sky not five minutes later confederate machine guns added their racket to the crashes from the artillery shouts rose up and down the trench here they come here come the goddamn motherfucking sons of bitches beneath the gas helmet mcsweeneys face set in disapproving lines hed never find out who had committed the obscene blasphemy and then a shout rose that made him forget to worry about discipline and propriety barrel jesus the rebs have a stinking barrel he stuck his head up over the top of the parapet sure enough one of those tracked traveling fortresses was slowly rumbling and clanking straight toward the us linestraight toward him it looked like the us machine guns went from raking the soldiers in butternut advancing with the barrel to aiming their fire exclusively at it trying to knock it out of action before it could get into the trenches it was a britishstyle machine with cannon mounted in sponsons on either side one of those cannon spat fire a machine gun fell silent the barrel clattered forward once more its own machine guns sprayed bullets at the us soldiers the glass portholes in mcsweeneys gas helmet were fogged on the inside and streaked with dust on the outside that did not keep him from noticing a couple of men running away from the barrel halt he roared at them it did no good at last the men had discovered something they feared worse than they feared him boom the barrel fired again another machine gun abruptly stopped shooting at it ricochets whined off the steel armor striking sparks but failing to penetrate mcsweeney wondered how many more barrels that he could not see were moving forward he shrugged if he couldnt see them he couldnt do anything about them he could see this one he bent and careful not to disturb his gas helmet shrugged over his shoulders the straps to the metal tank that fueled his special weapon then he waited bullets seemed unable to hurt the barrel here it came grinding its way through and over the few strands of wire protecting the us trenches having thicker belts out there wouldnt have stopped it more soldiers in greengray fled the machine they could not stop it crushed the parapet and stood poised up there above the edge of the trench triumphant like a great bull elephant as it began its plunge into the us works mcsweeney sent a stream of flame in through one of the machinegun ports an instant later he did the same with the other port on the right side of the barrel thereby making sure neither of those guns would bear on him through the shelling through the firing going on all around through the coughing roar of the barrels engine he heard screams inside the metal hull hatches flew open on top of the barrel men started scrambling out smiling behind the canvas of the mask mcsweeney burned them down they tumbled back into the machine black and shrunken and flaming like insects that had flown into the flame of a gaslight smoke poured from the barrel ammunition started cooking off in it mcsweeney regretfully moved away that hard tight grin still on his face a confederate soldier sprang onto the parapet he fired from the hip at mcsweeneyand missed he never got a second chance a tongue of flame licked over him he tumbled back burning burning a grenade flew down into the trench the blast was deafening a fragment bit mcsweeneys leg but when a rebel followed the grenade he too became a torch no more confederate soldiers tried coming down into the us trenches not anywhere the flame could reach the sight of the blazing barrel took the heart out of their attack youll get a medal for this someone shouted someone in captains bars schneider hadnt run then that was something the company commander went on a medal of honor if i have anything to do with it thank you sir mcsweeney was as unflinchingly honest about himself as about everything and everyone around him i earned it the envelope with the familiar handwriting had caused a small stir when it got to scipios apartment house any time mail arrived there was a small occasion for only a few of the negroes in the building were able to read and write who it from asked the apartment manager a plump black fellow named demosthenes shonuf write pretty scipio had professed ignorance the imperturbable mask a butler had to be able to don at will was proof against demosthenes curiosity behind that mask hed been trembling how did miss anne find out where i was living he wondered the war had made people forget about registering newly arrived blacks and in any case he was but one nero among many negroes by that name in columbia in his haste to find out what his former mistress wanted hed ignored yet another inviting glance from the widow jezebel ignored it so flagrantly that he knew hed offended he hadnt cared the message as was anne colletons way was to the point come to marshlands sunday before noon shed written if you do no harm will come to you if you do not i shall not answer for the consequences and so early sunday morning scipio not doubting her word for a moment had hopped aboard the beatup negro car of a train at confederacy station traveled southeast and then southwest around two sides of a triangle to reach st matthews no direct rail route on the third side existing and then trudged out of town down a muddy road that got muddier as a chilly drizzle came down heading west toward the plantation where hed lived his whole life till the past year marks of the negro uprising still scarred the countryside burntout houses and barns cotton fields gone to weeds trees shattered by the artillery that had done more than anything else to break the congaree socialist republic despite the scars scipio had the feeling he was walking back into his own past he wondered if anne colleton would have a brassbuttoned tailcoat waiting for him when he got back to the plantation all things considered he preferred life as a laborer which had more freedom to it than hed ever imagined very few people though had ever cared about what he preferred he hiked through the forest where hed killed major hotchkiss if anyone ever found out about that none of miss annes promises would matter in the least coming up the familiar path turning onto it and seeing the marshlands mansion in ruins brought home to him how much things had changed the negro cottages still standing alongside those charred ruins brought home to him how much things hadnt a battered filthy rusty ford was parked next to one of those cottages no sign anywhere of the fancy motorcar miss anne had driven none of the field hands would have had an automobile though no matter how battered that had to be where the mistress was staying as scipio approached the cottage a chill ran down his back before the uprisingthe revolution that had failedthat had been cassiuscottage scipio wondered if anne colleton appreciated the irony a few children were playing outside in spite of the drizzle in his city clothes he was a stranger to them strangers these days were objects of fear not curiosity what you wan asked one of the boys a chap who would have been just too young to fight in the revolutionary army which had had more than one twelveyearold carrying a rifle i wish to speak with the mistress of marshlands ajax scipio answered will you be so good as to tell her i have arrived ajax and the other children stared at him not expecting that kind of language to come from the mouth of a black man wearing a frayed collarless shirt and a pair of dungarees with patches at the knees a cloth cap on his head against the rain then the youngster recognized him in spite of the unfamiliar habiliments it scipio he yelped do jesus scipio done come back that shout brought faces to windows and made several doors come open so the inhabitants of those cottages could gapeor could warily studythe returned prodigal one of the opening doors was that of the cottage formerly cassius out came anne colleton who ignored the nasty weather good morning scipio she said almostbut not quiteas she might have done before the revolt you were wise to come maam i thought so myself which is why i did he answered she stood aside well come in she said i have coffee waiting and cold chicken and sweetpotato pie youll be hungry i expect yes maam he said again he went into the cottage pausing only to wipe his feet on the jute mat in front of the door the cottage hadnt boasted a mat when cassius had lived there it hadnt boasted an icebox either or a small stove to supplement the fireplace nor had it held a bookcase even if the titles on the shelves were worn secondhand copies like the ones he bought for himself but there had been literature here marx and engels and lincoln and other red and nearred writers cassius though had had to keep all that hidden anne colleton closed the door behind them help yourself to anything she said i dont want anyone but the two of us hearing what we have to say to each other that explained why she had no servant present and for her to serve him had undoubtedly never once crossed her mind she was after all a sort of commingling of feudal landlord and capitalist oppressor scipio had read cassius books too unless he planned on killing her and then fleeing he had to do as she said for the moment hed thought about that walking out from st matthews but even if the field hands didnt try stopping him as he ran she would have put aside a letter or something somewhere to point the finger at him she was not the sort to miss such a trick as if to underscore that she pulled a pistol out of her handbag in case you were foolish she remarked i didnt really expect you to be but one never knows these days i have no intention of being foolish he answered gravely shed put out two coffee cups he poured one for her one for himself since shed set out only one plate he assumed shed already eaten the food was plain nothing like the fancy banquets shed served in the days before the war but good enough since hed had nothing but a slice of bread before leaving for the train station he ate his fill now with more patience than she usually showed his former mistress let him finish before saying anything when he was done she began without preamble i want you to tell me how my brother jacob died yes maam he made his voice as flat as he could a fitting complement to the features he schooled to stillness her face and voice were similarly chary of giving him clues how much did she know how much did he dare lie after no more than a heartbeat he decided that anyone who lied to her was a fool the truth then as much of it as he could give maam he perished most courageously i wouldnt have expected anything else she answered courage jacob always had no brains to speak of but courage that wench cherry would have played a part in it wouldnt she maam if you know the answers what need have you to question me scipio asked i am in a position to question you anne said you are not in a position to question me she would have used her charms to soften him up wouldnt she that was not a question she sounded wearily sure she knew whereof she spoke and cassius hes still stealing things hereabouts you know so i have heard yes scipio said the more he talked about cassius now the less he would have to talk about what had happened a year before he still has a price on his head too anne said if he comes round herethe pistol twitched in her handi shall kill him she studied scipio as if deciding whether to butcher a hog now or to wait and of course you still have a price on your head as well you said no harm would come to me if i visited you here scipio said quickly if she hadnt had the pistol he would have thought about trying to kill her living with her serving her had taught him how devious she was but when she said and i meant that he thought she was telling the truth she went on you and julia are the only members of the house staff ive been able to find she and the field hands deny knowing anything ive made my investigations but you are the only eyewitness to what happened ive been able tofind catch was what she meant wherever shed learned whatever shed learned she knew a good deal scipio had not defied cassius when the red leader made it plain his choices were cooperation and death the stuff of defiance was not in him maybe it never had been maybe his servile upbringing had trained out whatever hed once owned he told the whole story from cherrys claim of abuse to the gun battle in which jacob colleton had defended himself so well to the storming of the bedroom door behind which annes gassed brother had barricaded himself three or four men did that he said they rushed past me so fast i do not know for certain who they were i do not know which of them fired the fatal shot either maam you may do with me what you will but i am being truthful in this regard i believe you anne said which caught scipio by surprise sitting where she sat he wouldnt have believed himself she went on the reason i believe you is that if you were lying to me you would have come up with a better story the truth ive found is usually confused yes maam he said now her voice sharpened who burned the marshlands mansion that was cassius maam he answered adding i wish he had not done it many beautiful things were lost in five words youve just given the story of this war she said i know you had a role in the socalled congaree socialist republic from what ive heard you usually did what you could to stop its excesses i suspect your reasons had as much to do with what would happen after the uprising was put down as they did with any special milk of human kindness in your veins but only god can look into a mans heart and ive found out that whatever else i may be i am not god not knowing what to say to that scipio kept quiet if anne colleton hadnt thought she was god before the red revolt shed done a fine job of concealing the fact he wondered what shed gone through he didnt have the nerve to ask he didnt have the nerve for a lot of things in a nutshell that was the tale of his life wearily anne said go back to columbia go back to your work once we win the war that will have been enough dont ever come here again unless i summon you maam on that you may rest assured scipio wondered if he was talking like an educated white man for the last time in his life in a way he would miss it if that proved so in another way giving up what had been imposed on him was a sort of freedom in itself he rose half bowed to anne and left the cottage field hands and children stared after him he didnt look back as he got to the forest where hed killed major hotchkiss he decided he needed a new apartment a new job a new name the widow had wanted to go to bed with him he sighed it wouldnt happen now odder chances he said aloud dey is odder chances he kept walking toward the train station brakes squealing the train pulled into the station cincinnati the conductor shouted all out for cincinnati men most of them in uniform and a scattering of women rose from their seats so they could depart irving morrell stayed where he was so did heinz guderian beside him how far now from cincinnati to philadelphia guderian asked in german morrell visualized a map six hundred miles maybe a little less he answered in the same language seeing guderian look puzzled he amplified that about kilometers he moved back and forth between one system of measurement and the other readily enough but had learned the german found it harder sure enough guderian twitted him about it how many feet in a mile it is nicht wahr what a foolish number to have to keep straight every time you need to make a calculation before morrell could defend the american system the conductor leaned over and said with a smile wir willen winnen der krieg guderian stared at him not because he spoke german so badly hed said we want to win the war not we will win the war which was what hed probably meant and hed botched his article and his word order too but because he spoke it at all he was a black man with a mouth full of goldcrowned teeth ja guderian managed at last and the conductor smiling still headed down the central aisle to morrell the german general staff officer said i had not realized just how popular my country was in the united states oh yes morrell said with a nod good thing we werent speaking french or hed have probably thought we were spies a classmate of mine at the academy jack lefebvre changed his name to schmidt after the war started it was either that he told me or kiss promotion goodbye and i happen to know his people have been in the usa since before the war of secession this business of everyone coming from elsewhere or having parents or grandparents who came from elsewhere is very strange to me guderian said in europe we have been where we are since the volkerwanderungen of a thousand years ago and more passengers were boarding the train as well as leaving it some of them came from elsewhere too speaking with accents plainly sprung from the csa a couple of those fellows looking prosperous with big bellies expensive black suits and homburgs sat down across from morrell and guderian itll be right strange one of them said to the other with a ripe drawl but i reckon we can do it shifting to english morrell leaned over and asked who are you people anyway talk about spies the man sitting closer to him stuck out a plump hand major im davis lee vidals lieutenant governor of kentuckyof the united state of kentucky i make haste to assure you morrell reached out and shook the proffered hand being careful not to squash it he gave his own name thats wonderful news he said welcome back to the country where you belong thank you very kindly major morrell vidals said that fellow sitting beside youis he a german his voice was half dread half awe he might have been one of the people helping to bring kentucky back into the usa but he didnt seem to know how to feel about us allies who had been enemies of the confederate states ja i am a german guderian spoke english with a heavy accent but was fluent enough he grinned at the kentucky politician you would not expect to find an american officer traveling with a frenchman would you hed paid attention to the story of jack lefebvre now schmidt all right good god almighty i hope not vidals exclaimed gentlemen let me introduce to you my friend and colleague here this is luther bliss chief of the kentucky state police were both on our way to philadelphia to settle arrangements for electing congressmen and senators next month bliss leaned across his traveling companion to shake hands with morrell and guderian he was hardfaced and sallow with a scar seaming one cheek his eyes were a light light brown about the color of a hunting dogs morrell wouldnt have cared to let the kentuckian stand behind him he was the sort of man who looked to have a stiletto stashed up his sleeve kentucky state police morrell suspected was a euphemism for kentucky secret police how did kentucky go about applying for readmission to the united states he asked the curiosity was more professional than personal administering conquered territory and bringing it under the control of the usa was something that might be part of his responsibilities one day the train started rolling as davis lee vidals started talking morrell quickly discovered the train was more likely than the lieutenant governor to slow down we convened a gathering of distinguished kentuckians eager to renew their historic ties to the united states of america vidals began and discussed ways and means by which this might be accomplished we how many kentuckians morrell asked vidals began another speech it went on for some time and told morrell nothing when the politician paused to inhalewhich took a whileluther bliss interjected couple hundred his superiorhis nominal superior at any rategave him a dirty look and started talking again several wellmodulated paragraphs of rhetoric later morrell asked did you need any soldiers to make sure things went the way you had in mind davis lee vidals waxed indignant eloquently indignant at the very idea he didnt however say no he also didnt say yes he did say and say and say presently he paused again this time to light a cigar in that brief interval of silence bliss got another chance to open his mouth couple regiments he said and fell silent again morrell nodded that told him everything he thought he needed to know about the new state government of kentucky without massive help from the us army it wouldnt exist but heinz guderian spoke up in german this is not so bad as it may sound major when fortyfive years ago we annexed alsace and lorraine from france many of the people there resented and resisted us there remain some who do but those provinces also remain a part of the german reich and grow more accustomed to our rule with each passing day vidals eyes got wider with every guttural he heard and wider still when morrell answered in german he might have been bringing kentucky back into the usa but he was also bringing a lot of ideas from the quadruple entente with him luther bliss by contrast listened quietly morrell wouldnt have bet against his understanding every word that was said the only thing that finally slowed vidals down was sleep no matter that he was sitting in a seat that didnt recline he set his homburg in his lap put his head back and snored like a thunderstorm in training that he was so aggressively asleep meant everyone else in the crowded car had trouble joining him outside the countryside was dark as the tomb that hadnt been so farther west but here in ohio and pennsylvania confederate bombing aeroplanes remained a nuisance the enforced darkness after sunset made it harder for them to find worthwhile targets morrell had finally drifted into a fitful doze when the train pulled into philadelphia at a little before four in the morning he grunted and groaned and rubbed his eyes across the aisle the lieutenant governor of kentucky kept on snoring till the conductor shouted out the arrival luther bliss didnt look to have slept a wink or to have needed sleep either when the doors opened a brass band started blaring the starspangled banner there on the platform stood president roosevelt when the kentuckians got out he folded them into a bearhug welcome back prodigal sons he cried while photographers flash trays went off with almost as much smoke and noise as an artillery bombardment a new star joins the flag a new star shines in the firmament the band switched to my old kentucky home lets see what senator debs can do to match that morrell thought bringing kentucky back into the usa before the election had to be worth thousands of votes soldiers werent supposed to have politics such politics as morrell did have were democratic waiting for him and guderian was not the president of the united states but captain john abell of the general staff welcome captain guderian the clever almost bloodless officer said in excellent german he turned to morrell and returned to english general wood has ordered me to extend his personal greetings to you lieutenant colonel lieut morrell didnt get any further than that because guderian was pounding him on the back cutting off the canadian railroad that ran through banff had earned him a promotion and evidently got him forgiven for the difficulties the usa had had in utah if captain abell was pleased at that he hid it very well he said as you know you are assigned to duty here in philadelphia once more lieutenant colonel i assure you i look forward to working with you in every way a liar but a polite liar morrell judged guderian said see my friend you have won a victory and they have put you back behind a desk it almost tempts one to lose doesnt it yes morrell said almost lord i wish emily was here jefferson pinkard stabbed himself with a needle about the fourth time hed done that hipolito rodriguez gave him an amused look most of the time amigo you say you wish you was with your esposa now you want her here with you you no can make up your mind he waved around at the bleak westtexas prairie i think she rather you home with her pinkard snorted yeah id rather i was home with her too but she can do this a hell of a lot easiern i can stubbornly he kept sewing the single chevron to the sleeve of his uniform tunic if id known it was gonna be so blame much trouble maybe i wouldnt have let em promote me si life is easier when you have only yourself to worry about rodriguez agreed with obvious sincerity hell hip if they reckon you can do the job how you gonna tell em no jeff asked he could complain about making private first class after the fact he hadnt complained when captain connolly told him hed done it he fought through another couple of stitches then surveyed his handiwork and found something else over which to complain that stripes pretty light isnt it make it easier for those yankee sons of bitches to spot me wait till it rains again and you go through the mud rodriguez told him then your whole uniform the same color again yeah youre right pinkard dug out some cornbread he hadnt finished at breakfast it had got hard he didnt care even when it was fresh it hadnt been a patch on what emily made her cornbread and her skill with the needle werent what he really missed about her though he wanted to be back home in birmingham to warm her bedand to make sure nobody else was warming it for him he stood up in the trench to put on the tunic to which hed affixed his new chevronand a bullet cracked past his head he threw himselfand the tunicdown flat into the trench got to dig it deeper hip rodriguez said seriously they shouldnt see you when you get up like that yeah jeff said again they wouldnt see you i dont guess he was several inches taller than the littler sonoran this time he donned the fresh tunic sitting down it wasnt so fresh any more hed smeared dirt over a good part of it including the sleeves he stopped worrying about sharpshooters spotting him on account of one stripe a few more bullets flew from the us trenches here and there confederates along the line east of lubbock shot back pinkard didnt hear any of his countrymen cry out in pain he didnt know whether they got any yankees either and if they had hit somebody so what did that mean they would run the us army out of texas he knew too well it didnt that was what his regiment had come here to do how many lives were gone without the lines moving one way or the other too many that was sure as if to underscore the point a confederate machine gun opened up maybe at a yankee out of his nice safe burrow maybe just for the sake of using up some ammunition half a minute later a us machine gun answered a couple of hundred yards away from pinkard somebody started screaming for his mama shit hip rodriguez said and crossed himself he shook his head then got a tobacco pouch out of his pocket and began rolling a cigarette after a while both machinegun crews decided theyd made their pointless points they quit firing rifles kept banging a few minutes longer nervous excited men shooting at what they thought were targets at last quiet returned you know what all this here reminds me of jeff said by then having seen a lot of meaningless fire fights that conformed to the same general pattern when rodriguez shook his head pinkard went on its like a rainstorm aint it first you get a few drops then it comes down hard for a while then it tapers off and its all quiet and the suns out again that is clever what you say rodriguez nodded now this time we dont get no the noise he made could have been thunder rolling or artillery going off it fit either way up the communications trench into the front line came stinky salley most times pinkard would have been as glad to see him as to encounter a new kind of louse but salley had somehow used his civilian career as a clerk to convince captain connolly that no one else could possibly match him as the man to pick up and distribute the mail he carried a butternut canvas bag labeled csampo letters he called ive got letters he needed more than being the bearer of news from home to make him popular with his fellow soldiers but that didnt hurt men came hurrying over to him arms outstretched smiles on their faces come on stinky somebody said cough em up but even that wasnt so peremptory as it would have been had salley not borne letters he took them out of the sack and started reading off names burroughs dalton pinkard jeff took the envelope with an enormous grin he recognized emilys handwriting captain connolly one for you sir to officers salley was painfully obsequious pratt ambrose pinkard againyou lucky dog jeffs promotion hadnt quite sunk in on his fellow alabaman two in one mail call pinkard exclaimed joyfully as he carried both lettersthe second he saw also from his wifeaway from the crowd around salley he sat down beside hip rodriguez rodriguez never got mail as far as jeff could tell the little sonoran didnt know anyone who could read or write and had only started learning those arts himself since hed joined the army he liked listening to other soldiers read their mail though as did anybody whod drawn a blank in the distribution jeff looked to see which letter had the earlier postmark and opened that one first dear jeff he read aloud i am fine i wish you was home with me so i could give you a kiss and he skipped most of the next paragraph at least with his voice though his eyes lingered on it every once in a while emily would do something like that it made him more anxious than ever to get home rodriguez grinned at him probably guessing what he was leaving out coughing a little he resumed where the spice left off i am fine and working hard i hope so much you are well and have not got yourself hurt fanny got herself a telegram from the war department yesterday that says poor bedford got wounded and she is frantic turning to rodriguez jeff explained i worked with bedford cunningham and him and his wife live next door to me this is hard the sonoran said this is very hard he sounded altogether sincere he had a good deal more sympathy in him than the runofthemill confederate soldier for you my amigo and for your your wifehe remembered the english wordand more for your amigos wife and most of all for him how peligrosohow dangerousis the wound letter doesnt say pinkard answered reckon fanny didnt know so emily wouldntve either rodriguez pointed to the other envelope nodding jeff tore it open he didnt read it out loud all the way though but rapidly skimmed through it looking for news of bedford cunningham when he found it his face gave him away it is very bad hip rodriguez asked quietly right armjeff held up his own partly to help rodriguezs uncertain english partly to remind himself he still owned that precious piece of fleshgone above the elbow emily says bedfords on his way home now hell get better whats he going to do though with a wound like that never get on the floor at the sloss works again thats certain and irons about the only thing he knew rodriguez closed his right hand into a fist he watched it carefully as he did so pinkard watched too all the marvelous miraculous interplay of muscle and tendon and bone beneath a sheath of wonderfully unbroken skin gone in an instant jeff thought wonder if a bullet got him or if a shell came down right next door wonder if he knows wonder if he cares if this happen to me rodriguez said i take whatever money i have i go to the cantina and i dont do nothing but drink from then on what else am i good for without my right hand dont know pinkard said you couldnt farm onehanded any more than you could go back to the foundry its funny he went on after a little while just reading this here letter about bedford hits me harder than seeing some of the people from the company get hurt right in front of my eyes is that crazy or what no rodriguez answered this is a good friend almost like your hermano your brother we are still some of us like strangers yeah maybe that still tasted wrong but it was closer than any explanation jeff had come up with god damn the war he muttered rodriguez nodded solemnly a yankee machine gun started up the gunner spraying bullets over a wide arc to see what he could hit god damn the war jeff said again and checked to make sure his tredegar had a full clip from under the awning lieutenant general george armstrong custer stared gloomily at the hills above white house tennessee we have to have a victory he said we have to the war requires it and politics require it too cautiously major abner dowling said joining battle for the sake of politics is a recipe for getting licked sir we learned that in the war of secession and all over again during the second mexican war custers pouchy stare swung from the stalled battlefield toward his adjutant most times major i would agree with you he said after what was for him an unusual pause to reflect now thoughdo you want that wildeyed lunatic debs sitting in the white house come next march hes already said hell treat for peace with the rebels and the canucks if he gets elected is that what you want major is it no sir dowling said at once he was as good a democrat as custer he might as well not have spoken once the general commanding first army got rolling he kept rolling till he ran down god in heaven major custer burst out a rheumy thunderer were winning on every fronton every front i tell youand that crackbrained maniac wants to give it up and for what for an honorable peace he calls it honorable with his ageloosened wrinkled skin and enormous mustache custer had a formidable sneer when he turned it loose as he did now i agree with you sir dowling said for once telling custer the unvarnished truth we just have to hope the people back home havent got too sick of the war to want to fight it through to the finish they had better not try quitting custer growled if debs calls the troops home well have a brandnew american revolution mark my words dowling did mark them they filled him with horror his head whipped around after a moments panic he heartily thanked god nobody but he had heard custer as casually as he could he said armed rebellion against the government of the united states is treason sir i know that custer sounded testy not repentant still some rebs left alive who need hanging by god unless their own niggers shot em for us too much to hope for that i daresay now you listen to me major dowling who had done his share and more of listening made himself look attentive custer resumed i dont want a rebellion not even a little bit do you understand me what i want is to make a rebellion unnecessary and that means victory to give the people the ideathe true idea mind youthat we stand on the edge of the greatest triumph in the history of mankind the rebs are still fighting hard sir dowling said in what had to be the understatement of this or any other decade the front hadnt moved a mile closer to the white house since the enormous us offensive opened so are the canadians which forces us to divide our efforts teddy roosevelt bit off more than he could chew right at the start of the war custer said this from a man whose notion of reconnaissance was a headlong charge at an obstacle with everything he had struck major dowling as a curious utterancewhich for once did not mean it was wrong rather to dowlings relief the debate on grand strategy stopped then for one of custers division commanders came up stood under the awning and waited to be noticed he waited a while too custer was jealous of his own prerogatives at last grudgingly he said good morning brigadier general macarthur good morning sir brigadier general daniel macarthur came to stiff attention which made him tower even more over both custer and dowling dowling understood why custer was touchy around this particular subordinate macarthur was visibly a man on the rise at thirtytwo he was the youngest division commander in the us army unlike earlier conflicts this was one where an officer had a devil of a time making a name for himself by pluck and dash as far as anyone could do that in an age of machine guns and trenches and barbed wire daniel macarthur had done it he made sure people knew hed done it too which was one reason hed got his division in some ways he and custer were very much alike though both of them would have angrily turned on dowling had he been rash enough to say such a thing still as far as the adjutant was concerned the long ivory holder through which macarthur chainsmoked cigarettes was as much an affectation as custers golddyed locks macarthur said sir we need a breakthrough the army needs one from us and the country needs one from us the very thing i was saying to my adjutant not five minutes ago custer replied he looked up at the young lean ramrodstraight officer standing beside him his smile was cynical and infinitely knowing dowling would not have wanted that smile aimed at him after pausing to cough custer went on and you wouldnt mind having a breakthrough for yourself either would you daniel the countrys needs come first sir macarthur answered and sounded as if he meant it maybe he even believed it but he was still very young dowling saw how he tensed almost as if hed seen a beautiful woman walk by yes he lusted after a breakthrough all right weve been pounding the rebs for weeks now custer said they havent given us anything at all and we havent been able to take much they know as well as we do that the white house line is the last thing keeping our guns from letting nashville know the full taste of war yes sir macarthur said and pulled a map from the breast pocket of his uniform unlike custer who was oldfashioned enough to relish the epaulets and other fancy accoutrements accruing to his rank macarthur wore an ordinary officers uniform set apart only by the single silver stars of his rank ostentatious plainness as opposed to ostentatious display he unfolded the map i believe i know how to get past them too custer put on his reading glasses a concession of sorts lets see what you have in mind general misdirection daniel macarthur spoke the word solemnly as if it were the capstone of a magic spell dowling figured hed cooked his own goose then and there custer had about as much use for misdirection as an anteater did for snowshoes the dashing division commander and how many major generals gnashed their teeth at that when they led only brigades said as you know my men are stationed on our far left in front of cottontown yes yes custer said impatiently though dowling wouldnt have bet more than half a dollar that hed been sure where in the line macarthurs formation did belong we have found to our cost how strong the confederate defenses due south and southwest of our position are macarthur said custer nodded those peroxided curls flapping at the back of his neck macarthur continued aerial reconnaissance suggests though that the rebels line is weaker toward the southeast if we strike in that direction toward gallatin we can set our men to taking lines less formidably manned thereby giving them the opportunity to swing back toward nashville cutting in behind the entrenchments that have delayed them so long custer sucked at something between two of his false teeth abner dowling scratched his chin sir he said its not a bad scheme he suspected he sounded surprised he didnt much care for macarthur having seen in custer what the passage of years was likely to do to such a man custer studied the map a while longer macarthur had used bright blue ink to show exactly what he wanted to do no custer said at last its not he sounded imperfectly enamored of it but seemed to recognize it was a better plan than any hed come up with since most of his plans amounted to nothing more than finding the enemy and attacking him not necessarily in that order that did not say as much as it might have otherwise unlike the general commanding first army macarthur did his homework ahead of time the map was not the only sheet of paper lurking in his breast pocket handing custer a typewritten list he said here are the additional artillery requirements for the assault sir and other ancillaries as well see what you think of this major custer said and passed the sheet to dowling precise control of details had never been his strong suit macarthur puffed and puffed blowing smoke into dowlings face as if it were phosgene gas dowling read rapidly through the list before turning to custer sir he wants all the heavy artillery concentrated on his divisions front and he also wants almost all of our barrels for the assault moving the heavy artillery will take time custer said especially with the roads as muddy as they have been lately im sure we can move some of it but asking for all asks for too much even half the first army reserve would probably be adequate macarthur said he was smarter than custer had ever been dowling thought he knew enough to ask for more than he really wanted to help assure his getting at least that much he couldnt quite keep the eagerness from his voice as he asked and the barrels ah the barrels custer assumed a mournful expression i have to remind you general that i am under strict orders from the war department not to concentrate the barrels in the manner you suggest approved doctrine requires keeping them widely spread along the entire length of the front but sir dowling closed his mouth a split second before it got him in trouble custer had argued ferociously for concentrating barrels in a mass why was he rejecting the idea when one of his subordinates had it after a moment the major understood custer was rejecting the idea because one of his subordinates had had it if a divisionsized attack spearheaded by a swarm of barrels succeed who would get the credit not custerdaniel macarthur macarthur said once you let me proceed sir i can show those fools in philadelphia the proper way to do things abner dowling sighed he was but a major neither of the exalted personages under the awning even noticed macarthur couldnt have said that worse if hed tried for a week custer as dowling knew full well despised those fools back in philadelphia as much as any man alive but when macarthur said i can show that meant custer couldnt show custer wanted victories yes custer wanted teddy roosevelt reelected yes but most of all custer wanted glory for george armstrong custer almost sorrowfully he said i wish i could help you more general but my own orders in this regard are severely inflexible i may be able to furnish you with oh half a dozen extra barrels without having some pipsqueak inspectorgeneral calling me on the carpet but no more than that i fear but sir nothing ventured nothing gained macarthur protested i am venturing what i can general i assure you custer said icily yours is not the only division in the line will you prepare a revised attack plan conforming to the available resources or will you stand on the defensive youll have it before the day is out sir macarthurs voice held no expression whatever like a mechanical man he saluted spun and stalked off very softly custer laughed at his retreating back dowling stared at the general commanding first army custer here knew just what he was doingand he enjoyed it too you bastard dowling thought you sneaky old bastard was that admiration or loathing for the life of him he couldnt tell roger kimball peered avidly through the periscope the fish was running straight and true suddenly the us destroyer realized it was under attack suddenly it tried to turn away from the creamy wake the torpedo left suddenly the torpedo struck just aft of amidships suddenly a great pillar of smoke and flame rose into the air the destroyer broken in half sank like a stonelike two stones cheers filled the narrow steel tube that was the working area of the bonefish drowning out the echoes of the explosion that the water carried to the submersible hit kimballs own bloodthirsty howl was but one among many he brought his eyes back to the periscope only a couple of boats bobbed in the atlantic the damnyankees hadnt had time to launch any more if hed been a german submarine commander he would have surfaced and turned the deck gun on them the huns played by hard rules there were times when kimball feeling the full weight of the usa pressing down on him and his country wanted to play that way too such thoughts went by the board in a hurry when turning the periscope he saw another destroyer running straight for him his fierce joy curdled and went cold in the twinkling of an eye dive he shouted take us down to tom and make it snappy aye aye sir feet his exec answered compressed air bubbled out of the buoyancy chambers seawater gurgled in to take its place up on the surface those bubbles would help the yankee sailors figure out where he was though they were liable to have a pretty good idea already what with the course their fellow boat had been making and the way it had tried to escape his fish with more and more of the north atlantic piled atop it the hull of the bonefish creaked and squealed there were a couple of little drips where the seams werent perfectly tight but they were in the old familiar places kimball didnt worry much about them through the hull the noise of the engine and screw up above them was perfectly audible noengines and screws two boats were moving back and forth up there leveling off at sir tom brearley said straightening the diving planes in the dim orange light his grin was almost satanic they arent what youd call happy with us aint been happy with them since we went to war kimball replied or before that either you get right down to it them and us we dont he broke off abruptly through the pounding drone of the destroyers engines hed heard another sound the noise that might have come from a garbage can full of cement being flung into the ocean depth charge ben coulter said hoarsely the veteran petty officer tried to make light of it those damn things most of the time they dont work for beans a moment later another splash followed the first give me eight knots tom and change course to kimball said changing course to twosevenzero sir aye aye and eight knots brearley acknowledged a certain amount of doubt in his voice kimball didnt blame him eight knots used up battery power in a hurry cutting deeply into the time the bonefish could stay underwater without much humor kimball tried to make a joke of it when the boys on top start throwing things at you tom its time to get out from under em well yes sir but brearley didnt get any further than that for the first depth charge exploded just then it was kimball supposed something like being in an earthquake it was also like standing inside a metal pipe while giants pounded on the outside of it with sledgehammers kimball staggered and smacked the side of his head against the periscope mounting something wet started running down his cheek it was warm not cold so he supposed it was blood rather than seawater men stumbled and cursed the lights flickered a few seconds later the other depth charge went off it was farther away than the first one so it only felt like a big kick in the ass from an angry mule sir on second thought eight knots is a right good idea brearley said everything still answer kimball asked brearley nodded seems to sir we got a new leak back here sir one of the men in the black gang called from the engines toward the stern dont seem too bad though it had better not kimball answered tom take her down to i want to put some more distance between us and them the leaks will get worse brearley said but that was more observation than protest the bow of the bonefish slanted down if the leaks got a lot worse kimball knew hed have to rise no one shouted in alarm so he kept quiet till brearley said leveling off at splash splash two more depth charges went into the water where they went into the water was the key factor and the one kimball couldnt gauge till they detonated all he could do was hope hed picked a direction different from the one the yankees had chosen even with the bonefish going flat out submerged those destroyers had better than three times his speed the only thing he had going for him was that they couldnt see him hydrophones gave only a vague clue about his direction and they had to guess his depth wham wham explosions rocked the submarine they were both closer than that second one had been but not so close as the first all at once he grinned all stop he snapped to brearley allstop the exec answered he looked back over his shoulder at kimball youre not going to bet your balls i am son the skipper of the bonefish said the damnyankees guessed with me far as direction goes they know how fast we are what do you want to bet they keep right on that track pounding away they must have some new kind of charges too on account of i dont think theyve tossed any duds at us isnt that wonderful brearley said along with most of the crew kimball chuckled the life of a submariner had never been easy by what the damnyankees were throwing at the bonefish it had just got harder splash splash with even the quiet electric motors running only enough to power lights and instruments the noise the depth charges made going into the ocean was all too audible in his minds eye kimball saw them twisting slowly down through the greengray waters of the atlantic almost the color of a yankee soldiers uniform looking for his boat he cursed himself for an overactive imagination wham wham he staggered a tiny new jet of seawater sprayed coldly down the back of his neck as they had with the first attack the lights flickered before steadying those were in front of us sir tom brearley said i know kimball answered here we sit he could feel eyes boring into him as he had when hed taken the bonefish up the pee dee river looking for red rebels then though the watchful eyes had belonged to the negroes in the swamps along the riverbank now they were the eyes of his own crew he understood exactly why too the previous spread of charges had been aft of the submersible this one in front if that meant the us destroyers up there had somehow located himthe next pair would go off right on top of his conning tower one thing boys he said into the drippunctuated quiet if it turns out im wrong well never know what hit us if water at seven atmospheres pressure flooded into the bonefish it would smash everything in its path surely making no exceptions for flimsy human beings sir brearley asked if you have to how deep will you take her id go to without blinking an eye kimball answered it gets wet fast down that deep but odds are youll come back up from it nobody really knows how deep you can go if youre lucky enough ive heard stories of even feet when the sub was damaged and couldnt control its dive till it touched bottom he grinned wryly at his exec course the ones who go down that deep and never surface againyou dont hear about those sailors chuckled he looked round at them a grimy unshaven crew all the more raffish in the orange lighting they fit here the same as he did they would have beensome had beenoutcasts frequent inhabitants of the brig almost outlaws in the gentlemanly world of the confederate states surface navy as far as he was concerned theyd done the cause more good than ten times their number aboard fancy battleships splash splash everyone involuntarily sucked in a long breath of the humid fetid air in a very little while kimball would find out whether his training and instincts had saved their baconor killed them all in casual tones coulter remarked wish i had me a beer right now we get back to charleston ill buy everybody here all the beer you can drink kimball promised that was liable to be an expensive promise to keep but he didnt care getting back to charleston would make being poor for a while afterwards worthwhile and then some how long for a depth charge to reach the depth for which it was fused the new pair seemed to be taking forever maybe they were duds kimball thought the damnyankees couldnt have come up with a way to make them work all the timecould they wham wham maybe they could jesus tom brearley exclaimed that took forever kimball wasnt the only one for whom time had stretched like a rubber band then the exec turned to him with a smile as radiant as any worn greasy man could show in that light well ahead of us both of em sir yeah kimball said as if he hadnt just bet his life and won now we sit here for as long as the batteries will let us and wait for our little friends up there to get tired and go away how long can we wait tom brearley checked the gauges it would be longer if we hadnt tried that sprint after we sank the destroyer sir but weve got charge enough for five or six hours should be enough kimball said jovially it had better be enough echoed in his mind he took a deep breath and made a face thingsll stink too bad for us to stand it any longern that regardless that was phrased like a joke and got laughs like a joke but it wasnt a joke and everybody knew it the longer you sat submerged the fouler the air got that was part of the nature of the boat five and a half hours after the bonefish sank its target ben coulter found he couldnt keep a candle alight in the close nasty atmosphere inside the pressure hull if we had a canary in here sir it would have fallen off its perch a hell of a long time ago he said to kimball yeah the captain answered his head ached he could feel how slowly he was thinking he nodded to brearley blow forward tanks tom bring her up to periscope depth a long careful scan showed nothing on the horizon kimball ordered the bonefish to the surface wearily he climbed the ladder to the top of the conning tower the exec close behind him to make sure the pressurized air didnt blow him out the hatch when he opened it when he did undog the hatch his stomach did its best to crawl up his throat all the stenches so long trapped inside the submersible seemed ten times worse when they rushed out in a great vile gale and mixed in his lungs with the first precious breath of fresh clean sea air fighting down his gorge he climbed another couple of rungs and looked around lateafternoon sunshine felt as savagely bright as it did during a hangover the ocean was wide and empty made it again boys he said the crew cheered maria tresca fiddled microscopically with flora hamburgers hat the italian woman stepped back to survey the results better she said although flora checking the mirror doubted the naked eye could tell the difference between the way the hat had looked before and how it did now remember herman bruck said daniel miller isnt stupid if you make a mistake in this debate hell hurt you with it he looked and sounded anxious had he been running against the appointed democratic congressman he probably would have made just such a mistake maybe he sensed that about himself and set on floras shoulders his worries about what he would have done it will be all right herman she said patiently she sounded more patient than she was and knew it beneath her pearlbuttoned shirtwaist beneath the dark gray pinstriped jacket she wore over it her heart was pounding class warfare in the usa hadnt reached the point of armed struggle the confrontation ahead though was as close an approach as the country had yet seen democrat versus socialist established attorney against garment workers daughterhere was the class struggle in action someone pounded on the dressingroom door five minutes miss hamburger the manager of the thalia theatre shouted as if she were one of the vaudevillians who usually performed here on bowery she felt as jumpy as any of those performers on opening night the manager who stomped around as if he had weights in his shoes clumped down the hall and shouted five minutes mr miller those last minutes before the debate went by in a blur the next thing flora knew there she stood behind a podium on stage staring out over the footlights at the packed house a fuller house than vaudeville usually drew which was the main reason the manager had rented out the hall tonight there in the second row sat her parents her sisterssophie with little yossel in her armsand her brothers and here at the other podium to her right stood congressman daniel miller appointed to the seat she wanted he wasnt quite so handsome and debonair as his campaign posters made him out to be but who was he looked clever and alert and the democrats had the money and the connections to make a strong campaign for whatever candidate they chose up in between the two candidates strode isidore rothstein the democratic party chairman for the fourteenth ward a coin toss had made him master of ceremonies rather than his socialist opposite number more tosses had determined that miller would speak first and flora last rothstein held up his hands the crowd quieted tonight we see democracy in action he said making what flora thought of as unfair use of his partys name in the middle of the greatest war the world has ever known we come together here to decide which way our district should go listening to both sides to come to a fair decision here and there people in the crowd applauded flora wondered how much anything they did here tonight would really matter the democrats would keep a strong majority in congress unless the sky fell one districtwhat was one district but myron zuckerman had spent his whole adult life working to improve the lot of the common people his legacy would be wasted if this democrat kept this seat to which he had been appointed plenty of reason there alone to fight and now isidore rothstein thundered a bigger voice than had any business coming out of his plump little body congressman daniel miller democrats in the crowd cheered socialists hissed and whistled miller said under teddy roosevelt the democrats have given every american a square deal we are pledged to an honest days pay for an honest days work to treating every individual as an individual and as he deservesthe code phrase democrats used when they explained why they were against labor unionsto the rights of cities and counties and states to govern themselves as far as possible and to what about the war a socialist heckler shouted before the debate the two parties had solemnly agreed not to harass each others candidates both sides had sounded very sincere flora hadnt taken it seriously and didnt expect the democrats had either daniel miller was certainly ready for the shout and to keeping the commitments made long ago to our friends and allies i was about to say he went on smoothly for years the usa was surrounded by our enemies by the confederacy and canada and england and france even by the japanese germany was in the same predicament on the european continent we are both reaching out together for our rightful places in the sun not only that we are winning this war it hasnt been so easy as we thought it would be but what war is to quit now would be to leave poor kaiser bill in the lurch fighting england and france and russia all alone or near enough as makes no difference and to guarantee that the old powers will hold us down for another fifty years do you want that he stuck out his chin in profile as flora saw him his jawline sagged but from the front he probably looked most impressively political she made her own opening statement we are winning this war mr miller says she wouldnt call him congressman if you want to buy a pound of meat you can go down to the butchers shop and get it if you have to pay twenty dollars for it you begin to wonder if its worth the price here we are almost two and a half years into a fight the socialist party never wanted and what have we got to show for it quebec city is still canadian montreal is still canadian toronto is still canadian winnipeg is still canadian richmond is still confederate our own capital is still in confederate hands for heavens sake and nashville is still confederate just this past week the brilliant general custer the heroic general custer attacked again and what did he get half a mile of ground moving away from nashville mind you not toward it and what was the cost another division thrown away threequarters of a million dead since two million wounded half a million in the enemys prisonerofwar camps poor kaiser bill her voice dripped venom and will you have all those brave men die in vain daniel miller demanded will you have the united states abandon the struggle before its over go back to our old borders tell our enemies oh were sorry we didnt really mean it he was sarcastic himself once youve begun a job of work you dont leave it in the middle we have given as good as weve got we have given better than weve got the canucks are tottering the confederates are about to put rifles into black mens hands we are winning i tell you so what flora said the blunt question seemed to catch her opponent by surprise she repeated it so what what can we win that will bring those boys back to life what can we win thats worth a hundredth part of what they paid even if we make the csa make peace instead of the other way round what difference does it make two thousand years ago there was a king who looked around after a battle and cried out one more victory like this and i am ruined he could see he gave up the war is the democratic party full of blind men no were full of men who remember what happened in who remember what happened twenty years later miller shot back were full of men who believe the united states of america must never be humiliated again men who believe we must ten times never humiliate ourselves a man who makes a mistake and backs away from it has sense flora said a man who makes a mistake and keeps on with it is a fool we traitor came a voice from the crowd youre just a woman what do you know about what war costs tightlipped flora pointed to her family sophie stand up her sister did still holding little yossel theres my nephew flora said into sudden silence hell never know his father who died on the roanoke front she pointed again david stand up the older of her two brothers rose wearing us greengray here is my brother he has leave hes just finished his training he goes to the front day after tomorrow i know what this war costs the crowd applauded to her surprise the heckler subsided shed thought the democrats would have pests more consistent than that fellow no matter she turned toturned ondaniel miller you love the war so well congressman now she did use the title etching it with acid where are your hostages to fortune miller was a little too old to be conscripted himself he had no brothers his wife a woman who looked to be very nice sat in the audience not far from floras family with her were her two sons the older of whom might have been thirteen flora had known the democratic appointee couldnt well come back if she raised the question and shed been hoping shed get or be able to make the chance to do it and just for a moment her opponents composure cracked i honorably served my time in the united states army he said i yield to no one in nobody was shooting at you then four people from four different sections of the hall shouted the same thing at the same time a storm of applause rose up behind them miller looked as if hed had one of his fancy clients stand up in court and confess betrayed by circumstances over which he had no control the debate went on daniel miller even made a few points about what a democratic congressman could do for his district that a socialist couldnt hope to match wouldnt you like to have the majority on your side again he asked almost wistfully it was not the best question not in a hall full of jews when since the fall of the second temple had they had the majority on their side and after the blow flora had got in it mattered little at last like a referee separating two weary prizefighters isidore rothstein came out again i know youll all vote next month he told the crowd i expect youll vote the patriotic way flora glared at the democratic party chairman he had no businessno business but the business of politicsgetting in a dig like that now more like a corner man than a referee rothstein led miller away flora had to go offstage by herself only when she was walking down the dark narrow corridor to the dressing room did she fully realize what shed done her feet seemed to float six inches above the filthy boards of the floor when she opened the door maria tresca leaped out and embraced her its ours she exclaimed you did it right behind her herman bruck agreed his face looked like curdled milk when you reminded people he has no personal stake in watching the war go on that stupid democratic heckler gave me the opening i needed flora said rothstein must be throwing a fit in the other dressing room maria looked at bruck bruck looked uncommonly smug even for him that was no stupid democrat that was my cousin mottel and i told him what to say and when to say it flora stared at him then let out a shriek then kissed him on the cheek shall we go out and have supper to celebrate she thought shed meant the invitation to include maria too but maria didnt seem to think so and flora discovered she didnt mind herman bruck had just given her the congressional seat on a silver platter if that didnt deserve a dinner what did besides she always had her hatpin if she felt like using it maybe she wouldnt weve got to hold this town boys lieutenant jerome nicoll said below waurika theres no more sequoyah left not hardly theres just the red river and then theres texas the whole confederacy is depending on us if the damnyankees push over the river and into texas you can kiss sequoyah goodbye when the war is done wish i could kiss sequoyah goodbye right now reginald bartlett muttered under his breath wish i was back in virginia napoleon dibble gaped you wish you was back on the roanoke front reggie he sounded as if he thought bartlett was crazy had reggie wished that he would have been crazy no i wish i was back in richmond where i came from dibble nodded enlightened or as enlightened as he got under his breath reggie went on the other thing i wish is that lieutenant nicoll would get himself a new speech nap dibble didnt hear him but sergeant hairston did yeah he said we got to hold this we got to hold that then what the hell happens when we dont hold we supposed to go off and shoot ourselves if we dont hold a place the damnyankees usually shoot a lot of us bartlett said which made pete hairston laugh but which was also unpleasantly true the regimentthe whole divisionhad taken a lot of casualties trying to halt the us drive toward the red river an aeroplane buzzed overhead reggie started to unsling his rifle to take a shot at it it wasnt flying very high for gray clouds filled the sky but it carried the confederate battle flag under its wings he stared at it in tired wonder the usa didnt have many aeroplanes out here in the west but the csa had even fewer hoping it would do the damnyankees some harm he forgot about it and marched on toward waurika the towns business district lay in a hollow with houses on the surrounding hills well have to hold the yanks up here he said as much to himself as to anyone else we go down there into that bowl were going to get pounded to death as had been true up in wilson town not all the civilians had fled from waurika most of the men and women who came out of the houses to look over the retreating confederates had dark skins waurika lieutenant nicoll had said was about half kiowa half comanche reggie couldnt have told one bunch from the other to save himself from the firing squad some of the civilians had skins darker than copper the indians negro servants most of those or at least most of the ones bartlett saw were women the men had probably been impressed into labor service already either that or theyd run off toward the yankees or toward the forests and swamps of the red river bottom country where a man who knew how to live off the land could fend for himself for a long time more than a few indians men wearing homespun and carrying hunting rifles tried to fall in with the column of confederate soldiers you braves dont know what youre getting into lieutenant nicoll told them this isnt any kind of fighting youve ever seen before and if the damnyankees catch you shooting at them without wearing a uniform theyll kill you for it what will the yankees do to us if they take this land one of the indians answered we do not want to be in the usa our grandfathers have told us how bad the living was under the stars and stripes another indian agreed we want to stay under the stars and bars he pointed toward the business section of waurika where several confederate flags flew in spite of the threatening weather at that moment the weather stopped threatening and started delivering chilly rain mixed with sleet shivering bartlett consoled himself with the thought that the rain would be harder on the yankees who would have to fight their way through it than on his own unit which had already reached the place it needed to defend sergeant hairston spoke in a low urgent voice sir you cant give them redskins any stretch of line to hold they aint soldiers we are warriors one of the indians said proudly the tribes in the east of sequoyah have their own armies allied to the stars and bars ive heard about that nicoll said isnt anything like it hereabouts though he scowled visibly of two minds at last he went on you want to fight the indians gathered round him made it loudly clear they did indeed want to fight he held up a hand all right this is what well do you go out in front of the line well hold you snipe at the damnyankees and bring us back word of what theyre doing and how theyre moving dont let yourselves get captured you get in trouble run back to the front is it a bargain we know this country one of the indians answered the soldiers in the uniforms the color of horse shit will not find us the rest of the men from waurika nodded then trotted quietly north in the direction from which the us soldiers would come reggie turned to nap dibble the damnyankees may not find em but what about machinegun bullets i dont care how brave or how smart you are and a machine gun doesnt care either he spoke with the grim certainty of a man who had been through the machinegun hell of the roanoke river valley all nap dibble knew was the more open fighting that characterized the sequoyah front no he knew one thing more better themn us he said and taking out his entrenching tool began to dig in along with using the indians of waurika as scouts and snipers lieutenant nicoll used the few negro men left in town as laborers none of the indian women and old men left behind objected no one asked the negroes opinions with shovels and hoes and mattocks they began helping the confederate soldiers make entrenchments in the muddy ground once there were holes in which the men of nicolls company could huddle the lieutenant set the blacks to digging zigzag communications trenches back toward a second line lawd have mercy suh one of them said you gwine work us to death you dont know what death is not till the yankees start shelling you nicoll answered then his voice went even colder than the weather werent for the way you niggers rose up last winter the confederate states wouldnt be in the shape theyre in werent us suh said the negro who had spoken before onliest reds in sequoyah theys indians and they was born that way the other black men impressed into labor nodded emphatic agreement likely tell nicoll said dismissing their contention with a toss of the head you want to show me youre good loyal confederates you dig now and help your countrys soldiers beat the yanks sullenly the negroes dug alongside the soldiers bartlett began to hope the confederates around waurika would have the rest of the day and the whole night in which to prepare their position for the expected us onslaught having slogged through a lot of mud himself he knew what kind of time the yankee troops would be having but a little past three in the afternoon a brisk crackle of smallarms fire broke out ahead of the line he found himself in a trench and peering out over the parapet almost before he realized hed heard the rifles some of the reports were strange not all rifles sounded exactly like the tredegars and springfields with which hed been so familiar for so long machine guns were heavy units not of the first qualitywhich on the sequoyah front meant a lot of unitsdidnt make sure they kept up with the head of an advancing column but that malignant hammering started only moments after the rifle fire broke out now we see what kind of balls the redskins have sergeant hairston said with a sort of malicious anticipation warriors he hawked and spat in the mud here came the kiowas and comanches running back toward the hastily dug entrenchments behind them trudging across the fields firing as they advanced were us soldiers an indian fell then another one an indian leaped into the trench near bartlett why do you not shoot at them he demanded do you want them to kill us all no reggie answered what we want is for them to get close enough for us to hurt em bad when we do open up fire discipline its called the indian stared at him without comprehension but when the confederate company did open up with rifles and machine guns and a couple of trench mortars the us soldiers went down as if scythed not all of them reggie knew would be hit more were taking whatever cover they could find but the advance stopped more indians jumped into the trenches with the confederates they kept on shooting at the yankees and showed as much spirit as the men alongside whom they fought maybe they are warriors bartlett said sergeant hairston nodded yeah maybe they are i tell you one thing though bartlett they give the niggers guns the way it looks like theyre gonna them coons aint never gonna fight this good reggie thought about that the kiowas and comanchesmost of the indians in sequoyahhad done pretty well for themselves under the rule of the great white father in richmond as these young men had said they wanted to stay under the stars and bars how many negroes wanted the same thing maybe theyll fight for the chance to turn into real citizens he said at last shitfire who wants niggers voting hairston exclaimed since reggie himself was a long way from thrilled at the idea of their voting he kept quiet it all seemed abstract anyhow wondering about if and how soon the yankees would be able to haul their artillery forward through the thickening muck was a much more immediate concern riding a swaybacked horse hed no doubt rented at the st matthews livery stable tom colleton came slowly up the path toward the ruins of marshlands anne colleton stood waiting for her brother her hands on her hips when he got close enough for her to call out to him she said you might have let me known you were coming before you telephoned the train station i would have come to get you in the motorcar sis i tried to wire you but they told me the lines out from st matthews werent up or had gone down again or some such tom answered when i got into town i telephoned just on the off chancei didnt really expect to get you i was all set to show up and surprise you i believe it anne answered tom had always been one to do things first and sort out the consequences later she pointed to the wire than ran to the cabin where she lived these days they finally put that in last week if you knew what i had to go through to get it cant be worse than army red tape tom said as he swung down from the horse he looked fit and dashing and alert his right hand never strayed far from the pistol on his hip the scar on his cheek wasnt pink and fresh any more he also wore two stars on either side of his stand collar youve been promoted anne exclaimed he gave a little bow as a french officer might have done lieutenantcolonel colleton at your service maam he said my regiment happened to find a hole in the yankee lines up on the roanoke and they pushed forward half a mile at what turned out to be exactly the right time he touched one of the stars signifying his new rank then the other each of these cost me about a hundred and fifty men killed and wounded slowly anne nodded tom had gone into the war as a lark an adventure a lot had changed in the past two years a lot had changed here too he strode up to her and gave her a brotherly embrace but his eyes remained on what had been the family mansion those sons of bitches he said in a flat hard voice and then well from what i hear they paid for it ten times over maybe not so much as that anne said but they paid she cocked her head to one side and sent him a curious glance and youre one of the people who want to put guns in niggers hands he nodded for one thing were running out of white men to be soldiers he said and anne nodded in turn remembering president semmes words tom went on for another if niggers have a stake in the confederate states maybe they wont try and pull them down around our ears we smashed this rebellion sure but that doesnt mean we wont have another one ten years from now if things dont change this ones smashed but its not dead she said cassius is still out in the swamps by the river and the militiamen theyve sent after him and his friends havent been able to smoke them out hes the kind of nigger i wish we had in the army tom said hed make one fine scout and sniper unless he decided to shoot at you instead of the damnyankees anne answered which made her brother grimace then suddenly she noticed a new ribbon in the fruit salad above toms left breast pocket her eyes widened pointing to it she said thats an order of lee and you werent going to say a thing about it shed succeeded in embarrassing him i didnt want to worry you he replied which went a long way toward explaining the circumstances under which hed won it the order of lee was the army equivalent of roger kimballs order of the virginia only one step down from the confederate cross ive been worried from the beg anne started to say but that wasnt quite true in the beginning she like most in the csa had thought theyd lick the yankees as quickly and easily as they had in their first two wars she made the needed change ive been worried for a long time julia came up to them then her baby on her hip mistuh tom we got yo cabin ready fo you thats good he answered thank you he spoke to her in a tone slightly different from the one he would have used before the war started even if the words might have been the same then in he would have taken the service completely for granted now he spoke of it as if she was doing him a favor anne found herself using that tone with blacks these days too and noticed it in others tom went back to his horse detached the saddlebags and bedroll from the saddle and carried them while he walked after julia in a negro would have dashed up to relieve him of them if he missed that level of deference he didnt show it and before he went into the cabin he asked youre not putting anyone out so i can stay in here are you no suh the serving woman answered aint so many folks here as used to be i see that tom glanced over at anne its a wonder youve done as much as you have out here by yourself you do what you have to do she said at which he nodded again before the war that hard logic had meant nothing to him the roanoke front had given him more than rank and decorations he understood and accepted the ways of the world these days as soon as julia went out of earshot she continued in a lower voice we made a bargain of sortsthey do the work that needs to be done and i make sure nobody from st matthews or columbia comes around prying into what they did during the rebellion you said something about that in one of your letters tom answered remembering best you could do i suppose but there are some niggers i wouldnt have made that bargain with cassius for one even if youd want him for a soldier anne asked gently mocking especially because id want him for a soldier her brother said i know a dangerous man when i see one i have no bargain with cassius anne said quietly every so often livestock heredisappears i dont know where it goes but i can guess not that much to eat in the swamps of the congaree even for niggers used to living off the land thats so tom agreed and hell have friends among the hands here sis i really wish you werent out here by your lonesome if im not this place goes to the devil anne said i didnt get a great crop from it but i got a crop that gave me some of the money i needed to pay the war taxes and it meant i didnt have to cut so far into my investments as i would have otherwise i dont intend to be a beggar when the war ends and i dont intend for you to be a beggar either if the choice is between being being rich and being a beggar thats one thing sis he said if the choice is between being a beggar and being dead thats a different game his face its expression already far more stern than it had been before the war turned bleak as the oncoming winter thats what the confederate states are looking at right now seems to me a choice between being beggars and being dead he walked up into the cottage anne followed him he tossed the saddlebags and bedroll onto the floor next to the ironframed cot on which hed sleep looking around he shook his head its not the way it was any more he said half to himself nothing is the way it was any more no anne said its not buti talked with president semmes not so long ago hes worried yes but not that worried she checked herself if the president hadnt been that worried would he have introduced the bill calling for negro troops trying to look on the bright side she pointed to toms tunic that was a victory there in the valley and it makes one her brother answered bitterly i pray to god we can hold the ground we gained too we need every man in the csa at the front and we need every man in the csa working behind the lines so the men at the front have something to shoot at the damnyankees if everybody could be two places at once twentyfour hours a day wed be fine thats why the president wants to give the blacks guns she said i understand he sounded impatient with her something hed rarely donebefore the war that endlessly echoed phrase weve put them in the factories to make up for the white men whove gone maybe we can put enough women in to make up for the niggers maybe she didnt want to argue with him any more supper soon she said come over to my cottage and well talk more then get yourself settled in for now for now he repeated ive got to catch the train day after tomorrow he sighed no rest for the weary supper was fried chicken greens and pumpkin pie with apple brandy that had no tax stamp on it to wash down the food its not what i would have given you if things were different anne said watching with something like awe as the mountain of chicken bones on her brothers plate grew and grew no fancy banquets these days though its nigger food tom said and then held up a hand against the temper that sparked in her eyes wait sis wait its good its a hundred times better than what i eat at the front dont you worry about it for a minute he patted his belly which should have bulged visibly from what hed put away but somehow didnt what are we going to do she said if this is the best we can hope for once the war is over is it worth going on kentucky is a state in the united states again tom said quietly the yankees say it is anyhow and they have some traitors there who go along with them the best may not be as good as we hoped when we set out to fight but the worst is worse than we ever reckoned it could be he yawned then got up walked over to her and kissed her on the cheek im going to bed siscant hold em open any more you dont have to worry about anything tonightim here he walked out of the cottage into the darkness julia took away the dishes anne got into a long cotton nightgown blew out the lamps and lay down off in the distance an owl hooted off farther in the distance a rifle cracked then another than a short volley silence returned she shrugged ordinary noises of the night as always her pistol lay where she could reach it she even carried the revolver when she needed to go to the outhouse instead of using the pot though it was no good against moths and spiders did she feel safer because her brother was here yes she decided now there were two guns on which she could rely absolutely did she feel he was taking on the job of protecting her so she wouldnt even have to think of such things as long as he was nearby laughing at the absurdity of the notion she rolled over and went to sleep george enos was swabbing the deck on the starboard side of the uss ericsson when shouts of alarm rang out to port torpedo he jumped as if someone had stabbed him with a pin as klaxons began to hoot he sprinted toward his battle station a onepounder antiaircraft gun not far from the depthcharge launcher at the stern of the destroyer someone by some accident had actually read his file and given him a job he knew how to do the onepounder wasnt that different from an outsized machine gun torpedo the shouts grew louder the ericssons deck throbbed under enos feet as the engines came up to full power from cruising speed thick black smoke poured from the stacks the smoke poured back toward him he coughed and tried to breathe as little as he could the deck heeled sharply as the destroyer swung into a tight turn the turn was to the right not to the left as hed expected were heading into the track he shouted at the launcher carl sturtevant nodded if it misses us we charge down the wake and pay the submarine a visit the petty officer said yeah george said if it missed them that was what would happen but it was likelier to hit them when they were running toward it than if theyd chosen to run away enos did his best not to think about that he was sure the whole crew of the ericssonincluding captain fleming whod ordered the turnwere doing their best not to think about that he peered ahead though the destroyers superstructure blocked his view of the most critical area his fate rested on decisions over which he had no control and which he could not judge till afterwards he hated that so did every other navy man with whom hed ever spoken both on the mississippi and out here in the atlantic something moving almost impossibly fast shot by the onrushing ericsson perhaps fifty feet to starboard of her staring at the creamy wake george sucked in a long breath not caring any more how smoky it was missed he said with fervent delight is that the only fish they launched at us dont hear em yelling about any others sturtevant said lieutenant crowder came running toward the stern load it up he shouted to sturtevant and his comrades well make em pay for taking a shot at us yes sir sturtevant sounded less optimistic than his superior the depthcharge launcher was a new gadget the ericsson one of the first ships in the navy to use it instead of simply rolling the ashcans off the stern like a lot of new gadgets it worked pretty well most of the time like a lot of sailors george enos among them sturtevant was conservative enough to find that something less than adequate like a lot of young lieutenants crowder was enamored of anything and everything new for no better reason than that it was new he said by throwing the charges off to the side we dont have to sail right over the sub and lose hydrophone contact with it yes sir sturtevant said again his mouth twisted george understood that too a hydrophone could give you a rough bearing on a submersible what it couldnt tell you was where along that bearing the damn thing lurked an officer on the bridge waved his hat to lieutenant crowder launch crowder shouted as if the depthcharge crew couldnt figure out what that meant for themselves the launcher roared the depth charge spun through the air then splashed into the sea carl sturtevants lips moved in the racket george couldnt hear what he said but he saw the shape of the words here goes nothingand it was just as well that lieutenant crowder couldnt read lips another depth charge flew the chances of hitting a submarine werent quite zero but they werent good the charge had to go off within fifteen feet of a sub to be sure of wrecking it though it might badly damage a boat at twice that range since the destroyer and the submersible were both moving hits were as much luck as in a blindfold rock fight as the third depth charge arced away from the ericsson water boiled up from the explosion of the first one damnation lieutenant crowder shouted only white water nothing more by the disappointed look on his face hed expected a kill on his very first try another charge flew the second one went off down below the surface of the sea another seething mass of white water appeared and then a great burst of bubbles and an oil slick that helped calm both the normal chop of the atlantic and the turbulence the bubbles had kicked up hit crowder and sturtevant and the rest of the depthcharge crew and george all screamed the word at the same time skepticism forgotten sturtevant planted a reverent kiss on the oily metal side of the depthcharge launcher more bubbles rose from the stricken submersible and more oil too peering out into the ocean george was the first to spy the dark shape rising through the murky water here he comes the son of a bitch he said and turned the onepounder in the direction of the submersible the gun was intended for aeroplanes but moses hadnt come down from the mountain saying you couldnt shoot it at anything else vaster than a broaching whale the crippled sub surfaced english french confederate george didnt know or care it was the enemy the men inside had done their best to kill him their best hadnt been good enough now it was his turn some of the enemy sailors still had fight in them they ran across the hull toward the submersibles deck gun george opened up with the onepounder before lieutenant crowder screamed rake em shell casings leaped from georges gun it fired tenround clips as if it were an overgrown rifle one of the rounds hit an enemy sailor george had never imagined what one of those shells could do to a human body one instant the fellow was dashing along the dripping hull the next his entire midsection exploded into red mist his legs ran another stride and a half before toppling george picked up another clipit hardly seemed to weigh anythingand slammed it into the onepounder he blew another man to pieces but most of the clip went to chewing up the submersibles conning tower the sub wouldnt be doing any diving not if it was full of holes as he was reloading again one of the ericssons fourinch guns fired a shell into the ocean twenty yards in front of the submarines bow a warning shot that sent water fountaining up to drench the surviving men who had reached the deck gun they didnt shoot back at the destroyer their hands went up in the air instead hold fire lieutenant crowder said george obeyed a moment later a white flag waved from the top of the conning tower more men started emerging from the hatch and standing on the hull all of them with their hands raised in surrender crowder used a pair of field glasses to read the name of the boat which was painted on the side of the conning tower snook he said shell be a confederate boat they name em for fish same as we do looks like a limey dont she flags fluttered up on the snooks signal lines hes asking if he can launch his boats said sturtevant who had far more practice at reading them than did george captain flemings answer came swiftly crowder read it before sturtevant could denied we will take you off he inspected the dejected crew of the submersible i dont see their captain but theyre all so frowzy he may be there anyhow boats slid across the quartermile of water separating the ericsson and the snook confederate sailors were already boarding them when one more man burst from the submersibles hatchway and hurried onto one of them theres the captain sturtevant said and then shes sinking the goddamn bastard opened the scuttling cocks thats what he was doing down below so long ahh hell no way to save her sure enough the snook was quickly sliding down into the depths from which she had arisen she would not rise again up onto the deck of the ericsson came the glum confederates us sailors crowded round to see the men who had almost sunk them the attitude of the victors was half relief half professional respect they knew the submariners could have won the duel as easily as not when the confederate captain came aboard the destroyer georges jaw fell briggs he burst out ralph briggs somebody here know me the rebel officer looked around to see who had spoken i sure do george pushed through the crowd around the confederates his grin was enormous id better i was one of the fishermen who helped sink you when you were skipper of the tarpon what we already captured this damn reb once lieutenant crowder exclaimed why the devil isnt he in a prisonerofwar camp where he belongs then because i escaped thats why briggs stood straighter international law says you cant do anything to me on account of it either we could toss him in the drink and let him swim to shore carl sturtevant said without the slightest smile to suggest he was joking george shook his head when he was going to sink my trawler he let the crew take to the boats he played square besides if we ditched him wed have to ditch the whole crew lieutenant crowder said too many people would know somebody would get drunk and tell the story and the entente papers would scream like nobodys business theyre prisoners and were stuck with em he pointed to the confederate submariners then jerked a thumb toward the nearest hatch you men go belowand this time briggs well make damn sure you dont get loose before the war is done you can try the submersible skipper answered my duty is to escape if i can he nodded to george enos i wish id never seen you once let alone twice but i do thank you for speaking up for me there george looked him in the eye if you were the skipper of the damn commerce raider that got my fishing boat when i was still a civilian youd be swimming now for all of me get moving lieutenant crowder said again and along with his crew ralph briggs headed for the the brig briggs is going to the brig george said and laughed as the confederates one by one went down the hatchway and disappeared standing in bay view park chester martin peered east across the maumee river to the toledo ohio docks mist that was turning to drizzle kept him from seeing as much as he would have liked but a couple of light cruisers from the lake erie fleet were in port resupplying so they could go off and bombard the southern coast of ontario again martin turned to his younger sister you know what sue this business of watching the war from the far side of the river is alot more fun than being in it up close the pause came from his swallowing a pungent intensifier or two in the trenches he cursed as automatically as he breathed hed horrified his mother a couple of times and now tried to watch himself around his female relatives sue giggled shed caught the hesitation she found his profanity more funny than horrifying but then she was of his generation they shared a sharpnosed sharpchinned family look though sues hair was brown not sandy heading toward red like his she said im just sorry you had to get hurt so you could come home for a while oh i knew it was a hometowner as soon as i got it he said exaggerating only a little never worried about it for a minute now that my arms out of the sling i expect theyll be sending me back to the front before too long i wish they wouldnt she said and took his good right hand in both of hers she was careful with his left arm even if hed finally had it released from its cloth cocoon from behind him a gruff voice said you there soldierlets see your papers and make it snappy martins turn was anything but snappy it let the military policeman see the three stripes on his sleeve the mp was only a private first class he didnt worry about that though not with the law on his side martin was convinced the military police attracted selfrighteous sons of bitches the way spilled sugar drew ants but this fellow wouldnt be able to give him a hard time he took the necessary paperwork from a tunic pocket and handed it to the mp convalescent leave eh the fellow said weve seen some humbug documents of this sort lately sergeant what would happen if i took you back to barracks and told you to show me a scar id do it and youd get your ass in a sling martin answered steadily he looked the private first class up and down with the scorn most frontline soldiers felt for their notquitecounterparts who hadnt seen real action why is it sonny boy the only time you ever see a dead mp hes got a springfield bullet in him not a tredegar sue didnt get that the military policeman did and turned brick red i ought to keep these he said holding martins papers so the sergeant couldnt take them back go ahead martin said lets head back to your barracks we can both tell your commanding officer about it like i say doesnt matter a beans worth to me a soldier ready to go back to barracks and take his case to the officer of the day was not a spectacle the mp was used to angrily he thrust martins papers back at him angrily he stomped off the soles of his boots slapping the bricks of the walkway thats telling him sue said proudly clutching her brothers arm he didnt have any business talking to you like that he could ask for my papers to make sure im not absent without leave martin said but when he got nasty afterwards he made a face he didnt have any call to do that except hes a military policeman and people have to do what he tells them like the coal board officials sue said and the ration board and the train transportation board and the war loan subscription committees and she could have gone on instead she said all those people were bad enough before the war theyre worse now and there are more of them and if youre not a big cheese yourself they act like little tin gods and give you a nasty time just to show they can do it makes you wonder what the countrys coming to sometimes doesnt it martin said old people say there used to be more room to act the way you pleased back before the second mexican war taught us how surrounded we are gramps would always go on about that remember she shook her head not really i was only six or seven when he died what i remember about him was his peg leg and how he always pretended he was a pirate on account of it yeah he got hurt worse than i did and the doctors in the war of secession werent as good as they are nowadays either i dont suppose he used to talk about stacks of cutoff arms and legs outside the surgeons tents after a battle sue looked revolted not with me he didnt youre a girl chester reminded her he used to tell me and hank all the horrible stuff we ate it up like gumdrops she sighed i was only seven when henry died too what a horrible year that was everybody wailing all the time i miss him sometimes same as gramps i waseleven twelve something like that martin said he was two years older than me i know that much i remember the way the doctor kept shaking his head for all the good he did us he might as well have been a sioux medicine man scarlet fever any of those thingsi wish they could cure them not just tell you what they are hed be in the army toohenry i mean sues laugh was startled i dont think i ever thought of henry all grown up till now hed be in the army all right chester agreed hed be an officer i bet hank was always sharp as a razor people listened to him too i didntbut i was his brother after all a chilly breeze from off the lake seemed to slice right through his uniform brr enough sightseeing lets go home and sit in front of the fire they caught the trolley and went southwest down summit alongside the maumee after three or four miles the trolley car turned inland and clattered past the county courthouse and across the street from it the big bronze statue of remembrance sword bared in her right hand pointing to it sue said we just got some new stereoscope views of new york city now i know how good a copy of the statue on bedloes island that one is even if ours is only half as tall weve still got a lot to pay people back forthe united states do i mean martin said now he laughed ive got a rebel to pay back and i dont even know who he is the trolley took them over the ottawa river a smaller stream than the maumee and up into ottawa heights the closest stop was three blocks from their apartment house chester remembered how cramped hed felt in the flat before the war started he had no more room nowless in fact because theyd had to make room for him when he came back to convalescebut he didnt mind after crowded barracks and insanely crowded bombproof shelters a room of his own even a small one seemed luxury itself his motheran older graying version of sueall but pounced on him when he came in the door you have a letter here from the white house louisa martin exclaimed thrusting the fancy envelope at him the martin family had a strong tradition of never opening one anothers mail that tradition obviously had never been so sorely tested as now dont be silly mother chester said the rebs are still holding onto the white house his mother glared at him and with reason even if business got done in philadelphia washington remained the capital of the usa sue squeaked open it she said and then grabbed his arm so he couldnt he shook her off and did open the envelope dear sergeant martin he read from the typed letter i have learned you were wounded in action since you have defended not only the united states of america but also me personally on my visit to the roanoke front i dare hope my wishes for your quick and full recovery will be welcome sincerely yours theodore roosevelt the signature was in vivid blue ink thats wonderful louisa martin said softly tr keeps track of everything doesnt he seems to martin agreed he kept staring at that signature well i was going to vote for him anyhow guess ill have to vote twice now if you knew the right people in toledo as in a good many other us towns you could do that though hed meant if for a joke his mother sighed one of these days ohio may get around to granting womens suffrage then you wouldnt need to vote twice stephen douglas martin chesters father came home from the mill about an hour later well well he said holding the letter from tr out at arms length so he could read it he was too old to worry about conscription and had been promoted three times at work since the start of the war when younger men with better jobs had to put on greengray aint that somethin chester aint that somethin we ought to frame this here letter and keep it safe so you can show it to your grandchildren that would be something pop martin said he thought of himself with gray hair and wrinkled skin sitting in a rocking chair telling war stories to little boys in short pants grampsstories had always been exciting even the ones about how hed lost his leg could chester make life in the trenches exciting was it anything hed want to tell his grandchildren maybe if he could show them the presidents letter im proud of you son his father said the second mexican war was over before they called me up my father fought for our country and now you have too thats pretty fine all right pop martin answered for a moment he wondered what his father would have said if hed stopped that bullet with his head instead of his arm whatever it was he wouldnt have been around to hear it supper his mother called the ham steaks that went with the fried potatoes werent very bigmeat had got expensive as the dickens this past year hed heard a hundred timesbut they were tasty and there were plenty of potatoes in the big black iron pan she served chester seconds of those and then thirds youre going to have to let out the pants on my uniform he said but all she did was nodshe was ready to do it his father lighted a cigar and passed one to him the tobacco was sharp and rather nasty but a cigar was a cigar he leaned back in his chair as his mother and sister cleared away the dishes for now the front seemed far far away he tried to stretch each moment as long as he could come on jake featherston called to the gun crews of his battery weve got to keep moving rain poured down out of the sky the southern maryland road already muddy began turning to something more like glue or maybe thick soup come on a whistle in the air swelled rapidly to a scream a longrange shell from a yankee gun burst about a hundred yards to featherstons left a great fountain of muck rose into the air none splattered down on him but that hardly mattered hed long since got as muddy as a human being could more us shells descended feeling for the road down which the first richmond howitzers were retreating the damnyankee gunners couldnt quite find it the barrage instead of swinging west from where the first one hit went east that meant theyd probably find another road and hurt a different part of the army of northern virginia jake didnt care if he got out in one piece hed settle for that hey sarge michael scott said with the shelling and the rain the loader had to call two or three times to get featherstons attention when he finally had it he asked what do we do when we get to the potomac you think im the war department god damn them to hell featherston answered the war department and especially its upper echelons did not contain his favorite people if the damnyankees aeroplanes havent bombed all the bridges to hell and gone i reckon we cross over em and go back into virginia but what are we gonna do there scott persisted i told you im not the goddamn war department jake said he shook his head which made cold rainwater drip down the back of his neck they wouldnt make him an officer they didnt have the brains to notice when the niggers were going to rise up and they were still in charge of running the war where was the justice in that and his own men expected him to think like a fancypants richmond general where was the justice in that but sarge the loader said like a little boy complaining when his mother wouldnt let him do what he wanted all right featherston said wearily heres what we do you ask me we cross the bridge if its still up there all the artillery weve got goes into battery on the south bank soon as the last man from the army of northern virginia comes out of maryland we drop the bridge right into the middle of the river bam soon as the damnyankees get in range of our guns we start plastering them hard as we can those sons of bitches are already in the western part of the state sure as the devil dont want em getting a toehold anywhere else do we nope scott soundednot happy now but contented hed got jake to tell him what he could have worked out for himself if hed had an ounce of sense featherston shook his head again more rainwater ran down his neck what difference did that make when he was already so soaked he cursed the yankees he cursed the mud and he cursed the war department the last more sulfurously than either of the other two christ no wonder were losing he told the unheeding sky if the damn fools cant do the little things right how are they supposed to do the big ones he supposed the united states army was afflicted with a war department too but somehow it seemed to be overcoming the handicap to make his joy with the world complete the lead gun went into a puddle and bogged to the hubs the horses strained in their harness but it did no good that gun wasnt going anywhere any time soon not with just the team trying to get it out and the others piled up in back of it along with the rest of the gun crew he lent his own strength to the work pushing from behind as the horses pulled the gun remained stuck jake spotted metellus the cook lounging on the limber that traveled behind the gun get your black ass up here and do something to help damn you he snarled the yankees do find this here road with their guns the shells wont care what color you are theyll blow you up same as me his grin was ferocious if that aint nigger equality i dont know what the hell is metellus got down and got as dirty as any of the white men but the gun wouldnt budge sarge the horses are gonna founder if we work em any more right now michael scott said theyll plumb keel over and die shit featherston looked around feeling harassed by too many things at once the whole battery would bog down if he didnt move the rest of the threeinchers around the lead gun but if he had to abandon it the higherups would crucify him the only way hed kept his head above water was by being twice as good as anybody else around if he showed he was merely human theyd cook his goose in jig time here came a battalion of infantry marching through the mud by the side of the road because the guns were occupying the mud in the middle of the road give us some help boys jake called to the foot soldiers cant afford to lose any guns some of the infantrymen started to break ranks but the lieutenant in charge of the company shouted keep moving men we have our own schedule to meet he gave featherston a hard stare you have no business attempting to delay my men sergeant yes sir sorry sir jake said as he had to he was just a sergeant after all not one of gods anointed officers how he hated that smug lieutenant because of his arrogance the confederate states would lose a gun they could have kept a gun they should have kept whats going on here someone demanded in sharp angry tones an officer on horseback surveyed the scene with nothing but disapproval featherston kept quiet he was only a sergeant after all the lieutenant answered sir this this enlisted man is trying to use my troops to get out of his trouble then youd better let him hadnt you major clarence potter snapped the lieutenants jaw dropped he stared up at potter with his mouth wide open like a stupid turkey drowning in the rain the intelligence officer went on break out some ropes get your men on that gun and get it moving we cant afford to leave it behind but the infantry lieutenant began major potter fixed him with the intent icy stare that had impressed jake on their first meeting up in pennsylvaniaand how long ago that seemed one more word from you lieutenant and i shall ask what your name is the lieutenant wilted featherston would have been astounded had he done anything else twenty men on a rope and more on the hubs and carriage got the threeinch gun up out of the morass into which it had sunk on more solid ground the horses could move it again thank you sir jake said waving the rest of the guns from the battery around the bad spot in the road my pleasure potter said crisp as usual weve done a pretty fair job of fighting the enemy in this war sergeant but god deliver us from our friends sometimes yes sir jake said that put his own anger into words better than hed been able to do for himself keep struggling sergeant potter said thats all you can do thats all any of us can do yes sir jake stared furiously after the nowvanished infantry lieutenant he could have been heading up a labor brigade and if he was he wouldnt have let me use any niggers either id say youre probably right potter said some people get promoted because theyre brave and active some people get promoted for no better reason than that all their paperwork stays straight and some people dont get promoted at all featherston said bitterly weve been over this ground before sergeant potter said theres nothing i can do its not up to me jake would not hear him that damn lieutenantbeg your pardon sirwouldnt pay me any mind on account of i wasnt an officer i command this battery and i damn well deserve to command it but he treated me like a nigger on account of im just a sergeant he glanced over to the intelligence officer its true isnt it they are going to give niggers guns and put em in the line its passed the house its passed the senate since president semmes was the one who proposed the bill hes not going to veto it major potter said you know what sir featherston said you mark my words theres gonna be a nigger promoted to lieutenant before i get these here stripes off my sleeve is that fair is that right potters lips twisted in what might have been a sympathetic grin or an expression of annoyance at jakes unending complaints the latter it proved for the major said sergeant if you think youre the only man unfairly treated in the army of northern virginia i assure you that youre mistaken he squeezed his horses sides with his knees the animal trotted on ahh youre just another bastard after all jake said thanks to the rain potter didnt hear him featherston turned back to the battery come on lets get moving they bogged down again less than half a mile in front of the bridge this time jake had no trouble getting help for a negro labor gang was close by and the white officer in charge of it proved reasonable featherston worked the black men unmercifully hard but he and his comrades were working hard too the guns came free and rattled toward and then over the bridge the firing pits that waited for them on the south side of the potomac were poorly dug in and poorly sited everythings going to hell around here featherston growled and went tramping around to see if he could find better positions no other guns would occupy he had little luck if the artillery hadnt had to stay close to the river to defend the crossing he wouldnt have wanted anything to do with the area when the yankees came down and got their guns in place his crew was going to catch it hed come down close by the potomac when the engineers blew the bridge and sent it crashing into the water as hed predicted somebody near him cheered to see it fall featherstons scowl never wavered how long would the wrecked bridge keep the yankees out of virginia not long enough he feared destroyers and a couple of armored cruisers screened the dakota and the new york as the two battleships steamed southeast through the pacific on the deck of the dakota sam carsten said i wont be sorry to leave the sandwich islands and thats a fact as if to emphasize his words he rubbed at the zincoxide ointment on his nose youre gonna bake worse before you get better vic crosetti said with a chuckle he could afford to laugh when he baked he turned brown were going over the equator and it dont get any hotter than that and besides its heading toward summer down in chile oh jesus carsten said mournfully sure as hell i forgot all about that he looked at his hands which were as red as every other square inch of him exposed to the sun why the devil didnt the chileans get into trouble with argentina six months ago crosetti poked him in the ribs far as im concerned all this means is were doing pretty well if we can detach a squadron from the sandwich islands to give our allies a hand we got to figure aint no way for the limeys and the japs to get honolulu and pearl away from us he paused then added unless that john liholiho item tells them exactly what weve got and where everythings at you know maybe we ought to send a letter back to the sandwich islands when we get to chile sam said about him being a spy i mean theyll rake him over the coals you bet they will yeah maybe we should do that crosetti said hell lets reckon youre right about the other too dammit carsten scratched one of his sunburned ears did being happy for his country outweigh being miserable at the prospect of still more sunburn that one was too close to call without doing some thinking right about what hiram kidde asked as he came up carsten and crosetti explained the veteran gunners mate nodded yeah the brass has got to think the islands are ours to keep weve got enough guns and enough soldiers on em now that taking em away would cost more than the limeys can afford what about the japs sam said they showed better than i ever figured they could there in the battle of the three navies yeah i suppose the japs are a wild card kidde admitted but as long as we dont fall asleep there at pearl i expect well be able to take care of them all right he studied carsten youre looking a little down in the mouth you find a gal in honolulu you didnt feel like leaving nah its nothing like that capn carsten answered i was hoping id get out of the damn sun for a while but vic here just reminded me the seasons do a flipflop down there kidde let out an undignified snort old son that aint gonna matter a hill of beans how long you think were going to stay in valparaiso not anywhere near long enough to get to know the senoritas i bet once we refit and refuel there were gonna head south to join the chilean fleet i dont care whether its summer or not your poor miserable hide wont burn in the straits of magellan sam considered that yeah youre right he said happilyso happily that kidde snorted again listen sam he said sunburns not the only thing that can go wrong with you you know we get down there youll find out what kind of a sailor you are the dakotas a good sea boat and shes gonna need to be down in the straits theyve got waves thatll toss around a ship as big as this one like she was a wooden toy in a tin tub with a rambunctious fiveyearold in it ive made that passage a couplethree times and you can keep it for all of me capnif i start puking i know itll be over sooner or later no matter how bad i feel while its going on carsten said ever so gently he touched his flaming face this here sunburn never stops im gonna remember you said that vic crosetti told him and if i aint too sick myself im gonna throw it in your face and if you are that sick youll throw somethin else in his face hiram kidde said ive done my share of puking down in that part of the world ill tell you you take a beating there you and the ship both that made sam think of something else hows our steering mechanism going to do if we take a pounding like that the repairs were a pretty quick job kidde grunted thats a good question he laughed without humor and we get to find out what the good answer is hope we dont have to do it the hard way cant be any harder than the last time crosetti said no matter what argentinas got we aint sailin straight at the whole british and japanese fleetsand a damn good thing we aint too anybody wants to know amen sam said solemnly hiram kidde nodded after a moments contemplation crosetti crossed himself new york took the next biggest beating in the battle of the three navies after us now that i think about it kidde said looks like theyre sending what they can most afford to be rid of at the sandwich islands that makes sense to me carsten said it probably means they dont think the argentines are very good either listen hiram kidde said positively if we fought the goddamn royal navy to a standstill we aint gonna play against a tougher team anywhere in the whole damn worldand that includes the kaisers high seas fleet the limeys are bastards but theyre tough bastards vic crosetti started to say somethingmaybe agreement maybe argumentbut klaxons started hooting all over the ship summoning the sailors to battle stations everyone ran and ran hard sam ran as hard as he could hed never yet beaten hiram kidde to the fiveinch gun they both served since the two of them were starting from the same place and since he was younger than kidde and had longer legs he thought this was going to be the time it wasnt kidde stuck to him like a burr on the deck once they went below the gunners mates broad shoulders and bulldog instincts counted for more than sams inches and youth the capn shoved men aside and stuck an elbow in their ribs if they didnt move fast enough to suit him he got to the sponson a couple of lengths ahead of carsten the rest of the guns crew tumbled in seconds later all right were ready luke hoskins said his hand on a shell ready to heave it to sam what do we do now kidde was peering out of the sponson which gave a very limited field of view through a couple of slit windows i dont see anything he said not that that proves one hell of a lot maybe somebody here or aboard one of the destroyers heard a submersible through the hydrophones or spotted a periscope if theyd spotted a periscope sam said wed be making flank speed to get the hell away from it hoskins and the rest of the shellheavers and gunlayers nodded emphatic agreement but hiram kidde spoke in thoughtful tones maybe maybe not remember how that aeroplane decoyed us out of pearl and into that whole flock of subs they might be letting us see one so we dont think theyve got any more waiting up ahead mm maybe sam said wouldnt like to charge straight into a pack of em and thats the lords truth his wave encompassed the vast empty reaches of the pacific this isnt the best place to get torpedoed hoskins spoke with great authority sam there aint no good place to get torpedoed nobody argued with that either the klaxons stopped hooting commander grady stuck his head into the sponson a moment later good job men the commander of the starboard secondary armament said only a drill this time luke hoskins let out a sigh of relief sam was relieved too relieved and angry at the same time damnation he said its almost like the shore patrol raiding a cheap whorehouse when youre the next in line im all pumped up and ready and now i dont get to do anything dont you worry about that kidde said nothing wrong with shore leave in valparaiso no sir nothing wrong in concepcion farther south either theres some pretty friendlyand pretty friendly too he amended noting his own pause senoritas in chile and thats the truth in more than twenty years in the navy kidde had been to just about every port where us warships were welcomeand some where theyd had to make themselves welcome he had considerable experience in matters pertaining to senoritas and wasnt shy about sharing it sam hadnt been so many places his working assumption was that hed be able to find something or other in the female line almost anywhere though and he hadnt been wrong about that very often so instead of asking about women he said whats valparaiso like last time i was there waslet me think i guess it was kidde answered it was beat up then theyd had themselves a hell of an earthquake the year before and they were still putting things back together thats the same year as the san francisco quake isnt it i mean sam said now that i think about it i guess it is kidde laughed bad time to be anywhere on the pacific coast luke hoskins said what were the parts that werent wrecked like oh its a port town the gunners mate answered good harbor biggest one in chile unless im wrong but its open on the north when it blows hard the way it does in winter down therejune through september i mean not our winterthe storms can chew blazes out of ships tied up there i hear tell though theyve built or maybe theyre buildingdont know whicha breakwater thatll make that bettern it was not storm season now then hoskins said not in valparaiso no kidde answered not in concepcion either down by the straits of magellan thats a different story you know what i wish sam said i wish there was a canal through central america somewhere like there is at suez that would sure make shipping a lot easier it sure wouldfor the damn rebs hiram kidde said caribbeans already a confederate lake you want them moving battleships through so they could come up the west coast no thanks i meant in peacetime carsten said for once his flush had nothing to do with sunburn he prided himself in thinking strategically his buddies sometimes told him he sounded like an officer but hed missed the boat this time kidde drove the point home i guess you were still a shortpants kid when the confederates talked about digging a canal through nicaragua or one of those damn places president mahan said the usa would go to war the minute the first steam shovel took a bite and they backed down reckon hes the best president we had before tr commander grady peered into the sponson again one of his eyebrows rose quizzically not that much fun in here boys he remarked he might have broken a spell the gun crew filed out hot and stuffy as the sponson was sam wouldnt have minded staying there a while longer now hed have to go out in the sun again out of the entire crew of the dakota he might have been the only man looking forward to the straits of magellan arthur mcgregor hitched his horse to the rail not far from the post office his boots squelched in mud till he got up to the wooden sidewalk he scraped them as clean as he could before he went inside wilfred rokeby looked up from a dime novel good day to you arthur the postmaster said how are you he spoke cautiously everyone in rosenfeld like everyone in the surrounding countryside knew of alexander mcgregors execution arthur mcgregor had been into town once since then but he hadnt stopped at the post office how am i wilf he said and paused to think about it that was probably a mistake for it required him to come out with an honest answer in place of a polite one im right poorly is how i am how would you be in my shoes the same i expect rokeby licked his thin pale lips lamplight glistened from the metal frames of the halfglasses he was wearing and from the lenses that magnified his eyes without making them seem warm what can i do for you today eh want to buy some postage stamps mcgregor answered when i need beans ill go to henry gibbon in a different tone of voice it would have been a joke as he said it it was only a statement of fact hed seldom joked before alexander was shot he never joked now sure enough rokeby bent his head down and looked over the tops of those glasses as he opened a drawer mcgregor studied the part that ran down the middle of his crown dividing the brown hair on one side from that on the other as if moses had had a bit of a miracle left over after parting the red sea to make sure none of his hairs got egyptian tendencies rokeby slicked them all down with an oil reeking of spices the odor was part of coming to the post office for mcgregor as it was for everyone in and around rosenfeld after taking out a sheet of stamps rokeby looked up at the farmer how many you need let me have fifteen mcgregor answered thatll keep me for a while should anyway the postmaster agreed sixty centsll do it mcgregor stared at him then at the stamps they were some shade of red or other though only a stamp collector could have told at a glance exactly which every country in the world used some sort of red for its letterrate stamps and the letter rate in occupied manitoba as it had been before the war as it was in the usa and csa was two cents dont you mean half that he asked wilfred rokeby look wilf i can see for myself theyre twocent stamps they were as far as he was concerned ugly twocent stamps they showed a us aeroplane shooting down one either british or canadianthe picture was too small for him to be sure which two cents still is the letter rate sure enough rokeby said but you got to pay four cents each to get em all the same these here are what they call semipostal stamps only kind were gonna be able to sell hereabouts from now on see look he pointed to the lower lefthand corner of the stamp sure enough it didnt just say it said as if it were part of a beginning arithmetic lesson semiwhat mcgregor said what the devil is that supposed to mean and if two cents is the letter rate but ive got to pay twice that much to get one of these things where do the other two cents go into the yankees pocketswhere else the postmaster said into a fund that pays em to send actors and dancing girls and i dont know what all out toward the front to keep their soldiers happy we get to pay so they can do that mcgregor demanded wilfred rokeby nodded mcgregor took a deep breath thatsthievery is what it is he said slowly suppressing the scream you know it and i know it and i expect the yankees know it too rokeby said next question is do they care you can figure that one out for your own self if were paying for their damn vaudeville shows they can spend more of their money on guns in its way the casual exploitation of occupied canada appalled mcgregor almost as much as the casual execution of his son it showed how the invaders had the conquest planned out to the last little detail what happens if we dont pay the extra two cents he asked already sure of the answer the surcharge you mean rokebys fussiness extended to using precisely the right word whenever he could come to that mcgregor didnt remember ever hearing damn from him before if you dont pay the surcharge arthur i cant sell you the stamps and you cant mail your letters you dont happen to have any of the old ones left mcgregor asked not a one rokeby said sold out of em right quick i did when these here first came out last month id have expected you to notice the new stamps on your mail by now who pays attention to stamps mcgregor said which drew a hurt look from the postmaster the farmer took another deep breath and dug in his pocket all right sell em to me i hope the dancing girls give the yankee soldiers the clap rokeby giggled a high shrill startling sound he gave mcgregor fifteen cents change from the quarter and halfdollar the farmer laid on the counter mcgregor took the change and the stamps and left the post office shaking his head henry gibbons general store was only a few doors down the storekeeper nodded when mcgregor came inside mornin arthur he said good morning mcgregors eyes needed a little while to adjust to the lanternlit gloom inside the general store boards covered what had been the big window fronting on the street before a bomb blew it out that was a year ago now when are you going to get yourself a new pane of glass whenever the yanks say i can have one gibbon answered no us soldiers were in the store to overhear his bitterness i aint holding my breath ill tell you that hows your family arthur what i have left of it you mean mcgregor said bitternesshow could you replace a broken son but the storekeeper had meant the question kindly theyre healthy henry were all down at the mouth but theyre healthyand thank god for that well get by he stood a little straighter as if gibbon had denied it thats good gibbon said im glad to hear it like i told you last time you were in i he broke off abruptly for two men in greengray walked in off the sidewalk and bought a few cents worth of candy when they had left the storekeeper shook his head you see how it is what mcgregor saw was henry gibbon making money he didnt say anything what could he say you still have any of those beans henry i want to buy a couple of sacks if you do no postage stamps here he thought and almost smiled the kidney beans you mean sure enough do grunting gibbon put two sacks of them on the counter what else you need sewingmachine needles and a quart of vinegar for maude and some nails for me mcgregor answered tenpennies the big ones got some wood rot in the barn and im going to have to do a deal of patching before the weather gets worse dont want the stock to freeze he gave the storekeeper a quart bottle youre right about that gibbon said filling the bottle from the spigot of a twohundredpound barrel how many nails do you want twenty pounds worth should take care of things mcgregor said i should hope so the storekeeper said with a chuckle he dug into the relevant barrel with a scoop but as he dumped a scoopful of nails onto the scale a frown congealed on his plump features only thing i got to give em to you in is a us army crate hope you dont mind its all right arthur mcgregor answered wearily after a moment he added not the boxs fault who made it well thats right gibbon sounded relieved its only that what with everything i didnt think youd care to have anything to do with the yanks its just a crate henry mcgregor dug in his pocket what do i owe you for everything dollar a sack for the beans gibbon said scrawling down numbers on a scrap of butcher paper sixtyeight cents for the needles nineteen for the vinegar and ninety for the nails comes to he added up the column then checked it three dollars and seventyseven cents here you are mcgregor gave him four dollars waited for his change and then said let me bring the wagon by so i dont have to haul everything the storekeeper nodded patting the beans and the crate and the jar and the little package to show theyd stay safe till mcgregor got back as the farmer headed out of rosenfeld soldiers in greengray inspected his purchases they didnt usually do that they were more concerned about keeping dangerous things from coming into town seeing what he had they waved him on toward his farm a week later in the middle of the night he got up from his bed as if to go to the outhouse maude muttered something but didnt wake downstairs he threw a coat and a pair of boots over his union suit then went outside the night was very still clouds in the west warned of rain or snow on the way but the bad weather hadnt got there yet for the moment no traffic to speak of moved on the road near the farm he nodded to himself went into the barn saddled the horse in the darkness and rode away when he came back to bed maude was awake hed hoped she wouldnt be why were you gone so long she whispered as he slid in beside her getting rid of some things we dont need he answered which was no answer at all he waited for her to press him about it all she said was be careful arthur and rolled over soon she was asleep again soon he was too however much he wanted to stay awake if anything happened in the night he didnt know it three or four days later captain hannebrink drove out to the farm in his greengray ford out he came out came three ordinary soldiers all of them with guns half a minute after that another automobile this one all full of soldiers stopped alongside hannebrinks arthur mcgregor came out of the barn he scowled at the american what do you want here now you damned murderer he demanded through the kitchen window he saw maudes frightened face calmlyand well he might have been calm with so many armed men at his backhannebrink answered i hear tell you bought some nails from henry gibbon not long ago i am guilty of that which is more than my son was guilty of anything mcgregor said maude came outside to find out what was going on she held julias hand in one of hers marys in the other she was holding both daughters tight for they both looked ready to throw themselves at hannebrink and the soldiers regardless of rifles and bayonets mcgregor went on have you come to put the blindfold over my eyes because of it maybe hannebrink said calm still show me what youve done with them come back in here with me mcgregor told him motioning toward the barn hannebrink followed so did the american soldiers so did maude and julia and mary mcgregor pointed here and there along the wall and at the hayloft and up among the rafters youll see where ive done my repairs davismathisongoldberg hannebrink told off three men check those see if theyre fresh work look to be sir one of the men said after hed clambered up to inspect mcgregors carpentry at close range the other two soon called agreement all right mr mcgregor hannebrink said easygoing in nothing like a hurry say you used a pound or two of nails there by what i hear you bought more like twenty pounds wheres the rest of em on my workbench here mcgregor pointed again still in the box henry gibbon used for em captain hannebrink strode over he picked up a couple of the nails new all right he said still have that shine to em he let them clank back in among their fellows then picked up the box he nodded again heft is about right figuring in what you would have used good enough mr mcgregor thank you want to tell me what this is all about mcgregor asked no without another word hannebrink and the us soldiers left the barn got into their motorcars and drove back toward rosenfeld maude started to say something mcgregor set a hand on her shoulder and shook his head she took their daughters back into the house he wondered if shed ask him questions later she didnt do that either a day or two later he had to go into town again himself he stopped by the post office to see if wilfred rokeby had any stamps but those larcenous semipostals rokeby didnt but he did have news the knights are in more trouble with the yanks he said what now mcgregor asked havent been off the farm since i was here last and nobody much comes and visits people figure bad luck rubs off seems like bomb in the roadway near their land killed the man who stepped on it last week and three more besides rokeby answered good many hurt too yanks say they planted it because of their boy stupid to set a bomb by your own house mcgregor remarked but the knights have never been long on brains you ask me biddys always going around gossiping about this and that and jacks no better anybody who runs on at the mouth that way you have to figure theres no sense behind it thats so rokeby nodded vigorously but not vigorously enough to disturb the greased perfection of his hair they would even talk to the americans now and then people say in spite of what happened to their boy really mcgregor sucked on his pipe i have to tell you i hadnt heard that because he had to tell it to rokeby didnt make it true as hed calculated captain hannebrink had been so interested in those new nails that he hadnt thought buying new ones meant mcgregor could get rid of old ones and a farm was a big place you could search it from now till doomsday and never find dynamite and fuse and blasting caps even if they were therewhich some of them at any rate werent not any more some of the yankees blown to hell and gone the runnymouthed knights in hot watervery hot water he hopedwith the occupying authoritiestwo revenges at once wasnt bad no i hadnt heard that mcgregor repeated too bad nellie semphroch set fresh coffee in front of the confederate colonel i do thank you maam he said courteous as the rebs were most of the time once the words had passed his lips though he might have forgotten she existed turning back to the other officers at the table he took up where hed left off if we have to leave this town we ought to treat it the way the romans treated carthage the classical allusion meant nothing to nellie the officers to whom he was speaking understood it though leave no stone atop another a lieutenantcolonel said another colonel nodded well give the damnyankees a desert to come home to not a capital this place has been frowning down on the confederacy as long as weve been independent too right it has said the first colonel the one to whom nellie had given the new cup of coffee let them rule from philadelphia washington was a capital made before we saw how we were treated in that union tyrants they were tyrants they are tyrants they shall ever be the second colonel agreed the white house the capitol all the departmentsdynamite them all i say the yankees only maintained their presence here after the war of secession to irk us nellie glanced over toward edna hoping her daughter was listening as the rebel officers calmly discussed the destruction of the capital of the united states edna however was casting sheeps eyes at lieutenant kincaid why should she care nellie thought bitterly shes got a rebel officer for a fiance the lieutenantcolonel said too bad about the washington monument no matter what we did with the rest of the town i would have left that standing washington was a virginian after all fortunes of war the colonel said cant be helpedit was in the way of our barrage when the war started and of the damnyankees fire once we forced an entrance into the city that sort of destruction is one thing the lieutenantcolonel said but deliberately wrecking the monuments as we retire may cost us yankee retribution elsewhere for a wonder that made both colonels thoughtful before the war the arrogant rebs wouldnt have worried about how the usa might respond to anything they did nownow nellie had a hard time holding on to her polite mask now theyd learned better edna got up and filled nicholas kincaids coffee cup she didnt charge him which annoyed nellie but about which she could say nothing she didnt want edna to marry the confederate lieutenantshe didnt want edna marrying any manbut she knew she couldnt do anything to stop it she consoled herself by thinking that marrying kincaid might get edna out of washington before the united states battered their way back into the city had nellie had some way of escaping the bloodbath that likely lay ahead she would have taken it she did have a way to escape the coffeehouse if only for a little while im going across the street to see mr jacobs she said to edna take care of everybody while im gone would you dear all right ma edna said sulkily she no doubt suspected that her mother wanted to keep her from spending so much time with nicholas kincaid she was right too but she couldnt do anything about it the bell above jacobs door jangled when nellie came in the cobbler looked up from the boot he was resoling why hello nellie he said as if his fondest wish had just been realized how good to see you this morning good to see you too hal nellie said a little stiffly she was still nervous about having let him kiss her once and even more nervous about having liked it but that didnt matter or didnt matter much business was business and wouldnt keep you remember how i told you not so long ago that the rebs would do anything to try and hang onto washington on account of they reckoned it was their capital by rights and not ours yes of course i remember that jacobs said peering at her through his spectacles then he took them off blinked a couple of times as he set them on the counter and looked up at her again he smiled thats better nellie said i think theyre starting to get the idea they cant keep washington no matter what they do the usa wont get it back in one piece sounds like she told the shoemaker what the confederate officers had been discussing in the coffeehouse jacobs clucked reproachfully this is foolish wickedness he said no other word for it widow semnellie i promise you i will make certain it is known if you happen to be the first to have heard of it your country owes you a great debt if we can use this knowledge to keep the csa from carrying out such a vile scheme that would be good i guess she said if they want to show theyre grateful they can keep from shelling this part of town when their guns get into range yes i also think this would be an excellent reward jacobs said with a smile but that smile did not last long he coughed before continuing widow semphroch i am glad you came by today because there is something of importance i need to take up with you whats that she asked it was something important or he wouldnt have returned to the formality with which theyd once addressed each other he coughed again it wasnt something he wanted to bring up plainly at last he said widow semphroch what have you done to bill reach i havent done anything to him except tell him to stay away nellie answered you know i dont want anything to do with him she cocked her head to one side why even more reluctantly than before he said because he is actingstrangelythese days i believe he is drinking far too much for a man in his position he often speaks of you but gives no details thank god for that nellie thought aloud she said the last time i saw him i thought hed been drinking which was politer than he stank of rotgut if there is anything you can do for him jacobs began no mr jacobs i am sorry but there is nothing now nellie threw up the chilling wall of formality good day i will call again another time she left the cobblers shop without a backwards glance and without giving jacobs the chance to say a word she supposed she should have been warned but all she wanted to do with bill reach was put him out of her mind and so she did not pay as much heed to jacobs as she might have done two evenings later reach threw open the door to the coffeehouse and lurched inside nellie was in back of the counter pouring coffee making sandwiches and frying ham steaks and potatoes edna was out among the customers the usual crowd of confederate officers the sleek washingtonians who collaborated with them and a sprinkling of fancy women who collaborated more intimately with both rebels and local catspaws all of them stared at bill reach who looked even more disreputable than usual by the boneless way he stood nellie knew hed had his head in a bottle all day or maybe all week his eyes held a wild gleam she didnt like she started out toward the front of the coffeehouse certain he was going to do something dreadful she hadnt taken more than a step and a half before he did it little nell he said loudlybut he wasnt looking at nellie at all he was looking at edna so drunk he couldnt tell daughter from mother makes me feel young just to see you little nell same as it always did edna was less than half his ageno wonder seeing her made him feel young a leer spread over his face get out of here nellie shouted but he was too drunk too intent on what was going on inside his own mind to hear her and edna after a glance back at her mother a glance filled with both curiosity and malice smiled at him and said what do you want tonight bill it wasnt quite the right question but it was close enough over nellies cry of horror reach pulled a quartereagle out of his pocket slapped the gold coin down on a tabletop as if it were a nightstand and said tonight well well go upstairs like alwayshe pointed to the stairway leading up to nellie and ednas rooms which was just visible from where he stood swayingand then you can suck on me for a while before you get on top im feelinhiclazy if you know what i mean ill give you an extra half a buck all your own if youre good get him out of here nellie screamed a couple of confederate officers were already rushing toward bill reach they landed on him like a falling building pummeling him and flinging him out into the street with shouts of get your foul mouth out of here never show your face here again or youre a dead man one of them noticed the quartereagle he threw it out after reach then wiped his hand on a trouser leg as if to clean it of contamination that done he bowed first to edna and then to nellie you tell us if that cur comes back ladies well fix him for good if he dares show his ugly face in here again nellie nodded her customers worked hard to show good breeding by pretending nothing out of the ordinary had happened edna didnt say a thing edna didnt need to say a thing whatever else she was edna was no fool she could figure out why bill reach thought he had any business saying those filthy things to nellieor to someone he thought was nellie the only possible answer was the right one edna glanced back at nellie again her mother could not meet her eye that told her everything that still needed telling nellie hung her head shed tried to stay respectable for her daughters sake that was over everything was over now over the past couple of winters lucien galtier had discovered somewhat to his surprise that he liked chopping wood the work took him back to his youth to the days before he was conscripted hed swung an axe then swung it and swung it and swung it after he came back from the army the farm had burned far more coal than wood the americans though were niggardly with their coal rations as they were niggardly with everything else he was glad old blaise chretien only a couple of miles away had a woodlot it made the difference between shivering through the winter and getting by comfortably enough chopping wood also kept him warm while he was doing it down came the axewhump two chunks of wood leaped apart ah if only those were father pascals head and his fat neck lucien said wistfully his son georges was walking by then georges had a way of walking by whenever he had the chance to create mischief you want to be careful papa he called otherwise youll end up like greatuncle leon after grandfather took off his little finger with the axe when they were boys you scamp taistoi lucien retorted otherwise your backside will end up like your grandfathers after he took off leons finger with the axe georges laughed at him georges had a right to laugh too he was sixteen now and almost half a head taller than his father if lucien tried to give him a licking who would end up drubbing whom was very much in doubt lucien thought he would win even yetyou learned tricks in the army that simple roughhousing never taught you but he didnt want to have to find out up went the axe down it came more wood split marie would be happy with him no she cannot call me lazy today he said some people he had seen worked simply for the sake of working a lot of englishspeaking canadians were like that and americans too fewer quebecois had the disease lucien worked when something needed doing when it didnt which on a farm was all too seldom he was content to leave it alone he wiped his forehead with the back of his sleeve hed worked up a good sweat though it was chilly out here the day was clear though the sunshine streaming down as if it were spring only the slightly deeper blue of the sky argued otherwise up in the sky something buzzed like a mosquito out of season he stopped chopping for a little while and peered upward trying to spot the aeroplaneno aeroplanes a flight of them droning north his mouth twisted i hope all of you are shot down he said shaking his fist at the heavens this is our patrimony not yours you have no business taking it from us afterwards he blamed the american aeroplanes for what happened when he went back to chopping they had after all broken the smooth rhythm hed established before they disturbed him and if he hadnt blamed them he would have blamed georges instead better to put it on his enemys head than on his own flesh and blood he knew the stroke was wrong the second the axehead started on its downward arc he tried to twist it aside in the end he didnt know whether that made things better or worse the axe hit the piece of wood on the chopping block a glancing blow and then bit into his left leg tabernac he hissed the blade had a red edge when he pulled it free blood started running down his calf into his shoe it was warm on what had been cold skin ah mauvais tabernac the axe had sliced into meat not bone that was the only good thing he could say about the wound he started to throw the axe aside so he could hobble to the farmhouse but held onto the tool instead that leg didnt want to bear much weight and the axe handle made a stick to take it instead marie let out a small shriek when he made it inside it is not so bad he said hoping it was not so bad put a bandage on it and then i will go out and finish what i have to do you will go nowhere today she said grabbing for a rag you should be ashamed bleeding on my clean floor believe me i regret the necessity more than you do he said she got off his shoe and sock and pulled up his trouser leg this is not good she said examining the wound he did not want to look at it himself while she worked he had not a qualm about slaughtering livestock but his own blood made him queasy it is bleeding right through the bandage she told him a cloth will not be enough for this lucien it wants stitching or heaven knows when it will close that is nonsense he said even as he spoke though the two raw edges of the wound slipped against each other his stomach lurched he felt dizzy a little lightheaded firmly marie said jai raison lucien i have sewn up a cut hand once or twice but i do not think i should sew this it is too long and too deep i think you should go to the american hospital and let them do a proper job of putting you back together the mere idea of going to the hospital was enough to restore her husband to himself no he said no and no and no it was bad enough that the americans took my land took land in this family since before the battle on the plains of abraham took my patrimony for their own purposes to use this hospital to acknowledge it is there this is a humiliation that cannot be borne sew it yourself if you do not acknowledge the hospital why does nicole work there marie asked if you do not acknowledge the hospital why have you drunk applejack with dr odoull three times in the past month why have you probably got one of his cigars in your pocket even now galtier opened his mouth to give her the simple logical explanation to the paradoxes she propounded nothing came out his wits he thought were discommoded because of the wound he told her that instead she set her hands on her hips then foolish man it is time to get the wound seen to nestce pas you will come with me go with her he did still using the axe as a stick and with his other arm around her shoulder even with such help he had to stop and rest three or four times before they got to the hospital when they did one of the workmen there tried to turn them away this place is for americans not you damn canucks hold on bill a nurse said thats nicoles father well take care of him what happened to you the last was to galtier axecutting wood remembering english was hard come on in the nurse said ill get dr odoull hell do a proper job of patching you up she pointed to the door maybe seeing that marie had no english at the door lucien ordered his wife home they will help me the rest of the way he told her pointing to the nurse and the workman when she protested he said some of what is here you should not see he knew what war looked like she didnt not really he wanted to keep it that way in english and in horrible french the people from the hospital told her the same thing she was still protesting when an ambulance skidded to a stop in front of the hospital the driver and an attendant carried in a man on a stretcher a bloody blanket lay over the lower part of his body it was obvious hed lost a leg marie abruptly turned and walked back toward the farmhouse the first thing lucien noticed inside the hospital was how warm it was the americans did not have to stint on coal the second thing he noticed was the smell part of it was sharp and medicinal the top layer so to speak under it lay faint odors he knew from the barnyardblood and dung and almost but not quite undetectable a miasma of bad meat you wait here the nurse told him pointing to a bench ill get the doctor to see you merci he said his injured leg stretched out straight in front of him a couple of soldiers young men hardly older than charles his older son sat there too the wounded man whod been brought in on the stretcher wasnt in sight they were probably working on him already one of the soldiers asked you speak english pal at luciens nod the youngster asked you get that from a shell he pointed to the wound no from to chop the wood lucien gestured to eke out his words the american nodded in turn seeing him polite lucien asked and youwhat have you flunked my shortarm inspection the young soldier answered flushing that didnt mean anything to lucien the yank noticed this hoor up in riviereduloup she gave me the clap he explained lucien had heard that phrase in his own army days inside he laughed he had a more honorable wound than the american well well what have we here that was good french from the mouth of dr leonard odoull he wore a white coat with a few reddish stains on it looking severely at lucien he said monsieur galtier if you want to visit me here it is not necessary to do yourself an injury first i shall bear that in mind thank you lucien said dryly it was you must believe me not the reason for which i hurt myself of that i have no doubt odoull replied he undid just enough of the bandage to see how big the wound was and whistled softly when he did yes you were wise to come it was my wifes idea galtier said then you were wise to listen to her as long as one in the family is wise things go well i shall have to show you how neatly i can sew he turned and spoke to a nurse in english too rapid for lucien to follow she nodded and hurried off i am glad you are the one to help me the farmer said i speak french odoull answered and you are the father of my friend did he hesitate a little before that last word lucien couldnt tell odoull went on this is a duty and an honor both then the nurse came back with a tray full of medical paraphernalia the doctor went on it is an honor that will be painful for you though monsieur i am going to give you an injection to keep you from getting lockjaw this will not hurt much now but may make you sore and sick later we must roll up your sleeve next to the fire in galtiers leg the injection was a fleabite then odoull said and now we must disinfect the wound you understand we must keep it from rotting if we can lucien nodded hed seen hurts go bad odoull poured something that smelled almost like applejack into the wound galtier gasped and bit his lip and crossed himself if the wound was a fire odoull had just poured gasoline on it osti the farmer said weakly tears blurred his vision i do regret it very much but it is a necessity odoull said lucien managed to nod now to sew it up the doctor told him before odoull could get to work with needle and thread another nurse came in that was how galtier thought of her till she exclaimed papa oh bonjour nicole he said hed seen her in the whiteandgray nurses uniform with the red cross on the right breast before of course but here hed looked at the uniform instead of the person inside it embarrassed he muttered the foolish axe slipped nothing that cant be fixed odoull said fitting fat thread to a large needle do hold still if youd be so kind oh very good i have seen soldiers m galtier who gave far more trouble with smaller wounds i have been a soldier lucien said quietly he counted the sutures twentyone odoull bandaged the wound thicker and more tightly than marie had done lucien dipped his head merci beaucoup pas de quoi odoull answered i will give you a weeks supply of sterile wound dressings if its still oozing after that much time come in and see me and we will disinfect it again let your sons do the work for a while they think theyre men now work will show whether or not they are right well take you home in an ambulance if you like no lucien said marie will think i have died ah well let me get you a proper walking stick then odoull did that himself the stick with which he returned was so severely plain it was obviously government issue that the us government manufactured large numbers of walking sticks for the anticipated use of wounded men said more plainly than words what sort of war this was but as lucien made his slow hobbling way home he despised the americans less than he had before almost everyone at the hospital had been good to him even though he was a civilian and an enemy civilian at that no one had asked him for a penny he was not used to feeling anything but scorn for the occupiers but he prided himself on being a just man it could be he said slowly wonderingly that they arethat some of them arehuman beings after all i wish pa would come home again george enos jr said me too mary jane said loudly she didnt say no as much as she had when shed first turned two for which sylvia enos heartily thanked god now her daughter tried to imitate george jr in everything she did most of the time that wasnt bad at all every so oftenas when she piddled standing upit proved unfortunate i wish he would too dears sylvia said and wondered just how much she meant that no time to worry about it now come on both of you we have to get you to mrs coneval or ill be late for work they followed her down the hall to brigid conevals apartment several other children were in there already and making a racket like a bombardment on the maryland front a fine mornin to you mrs enos mrs coneval said after shed opened the door ill see you tonight come in lambs sylvia went downstairs and headed for the trolley stop newsboys hopped up and down on their corners trying to stay warm the sun wouldnt be up for a little while yet and the air had a wintry snap in it though indian summer had lingered till only a few days before nobody was shouting about great naval battles in the atlantic nor about a destroyer lost at sea with the war now in its third year sylvia knew how little that meant a sunken destroyer was the small change of war hardly worth a headline anything might have happened to the ericsson and she wouldnt know about it till she found the paragraph on page five if she bought a paper at all that is these days she didnt do that every day as she had when george was serving on the river monitor she walked past the newsboys today too and stood waiting for the trolley without a globe men she muttered as the streetcar clanged up to the stop she threw a nickel in the farebox an old man stood up to give her his seat she thanked him hardly noticing he was of the sex shed just condemned for existing she wished george had been either a better person or a better liar she would have preferred the first but the other might have done in a pinch for him not to have the need to visit a whore and a nigger whore at that she thought appalled by his lack of taste as well as his lack of judgment would have been best if he had gone and done it she wished shed never found out actually he had gone but he hadnt quite done it that didnt make things any better how was she supposed to trust him now that he wouldnt have been worth trusting if he hadnt told her about going to the whore never occurred to her when he wasnt in her sight but was ashore what would he be doing men she said again she was so lost in her angry reverie she almost missed the stop in front of the canning plant the trolley was about to start up again before she leapt from her seat and hurried out the door the driver gave her a reproachful look she glared at him he was a man too even if he had a white mustache she punched in and hurried toward her machine isabella antonelli was already at hers good morning sylvia she said with a smile that did not match the mourning she still wore hello isabella sylvia answered as she made sure the machine had plenty of labels in the feeder and the paste reservoir was full that done she really noticed the smile she had seen and smiled back at her friend youre looking cheerful this morning her own smile was mischievous did you put a little brandy in your coffee before you came to work the capitalists who ran the canning plant hadnt spent any more than the bare minimum on lamps the ceiling was high the bulbs dim and isabella antonelli was as swarthy as any other italian which made her seem very dark indeed to fairskinned sylvia nevertheless she blushed it was unmistakable sylvia waggled a finger at her you did put some brandy in your coffee no such thing isabella said maybe she hadnt sniffing sylvia couldnt smell any brandy but they werent standing face to face with each other either and the whole plant reeked of fish anyhow but isabella antonelli had done something or other what how to find out without embarrassing her further before sylvia could come up with answers to either of those questions the production line which had shut down for shift changeover started up again here came the cans they came fast enough nothing else mattered sylvia began pulling the three levers that carried them through her machine gave each one a couple of girdling squirts of paste and put on the label bearing a fish that looked much more like a fancy tuna than the mackerel the cans contained pull step pull step pull back to the beginning pull stepit was going to be a good day sylvia could feel that already a good day was a day she got through barely noticing shed been at the plant at all on bad days her shift seemed to last for years here came mr winter limping up the line a cigar clamped between upper and lower teeth good morning mrs enos the foreman said almost without opening his mouth how are you today fine thank you she answered politely adding and you couldnt be better mr winter said his mouth still didnt open wide but its corners moved upwards he was happier than shed seen him in a good long while after a moment he returned to business machine behaving yessee for yourself sylvia hadnt missed a lever while talking with the foreman the action feels smoother than it has they oiled it last night about time he said after a brief pause he went on hope your husbands all right so do i sylvia answered despite everything more truthfully than not gods own miracle he was saved off the punishment mr winter said i suppose thats true sylvia had all she could do not to laugh in the aging veterans face george had gone up on the riverbank to get drunk and commit adultery the god she worshiped wasnt in the habit of manufacturing miracles of that shape gods own miracle the foreman repeated he of course didnt know all the details sylvia wished she didnt know all the details either nodding to her once more mr winter went on up the line to see how isabella antonelli and her machine were over the noise of the line and of her own machine sylvia couldnt hear much of what the two of them said to each other she could see though could see the foremans hand rest lightly upon isabellas for a moment could see the way the widows body bent toward his as a flower bends toward the sun sylvia automatically worked her machine she stared at her friend stared and stared she was not a blind woman when things went on around her she noticed them if mr winter and isabella antonelli werent lovers she would have forfeited a weeks pay i should have known what kind of smile that was she thought annoyed at herself for not recognizing it on isabellas face shed worn it often enough herself when things with george had been good mr winters smile wasnt quite the usual large male leer but the cigar would have fallen out of his mouth if it had been pull step pull stepshe wanted to see if isabella would say anything at lunch all of a sudden the day that had been moving swiftly ceased to move at all at half past twelve the line finally stopped the weather was too raw for sylvia and isabella to eat outside as they had earlier in the year they sat down together on a bench not too far from one of the handful of steam radiators the factory boasted isabella solved sylvias problem for her by speaking first she blushed again as she said i saw you watching me sylvias face heated but she nodded erwell yes he is not a bad man i have said this since he and i were only friends isabella antonelli tossed her head as if defying sylvia to make something of that sylvia only nodded again that seemed to mollify her friend who went on he has been lonely for years now since his wife died i know what being lonely meansdio mio how i know believe me when i tell you not being lonely is better sylvia imagined lame old mr winter touching her caressing her she didnt know whether to be revolted or burst out laughing but she was lonely herself a good deal of the time these days with george aboard the ericssonand when he had been home had she been anything more than a piece of meat for him a more convenient piece of meat at the moment than a negro harlot did she want him to love her or to leave her alone for the life of her she didnt know and so very slowly she nodded you may be right after all isabella she said you may be right jonathan moss had reached that pleasant stage of intoxication where his nose and the top part of his cheeks were going numb but he was still thinking clearlyor pretty clearly anyhow as he generally did at such times he stared into his whiskey glass with bemused respect astonished the amber fluid could work such magic on the way he felt dud dudley stared around the officers lounge what we need here he declared are some women ill drink to that moss said and did they ought to bring some up from the states as a matter of fact all the canuck gals treat us like were poisonous that wasnt strictly true every now and then a pilot would find a complaisant young woman in ontario moss never had though his flight leader nodded vigorously theres an idea dudley said they can call them something that sounds as if its military supplies so the bluenoses wont have conniptions tool mufflers maybe yeah tool mufflers how do you like them apples it seemed funny and then some to moss we ought to give hardshell a requisition for em start it going through the quartermaster corps yeah fred we need another couple dozen tool mufflers on the toronto front he spoke into an imaginary telephone split em even between blondes brunettes and redheads he would have gone on embroidering that theme for quite a while but an orderly poked his head into the officers lounge spotted him and brightened lieutenant moss sir he said major pruitt needs to see you right away sir im coming moss got to his feet a process that proved more complicated than hed expected im coming lead on henry henry led on as moss left dudley called after him requisition a couple extra redheaded tool mufflers for me pal they both laughed henry the orderly grinned in a nervous sort of way not getting the joke major shelby pruitt raised an eyebrow when he saw the state moss was in that was all he did the weather was too lousy to let aeroplanes get off the ground so the pilots had little to do but sit around and drink the salute moss gave him was crisp enough at any rate reporting as ordered sir at ease pruitt said he passed moss a little velvet box with a snap lid here as long as youre celebrating you can have something to celebrate moss opened the box two sets of a captains twin silver bars sparkled in the lamplight he stared at them then at pruitt the squadron commander grinned at him congratulations captain moss moss said the first thing that popped into his head what about dud sir he made hardshell pruitt smile that does you credit his are in the works they should have come in with yours but theres some sort of paperwork foulup id have saved yours to give them to the both of you at the same time but i cant youre both getting shipped out and to different places and theyve laid on a motorcar for you in an hour as soon as you leave here go pack up what you have to take with you the rest of your junk will follow you sooner or later maybe even by the end of the war things were moving too fast for moss to follow he thoughthe hopedthey would have been moving too fast for him to follow had he been sober sir could you explain he said plaintively youre a captain now pruitts voice was crisp incisive he used it as a surgeon uses a scalpel to slice through the fat to the meat youll be a flight leader for certain maybe even a squadron leader if casualties keep on the way theyve been going we keep flying martins against these pups sir well have a lot of casualties moss said with conviction i understand that major pruitt answered well it just so happens the kaisers come through for us wright is building a copy of the albatros twodecker a german cargo submarine finally made it across the atlantic with plans and with a complete disassembled aeroplane the orders detach you to train on the new machine thatsbully sir jonathan moss breathed can we really fight the limeys in this new bus everybody seems to think so the squadron leader answered the copied albatros isnt quite as fast as the pup but itll climb quicker and its just about as maneuverable and well have a hell of a lot more of them than the limeys and canucks will have pups goodwell make em have kittens then moss said when sober he was sobersided he wasnt sobersided now hardshell pruitt also grinned go pack your bags captain pack the undowithoutables and dont worry about anything else i want you back here at ready to move out for london here are your written orders yes sir thank you sir moss looked at the pocket watch he wore strapped to his wrist like a lot of fliers hed started doing that because of the difficulty of groping for a watch while wearing a bulky flight suit learning at a glance what time it was had proved so convenient he wore the watch on a strap all the time now see you in fortyfive minutes sir he seemed to float several feet above the muddy ground as he made his way back to the tent he shared with dudley and with phil eaker and thad krazewski whod taken the place of orville thornley whod taken the place of tom innis a match got a kerosene lantern going the space around his cot was as full of junk as more than a years settling in and an easygoing view of military regulations would allow one greengray canvas duffel bag didnt seem enough he wondered if he could lay hands on a white truck or maybe two he shrugged hed manage one way or another and whatever he left behind wouldnt go to waste some would as major pruitt had said follow him wherever he went the other fellows in the flight were welcome to the rest he heard eaker and krazewski coming eaker said jonathanll be glad we sweettalked the cook out of a cornedbeef sandwich for him ive never seen anybody as keen for the stuff as he is the two young fliers came into the tent and stared grinning moss said i will be glad for the sandwich boys itll give me something to eat while they take me wherever im supposed to go sir they said together twin expressions of blank surprise on their faces moss wanted to tell them everything the whiskey in him almost set his mouth working ahead of his brain he checked himself though saying too muchsaying anything reallywouldnt be fair to dud dudley who had to stay a while longer because of his botched paperwork what moss did end up saying was theyre shipping me out im going into training on a new aeroplane thats wonderful sir they exclaimed again in unison krazewski clapped his hands together with his wide cheekbones blue blue eyes and shock of wheatblond hair he would have made a gorgeous woman he made a hell of a handsome man and the canucks and limeys hadnt managed to kill him yet he asked does lieutenant dudley know sir thats captain dudley moss thought but dud doesnt know it yet ill tell him as soon as i finish packing moss said he didnt say anything about all the stuff he wouldnt be able to pack his tentmates would go through it soon enough almost as if hed died he had intended to head for the officers lounge as soon as the duffel bag was full that didnt happen because dud dudley came in when he was trying to stuff a tin of shaving soap into a bag already full to the point of seamsplitting a fine day to you captain moss he exclaimed in a voice to which whiskey gave only part of the glee hes heard jonathan realized hardshell must have decided he couldnt keep it a secret a fine day to you captain dudley he returned the two men solemnlywell not so solemnlyshook hands while eaker and krazewski gaped all over again too damn bad were going to different aerodromes to train dudley said which reconfirmed moss guess the flight leader slapped him on the back ill miss you you son of a bitch weve got to look each other up if we both come through this stinking war in one piece he scrawled his name and address on a scrap of paper here this is me moss found his own scrap and borrowed dudleys pen and this is me ill miss you too dud and ill miss these two sorry ragamuffins at that the pilots who would stay behind gave him a pair of raspberries he shook hands with both of them too then slung his duffel bag over his shoulder he mimed collapsing under the weight which wasnt far from being true and tramped back toward major pruitts tent a ford was waiting there for him the motor running the driver took the duffel gave him a reproachful stare at its weight and tossed it into the automobile hop in sir he said off to london the drive was less than a delight the fords headlamps were taped so they gave out only a little light the enemys aeroplanes would shoot up anything that moved at night the road would have been bad even had the driver been able to spot all the potholes not spotting them meant he and moss got to fix several punctures along the way they didnt do better than ten miles an hour which made a hundredmile journey seem to take forever dawn was breaking when they finally reached the aerodrome no one seemed to be expecting moss which after the time hed had getting there didnt surprise him at all well a sergeant said doubtfully i guess well put you up in tent basler a private appeared as if by magic take captain moss to tent hell fit in there one way or another the noncoms face bore a strange sort of smile moss who hadnt managed to doze in the automobile was too worn to care what a sergeant thought the private led him to a greengray tent distinguishable only by the number stenciled on its side here you are sir thanks moss went inside sure enough there was a cot with no belongings nearby the three officers in the tent who were readying themselves for the day looked him over one of them a tall thin goodlooking fellow exclaimed jonathan percy moss said percy stone then he burst out laughing now i know why that billeting sergeant said i belonged here moss and stone like the old days he pumped stones hand jesus its good to see you in one piece chum its good to be in one piece again stone said hed been moss photographic observer when moss was still flying twoseaters instead of fighting scouts and a canuck had badly wounded him he pointed to the pilots insigne on his chest you see ive got both wings now yeah moss said enthusiastically between us were going to show the canucks a thing or two percy stone nodded they shook hands again every time abner dowling walked into the tennessee farmhouse where general custer was staying these days he braced for trouble since the first army had basically stopped moving forward these days custers accommodations hadnt shifted lately either that meant libbie custer had come down from kentucky to stay with her husband it also meant custer had to stop paying such avid attention to the pretty young mulatto housekeeper hed hired before libbie came down the wench whose name was cornelia kept right on cooking and cleaning dowling didnt know whether shed done anything more than that before he was sure custer had wanted her to do more though and had hoped to convince her to do more libbie was sure of that too which made the farmhouse into a sort of front of its own the illustrious general commanding first army was in the kitchen eating lunch when dowling arrived the tubby majors nostrils twitched appreciatively regardless of whether cornelia was helping custer forget his years the wench could cook why that damned lying little slut custer shouted waiting out in the parlor dowling jumped in alarm the worst thing he could think of would have been for cornelia to go telling libbie tales whether the tales were true or not didnt matter libbie would believe them custer would deny everything libbie wouldnt believe that by the sound of things the worst had just happened but then to the adjutants astonishment libbie spoke in soothing tones dowling couldnt make out what she said but she wasnt screaming dowling wondered why she wasnt screaming how many damned lying little sluts besides cornelia did custer know dowling was sure custer would have liked to know a regiments worth but what he would have liked wasnt the same as what was so a few minutes later custer came out of the kitchen a scowl on his face and a newspaper in his hand when dowling saw that he relaxed so someone had savaged custer in the press the general commanding first army would rage like a hurricane when a story threatened to tarnish his refulgent image of himself but that kind of bluster didnt amount to a hill of beans in the long run in the short run putting up with custers bad temper was what the war department paid dowling to do as far as he was concerned philadelphia didnt pay him enough but he would have said the same thing had he raked in a million in gold on the first of every month is something wrong sir he asked now as if hed heard nothing from the kitchen and had just chanced to notice the generals frown wrong custer thundered you might possibly say so major yes you just might he flung the paper into dowlings lap predictably hed folded it so the story that had offended him was on top that way he could reannoy himself whenever he glanced at it and stay in a fine hot temper the whole day through he would have pointed it out to dowling had his adjutant not spotted it at once oh the socialist candidate in one of those new york city districts giving you a hard time about the cottontown attack he said dont take it to heart sir its only politics goes to show women can play the game as dirty as men i suppose whats her name custer demanded hamburger was that it id like to make hamburger out of her by godfrey didnt i tell you we needed a victory here to put a muzzle on those miserable bombthrowing anarchists yes sir you did dowling spoke with some genuine sympathy being a democrat himself and i see that senator debs but custer once he got rolling would not let even agreement slow him down and you were there werent you major when general macarthur came to me with that halfbaked plan for attacking southeast before shifting the direction of his advance i warned him he needed to have more resources than i could afford to commit if that attack had even a prayer for success but he wheedled and pleaded till i didnt see what i could do but give in and this is the thanks we get for it he reached out and slapped the newspaper onto the floor bending over to pick it up gave dowling the chance to pull his face straight by the time custer saw him again the general commanding first army often rewrote history so it turned out as he wished it would have but this was a particularly egregious example general macarthur did request more resources than you were prepared to provide yes sir dowling said cautiously thats what i told you custer said it didnt sound that way to dowling but arguing about what had happened was a pointless exercise trying to keep similar disaster from happening later occasionally even succeeded libbie custer came out and nodded to major dowling did you see the lies they were telling about autie major she said setting a hand on custers shoulder theyre all a pack of shameless jackals jealous of his fame and jealous of the victories hes won for his country george armstrong custer was a blowhard hed blow hot and then five minutes later hed blow cold elizabeth bacon custer as far as dowling had been able to tell wavered not at all when she got angry at someone she stayed angry forever some of that anger she aimed at anyone presumptuous enough to criticize her husband in any way and some of it she aimed at custer himself from some of the things shed said to dowling shed been furious at the famous general for better than forty years longhandled feather duster in hand cornelia came out and started cleaning excuse me major dowling suh she said when she dusted near him he nodded and smiled at her every time he looked at herand she was worth looking athe wondered how the men of the confederacy reconciled their claims of negro inferiority and their own mingling of blood with the negroes in the confederate states he shrugged a tiny shrug his uniform hid the rebs didnt need to reconcile anything they were the masters down here they could do what they wanted no they had been the masters despite hard times on the battlefield the united states were changing things custer now custer looked at cornelia in exactly the way one of those rebels might have done this is mine his eyes seemed to say if i want it all i have to do is reach out and take it libbie custers eyes said something too if you do reach out george they warned ill whack you on the wrist so hard youll think youre back in primary school again dowling didnt think the general commanding first army was going to get away with much not here not now having cornelia go elsewhere was a relief tension in the front room went with her as it did in a frontline bombproof when the barrage shifted to supply dumps farther back dowling found himself able to think about the war again do you think well be able to accomplish anything worthwhile this winter sir he asked or will we keep on wasting men the way we have been doing we may have to make the effort major custer replied for the moment though however reluctantly i am accumulating men and materiel to make sure we have reserves and adequate stocks on hand in case we do have to make any mass assaults in the next few months digging a finger in his ear to make sure hed heard correctly would have been rude dowling was tempted even so one thing hed seen over and over again was custer ignoring reserves and logistics his gaze slid to libbie brief acquaintance had convinced him she was a hell of a lot smarter than her heroic husband if she was smart enough to have convinced him of the need to prepare dowling was ready to call her a genius custer said its the election of course if that snake debs slithers into the white house we shall have to go all out to force the csa to make peace before tr leaves office in march i want to be ready isee dowling said slowly maybe libbie had put that bug in custers ear but maybe hed thought of it all by himself he did pay attention to politics and maybe word had come down from philadelphia quietly recommending buildups all along the line in case the us army had to try to force the rebs to yield in the four months between debs election and his inauguration do you know major custer said that back in there was some talk of procuring the presidential nomination for me i was quite the man of the hour after all but i had chosen to make the united states army my lifes labor and i would not resign my commission under any circumstances i sometimes wonder how things might have turned out had i decided otherwise dowling valiantly didnt say anything he was convinced commanding first army was beyond custers capacity for the life of him he didnt see why the war department kept the old warhorse in the saddle instead of putting him out to pasture things were going well enough on most fronts that the retirement of an aging lion shouldnt produce any great outcry no matter how much the public revered custers name president custer there was an idea to make any man who didnt believe things could have been worse for the united states think twice even though it hadnt happenedand probably hadnt been so close to happening as custer asserted now thirtytwo years after the factcontemplating it was enough to make dowling are you well major libbie custer asked sharply you look dyspeptic maybe the general should send this wench cornelia over to your quarters to cook for you and bring you back up to snuff im sure that wont be necessary dear custer said anyone can see that the good major dowling is not off his feed he chuckled libbie custer glared at him because he refused to remove the attractive housekeeper from his not very attractive house dowling glared at him because hed called him fat dowling knew he was fat he didnt appreciate being reminded of it oblivious to having angered both people with whom he was conversing custer went on now we shall just have to wait until after the seventh if god be kind both senator debs and this ignorant vicious hamburger woman will get the drubbing they so richly deserve and if the lord should choose to inflict debs on us because of our many sins we shall still have four months in which to redeem ourselves dowling sighed agreeing with custer on anything even a matter of politics tempted him to take another look to make sure he wasnt wrong he hadnt dreamt anything might incline him toward socialism but if custer loathed it it had to have its good points somebody knocked on the door of socialist party headquarters another western union boy herman bruck shouted over the electionnight din that filled the place flora hamburger happened to be standing close to the door ill get it she said opening the door for a moment would let a little of the tobacco smoke hazing the atmosphere escape her own fathers pipe was but one among a great many sources of that smoke as he and the rest of the family had come down with her to learn whether she would be going to philadelphia when the new congress convened in january but it wasnt another messenger with a fistful of telegrams standing out there in the hall it was max fleischmann the butcher from downstairs he carried a tray covered with brown paper you people will be hungry he said ive brought up some salami some bologna some sausages you didnt have to do that mr fleischmann you didnt have to do that at all youre a democrat for heavens sake you peopleand especially you miss hamburgeryou dont let politics get in the way of beings friends the butcher said this is the least i can do to show you i feel the same way after that flora didnt see what she could do but take the tray this is very kind of you she told the old man and if more people felt the way you do the united states would be a better place to live getting rid of those soldiers circle goons would be a good start fleischmann said well i hope you win even if youre not from my party what do you think of that i hope i win too flora blurted which made the butcher smile he bobbed his head to her and went back downstairs she put the tray on a desk near the door people descended on it as if they hadnt already demolished a spread of cold cuts and pickles and eggs and bread that would have done justice to the freelunch counter at a fancy saloon everyone was eating as if there would be no tomorrow someone else knocked on the door this time maria tresca got it this time it was a western union messenger she took the sheaf of flimsy envelopes from him new returns she shouted i have new returns something approaching silence fell she started opening envelopes debs leading by seven thousand in wyoming she said and a cheer went up the socialist there is going back to congress too it looks like another cheer she opened a new telegram and her face fell roosevelt ahead by ten thousand in dakota groans replaced the applause dakota had voted socialist most of the time since being admitted to the united states herman bruck let out a long sigh and said the thing most of the people in the room had been thinking for some time we arent going to elect a president this year the people are too mystified to put aside the war a few party workers called out protests but most only nodded as when a doctor delivers a diagnosis grim but expected we carried new york three people said at the same time as if that were a consolation prize we arent carrying any of the other big states though bruck said looking at a map of the usa and now that the returns from west of the mississippi are coming in it doesnt look like were going to carry enough of the midwest and the west to make up for that foolishness flora said shed been saying the same thing since the beginning of the war for the life of her she didnt understand why more people didnt feel the same way if you have a mine that doesnt give you any gold why spend more money on it along with everyone else in the room her mother and father both sisters and the younger of her two brothers nodded at that she wished david hamburger had been there to nod too but he was down in virginia now that filled flora with dread yossel reisen had gone down to fight in virginia too and never came back his little son slept in sophies arms a telephone rang herman bruck picked it up he scribbled numbers on a piece of foolscap then hung up new returns from city hall he announced in a loud important voice cutting off marias reading of results from farther away latest returns for our districtmiller hamburger thats the biggest lead weve had tonight howls of glee filled the air benjamin hamburgers pipe sent up smoke signals he looked over at flora smiling broadly around the pipe this is a fine country never doubt it for a minute this is a fine country he said i came here with the clothes on my back and not a thing more and now i have not a son but a daughtera daughter mind youin the congress of the united states more cheers rose angelina would be proud of you maria tresca said quietly she added and if the results hold you can keep your brother out of any danger i can cant i flora said in some surprise the war department would likely pay attention to the wishes of any member of congress even a young woman from the opposition the war department might even pay special attention to her wishes in the hope that by doing as she wanted it could influence her vote on matters pertaining to the war and in making that calculation the war department might prove right all at once leading by fifteen hundred votes flora contemplated the differences between running for office and being in office the socialists down in philadelphia often compromised on issues party regulars back home would sooner have seen fought to a finish theyd compromised on war credits back in the summer of and flora was far from the only one who wished they hadnt now came her turn in the barrel would she have to make deals with the democratic majority could the socialists and the few surviving republicans do anything to slow down teddy roosevelts juggernaut then she asked herself another question if she used her congressional office to protect david wasnt she taking for herself one of the privileges of the elite that socialists from maine to california decried but if she didnt do what she could to keep her brother out of harms way and something god forbid happened to him how could she ever look at herself again was her ideology more important or her family asking the question gave her the answer in a sudden burst of insight it also gave her a clue to something that had puzzled her since the war began why socialists the world over in germany and austriahungary and england and canada and france and the usa and even in unprogressive countries like russia and the confederate states rushed to their nations colors when ideology should have made them stand together against the madness blood is thicker than water was the cause of the nation of kith and kin more urgent than the rarefied summons of socialist egalitarianism it was a dismal notion but made an alarming amount of sense a western union messenger brought her out of her reverie with a new batch of telegrams when he saw who was taking them from him he smiled and said i hope you get elected thank you she said startled he was developing his ideological awareness early on he wouldnt be able to vote for another six or seven years whats the latest four people called at once flora started opening telegrams senator lafollette is out in front in wisconsin she said which drew cheers a moment later she added and senator debs is sure to carry the presidential race in indiana hes leading three to two noise filled the socialist party offices again flora was pleased too but if debs couldnt carry his own home state what was the point in having him run herman bruck was studying the map the slow trickle of incoming returns and a couple of sheets of paper filled with calculations if things go on like this he announced i think well pick up about a dozen seats in the house and two maybe three in the senate that brought a fresh wave of applause brucks calculations had been pretty good during the congressional elections of that made flora think she could place some confidence in them now roosevelt repudiated somebody shouted somebody else let out a real war whoop almost a rebel yell its not enough flora said and being almost a congresswoman got instant attention from everyone its not enough she repeated if the people had wanted to repudiate tr to repudiate him properly i mean they would have elected debs and another couple of senators and another handful of congressmen and congresswomen maria tresca broke in arent enough to matter flora went on as if her friend hadnt spoken the democrats still have a big majority in both houses tr can jam any bill he likes right down the countrys throat and we cant stop him there arent enough progressive democrats to join us in a united front and keep him out of mischief weve done something this yeara little something when comes we have to do much more she got some applause for that impromptu speech she also got some thoughtful silence which struck her as even more important the socialist party had some notion of the shape of this election now they had to look ahead to see where they could go next a phone rang herman bruck answered it he waved for quiet which meant he was getting fresh returns after he wrote them down he shot a fist into the air in triumph miller he announced hamburger hell never come back from that sarah hamburger had been sitting watching election night with interest but without much visible concern now though deliberately and with great dignity she got up walked over to her daughter and embraced her tears ran down the older womans cheeks and the younger ones as well a few minutes later the telephone rang again again herman bruck answered it after a moment he waved put a finger to his lips then he waved again this time for flora its daniel miller he said silence fell in the offices as flora walked over to the telephone she took the earpiece from herman and leaned close to the mouthpiece hello the democratic appointee to congress sighed in her ear im calling to congratulate you miss hamburger he said the latest returns do seem to show that you have won this seat that being so i dont see much point in wasting everyones time by not admitting the obvious thank you very much congressman miller she said he was being gracious she would return the favor all around her the party workers started cheering once more understanding why miller had to be calling she tried waving them to silence as herman bruck had done it didnt work now that theyd gained what they worked so long and hard to accomplish they werent going to be quiet for anybody not even their own candidate hearing the racket daniel miller managed a chuckle enjoy it miss hamburger he said i wish it were mine if theres anything i can do to help you in the next couple of months im sure you know how to reach me good night he hung up hes conceded flora said also setting the earpiece back on the hook she didnt think any of her colleagues heard her it didnt matter they already knew so did she she was going to congress the best thinglieutenant colonel irving morrell sometimes thought it was the only good thingabout getting back to general staff headquarters was the maps nowhere else in all the world could he get a better idea of how the war as a whole was going looking at them one after another he thought it was going pretty well war department cartographers had already amended national boundaries on the maps to show kentucky as one of the united states captain john abell came into the map room morrell nodded to him that abell still was a captain filled morrell with a sense that there might be justice in the world after all no matter how well life attempted to conceal it good morning lieutenant colonel morrell abell saidcoolly as he said everything coolly that morrell was now a lieutenant colonel seemed to fill him with a sense that there was no justice in the world morning morrell agreed the use of such polite formulas let even men who didnt care for each other find something safe to say and no doubt often kept them from going after each other with knives morrell didnt need to look very hard to find something else safe with tr on the job for another four years well have the chance to make these end up looking the way they should he waved to the maps so we will abell said debs would have been a disaster this is already a disaster morrell said abell looked at him as if hed suddenly started speaking turkish to the general staff officer whod spent the whole war in philadelphia the conflict was a matter of orders and telegrams and lines on maps nothing more having almost lost a leg himself having seen men bleed and heard them scream morrell conceived of it in rather more intimate terms he went on it would be an even worse disaster if we dropped it in the middle though then wed just have to pick it up again in five years or ten or fifteen at the most there is no doubt some truth in that abell sounded relieved at least to the degree he ever sounded much like anything we have the tools and we can finish the job hope so anyhow morrell said the canadians are in a bad way and thats a fact if we knock them out of the war that will let us pull forces south and give it to the csa with both barrels if the canadians had any sense they would have long since seen they were fighting out of their weight abell scowled at the situation maps of ontario and quebec theyre as irrational as the belgians morrell shrugged theyre patriots same as we are if the belgians had rolled over our german friends would long since have got to paris if the canadians had rolled over we wouldnt just be in richmondwed be in charleston and montgomery by now i believe youre right about that sir a light kindled in abells pale eyes we may get there yet in spite of everything yes morrell said and the word soundedhungry weve owed the rebs for a long time and now maybe we can finally pay them back abell smiled so did morrell they distrusted each other being as different as two men could be while both wearing the uniform of the united states but no matter how different they were they shared the us loathing for the confederate states of america two generations of humiliation abell said dreamily two generations of those drawling bastards telling us what to do and giving us orders out of the barrel of a gun two generations of their hiding behind englands skirts and frances knowing we couldnt fight them and their friends all at the same time we tried it once and it didnt work but we have friends of our own now so the confederates have to try to take us on by themselves this time and its turning out to be a harder job morrell walked over to the map that showed how things stood on the maryland front the cartographers had left on the map the confederate advance to the susquehanna as if it were the highwater mark of a flood and so in a way it had beenif the rebs had got to the delaware instead the war would look a lot different now but that highwater mark was not what had drawn morrells attention these days western maryland was cleared of the invaders one day soon us forces would cross the potomac and carry the war into the confederate states fortunes changed and so did the enemys responses thoughtfully he said i wonder how much trouble their nigger troops are going to cause that is the wild card abell admitted those black units will be riddled with reds so we can dare hope they wont fight hard and after all they are only negroes the french have had pretty good luck with their colored soldiers morrell said guderian was telling me the germans dont like facing them for beans when they attack they put everything theyve got into it and they dont want to be bothered with prisoners either yes ive heard that too abell said but ive also heard theyve got no staying power to speak of thats what the rebs will need being on the defensive as they are theyre in no position to attack us even if the canucks stay in the fight the initiative is in our hands i wouldnt be so sure of that morrell said if the rebs stand on the defensive theyll lose well hammer them to deathand the voters just gave teddy roosevelt four more yearswell two anyhow till the next congressional electionsto do exactly that if the confederates want to stop us theyll have to do some striking of their own perhaps youre right lieutenant colonel by the way abell said it he thought morrell was out of his mind but inexplicably being of two grades superior rank had to be humored the maps make it difficult to see where they could hope to do so however maps are wonderful morrell said i love maps they let you see things you could never hope to spot without em but they arent a beall and endall if you dont factor morale into your strategic thinking youre going to get surprised in ways you dont like perhaps abell said again again he sounded anything but convinced since he had few emotions of his own he didnt seem to think anyone else had them either maybe that accounted for his still being a captain never mind morrell said a little sadly but ill tell you this captain anybody whos looking defeat in the face isnt going to fight a rational war once he figures hes got nothing left to lose yes sir abell said it didnt get through to the general staff captain morrell could see as much he wondered when abell had last fired a springfield he wondered if abell had ever had to command a platoon on maneuvers he had his doubts had abell ever done anything like that he wouldnt have retained such an abiding faith in rationality what will you do when the wars over morrell asked abell didnt hesitate help the country prepare itself for the next one of course he replied and you the same for the life of him morrell couldnt think of anything hed rather do i think if i get the chance im going to go into barrels thats where well see a lot of effort focused once the fightings done this time abell shook his head theyve been a disappointment if you ask me like gas they promise more than they deliver now that the enemy has seen them a few times we dont get the panic effect we once did and enemy barrels are starting to neutralize ours they may have occasional uses i grant you but i think theyll go down in the history of this war as curiosities nothing more i dont agree morrell said they need more work theyd be much more useful if they could move faster than a soldier can walk and im not sure our doctrine for employing them is the best it could be either how else would you use them sir other than all along the line abell asked they are as you pointed out an adjunct to infantry this matter has been discussed here at considerable length both before your arrival and during your absence had abell been wearing gloves he might have slapped morrell in the face with one of them his remarks really meant who do you think you are you johnnycomelately to question the gathered wisdom of the war department and the general staff all i know is what i read in the reports that come back from the field and what ive seen in the field for myself morrell answered which didnt make captain abell look any happier theyve done some good and i think they could do more i suggest then sir that you put your proposals in the form of a memorandum for evaluation by the appropriate committee abell said maybe i will morrell said which startled john abell one more memorandum no one will ever read morrell thought just what the war effort needs now aloud he went on yes maybe ill do that and maybe ill do something else too the gaze abell gave him held more suspicion than any the smooth young captain had ever aimed at the confederates and their plans roger kimball said youre all volunteers here and im proud of every one of you for coming along on this ride i knew the bonefish had the finest damn crew in the cs navy and youve gone and proved it again sir tom brearley said we wouldnt have missed it for the world brearley was the executive officer and was supposed to think like that kimball wanted to get a feel for how the ordinary sailors felt yes theyd all volunteered but had they really understood what they were getting into then ben coulter said if we can give the damnyankeesnuts a good twist skipper reckon itll turn out to be worth it the rest of the crew some in greasy dungarees some in black leather that was every bit as greasy but didnt show it so much rumbled their agreement with the veteran petty officer a lot of them had quit shaving after they sailed out of charleston which made them look even more piratical than they would have otherwise all right kimball said heartened you understand what were doing here if it goes wrong we aint gonna be like my old chum ralph briggs calls himself a submariner and the yankees have captured him twice he spat to show what he thought of that if it goes wrong were sunk his eyes gleamed but if it goes right theres gonna be a lot of unhappy yankees in new york harbor that wolfish growl rose from the crew again rationally kimball knew the odds were hed said his last goodbyes to everybody except the crew of the bonefish and hed probably never get the chance to say goodbye to them but the risk was worth the candle as far as he was concerned bookish and thoughtful where kimball was fierce and emotional tom brearley said weve loaded this boat with so many extra batteries we only need to fill our buoyancy tanks half full to go straight down to the bottom that was an exaggeration but not a big one brearley went on weve got chemicals aboard to take some of the carbon dioxide out of the air while were submerged too what all that means is we can submerge farther out from new york city than the yankees think sneak up on them do our worst and then get away again thats what we can do all right kimball said thats what were going to do he went up the ladder to the conning tower and looked all around the stars and bars flapped where the confederate naval ensign would normally have flown as it had been in the chesapeake bay that was part of the deception scheme hed laid on a passing ship or aeroplane would see red white and blue andhe hopedassume the boat belonged to the us navy what made it especially delicious was that it didnt even slightly contravene international law the bonefish was only a couple of hundred miles southeast of new york harbor now and ship traffic was heavy as hed counted on none of the merchantmen paid any attention to a surfaced submersible sailing along on what were obviously its own lawful occasions an aeroplane with the us eagleandswords emblem flew past at first taking the bonefish for granted but then sweeping back for a closer look cursing under his breathif that aeroplane carried wireless and identified him as a hostile all his preparations were wastedkimball took off his cap and waved it at the yankee flying machine it came no closer but waggled its wings and flew off satisfied he let out a sigh of relief five minutes later he spotted a us airship a giant flying cigar he cursed again this time not at all under his breath the airship could look him over at close range and hover above his boat penetrating its disguise he stayed up top ready to order the bonefish to dive if the dirigible turned his way it didnt evidently taking the sub for a us vessel if it noticed the boat at all when he was inside a hundred miles of the harborand also about to enter the first ring of mines around ithe went below dogged the hatch after himself and said take her down to periscope depth tom five knots aye aye sir periscope depth five knots brearley said the bonefish slid below the surface with remarkable alacrity those extra batteries were heavy without them though he couldnt have come close enough to the harbor to contemplate an attack confederate naval intelligence had given him their best information on where the lanes through the mines lay he was betting his boatbetting his neck too but he didnt care to think of it that waythe boys in the quiet offices knew what they were talking about and then as hed hoped he would he caught a break peering through the periscope he spotted a harbor tug leading a little flotilla of fishing boats back toward new york were going to sneak up on their tails and follow em in he said to brearley and gave the orders to close the bonefish up on the last of the fishing boats which in among the mines were going no faster than he was he was reminded of stories about a gator swimming behind a mother duck and her ducklings and picking them off one by one he let the ducklings swim all of them together wouldnt have satisfied his hunger the periscope kept wanting to fog up kimball invented ever more exotic curses and hurled them at its lenses and prisms down inside the steel tube with him the sailors snickered at his extravagances it was funny too but only to a point if he couldnt see where he was going he wouldnt get there he spotted sandy hook off to port and then a little later coney island to starboard his lip curled here we are boys he said where all the damnyankees in new york citya symbol of depravity all over the confederate statescome to play nobody frolicked on the beaches today the weather topside was chilly and gray and dreary he swept the periscope around counterclockwise till he recognized nortons point the westernmost projection of coney island which stuck out almost into the narrows the channel that led to new yorks harbors theres the lighthouse he said confirming a landmark and theres the fog bell next to it for nights when a light doesnt do any good andwhat the hells going on there cursing the blurry image he stared intently into the periscope his left hand folded into a fist and thumped softly against the side of his thigh what is it sir tom brearley asked recognizing the gesture of excitement must have had themselves a foggy night last night or somewhere not long ago kimball answered somebodys aground on the mud flats by the lighthousesub i think maybe and theyve got themselves one two threejesus i see three i really dobattleships sitting like broody hens around the cruiser thats pulling her off to hell with anything else im going to get me one of those big bastards if its the last thing i ever do what are they doing there brearley asked damned if i know kimball answered but this is new york city after all they would have been in port and some halfsmart son of a bitch probably said well weve got em right close by lets use em to make sure nobody gets frisky while were pulling our boat back into the water its only a guess mind you but ill lay its a good one bet youre right sir brearley said kimball didnt care whether he was right or not why didnt matter what mattered and there in front of him was the juiciest what this side of a fox sauntering into an unguarded henhouse at his orders the bonefish pulled away from the fishing boats shed been following and slid through the water toward the battleships they didnt have a clue the boat was on the same planet let alone closing toward eight hundred yards they werent keeping anything like a proper antisubmersible watch not here so close to home all four of his forward tubes already had fish in them hed known from the beginning he would have to shoot fast and run fivedegree spread he ordered im going to give two targets two fish apiece i cant get a clean shot at the third one are we ready gentlemen he knew how keyedup he washe hadnt called his crew a pack of bastards or anything of the sort fire one and two and three and four compressed air hissed as the fish leaped away they ran straight and true a bare instant before they reached their targets one of the battleships began showing more smoke as if trying to get away the explosions from at least two hits echoed inside the bonefish whoops and cheers from the men drowned them out right full rudder to course tom kimball said exultantly lets get the hell out of here if we dont hit a mine were all a pack of goddamn heroesi think i nailed both those sons of bitches and if we do hit a mine its still a good trade for the cs navy he thought but that had nothing to do with the price of beer hed done what hed come to do hed done more than hed thought he would be able to manage up till then he hadnt cared what would happen afterwards now all at once he very much wanted to live so he could give the damnyankees balls another good kick somewhere further down the line if the hiring clerk at the cotton mill in greenville south carolina had been any more bored he would have fallen out of his chair name he asked and yawned enormously jeroboam scipio answered after his meeting with anne colleton he didnt dare keep the false name hed borne before any more than hed dared stay in columbia jero that got the clerks attention it made him unhappy you able to spell it for me nigger scipio did without any trouble the clerk drummed his fingers up and down on the desktop you read and write sounds like it yes suh scipio answered hed decided he didnt need to lie about that it wasnt against the law and wasnt even that uncommon cipher too the clerk asked he yawned again and scratched his cheek just below the edge of the patch covering his left eye socket a patch that explained why a white man in his twenties wasnt at the front yes suh scipio said again and cautiously added some i do but the clerk just nodded and wrote something down on the form he was completing for a moment he almost approached briskness you got a passbook you can show me jeroboam no suh scipio said resignedly too bad the clerk said thats gonna cost you scipio had been sure it was going to cost him now he wanted to find out just how much he had more money now than when hed come to columbia he figured he could get by till this petty crook was through shaking him down but to his amazement the clerk went on these last couple weeks weve been paying twentydollar hiring bonuses to bucks with their papers all in order on account of they stay with us longer and we want to keep em in the plant aint got no papers scipio repeated doing his best to hide how surprised he was been a busy time dese pas couple years nigger you dont know the half of it the clerk said considering what all scipio had been through the clerk didnt know what he was talking about but then he scratched by the eye patch again so he knew some things scipio didnt too he asked how old are you ise fotyfoi think scipio answered all right the clerk wrote that down too even if you took your black ass down to the recruiting station they wouldnt stick you in butternut so we aint real likely to lose you anyhow aint that right i reckon not scipio said all of a sudden things made more sense you losin a lot o de hands to de war suh too damn many the clerk said always knew niggers was crazy you got to be crazy if you want the chance of gettin shot and next to no money while youre doin it he scratched by the patch yet again i been through all that and i purely dont see the point to it me neither suh scipio said but he did though he wouldnt say so to a white man the clerk had gone to war along with his peers masters of what they surveyed if negroes put on butternut they hoped to gain some measure of the equality the clerk took for granted well thats as may be the oneeyed white man said pay is two dollars an fifty cents a day you start tomorrow mornin half past seven you make sure youre here on time yes suh i do dat suh scipio had expected warnings far more dire that this one was so mild told him how badly the mill needed workers so did their attitude toward his papers or lack of same the clerk called him nigger in every other sentence but the clerk had undoubtedly called every black he saw a nigger from the day he learned how to talk he did it more to identify than to demean scipio went looking for a room at a boardinghouse and found one not far from the cotton mill the manager of the building a skinny wizened negro who called himself aurelius said wes right glad to have you jeroboam and thats a fac lots o folks is leavin here fo to join the army up from the congaree country is you dat right scipio said aurelius accent was different from his closer to the way the white folks of greenville spoke than to the low country dialect scipio had learned on the marshlands plantation aurelius scratched his head his hair had more gray in it than scipios you know somethin jeroboam he said if i thought theyd let me tote a rifle id join the army my own self reckon i wouldnt mind votin an all them other things the white folks is givin to niggers who goes to war for em maybe was all scipio said having fought against the confederate government having the blood of a confederate officer on his hands he didnt think he wanted to put on butternut himself even had he been young enough for recruiters to want him his room was bigger and cleaner and cost less than the one in columbia being just a mill town rather than the state capital greenville didnt have to put on airs the work scipio got was marginally easier than what hed been doing before instead of hauling crates of shell casings from one place to another he loaded bolts of coarse butternutdyed cloth onto pallets so someone else could haul them off to the cutting rooms two days after he got the job the young negro who had been hauling those pallets quit another young black took his place this one lasted a week a third negro held the position two days all three of them resigned to put on that butternut cloth once it had been made into uniforms scipio saw his first black man in confederate uniform a little more than a week after he came to greenville three big toughlooking negroes in butternut came down park avenue side by side they swaggered along as if they owned the sidewalk blacks of all ages and both sexes stared at them as if theyd fallen from the moon scipio was one of those who stared he wondered if any of the brandnew soldiers had worn the red armband of the congaree socialist republic the winter before as the uniformed negroes strode along the avenue sighs rose up from every woman around if the men in butternut were out for a good time their problem would be picking and choosing not finding that much though scipio could have guessed beforehand he found watching whites far more interesting they stared at the negroes in uniform too their attitude was more nearly astonishment and uncertainty than delight their legislators had passed the bill authorizing negro soldiers now that they were confronted with the reality they didnt know what to make of it a white captain perhaps home on leave came out of a shop on park avenue the three negroes snapped to attention and gave him salutes so precise they might have been machined the captain stopped and looked the black men over damnfool buckra scipio thought if a white officer doesnt treat them like soldiers who will but the captain though half a beat late did return the salutes then he did something better something smarter he nodded to the three negroes before he went on his way they nodded back one of them saluted again the captain gravely returned that salute too he hadnt acknowledged them as his equals but they werent his equals in the army he had acknowledged them as belonging to the same team he did in the confederacy that was epochal in and of itself a sigh ran through blacks and whites alike everyone recognized what had happened not everyone scipio saw was happy with it that didnt surprise him what did surprise him was that none of the whites on park avenue raised a fuss the three negro soldiers found a saloon and went into it one after another more and more blacks in butternut began appearing as time went by a couple of weeks after scipio saw his first colored recruits he was going home from the mill when a white corporal stopped a black man in confederate uniform the white man had his right arm in a sling in a voice more curious than anything else he asked nigger why the hell you want to take the chance of getting a present like this one here he wiggled the fingers sticking out of his cast the negro came to attention before he spoke copral suh he said my big brother he was in one o they labor battalions an a damnyankee shell done kilt him he didnt have no gun he couldnt do nothin about it them damnyankees aint gwine shoot at me without i shoots back all right thats an answer by jesus the corporal said kill a couple o them bastards for your brother then kill a couple for your own self thats what i aims to do the negro said scipio was very thoughtful all the way back to his boardinghouse after the csa pounded the congaree socialist republic into the ground hed been convinced everything cassius and cherry and the rest of the marxist revolutionaries had tried to achieve had died with the republic he wasnt so sure not any more maybe negroes were getting a taste of greater freedom after all even if not in the way the reds had aimed to give it to them and maybe just maybe the struggles of the congaree socialist republic hadnt been in vain when the field hands lined up in the morning two more men were missing where did hephaestion and orestes disappear to anne colleton asked are they off somewhere getting drunk instead of sounding furious she hoped that was what the two stalwart hands were doing but the field foreman a grizzled buck named maximus shook his head no maam he said dey is on de way to st matthewsdey leave befo de fust light o dawn maximus had an unconsciously poetic way of speaking dey say dey gwine be sojers did they anne bit down on the inside of her lower lip she had helped get the bill allowing negro soldiers passed and now she was paying the price for it in front of the hands she had to keep up a bold facade well well make do one way or another lets get to work out to the fields and to their garden plots trooped the negroes the young men among them had found a loophole in the silent agreement theyd made with her after the congaree socialist republic collapsed if they joined the confederate army they didnt need her to shield them from authorityand they didnt need to do as she said grimly anne headed back toward her cabin she had letters to write bills to pay how she was supposed to put in a proper crop of cotton next year if all her hands departed was beyond her her shoulders stiffened shed managed a crop of sorts after the red uprising if shed worked one miracle she figured she could work another shed have to so she would do it julia was already busy in the cabin feather duster in one hand baby in the crook of her other elbow she couldnt join the army anne appraised her as coldbloodedly as if shed been a mule she wouldnt be much good out in the fields either mornin maam julia said unaware of the scrutiny or ignoring it it gwine be christmastime any day now so it will anne said shed driven into columbia a few days before and sent tom half a dozen pairs of leatherandwool gloves shed also bought a crate of the usual trinkets for the workers on the plantation she couldnt make herself believe they deserved anything but the back of her hand but couldnt afford any more trouble with them she had troubles enough a little bribery never hurt anything and a congressman for instance would have been far more expensive de tree sho smell fine julia said jus a little feller dis yeah not like in de old days in the old days anne had had the halls of marshlands in which to set a tree that was a tree here in the lowroofed cottage this sapling would have to do she was making the best show she could with tinsel and a cheap glass star on top julia cleaned at a glacial pace anne had learned hurrying her was useless she would just look hurt and stare down at her baby shed been slow before she had the baby she was slower now anne waited impatiently maybe she let the impatience show julia dropped and shattered the chamber pot then spent what felt like half an hour sweeping up shards of china anne was ready to kick her by the time she finally left the cottage at last the mistress of marshlands such as there was of marshlands these days got down to her own work without anyone peering over her shoulder she was gladder by the day that shed been in fine financial shape before the war started she wouldnt be in fine shape by the time it was done if she survived though she knew shed be able to get her own back once peace finally returned she picked up the telephone mouthpiece to call a broker down in charleston the line was dead she said something pungently unladylike nothing worked the way it was supposed to not any more it was either write another letter or drive into st matthews to send a telegram she wrote the letter more and more these days she felt nothing at marshlands got done unless she stayed here to see it get done to add to her foul mood the postman was late when he finally did show up he rode toward her with a bigger armed escort than usual you want to watch yourself maam he said they say them red niggers is feelin fractious they say all sorts of things anne answered coldly she took the envelopes and periodicals the fellow gave her and handed him the letters shed written he stuck those in his saddlebag and rode off once he was gone she regretted snapping at him the guards accompanying him argued that people in st matthews were taking seriously the threat from cassius diehards she checked her pistol it lay under her pillow where it was supposed to be wondering if julia or one of the other negroes had pulled its teeth she checked that too no it was fully loaded that eased her mind somewhat arguing as it did that the marshlands negroes didnt expect an imminent visit from their friends and comrades skulking in the swamps of the congaree comrades the word tasted bad in her mouth now that the reds had degraded it it wasnt a word decent people in the confederate states could use comfortably any more no sooner had that thought crossed her mind than she laughed at herself before the war shed had nothing but contempt for the stodgy boring folk who counted for the confederacys decent people now she reckoned herself one of them she laughed again though it wasnt funny it was either laugh or scream the red uprising had proved as painfully as possible how much she had in common with her fellow white confederate americans julia brought in chicken and dumplings for supper anne ate hardly noticing the plate in front of her her body servant took it away anne lighted the lamps one by one they didnt give her proper light by which to read but they were what she had she wasnt holding her breath about getting electricity restored to marshlands any more than she was about getting back a telegraph line on the off chance she tried the telephone again it was still silent too she snarled at it a couple of magazines told in great detail how the csa might yet win the war she would have had more faith in them if they hadnt contradicted each other in so many places she also would have had more faith in them if either author had shown more signs he knew what he was talking about and wasnt whistling in the dark she poured herself a cup of coffee the coffee remained good as long as the caribbean remained a confederate lake imports from central and south america could still reach galveston new orleans mobile and pensacola however good it was the coffee did nothing to keep her awake she drank it so regularly it had next to no effect on her when she started yawning over a particularly abstruse piece on russias chances against the germans and austrians in she set down the magazine blew out all the lamps but the one by her bed and changed into a nightgown then she blew out the last lamp and went to bed she woke up sometime in the middle of the night as shed tossed and turned her right hand had slipped under the pillow it was resting on the revolver that though wasnt what had wakened her coffee she muttered under her breath she reached down for the chamber pot only to discover it wasnt there and remember why off to the privy thenno help for it her lips twisted in frustrated anger as she started to get out of bed marshlands had had flush toilets longer than shed been alive it had been one of the first plantation houses in south carolina to enjoy such an amenity shed taken indoor plumbing for granted the refugee camp had taught her it was too precious too wonderful not to be properly admiredand at the moment she had not so much as a pot to call her own even in the mild climate hereabouts a nighttime trip to the privy was a chilly business she shut the door behind her to keep the cold out of the cottage going to the privy was also a smelly disgusting business and spiders and bugs and occasional lizards and mice visited the place too almost absentmindedly she scooped up the pistol and carried it along with her when she went out into the darkness she was halfway to the outhouse before she consciously recalled the warning the postman had given her when she got to the privy she set the little handgun down beside her before she hiked up her gown she spent longer in the noisome place than shed expected she had just risen from the pierced wooden seat when she heard voices outside they were all familiar voices though she hadnt heard a couple of them in more than a year she in dere cassius asked the hunterthe red revolutionary leaderwasnt talking loud but he wasnt making any special effort to keep his voice down either she in dere julia answered more quietly you don wan to wake she up cass she gots a gun she come out shootin den we shoots she and dat de end o one capitalist pressor cassius said we gots dis cottage surrounded aint no way out we aint got covered i oughts to knowde place was mine shootin too good fo dat white debbil bitch another womans voice cherrys anne realized after a moment oh is you right about dat julia agreed enthusiastically i wants to watch she burn she use me like is an animal she do ever since she come back i wants to see she dead see if i give you a christmas present this year julia anne thought shed got the idea julia didnt much care for her but this venomous hatredno she shook her head shed thought shed known what the negroes on marshlands were thinking shed been fatally wrong about cassius and now almost as misled about julia she wondered if she understood at all what went on inside blacks minds cherry said her brudder done use me he have hisself a high old time right till de end her laugh was low and throaty and triumphant he don find out till too late dat i usin he too so scipio told me the truth about that thinking about what had happened kept anne from worrying unduly about the predicament she was in now shed seen some of it for herself cherry had put on airs even around her on account of what she did in the bedroom with jacob cassius said don matter how she die so long as she dead top oall de other crimes she do i hear tell she behindat bill dat mystify de niggers to fight fo de white folks gummint we strikes a blow fo revolutionary justice when we ends de backers o dat wicked scheme so light de matches den cherry said impatiently through the tiny window cut in the outhouse door light flared brilliantly bright cassius and the other reds must have doused the doorway to the cottageand maybe the walls as wellwith kerosene or perhaps even gasoline had anne been inside there she wouldnt have had a chance in the world to get free the most she could have hoped for would have been to blow out her own brains before the flames took her how you like it now miss anne julia shouted exultation in her voice how you like it you coldeyed debbil cassius and cherry and the rest of the reds howled abuse at the cabin too after a moment so did a rising chorus of marshlands field hands roused from their beds by shouts and by flames anne realized that if she was going to escape she would have to do it now while everyones attention was on the burning cottage and nowhere else she opened the privy door and stepped outside holding up a hand to shield her face from the fierce glare of the fire she started to step away from the outhouse but then stopped and shut the door behind herno use giving her foes which seemed to mean everyone on the marshlands plantation a clue as to where shed been maybe the reds would think smoke and fire had overcome her before she woke up she wished her nightgown were any color but white it made her too easy to spot in the darkness putting the privy between her and the fire she made for the closest trees those couple of hundred yards seemed ten miles long no sooner had anne reached the trees than the harsh flat crack of gunfire came from behind her remembering everything tom and jacob had said about combat she threw herself flat that took care of her worries about the white nightgown because she landed in cold clammy mud shouts of alarm from the negroes behind her told her what the gunfire was rounds in the box of revolver ammunition in the cottage cooking off deliberately she rolled in the mud so her back was as dark as her belly then she set out for st matthews four or five miles away a couple of plantations between marshlands and the town had a sort of spectral halflife but after what had just happened to her she was not inclined to trust her fate to any place where the field hands vastly outnumbered the whites i kept the government off them she said through clenched teeth and this is the thanks i got theyll pay oh yes theyll pay after scipio had visited marshlands shed taken him off her list when she was in columbia shed learned hed quit his job and didnt seem to be in town any more that had been wise of him she bared her teeth in the end it would do him no good shed have her revenge on him as on all the others now she stayed in the undergrowth alongside the road instead of going straight down it that slowed her and wounded her bare feet but left her less visible as far as she was concerned the latter was more important every so often she stopped in the best shelter she could find and listened to try to find out if anyone was pursuing her she heard nothing that made her feel only a little safer she knew how good a hunter cassius was but every painful step she took brought her closer to safety she was she thought more than halfway to st matthews when a horsedrawn fire engine lanterns blazing in the night came clattering up the road toward marshlands a couple of armed guards on horseback trotted along beside it anne stepped out into the roadway waving her arms she was so muddy the fire engine almost rolled over her instead of stopping jesus christ one of the firemen exclaimed its anne colleton dont go any farther she said you havent got enough firepower cassius and his reds will be waiting to bushwhack you and besidesher mouth twistedthe fire will have done whatever it can do the fireman whod recognized her helped her up onto the engine it stank of coal smoke from the steam engine that powered the pump from a long way away a rifle barked the fireman grunted and crumpled shot through the head another shot rang out the bullet ricocheting off the engine before the sound of the report reached her get the hell out of here claude one of the guards shouted to the driver the other guard started shooting in the direction from which the shots had come claude could handle horses he turned the sixanimal team and headed back toward st matthews faster than anne would have thought possiblebut not before another fireman got hit in the foot he cursed furiously pausing every so often to apologize to anne for his language cassius she thought it has to be cassius the iron bulk of the pump shielded her from any more bullets all she had to do all the way back to town was think about how the hunter the red had ruined her twice but she was still alive still fightingand so in spite of the negro uprising and everything else were the confederate states well whip the yankees yet she thought and you cassius ill whip you
