jonathan kellerman victims chapter this one was different the first hint was milos tightvoiced eight am message stripped of details something i need you to see alex heres the address an hour later i was showing id to the uniform guarding the tape he winced up there doctor pointing to the second story of a skyblue duplex trimmed in chocolatebrown he dropped a hand to his sam browne belt as if ready for selfdefense nice older building the classic calspanish architecture but the color was wrong so was the silence of the street sawhorsed at both ends three squad cars and a livercolored ltd were parked haphazardly across the asphalt no crime lab vans or coroners vehicles had arrived yet i said bad the uniform said theres probably a better word for it but that works milo stood on the landing outside the door doing nothing no cigarsmoking or jotting in his pad or grumbling orders feet planted arms at his sides he stared at some faraway galaxy his blue nylon windbreaker bounced sunlight at strange angles his black hair was limp his pitted face the color and texture of cottage cheese past its prime a white shirt had wrinkled to crepe wheatcolored cords had slipped beneath his paunch his tie was a sad shred of poly he looked as if hed dressed wearing a blindfold as i climbed the stairs he didnt acknowledge me when i was six steps away he said you made good time easy traffic sorry he said for what including you he handed me gloves and paper booties i held the door for him he stayed outside the woman was at the rear of the apartments front room flat on her back the kitchen behind her was empty counters bare an old avocadocolored fridge free of photos or magnets or mementos two doors to the left were shut and yellowtaped i took that as a keep out drapes were drawn over every window fluorescent lighting in the kitchen supplied a nasty pseudodawn the womans head was twisted sharply to the right a swollen tongue hung between slack bloated lips limp neck a grotesque position some coroner might label incompatible with life big woman broad at the shoulders and the hips late fifties to early sixties with an aggressive chin and short coarse gray hair brown sweatpants covered her below the waist her feet were bare unpolished toenails were clipped short grubby soles said bare feet at home was the default above the waistband of the sweats was what remained of a bare torso her abdomen had been sliced horizontally below the navel in a crude approximation of a csection a vertical slit crossed the lateral incision at the center creating a starshaped wound the damage brought to mind one of those hardrubber change purses that relies on surface tension to protect the goodies squeeze to create a stellate opening then reach in and scoop the yield from this receptacle was a necklace of intestines placed below the womans neckline and arranged like a fashionistas puffy scarf one end terminated at her right clavicle bilious streaks ran down her right breast and onto her rib cage the rest of her viscera had been pulled down into a heap and left near her left hip the pile rested atop a oncewhite towel folded double below that was a larger maroon towel spread neatly four other expanses of terry cloth formed a makeshift tarp that shielded beige walltowall carpeting from biochemical insult the towels had been arranged precisely edges overlapping evenly for about an inch near the womans right hip was a pale blue tshirt also folded spotless doubling the white towel had succeeded in soaking up a good deal of body fluid but some had leaked into the maroon underlayer the smell wouldve been bad enough without the initial stages of decomp one of the towels beneath the body bore lettering silver bath sheet embroidered vita in white latin or italian for life some monsters notion of irony the intestines were greenbrown splotched pink in spots black in others matte finish to the casing some puckering that said theyd been drying for a while the apartment was cool a good ten degrees below the pleasant spring weather outside the rattle of a wheezy ac unit in one of the living room windows was inescapable once i noticed it noisy apparatus rusty at the bolts but efficient enough to leach moisture from the air and slow down the rot but rot is inevitable and the womans color wasnt anything youd see outside a morgue incompatible with life i bent to inspect the wounds both slashes were confident swoops unmarred by obvious hesitation marks shearing smoothly through layers of skin subcutaneous fat diaphragmatic muscle no abrasions around the genital area and surprisingly little blood for so much brutality no spatter or spurt or castoff or evidence of a struggle all those towels horribly compulsive guesses filled my head with bad pictures extremely sharp blade probably not serrated the necktwist had killed her quickly and shed been dead during the surgery the ultimate anesthesia the killer had stalked her with enough thoroughness to know hed have her to himself for a while once attaining total control hed gone about choreographing laying out the towels tucking and aligning achieving a pleasing symmetry then hed laid her down removed her tshirt careful to keep it clean standing back hed inspected his prep work time for the blade then the real fun anatomical exploration despite the butchery and the hideous set of her neck she looked peaceful for some reason that made what had been done to her worse i scanned the rest of the room no damage to the front door or any other sign of forced entry bare beige walls backed cheap upholstered furniture covered in a puckered ocher fabric that aped brocade but fell short white ceramic beehive lamps looked as if theyd shatter under a fingersnap the dining area was set up with a card table and two folding chairs a brown cardboard takeout pizza box sat on the table someoneprobably milohad placed a yellow plastic evidence marker nearby that made me take a closer look no brand name on the box just pizza in exuberant red cursive above the caricature of a portly mustachioed chef curls of smaller lettering swarmed around the chefs fleshy grin fresh pizza lotta taste ooh la la yum yum bon appetit the box was pristine not a speck of grease or fingersmudge i bent down to sniff picked up no pizza aroma but the decomp had filled my nose it would be a while before id be smelling anything but death if this was another type of crime scene some detective might be making ghoulish jokes about free lunch the detective in charge of this scene was a lieutenant whod seen hundreds of murders maybe thousands yet chose to stay outside for a while i let loose more mental pictures some fiend in a geeky delivery hat ringing the doorbell then managing to talk himself inside watching as the prey went for her purse waiting for precisely the right moment before coming up behind her and clamping both his hands on the sides of her head quick blitz of rotation the spinal cord would separate and that would be it doing it correctly required strength and confidence that and the lack of obvious transfer evidencenot even a shoe impressionscreamed experience if thered been a similar murder in la i hadnt heard about it despite all that meticulousness the hair around the womans temples might be a good place to look for transfer dna psychopaths dont sweat much but you never know i examined the room again speaking of purses hers was nowhere in sight robbery as an afterthought more likely souvenirtaking was part of the plan edging away from the body i wondered if the womans last thoughts had been of crusty dough mozzarella a comfy barefoot dinner the doorbell ring the last music shed ever hear i stayed in the apartment awhile longer straining for insight the terrible competence of the necktwist made me wonder about someone with martial arts training the embroidered towel bothered me vita life had he brought that one but taken the rest from her linen closet yum bon appetit to life the decomp reek intensified and my eyes watered and blurred and the necklace of guts morphed into a snake drab constrictor fat and languid after a big meal i could stand around and pretend that this was anything comprehensible or hurry outside and try to suppress the tide of nausea rising in my own guts not a tough choice chapter milo hadnt moved from his position on the landing his eyes were back on planet earth watching the street below five uniforms were moving from door to door from the quick pace of the canvass plenty of noonehome the street was in a workingclass neighborhood in the southeastern corner of west la division three blocks east wouldve made it someone elses problem mixed zoning allowed singlefamily dwellings and duplexes like the one where the woman had been degraded psychopaths are stodgy creatures of routine and i wondered if the killers comfort zone was so narrow that he lived within the sawhorses i caught my breath and worked at settling my stomach while milo pretended not to notice yeah i know he finally said he was apologizing for the second time when a coroners van drove up and a darkhaired woman in comfortable clothes got out and hurried up the stairs morning milo morning gloria all yours oh boy she said we talking freakybad i could say ive seen worse kid but id be lying coming from you that gives me the creeps milo because im old tsk she patted his shoulder because youre the voice of experience some experiences i can do without people can get used to just about anything but if your psyches in good repair the fix is often temporary soon after receiving my doctorate i worked as a psychologist on a pediatric cancer ward it took a month to stop dreaming about sick kids but i was eventually able to do my job with apparent professionalism then i left to go into private practice and found myself years later on that same ward seeing the children with new eyes mocked all the adaptation i thought id accomplished and made me want to cry i went home and dreamed for a long time homicide detectives get used to a regular diet of soulobliteration typically bright and sensitive they soldier on but the essence of the job lurks beneath the surface like a land mine some ds transfer out others stay and find hobbies religion works for some sin for others some like milo turn griping into an art form and never pretend its just another job the woman on the towels was different for him and for me a permanent image bank had lodged in my brain and i knew the same went for him neither of us talked as gloria worked inside finally i said you marked the pizza box it bothers you everything about this bothers me no brand name on the box any indies around here deliver he drew out his cell phone clicked and produced a page phone numbers hed already downloaded filled the screen and when he scrolled the listings kept coming twentyeight indies in a tenmile radius and i also checked dominos and papa johns and two guys no one dispatched anyone to this address last night and nobody uses that particular box if she didnt actually call out why would she let him in good question who discovered her landlord responding to a complaint she made a few days ago hissing toilet they had an appointment when she didnt answer he got annoyed started to leave then he thought better of it because she liked things fixed used his key where is he now he pointed across the street recuperating with some firewater down in that little tudorish place i found the house greenest lawn on the block beds of flowers topiary bushes anything about him bother you not so far why his landscaping says hes a perfectionist thats a negative this case maybe well he said so far hes just the landlord want to know about her sure her names vita berlin shes fiftysix single lives on some kind of disability vita i said the towel was hers the towel this bastard used every damn towel she had in her linen closet vita means life in latin and italian i thought it might be a sick joke cute anyway im waiting for mr belleveauxthe landlordto calm down so i can question him and find out more about her what ive learned from prelim snooping in her bedroom and bathroom is if shes got kids she doesnt keep their pictures around and if she had a computer it was ripped off same for a cell phone my guess is she had neither the place has a static feel to it like she moved in years ago didnt add any newfangled stuff i didnt see her purse on her nightstand you taped off the bedroom didnt want me in there i sure do but thatll wait until the techies are through cant afford to jeopardize any aspect of this the front room was okay i knew youd be careful his logic seemed strained insufficient sleep and a bad surprise can do that i said any indication she was heading to the bedroom before he jumped her no its pristine why i gave him the delivery tip scenario going for her purse he said well i dont know how youd prove that alex main thing is he confined himself to the front didnt move her into the bedroom for anything sexual i said those towels make me think of a stage or a picture frame meaning showing off his work okay what else to tell you her wardrobes mostly sweats and sneakers lots of books in her bedroom romances and the kinds of mysteries where people talk like noel coward twits and the cops are bumbling cretins i wondered out loud about a killer with martial arts skills and when he didnt respond went on to describe the killscene still bouncing around my brain he said sure why not agreeable but distracted neither of us focusing on the big question why would anyone do something like this to another human being gloria exited the apartment looking older and paler milo said you okay im fine she said no im lying that was horrible her forehead was moist she dabbed it with a tissue my god its grotesque any offthecuff impressions nothing you probably havent figured out yourself broken necks my bet for cod the cutting looks postmortem the incisions look clean so maybe some training in meatcutting or a paramedical field but i wouldnt put much stock in that all kinds of folk can learn to slice that pizza box mean something to you dont know said milo no one admits delivering here a scam to get himself in she said why would she open the door for a fake pizza guy good question gloria she shook her head i called for transport want me to ask for a priority autopsy thanks you might actually get it because dr j seems to like you also with something this weird shes bound to be curious a year ago milo had solved the murder of a coroners investigator since then dr clarice jernigan a senior pathologist had reciprocated with personalized attention when milo asked for it he said must be my charm and good looks gloria grinned and patted his shoulder again anything else guys im on halfshift due to budgetary constraints figure to finish my paperwork by one then go cleanse my head with a couple of martinis give or take milo said make it a double for me i said was significant blood pooled inside the body cavity her look said i was being a spoilsport a lot of it was coagulated but yes thats where most of it was you figured that because the scene was so clean i nodded it was either that or he found out a way to take it with him milo said buckets of blood lovely to gloria one more question you recall anything remotely like this in your case files nope she said but we just cover the county and they say its a globalized world right you could be looking at a traveler milo glared and trudged down the stairs gloria said whoa someones in a mood i said its likely to stay that way for a while chapter stanleigh belleveauxs house was as meticulous inside as out cozy plushcarpeted place set up with doilyprotected toosmall furniture the dollhouse feel was heightened by a brass etagere filled with bisque figurines another case bore photos of two handsome young men in uniform and an american flag paperweight my wifes thing said belleveaux wringing his hands the dolls theyre from germany shes in memphis visiting my motherinlaw he was black fiftyish thickset dressed in a navy polo shirt pressed khakis and tan loafers a fleece of white blanketed his scalp and the bottom half of his face his nose had been broken a few times his knuckles were scarred her mom said milo pardon you called her your motherinlaw rather than her mom because thats how i think of her motherinlaw worst person i know like the ernie kdoe song but you probably dont remember that milo hummed a few bars belleveaux smiled weakly turned grim and wrung his hands some more i still cant believe what happened to ms berlin still cant believe i had to see it he closed his eyes opened them no booze on the table before him just a can of diet coke milo said change your mind about the dewars huh its tempting said belleveaux but a little early in the day what if i get a call and have to drive call from who a tenant thats my life sir how many tenants do you have the feldmans down below ms berlin the soos and the kims and the parks and the other parks in a triplex i own over near korea town then ive got a real problem rental down in willowbrook inherited from my dad a nice family the rodriguezes are there now but its been tough because of the gangster situation he rubbed his eyes this is my best neighborhood i chose to live here last place i thought id have a problem still cant believe what i saw its like a movie a bad one a real horror movie i want to switch to another channel but what i saw wont budge out of here placing a thumbtip on his forehead itll fade said milo takes time guess youd know about that said belleveaux how much time hard to say its probably easier for you this being your job my job the worst thing i see is a bat in a garage sewage leak mice eating wires frowning gangsters in the willowbrook place but i keep my distance this was way up close too close how long have you owned the property across the street seven years eight months thats pretty precise mr belleveaux im a detailman lieutenant learned precision in the army they taught me mechanics a little mechanical engineering i didnt need a college degree to accumulate adequate knowledge later when i was out and repairing washing machines and dryers for sears what the army inculcated in me came in handy only one way to do a job right machine needs three screws you dont put in two i said the same goes for boxing pardon your hands i used to do karate you pick up the signs someone else is into martial arts martial arts said belleveaux nah none of that for me i just did a little sparring in the army then a little more when i got out light welterweight used to be skinny busted my septum three times and my wife she was my girlfriend back then said stan you keep scarring yourself to the point where youre ugly im going to go find myself a pretty boy she was kidding maybe i wanted out anyway what kind of life is that getting knocked around feeling dizzy for days the money was terrible he drank some coke licked his lips milo said so what can you tell us about vita berlin what can i tell you belleveaux echoed thats a complicated question whys that sir she wasnt the easiest okay look i dont want to be speaking bad of the dead specially someone whowhat happened to her no one deserves that no one no matter what i said she had a difficult personality so you know what im talking about i didnt deny it being her landlord could get complicated i prompted belleveaux picked up the soda can does what i tell you go in some kind of record milo said theres a problem with that i dont want to get sued by who someone in her family theyre difficult as well dont know said belleveaux never met them i just believe in being prepared ounce of prevention and all that no particular reason youre worried about being sued no but those kinds of things said belleveaux traits orneriness runs in families right like emmaline my motherinlaw her sisters are all like her scrappy always ready to tussle its like stepping into a cage of badgers vita berlin threatened to sue you about a million times what for anything that bothered her said belleveaux leaky roof she doesnt get a callback in an hour ill sue you torn carpet im at risk of tripping and breaking my neck fix it fast or ill sue you thats why i got irked when she demanded i show up for the toilet and wasnt there when she said shed be thats why i decided to use my key and go in there and fix it even though i knew shed call me up and bitch about entering the premises without her permission which the landlord association says i can do at my discretion for just cause which includes reasonable repairs requested by the tenant turns out the toilet was fine milo said you went into the bathroom i listened while i was looking at her i know its crazy but i couldnt move for a few seconds just stood there trying not to hurl my breakfast and it was quiet toilets out of whack you hear it so i thought about that it wasnt even broken i said vita enjoyed giving you a hard time dont know if she enjoyed it but she sure did it did you try to evict her belleveaux laughed no grounds thats the way the law works to get evicted a tenants just about got to he stopped short i was going to say theyve got to kill someone oh man this is terrible i said seven years eight months i bought the building four years five months ago she came with it i thought that meant good longterm stable tenant then i learned different basically she thought she owned it and i was her janitor entitled i said thats a nice word for it he said cranky lady okay he said ill come out and say it she was a miserable specimen didnt have a good word for anyone its like she had bile in her veins instead of blood my guess is youre not going to have too many people crying disgusted yes scared yes but not crying disgusted by what happened to her belleveauxs eyes clamped shut again the lids twitched man no one deserves that but no ones going to mourn maybe shes got some family wholl mourn he said but no one who had anything to do with her is going to say they miss her im not stating that for a fact im just guessing but id put money on my guess you want to see what i mean go over to bijou its a coffee shop on robertson she ate there from time to time made their lives miserable same for the feldmans the downstairs tenants nice young couple theyve been here a year are ready to move cause of her neighbors dispute no dispute she harassed them theyre on the bottom floor shes on top but shes the one complaining about footsteps actually made me come up to her place to listen a bunch of times all i heard was her bitching shes saying see hear that stan theyre clomping around like barbarians then she lies down puts her ear to the carpet makes me do it that position maybe i pick up a little sound but nothing serious but i lie tell her ill talk to them just to keep her out of my hair you know i did nothing about it she dropped it the next time its something elsethey fill the trash bins too high they park their cars wrong she thinks they snuck in a cat and its a nopet building what happened was there was a stray cat came to the back door looked like it was starving they gave it some milk which is the human thing to do right now the feldmans are going to leave for sure and ill have both units vacant shouldve put my pension money in gold bars or something milo said sounds like vita was a little paranoid thats a word for it said belleveaux but it was more like she wanted attention and being mean was a way to get it she have any friends none i ever saw and you live across the street part of the problem she knew where to find me here i was thinking the building would be perfect convenient no need to drive next time i buy its in another state not that therell be a next time market was up id sell everything what can you tell us about her daily routine from what i saw she kept to herself didnt go out much except for meals once in a while shed walk over to bijou i know because ive been there myself saw her a couple times cheap and good id be there more but the wifes into cooking takes lessons likes to try stuff out now its french thats why im not skinny like i used to be milo said vita eat anywhere else besides bijou mostly what i saw was takeout said belleveaux from the boxes shed throw out in the garbage i know because shed miss id have to pick them up the automated trucks they use nowadays its not in the can it stays there and i dont want rats what kind of takeout what i saw was pizza boxes so i guess she liked pizza from where where i dont knowi think dominos theyre the ones in the blue hats right maybe other places i dont know its not like i was checking out her eating habits through the drapes the less i had to do with her the better did she get pizza delivered last night wouldnt know said belleveaux i was at staples watching the lakers take one from utah went with my boys theyre both master sergeants in the army had leave the same week we did a basketball thing and later we went to philippes for some grub he touched his belt buckle overdid it with the french dip but how many times do you get to go out with your kids do guy stuff everyones being a grownup got home late slept late till seven got her message on the machine why didnt i come yesterday after the first call the toilets busted its her right to have a functional toilet all the fixtures are old and cheap and lousy if im not going to replace them the least i can do is repair them in a timely manner id best be there no later than eight am or shes filing a complaint milo said what time did she call you i didnt check message still on the machine nah i erased it can you narrow it down hmm said belleveaux well i left for the game around four stopped by at the soos apartment to look at an electrical outlet so it had to be after that what time did you get home close to midnight drove anthony and dmitri to where they parked their rental car in the union station lot anthony drove dmitri to the airport then he drove himself to fort irwin when you got home were vita berlins lights on lets see cant rightly say she paid her own electric what she did with her lights was her own business where can we find the feldmans theyre good kids still dont know about this whys that probably at work theyre doctorsresident doctors hes at cedars shes somewhere else maybe the u im not sure first names david and sondra with an o trust me they had nothing to do with this doctors said milo thinking surgical cut stanleigh belleveaux said exactly respectable chapter by the time we left belleveauxs house a crime lab van was parked outside the tape two techs both young men were inside the apartment their kits rested out on the landing the body remained in place milo said lance kenny lieutenant said the taller man l sakura on his tag this sure is disgusting k flores didnt react milo said keeps life interesting dont let me stop you flores said how far do you want us to take this as far as you need to what i mean lieutenant is theres no sign of disruption in the room it all seems centered on the body obviously well print and look for fibers but do you see any reason to luminol sakura said looks way too clean even for someone doing a mopup no bleach smell either well check the drains call in a forensic plumber if the fixtures give us a problem but we dont see much chance for significant blood evidence other than her blood said flores which is probably the small spots on the towel even there whoever did this was supercareful probably dabbed as he went and took whatever he used with him this is a freak said sakura milo said ci said most of the blood is pooled inside the body lets see what you pull up print and fiberwise then well talk about spraying flores said we pulled up one thing so far probably no big deal what a note in the bedroom we left it there after donning new gloves and foot coverings we followed flores in while sakura began fiddling with his kit vita berlins sleeping chamber was close dim spare with walls also painted apartmentbeige and linens of the same characterless hue double bed no headboard or footboard no personal touches the books milo had described were piled high on a white fiberboard nightstand the surface of a threedoor dresser was bare two more beehive lamps she hadnt indulged others or herself flores pointed to the foot of the bed where a rumpled scrap of white paper rested it was underneath i took a photo of it there then slid it out we kneeled read in neat script someone had written dr b shacker below that a number a diagonal line slashed the name at the bottom of the page a single word in larger darker caps quack flores said theres dust and maybe crumbs down there but nothing weird milo copied down the information thanks kenny bag it back on the landing he said might as well talk to this doctor half smiling maybe hes a surgeon he d got a listing bernhard shacker ph d north bedford drive beverly hills a colleague alex that makes it a bit more interesting no vita obviously had what you guys call issues maybe she decided to get some help tried out therapy changed her mind whats that phrase you use about screwedup folk resisting the most baloney afraid of the slicer but she got sliced anyway maybe shacker can educate us on her personality know him i shook my head bedford drive he said thats highticket couch row seems a little froufrou for someone who lived like vita did phoning shackers number he listened frowned clicked off recorded spiel he said i like your way better i still use an answering service because talking to human beings is at the core of my job you didnt leave a message didnt want to scare him off in case he gets all pissy about confidentiality also i figured maybe talking to him is something you could do one mindprober to another while were at it we can figure out transmigration of the soul wouldnt put it past you amigo so youll do it i smiled he said great lets check out that restaurant he left his unmarked at the crime scene and we drove west to robertson in my seville bijou a dining place was a brownbrick storefront set close enough to the freeway to harvest soot on its signage the brick was grimy too but a picture window sparkled the morning special was blueberry pancakes posted hours said breakfast and lunch only closed by three pm the restaurants interior said it was probably a venerable diner remodeled to look even older from the freshness of the green vinyl seating and the laminate tabletops patterned to look like formica a recent upgrade the kind of moviestar headshots you see in dry cleaners hung on the walls along with blackandwhite shots of prefreeway la an old man reading the wall street journal sat at the counter nursing coffee and a sweet roll three of seven booths were occupied up in front two young moms tried to chat while tending to bibbed squirming toddlers in booster chairs behind them a husky applefaced man in his thirties ate steak and eggs while penciling a puzzle book at the back a brownuniformed parcel driver small enough to be a jockey worked on a mountain of pancakes while grooving to his ipod both men looked up when we entered returned to their recreation the women were too busy with their kids to notice a waitress young blond shapely sleevetattooed had the shift to herself a shortorder cook with an incan face sweated behind the passthrough milo waited until the waitress had refilled wall streets coffee before approaching she said sit anywhere you like guys her badge chirped hedy milos badge ruined her smile the old man put his paper aside and eavesdropped hedy said let me get the owner milo said do you know vita berlin she eats here regularly kind of she said like two times a week the old man said whatd that one do now milo faced him she died hedy said omigod the old man unperturbed said how unnaturally what does that mean suicide accident a bushy white eyebrow compressed to the shape of a croquet wicket worse yeah probably worse if the constabularys bothering to show up hedy said oh sam the old man regarded her with pity milo turned to him you knew vita knew enough not to like her what happened to hershe mouthed off to the wrong guy and he hauled off and bopped her one hedy said omigod sam this is terrible can i go get ralph officers hes in back milo said ralphs the owner the old man said of this gourmet establishment sure hedy rushed toward the exit sign the old man said theyve got a thing going her and ralph milo said sam samuel lipschitz certified actuary said the old man blessedly retired he wore a burntorange cardigan over a white shirt buttoned to the neck gray hopsack slacks argyle socks cordovan laceups what was it about vita you didnt like mr lipschitz so youre verifying she was murdered raising his voice on the last word caused the young mothers to look over the driver and the puzzlesolver didnt react milo said that wouldnt surprise you yes and no said lipschitz yes because murders a lowfrequency event no because as i said she had a provocative personality whod she provoke anyone she felt like she was an equalopportunity harridan she was disruptive here shed come swaggering in like a man plop down in a booth and start glaring like she was just waiting for someone to do something that would give her the excuse to pull a snit everyone was wise to her so we ignored her shed sulk order her food eat sulk some more pay and leave lipschitz chuckled so she really pushed someone too far ay howd they do it whered they do it i cant get into that sir just tell me one thing was it around here i dont live in the neighborhood anymore moved to alhambra when i retired but i come back to this place because i like the pastries they get em from a danish baker all the way out in covina so if theres something i should worry about personalsecuritywise id appreciate your telling me im seventyfour would like to squeeze in a few more years from what weve seen sir theres nothing for you to worry about thats ambiguous to the point of being meaningless said lipschitz it wasnt a street crime it doesnt appear connected to gangs or a robbery when did it happen sometime last night i come here during the day i should be fine mr lipschitz is there anything else you can tell us about vita other than her being abrasive and antisocial i did hear about something but i didnt witness it firsthand a confrontation right here four five days ago i was in palm springs visiting my son missed my pastry and all the excitement who told you about it ralphhere he is let him tell you himself ralph veronese was no older than thirty tall and borderlineemaciated with long thick dark hair a rock stars cheekbones and slouchy stance he wore a black bowling shirt lowslung skinny jeans work boots a diamond stud in his left lobe one arm was brocaded in blue ink his hands were rough his voice soft he asked if we could speak outside and when milo assented voiced his thanks profusely and guided us through the cafe to a rear alley a red van occupied the single parking slot hedy just told me about vita i cant believe it you dont see anyone wanting to hurt her no its not that i mean im not saying someone would hurt her its just someone you know she was here a couple of days ago she was a regular two three times a week big fan of the food veronese didnt answer milo said something mustve drawn her here she could walk from her house thats what she told me once its not like youre a great chef i dont have to waste gas i said and hopefully we wont give you any she didnt laugh she never laughed cranky lady oh yeah mr lipschitz said shed had some kind of confrontation here a few days ago veronese rotated his earring im sure that had nothing to do with what happened to her whys that mr veronese mr veronese was my grandfather ralphs fine yeah vita had a tough personality but i just cant see anything that happened here being relevant tell us about the confrontation ralph he sighed there was no excuse for her behavior but i dont even know the peoples names it was the first time they were here what happened these people came in with their kid vita was already here reading the times that she always borrows from us and eating away how many people mom dad the kid was littlefour five im not good with ages veronese tugged at a forelock positioned it over his left eyebrow bald the kid skinny these humongous eyes like you see on those ads for starving kids he tapped the crook of one arm big bandage here like she got stuck with a shot it was a she a little girl i said sounds like a sick little girl exactly i figured cancer or something said veronese he sighed see something like that makes you want to cry i said vita didnt cry oh man his voice tightened i knew she was a pain in the ass but no way i figured something like that would happen if i had ida seated them far from her i seated them right next to her make it easy for hedy you know vita wasnt happy about that at first she didnt seem to notice them shes reading and eating everythings copacetic then the kid starts making noises not being annoying like a moan you know like shes hurting like something hurts the parents are leaning over whispering trying to comfort her i guess it goes on for a while the moaning then the kid quiets down then she moans again and vita puts down her paper gives her the eye you know angry angry with sharp eyes said veronese what do they call it dagger eyes like you can stab someone with them my grandmother used to say that dont be shooting me those dagger eyes you gonna draw my blood vitas doing that the dagger eyes right at the kid the parents arent noticing theyre concentrating on the kid finally she quiets down again hedy takes their order offers the kid a donut but the parents say the kids stomach cant take it vita mutters something the father looks over vita glares at him goes back behind her paper then the kid starts moaning again a little louder the father walks to the counter and asks me for some ice cream like hes figuring that might calm the kid down i say you bet and fix a double scoop he goes back tries to feed the kid the ice cream she tastes it but then shes not having it starts crying again all of a sudden vitas out of her booth like this he clamped a hand on each hip looking down at them like theyre evil then she says something then the kids father is up on his feet too and theyre going at each other going how arguing i couldnt hear what cause i had gone back to the kitchen same for hedy so all we heard was some kind of commotion i thought something had happened to the kid a medical emergency so i rush back and the father and vita are in each others faces and he looks ready tohes really pissed off but his wife grabs his arm holds him back vita says something that makes him pull his arm free he raises a fist just holds it there shaking all of him is shaking then he calms down swoops up the kid and they head for the door funny thing is now the kids calm like nothing ever happened another earringtug i rush out ask if theres something i can do i felt like shit a sick kid you know it wasnt her fault she didnt feel good father looks at me shakes his head they drive off i go back inside vitas back in her booth smiling says some people have no class i told them why would you people think the rest of the world wants to see your sick little brat ruin their appetite sick people belong in hospitals not restaurants milo said describe these people thirtyfive forty said veronese nicely dressed looking away i said something else black that you people part probably didnt go over well yeah said veronese that was evil did vita show other signs of racism nah she hated everyone he frowned wouldve loved to toss her but she sues people its all i can do to keep this place afloat last thing i need is to be sued whod she sue the place she used to work some kind of discrimination they paid her off thats how she lives who told you she did bragging milo said the people she had a todo with thirtyfive to forty well dressed and black what else they drove a mercedes not a big one small station wagon veronese scratched at his hairline silver i think im sure they had nothing to do with it whys that how would they know who she was where to find her maybe they knew her before didnt seem that way said veronese i mean they didnt use names or anything who else has vita had words with everyone leaves her alone big tipper huh you kidding oh yeah you are her top rates ten percent and for each thing that pisses her off she drops a percent and tells you hedy laughs about it only reason shes here is to do me a favor her main things singing she sings in a band i play bass behind her smiling i like looking at the back of her chapter we drove back to the crime scene the coroners van had taken the body sakura and flores were still busy at work scraping diluting bagging tagging lots of prints said sakura where youd expect them to be nothing on the doorknob thats wiped clean we got a few hairs off the towels gray consistent with hers we did find more blood on the towelstiny little specks tucked into the nap same for the carpet well cut out squares if he nicked himself operating on her you could get lucky milo said from your mouth to the evidence gods ears flores said the sink drains kind of tricky we are going to call in the plumber could take a couple of days whatever it takes guys anything else i dont want to tell you your business lieutenant but it was me id put in for a tox screen superstat you think she was doped this little resistance maybe the offender used something on herlike an anesthetic something that didnt need to be injected like chloroform or ether because we didnt find any needle marks but maybe she medicated herself and that made his job easy we found booze bottles under her bathroom sink when we were checking out the plumbing stashed at the back behind rolls of toilet paper reaching into an evidence bag he drew out two ml jack daniels bottles one sealed the other down a third i said no booze anywhere else nowhere sakura said big bottles she bought in bulk i said she lived alone but hid her habit living alone doesnt mean she drank alone said milo then why hide the booze he had no answer for that and it made him frown i said if she did have a drinking pal it was someone who wouldnt pry in the bathroom meaning no intimacy behind toilet papers not the first place anyone would look and if she was a solitary drinker why bother to conceal hiding a habit from herself i said someone who needed to think of herself as totally in control and righteous that didnt impress anyone flores said whats your take on the broken neck lieutenant some sort of karate move i should be checking out dojos asking if they have anyone likes also to cut people up and play with their guts he turned to the pizza box you guys ready to open it up sure said sakura we already dusted no prints or anything else didnt feel like there was any pizza in there or anything else pop it flores pried open the top empty but on the bottom surface of the box a piece of plain white paper had been scotchtaped margins precise just like the towels beneath the body in the center of the paper someone had computerprinted in a large boldfaced font milo flushed a deeper red than id ever seen a pulse in his neck raced for a moment i was worried about his health then he grinned and some of the color faded like a joke had just been played on him and he was determined to be a good sport he said whats this a fucking challenge fine game on you bastard to the techs print every damn surface of this look for spots where someone would be likely to screw up and leave a partial you dont find anything do it again you tell me theres nothing i want it to really be nothing flores said yes sir sakura said you bet milo walked me to my car keeping slightly ahead and making me feel i was being ushered away he leaned in when i started up the engine thanks for showing up im gonna be tied up with basics her bank her phone records finding next of kin im also gonna try for a facetoface with the two doctor neighbors i get lucky theyll turn out to be jack the ripper and his nefarious little jill meanwhile if you could try that shrinkshacker ill call him when i get home thanks what you said before the part about vita wanting to feel in control i agree with righteous im not so sure what kind of morally upright person unloads on a little sick kid i said righteous is a broad category she couldve seen herself as the guardian of all thats proper restaurants are for eating hospitals are for sick people disease is unappetizing stay away its a common feeling most people are a lot more subtle but youd be surprised how often sick people get stigmatized back when i worked in oncology families talked about it all the time he shook his head however she felt about herself she was a majorleague jerk and that means the suspect list just expanded to the entire goddamn universe i shifted into drive he said are there diseases other than cancer that can cause baldness a few i said but cancer would be my guess and if the kid had cancer theres a good chance shed be treated at your old turf western pediatric medical where id trained and worked and learned which questions to ask which to ignore i said its the best place in town hmm i said sorry no no what youre my pal but im not going snooping in the oncology files he poked his chest i would ask for such a thing now i know what you really think of me i think youre being your usual acedetective self his nostrils flared oh man we go too far back to spread the bullshit yeah id love for you to dig around you cant do it even discreetly theres no way to do it discreetly and even if there was i wouldnt want to be the one pointing a finger at a family thats had more than enough to cope with he exhaled yeah yeah im thinking like a hunter not a human being youre unlikely to be losing a lead big guy like veronese said no way for them to know who vita was and where she lived unless he said they live in the neighborhood and happened to spot her and were still pissed and decided to act they go back and carve her up i said thats one helluva grudge true but dealing with a high level of stress could kick up the frustration level right what if the poor little thing passed away shortly after the confrontation that would jam one helluva memory into mommy and daddys heads daddy stewed on it started eating himself up eating his guts out so to speak he spots vita maybe she even snots off again he decides towhatever you guys call itdisplace his anger thats what we call it and id seen plenty of it families railing against hospital food a misspoken phrase anything but the core issue because you can only deal with so much more than once id been called to ease a weapon away from a grieving father but nothing at the level of the savagery visited upon vita berlin and i said so milo said so if i wanna go there im on my own where im going is phoning dr shacker if he has an opening ill prioritize a meeting thanks no problem oh there are plenty of problems he said but theyre all mine chapter i drove home thinking about the horror tried to switch off the unthinkable channel the body floated back into my head switching on the radio i amped the volume to earbruise knowing that each thunderchunk of noise was ripping loose tiny hairs in my auditory canal but figuring a little hearing loss was worth it but stationsurfing fed me a bland stew of passionless jingly crap and nervescraping chatter that failed to do the trick so i pulled over popped the trunk took out a battered black vinyl case i hadnt touched in a long time audiocassettes to anyone under thirty as relevant as wax cylinders the seville has a different opinion shes a who rumbled out of detroit a few months before detroit turned her successors into bloatmobiles fifteen thousand miles on the third engine with an enhanced suspension regular oil and filter changes keep her appeased i retrofitted a cd player years ago a handsoff phone system recently but ive resisted an mp and kept the original tape deck in place because back when i was a grad student tapes were a major luxury and ive got lots of them purchased secondhand back when that mattered as i got back in the car the growling in my head grew thunderous ive seen a lot of bad things and i dont get that way often but im pretty sure where the noise comes from hiding from my father when he drank too much and decided someone needed to be punished blocking the bumpbump of my racing heart with imaginary white noise but now i couldnt turn it off and just as amphetamines quiet a hyperactive mind my consciousness craved something loud and dark and aggressively competitive thrash metal mightve been nice but id never bought any i flipped through tapes found something promising zz top eliminator i slipped the tape into the deck started up the car resumed the drive home covered a block and cranked the music louder minimalistic guitar truckengine drum and ominous synthesizer backup worked pretty well then i turned off sunset and got close to home and the peace and beauty of beverly glen the sinuous silence of the old bridal path leading up to my pretty white house the prospect of kissing my beautiful girlfriend patting my adorable dog feeding the pretty fish in my pond sparked a sly little voice nice life huh then malevolent laughter the house was empty and sunsuffused wood floors tomtommed as i trudged to my office and left a collegial message for dr bernhard shacker his soft reassuring recorded voice promised hed get back to me as soon as possible the kind of voice you believed i made coffee drank two cups without tasting went out back and tossed pellets to the koi and tried to appreciate their slurpy gratitude and continued on to the treeshrouded studio out back a sawbuzz sounded through an open window beautiful girlfriend was goggled and masked and brightened by skylights set into the high sloping ceiling as she eased a piece of rosewood through a band saw long auburn curls were bunched under a red bandanna her hands were coated with purplish dust adorable dog crouched a few feet away nibbling on one of the barbecuesaucecrusted bones girlfriend prepares for her with customary meticulousness girlfriend smiled kept her hands working dog waddled over and kissed my hand the saw rasped as it ate hardwood loud nasty good i sat with blanche on my lap until robin finished working rubbing a knobby little french bulldog head robin switched off the saw placed the guitarshaped slab on her worktable pushed up the goggles and lowered the mask she had on red overalls a black tshirt blackandwhite keds i placed blanche on the floor and she followed me to the bench robin and i hugged and kissed and she mussed my hair the way i like howd it go baby i touched the rosewood nice grain one of those days she said how much i talk about cases has always been an issue for us ive progressed from shutting her out completely to parceling the information i think she can handle sometimes it works in milos favor because robin is smart and able to bring in an outsiders perspective as if im an insider im not sure what i am i said definitely one of those she touched my face youre a little pale have you eaten bagel before want something now maybe later if you change your mind she said about food about anything sure i kissed her forehead she eyed the rosewood i guess i should get back to this i said dinner will probably work maybe a little on the late side sounds good if you get hungry sooner im flexible you bet she said as i turned to leave she touched my face her almond eyes were soft with compassion the bad days longterm planning doesnt work so well i returned to my office no callback from dr shacker i did some paperwork paid some bills got on the computer a search of disemboweling and murder pulled up a disquieting mountain of hits just under a hundred thousand nearly all were irrelevant resulting from the use of both words in complex sentences song lyrics by deservedly obscure bands political hyperbole by blogosimps whove never lived with anything worse than a paper cut the current administration is disemboweling civil liberties and committing premeditated murder on personal liberties with the bloody abandon of a serial killer the literal murders i found were mostly singlevictim crimes stalking outrages fueled by sexual fantasy or longsimmering resentment before building to a starburst of violence that led to mutilation and sometimes cannibalism the crimes were generally carried out carelessly and solves were quick in several cases floridly psychotic suspects turned themselves in in one instance an offender dropped a human liver on the desk of a police receptionist and begged to be arrested because hed done a bad thing the few open cases were of the historical variety most notably jack the ripper the scourge of whitechapel had engaged in abdominal mutilation and organ theft but differences outweighed any similarities to the meticulously organized degradation visited upon vita berlin vitas abrasive personality said this could very well be a oneoff i hoped to god it had nothing to do with the child shed humiliated i surfed a bit more trying abdominal mutilation visceral display intestinal wounds had gotten nowhere when my service called dr delaware its louise a dr shacker just called returning yours thanks hes one of you right a psychologist good guess louise actually its more than a guess dr delaware its intuition ive been doing this a long time we all sound alike actually you kind of do she said no offense i mean that in a good way you guys tend to be calm and patient surgeons dont sound like that anyway he seemed like a nice guy have a good day dr delaware a pleasant boyish voice said bern shacker alex delaware thanks for calling back no problem he said you said this was about vita does that mean youre the lucky guy treating her now im afraid no ones treating her oh shes been murdered my god what happened i gave him the basics he said thats dreadful absolutely dreadful murdered and youre calling me because because vita had labeled him a quack i said she had your card in her apartment did she her apartment im a littleyou said you were a psychologist why would you be in her apartment and why for that matter are you following up on a murder i consult to the police and the detective in charge asked me to call you one shrink to another shrink he said unfortunate term well i dont reallyi didnt exactly engage in longterm therapy with vitathis is a bit complicated i need to make a call or two before we go any further death and confidentiality i said the rules change every year true but its not only that said shacker vita wasnt a typical therapy patient im not trying to be mysterious but i cant say more until i get clearance if i do we can chat appreciate it dr shacker murder he said unbelievable where are you located the westside im in beverly hills if we do talk would you mind it being facetoface so i can document the conversation that would be fine ill get back to you fortythree minutes later he was true to his word alex this is bern the insurance attorneys have cleared me and so did my personal attorney ive got an opening at six does that work for you perfectly perfectly he echoed you sound like a positive person as if hed just uncovered a character flaw i try try said shacker is all we can do chapter shackers building was three stories of lime and brick in the midst of beverly hills business district glossy navy carpeting smothered footsteps walls were paneled in bleached oak a pharmacy calling itself a dispensing apothecarie and designed to look victorian took up a quarter of the ground floor the rest of the tenants were mds ddss a few other psychologists b shacker ph d suite his waiting room was tiny white and set up with three friendly chairs and a wallstack of magazines soft newage music played from somewhere a twobulb panel sat to the left of the inner door red for in session green for free red was illuminated but moments after i sat down it went dark the door opened an arm extended alex bern shacker the body attached to the arm was five six thin narrowshouldered the handshake offered was firm dry solid shacker looked around fifty a fineboned rosycheeked face was topped by thinning chestnut hair laced with silver and styled in a nottoobad combover prominent ears and a slightly crooked pug nose gave him an elfin look his eyes were soft hazel vaguely rueful he wore a gray vneck sweater over a black shirt charcoal slacks black loafers the sleeves of the sweater were pushed to his elbows black shirtcuffs overlapped the edges thanks for taking the time bern please come in the treatment room was painted pale aqua carpeted in a darker variant of the same hue dimmed by brown silk drapes shielding the window that looked out to bedford drive not a trace of street noise double or tripleglazed glass the requisite professional paper adorned the wall behind a modest walnut desk doctorate internship postdoc license the only thing mildly interesting was a ph d from the university of louvain in belgium shacker said my catholic days and smiled the wall to the left of the desk bore the auxiliary door that had allowed shackers patient to exit into the hallway without encountering me next to that hung a chromeframed cubist print of fruit and bread two scandinavian leather chairs sat in front of the desk facing each other shacker motioned me to one took the other he crossed a leg tugged his trousers up flashed argyle sock over the phone i mentioned insurance lawyers theyre the ones who sent vita to me therapy was part of a settlement three years ago she sued her employer the case dragged on finally the employers coverer was ready to settle but insisted upon a psych evaluation insurance work isnt my usual thing but id treated an individual with a connection to the insurerobviously i cant say moreand was asked to see vita i said what was the purpose of the evaluation to see if she was malingering she was claiming some sort of emotional damage supposedly shed been bullied at work and the company hadnt done enough to ensure a hostilityfree work environment what company are we talking about shacker recrossed his legs im sorry i cant give you that one condition of the settlement was a ban on discussion by both sides what i can tell you is that it was an insurance company health insurance to be exact vita worked for them as a screener she decided who got care and who didnt the company would call it managing the flow of treatment requests was she a nurse shed had two years of secretarial school and her employment history consisted of nonmedical clerical positions that qualified her to decide who got to talk to a doctor who got to talk to a nurse he said she was a prescreening screener its called diagnosisspecific utilization management and yes its atrocious vita described working at a huge phonebank claimed shed been provided scripts to read from certain conditions were to be ignored for others shed suggest an overthecounter remedy she was given a list of various callback protocolsa week for this a month for that acute conditions were to be referred to local emergency rooms serious diagnoses were put on hold as she pretended to search for the next available nurse i said telemarketing in reverse dont use our product shacker said this is what its come to what was different about vita was that she loved her job getting back at weaklings and fakers i said that didnt apply to her posttraumatic symptoms he smiled what can i tell you what kind of bullying are we talking about no physical intimidation just pranks and ridicule from some of her coworkers vita said she complained repeatedly to her supervisors but was ignored her suit was for five million dollars highpriced ridicule what were her symptoms difficulty concentrating insomnia appetite loss stomach problems aches and pains ambiguous things unlikely to show up on a medical exam but impossible to disprove since the alleged root cause was emotional trauma the health insurers casualty insurer wanted an official opinion as to her psychological status what did you tell them that her claims couldnt be validated or invalidated and that she came across as a hostile individual i didnt offer a diagnosis as it wasnt requested had i been asked i suppose i couldve dug around the dsm for something that fit but im not one of those therapists who feel bad behaviors a disease what was vitas bad behavior he folded his arms across his chest may i tell you something in utter confidence alex really i dont want this entered in any official record absolutely thank you he chewed his lip played with a sleeve vita was quite possibly the least pleasant person ive ever met i know were not supposed to judge but lets face it we do it didnt help that she had no motivation to cooperate and regarded our profession with obvious disdain most of our sessions consisted of her complaining that i was wasting her time that anyone with half a brain could see shed suffered grievous injury she just about came out and called me a quack now you tell me shes been murdered was there evidence of rage because i can see her inciting someones anger past the point of no return im also limited in what i can say bern i see all right then thats really all i can tell you could we go back to her lawsuit what kind of pranks and ridicule did she say shed experienced gluing her desk drawer shut hiding her headset making off with her snacks she claimed she overheard people referring to her as the mad cow and grumpy gertie claimed i said you think she was pouring it on i have no doubt she wasnt popular but all i had to go on was her selfreport the question in my mind was what role did her behavior play in provoking hostility but figuring that out wasnt my job i was asked to render an opinion about her faking and couldnt apparently that was enough because the settlement went through how much of the five million did she get i wasnt privy to details but the lawyer said it was considerably lessunder a million pretty nice payoff for having your drawers glued shacker stifled a laugh that pitched his spare frame forward as if hed been shoved from behind forgive me this is a terrible situation but what you just saidhaving her drawers glued im no freudian but thats some image no and you could certainly describe vita as being sealed up in every way no sex life nonexistent sex life and social life according to her she said she preferred it that way was that true or merely rationalization i dont know in fact i cant say anything about her with confidence because i never got to see her long enough to break through the resistance in the end it didnt matter she got what she wanted thats the world were living in alex genuinely sick people encounter the likes of vita who block their treatment and big moneys doled out for exaggerated claims because its cheaper to settle whats the name of the lawyer who represented her i asked for official documents but never got them had to work from a case summary provided by the casualty insurers why all the hushhush their position was i needed to be viewed as objective in case my conclusions were called into question the regretful look in his eyes deepened looking back sure i was used ill never repeat the experience what kind of personal information did vita give you not much taking a history was an ordeal he said i did get her to grudgingly admit to a difficult childhood but once again can we be sure vita didnt bring some of that upon herself cranky kid ive come to appreciate the importance of temperament were all dealt set hands the key is how we play them after observing vita berlin as a middleaged woman its hard to imagine her as a sweet cheerful child but i could be wrong perhaps something turned her sour was she ever married she admitted to an early marriage but refused to talk about it there was one sibling a sister they grew up near chicago vita moved to la ten years ago because she hated the weather in the midwest but she hated la too everyone was stupid superficial anything elseoh yes she never had children detested kids called them wastes of sperm and eggsher phrasing so how long have you worked for the police im not on payroll more of an independent contractor sounds interesting said shacker seeing the dark side and all that though im not sure i could handle it to tell the truth im really not that curious about horrible things all those terrible dyssynchronies me neither i lied its the solution thats gratifying my impression is that profiling has turned out to be quite a dud cookbooking never works could i ask you a few more questions about vita such as did she have friends or outside interests my impression is she was somewhat of a homebody did you pick up any signs of substance abuse no why the police found a couple of bulksized whiskey bottles in her apartment hidden did they well thats humbling alex i never caught that not that i could be expected to given her resistance he looked at his watch if theres nothing else how many sessions did she have a fewsix seven do you have her chart here the insurance company took possession of all records his desk phone rang he went over and picked it up dr shacker oh hi well i could squeeze you in today if that would work yes of course its my pleasure well go over all of that once youre here hanging up he said theres one more thing alex i probably shouldnt be telling you but i will she mentioned the name of one of the people whod harassed her samantha no last name might that help it might thanks no problem now back to doing what we were trained for eh nice to meet you alex chapter walking to the seville i thought about the question mark in the pizza box an old case id forgotten milo had assumed a taunt but maybe a question really had been posed i called his office he said you get an appointment with that shrink just finished meeting with him i summed up posttraumatic hoohah and a bully named samantha its a start thank you doctor unfortunately shackers bound by a confidentiality clause couldnt tell me what company vita worked for he said wellstart health management and assurance your wellbeing is where we start oh found some of her papers tucked in a kitchen cabinet including five years of tax returns she spent two of them at wellstart did temp office jobs before that averaged around thirty g a year last year she deposited five hundred eightythree g in a brokerage account which threw me but now it makes sense a fat onetime settlement the moneys been sitting in preferred stock paying around six percent interest a little over thirtythree g a year so she was getting paid more not to work i said it sounds like a job she couldve enjoyed he said the chance to torment people every day fits what we know about her im gonna try and find this samantha work my way through everyone vita accused of harassing her meanwhile reed and binchy are visiting every damn pizza joint in a tenmile radius see if they can find someone who uses those boxes i put in a call to the manufacturer maybe they ship to private parties as well and ill get lucky and theyll find some weirdo put in an order any other insights that question mark i said im not sure it was a taunt what then maybe our bad guy was referring to himself im curious about what the mysteries of the human body a doityourself anatomy lesson seemed more to me like abusing the victim could be you really see this as mining for gore the way everything was ordered the meticulous cleanup reminded me of a patient i saw years ago when i was a postdoc tenyearold boy extremely bright polite well behaved no problems at all other than some pretty freaky cruelty to animals sadistic psychopaths often start by torturing small critters but this kid didnt seem to derive any pleasure from dominance or inflicting pain hed capture mice and squirrels in humane traps hold gasolinesoaked rags over their noses till they died make sure never to bruise them i hold them just hard enough he told me i never hurt them that would be wrong their death throes bothered him he shuddered when i asked him about it but he viewed his hobby as a legitimate science experiment he dissected meticulously removed every organ studied sketched both parents worked fulltime had no idea his babysitter found him conducting surgery behind the garage and freaked out as did mom and dad the adult reactions frightened him and he refused to talk about anything hed done so they sent him to langley porter and i got the case eventually i got him to talk but it took months he really didnt understand what the fuss was about hed been taught that curiosity was a good thing and he was curious about what made animals work dad was a physicist mom a microbiologist science was the family religion how was he any different from them the truth was both parents had odd personalitieswhat would now be called asperger spectrumand kevin really wasnt much different whatd you do with him i arranged for anatomy lessons from one of the pathology fellows had his parents buy him books on the subject and got him to pledge to limit his interest to reading he agreed reluctantly but let me know that once he was old enough to take biology with a lab hed be doing the same exact thing and everyone would think he was smart maybe we should find out what happened to this little genius what happened to him is when he was seventeen he went hiking in the sierras looking for specimens fell off a cliff and died his mother thought i deserved to know because i was one of the few people kevin talked about with any positivity so maybe ive got myself a kevinoid who never got help a grownup kevinoid still stuck in a childhood that could range from eccentric to highly disordered the urges are durable and now hes got the maturity and the physical strength to pull off a grand expedition the precision i saw suggests hes done it before but i havent been able to find anything similar so maybe up until this point hes adopted the optimal strategy hide or get rid of the body why switch to showandtell with vita hes bored needs a bigger thrill or the killing had to do with vita specifically if you can find the exhusband or the sister they might shed some light on it he said sure but first lets see what mean ol samantha has to say for herself armed with the fact that vita had worked for wellstart finding her tormentor was easy during the time it took robin to shower i pulled up several photos on the companys employee website including a group shot from last years quality control department christmas party twentytwo unremarkable human beings who got paid to make life difficult for sick people not a set of horns in sight no evidence of guilt eroding holiday spirit samantha pelleter was chairperson of the celebration committee and she appeared in three photos short pudgy fortyish blond milewide grin being elected or appointed chairperson implied she had leadership qualities and that wasnt at odds with her playing a dominant role in any harassment but no way was she big enough to overpower a woman as substantial as vita leadership could also mean subordinates i called milo again he said just found her myself meeting her tomorrow at eleven im assuming you dont want to miss the fun wheres it happening her place shes on reduced hours due to budget issues sounded scared witless about being contacted by the police but didnt put up a fuss as to her curiosity level well see meanwhile mines spiking out of control chapter he picked me up the following morning got your earplugs she lives right near the airport im talking flightpath hell this is probably why he handed me two sheets of paper the first contained samantha pelleters credit report two bankruptcies in the last ten years a foreclosed house in san fernando a slew of confiscated credit cards the second page bore his handwritten notes pelleter had no criminal record owned no property county records pulled up a divorce six months prior to losing her home her titles a mouthful he said qualification consultant looks like that and chairing the company party supplied more ego dollars than the real stuff this is a lady on the downslide and im wondering if thats related to some sort of serious mental problem i found a picture of her shes small i know got her stats so shes got a large friend maybe someone else at wellstart who vita accused a revenge killing talk about a classic motive maybe you dont think so dont know enough to think he laughed like the engine ever stops running samantha pelleter lived in a twostory blockwide apartment building within walking distance of sepulveda boulevard aging stucco was the color of freezerburned chicken incoming planes descended at angles that seemed too acute casting terrible shadows turning conversation moot the air smelled of jet fuel not a tree in sight pelleter lived in a groundfloor flat on the west end of the complex the halfsecond lapse between buzzerpush and open door said shed been waiting for us from the look in her eyes and a freshly gnawed thumbnail not a relaxed wait milo introduced himself she said sure sure come in please the apartment was small dim generically furnished not dissimilar to vita berlins place the woman vita had accused of masterminding harassment was a shrunken figure with a quavering voice and the slumpedshouldered resignation of a child waiting to be slapped watery eyes were blue and so was her expression blond had mostly ceded to gray her haircut was short ragged probably a doityourself she fooled with the hem of a faded red sweatshirt a misshapen glass pendant hanging from a thin black cord was her sole adornment the glass was chipped at one end brushing off the seats of the folding chairs she offered us she hustled to a cluttered kitchenette returned with a plastic tray bearing a pitcher two cups a jar of instant coffee a pair of tea bags loose packets of sugar and sweetener hot water she said so you guys can have coffee or tea whatever alls i have is decaf sorry thanks ms pelleter said milo but he didnt touch anything on the tray and neither did i she said oh i forgot the cookies and turned back milo placed a gentle hand atop her forearm that was enough to freeze her in place the blue eyes turned huge not necessary ms pelleter but thanks again now please sit down so we can chat she tugged an index finger as if trying to remove a nonexistent ring complied chat about vita i dont get it all that happened last year it was supposed to be over the lawsuit not allowed to talk about it sorry i said mustve been an ordeal not for her she got rich the rest of usno no i cant talk about it her accusations were false totally totally totally i never did anything to her what about other people at wellstart itheyvita was the mostim sorry im not allowed to discuss it im really not i said from what weve heard vita had trouble getting along with everyone aint that the freakin truth said samantha pelleter blushing pardon my language but she makes me so frustrated makes you youre still in contact huh oh no no way i havent seen her since and i really cant talk about it the lawyers said anyone who stepped out of line was finished it had already cost the company she placed a finger over her lips i dont know whats wrong with me i keep going back to it it upset you i said yes but im sorry i cant i need my job i need it bad as is they cut us back to twentyfive hours a week so please im sorry if you wasted your time but i cant i said how about we talk about vita apart from the lawsuit i dont know anything about vita apart from the lawsuit whats going on anyway is she claiming something else not happy with what she got thats crazy shes the only one who came out ahead was anyone fired because of her samantha pelleter shook her head the company didnt want more lawsuits but none of us got bonuses meanwhile vitas rich bitch she said i still dont get what this is about i turned to milo he said vitas gotten herself in trouble oh said samantha pelleter oh wow new improved brand of smile she went into the kitchenette returned with a box of oreos picked one out of the box and nibbled youre saying she tried to con someone else with false accusations and got caught you want me to say she was a con id love to help you guys but i cant she was a bigtime liar huh you have no idea what else did she lie about besides the lawsuit we have scripts are supposed to stick to them did that matter to vita not a chance she improvised oh boy did she like with a flutype thing were supposed to start by having them list all their symptoms we take our time so if its not serious just their talking about it will show them its no big deal and theyll change their mind about wanting an appointment if they dont we suggest overthecounter meds and drinking fluids because lets face it thats enough in most cases if they get stubborn or call back we ask if theyve got a fever and if they dont we tell them theyre probably getting better time will heal but if they really need an appointment weve got one but its during working hours after theyve been cleared by the nurse if they want to pursue that we put them on the nurses callback list its a system you know vita wasnt satisfied with that vita would throw in her own stuff give them advice like try getting your mind off your problems concentrate on something else stress is the cause of most symptoms take a look at yours once i actually heard her tell someone to suck it up colds were no big deal that kind of thing i said howd people react she said they didnt like it sometimes vita would just hang up on them before they could complain sometimes shed stay on the line and let them complain holding the phone like this stretching her arm away from her ear you know you could hear noise coming out of the phone like chirp chirp chirp vita just smiled and let them go on enjoying herself shes one of the meanest people i ever met did policyholders complain about her im sure they tried but it would be tough we never give our names out and our extensions are switched all the time so no one gets the same consultant twice high level of customer service i said its to keep costs down she said so really sick people can get care you saw vita improvise meaning you sat near her right next to her if i was smart id have kept my darn mouth shut but it bothered me doing her own thing so i said something to her whatd you say you know vita you really shouldnt leave the script she winced i said she didnt take that well actually she ignored me like i wasnt even theretalk to the hand but a few days later she looked real mad so she mustve found out found out what pelleter looked to the side i was stupid because i cared you talked to someone else not a supervisor just one of the other consultants and they mustve snitched because vita got called in to a supervisor and when she got back to her cubicle she had a crazy look in her eyes boiling mad nothing happened until after the first break but then all of a sudden shes all over me claiming ima bunch of usare bullies weve never treated her like a human being are out to persecute her howd you react to that i didnt do anything i was so freaked out but no i cant talk about it please no more questions milo leaned in close samantha i promise you nothing you say will get back to the lawyers how can i be sure i never really snitched on vita but she thought i did and thats what started the whole thing he edged within an inch of her knees we know how to keep a secret samantha whatever so what kind of con did she try this time i know you didnt harass her samantha but did she have any particular problems with another consultant no one likes her what goes around comes around any special bad karma with someone else at work everyone avoided her she said but no one bullied her no one whatd she do that youre so interested nothing nothing you said she was in trouble she is samantha the worst kind of trouble i dont understand shes dead samantha huh what how someone killed her whatre you saying thats crazy milo didnt reply she made a run for the kitchenette stared at the fridge returned wringing her hands killed oh my god oh my god oh my god killed really someone killed her who when who we dont know when was the night before last samantha so then why are youoh no no god no not that you cant believe id everno it wasnt like that i mean i dontdidnt like her but that no no no no no no uhuh no were talking to everyone in vitas past im not in her past please i cant stand this sorry to upset you samantha i am upset im totally upset that you would think that that you would please sit back down samantha so we can clear this up quickly and be out of your way he motioned toward the chair shed vacated she stared sank down i really cant take any more stress im like at the end of mymy freakin husband cheated on me with who was supposed to be my freakin friend then he left me with a pile of debt i didnt even know about that lost me my house and screwed up my credit do you know what i used to have a threebedroom house in tujunga i used to have a horse i rode out in shadow hills i used to have a jeep wagoneer now youre coming here and thinking terrible things about me and if you go to the company and say those things i wont even have my job milo said no one suspects you samantha this is routine which is why i need to ask youeven though its a crazy questionwhere were you the night before last where was i i was here i dont go anywhere it takes money to go anywhere i watched tv i used to have a fiftyinch flatscreen now i have a little computer screen in my bedroom everythings tiny my whole freakin worlds tiny covering her mouth with her hands she wept maybe the closest to mourning vita berlin would merit milo fetched her water and when she stopped crying eased the glass toward her lips while resting a big paw on her forearm she drank wiped her eyes thank you thank you for putting up with us samantha now please give us the names of the other people vita claimed had harassed her i expected resistance but samantha pelleters mouth set crookedly this smile was hard to characterize you bet she said ill write you out a list time to look out for myself i dont care about anyone elses issues from a kitchenette drawer she retrieved a scrap of paper and a pen writing quickly she presented the list to milo as if it were a school project cleve dawkins andrew montoya candace baumgartner zane banion appreciate it samantha are any of these people unusually strong sure she said zane is big and strong hes fat but he used to play football and andrews into fitness he bikes to work says if people took care of themselves they wouldnt get sick in the first place what about cleve and candace theyre regular they stick to the script we all do she said thats the point milo drove north on sepulveda little miss sealed lips but get her feeling threatened and she rats out her work buddies any alarm bells go off as a psychologist her fragility bothers me as your lackey i dont see her as a serious suspect lackey and here i was thinking sage or pundit well i said once upon a time there was a particularly obnoxious rooster who wouldnt stop hassling the hens in the barnyard finally the farmer was forced to take action he castrated the rooster and turned him into a pundit he laughed sage then unless youve got a story about that once upon a time there was an obnoxious rooster fine form anyway i agree if anyone lacks the nerve the physical ability and the smarts to do what was done to vita its ol samantha but maybe one of the other jokers at wellstart will turn out to be more interesting he called moe reed passed the four names along ordered background checks reed said will do i had no luck with the pizza box so far but seans still out there you got a call from the coroners labs are back on berlin too quick for a tox guess they prioritized loo im talking scientifically moses yeah i guess thats true said reed okay ill run these jokers through get back to you if i learn anything clicking off milo punched in a preset number dr clarice jernigan said hi there labs are back so soon who told you that that was the message i got wonderful said jernigan new secretary she watches too much tv likes to throw the jargon around no sorry to get your hopes up milo full labs will take weeks but i was calling about your victims blood alcohol and with that you might not need the tox she pulled a level of more than thrice the legal limit even being the serious alcoholic her liver says she was shed have been pretty vulnerable so thered be no need to use anything else to subdue her drunk he said as the perennial blackandwhitestriped mammal her liver he said youve done the autopsy not yet but i was able to do a visual on a few organs courtesy of your killer once we got rid of all the congealed blood which by my estimate was nearly all she started out with meaning your offender was meticulous barely spilled a drop someone with medical training i cant exclude it but no you wouldnt need anything close to that level of skill what would you need the strength and confidence to perform two major incisions with a really sharp blade and a strong enough stomach to snip the intestines free a butcher could do it a deer hunter could do it so could anyone with a warped mind and the wrong kind of knowledge which you can get off the internet if so inclined in any event i didnt need to dissect the liver to know it was seriously cirrhotic most of the darn thing was fatty and gray not a pretty thing to behold but as i said even with her being a lush a couldve seriously affected her judgment reaction time coordination and strength a cinch to overpower ask dr delaware next time you speak to him he can probably give you some behavioral parameters i said im here clarice oh hi you concur completely great she said its nice when theres peace in the valley milo ill do my best to get the autopsy done by tomorrow ill be traveling so one of my people will do the actual cutting but ill keep an eye on it thanks that said dont be expecting any profound conclusions she died from a broken neck was well dead before he cut her up how long is well dead enough time for the blood to settle which is minutes not hours im picturing your creep sitting there waiting that was a big part of his fun what do you think alex makes sense oh if my teenagers could hear this mommys not always wrong bye guys chapter for three days i heard nothing from milo on the fourth morning he came to the house vinyl attache in hand wearing a black poly suit with lapels from two decades ago and a pumpkinorange tie and muttering yeah yeah happy halloween he flicked a pocket flap that buttoned vintage live long enough everything comes back hard to read his emotions he cruised past me into the kitchen did his usual surveillance robin and i had been going out to dinner regularly so the fridge was light on leftovers he made do with beer bread mayo hot sauce barbecue sauce steak sauce mustard ground horseradish sauce and three longforgotten lamb sausages yanked from the back of the freezer that he microwaved into submission after several gulps of haphazard sandwich he took a long swig of grolsch good morning boys and girls can you spell futility another long swallow of beer no one local uses that type of pizza box and all the alleged wellstart bullies have alibis none of them looked good anyway the female is pushing sixty was babysitting her grandkid the physical fitness guy was on a nighttime mountain bike ride in griffith park vouched for by members of his cycling club the supposedly big strong guy is big but not strongclose to four hundred and uses a cane and an inhaler and the night of the murder he was at his grandmothers birthday party verified by the waiter who served his table the last guy wears cokebottle glasses and weighs in at maybe a hundred twenty and he was at the er with one of his kids some sort of allergic reaction to shrimp the nurse and the oncall resident say neither he nor his wife ever left the kids side and she was hospitalized overnight he swigged put the bottle down i resisted the temptation to ask if daddy had prescreened the kid so she could get treated they all claimed to be blindsided by the lawsuit refused to talk about details i tried to reach someone at wellstarts corporate headquarters big surprise they stonewalled i put sean on it cause hes got a high tolerance for failure and boredom and dealing with robotic turdbrains he constructed another teetering sandwich polished it off autopsy results came in early this morning like clarice said no surprises he ripped a slice of bread in half balled it up consumed wheres robin working out back must be nice to be productive i located vitas sister using phone records had to go back nearly a month to find an illinois number so were not talking regular contact the sisterpatricias her namelives in evanston and the call was her phoning vita on her birthday which she made sure to tell me vita would never do for her was that after she found out vita was dead or before after not exactly sentimental i said howd she react to the news she was shocked but it wore off and she got pretty dispassionate analytic like hmm who would do something so terrible and she had a quick answer if i was a betting woman id say jay he despised vita the exhusband bingo thats why everyone calls you doctor and bows and scrapes when you enter a room jay is one jackson j sloat he and vita divorced fifteen years ago but patricia said the financial battle went on long after turns out hes got a record with some violence in it lives here in la los feliz which is at most a fortyminute drive to vitas place i said they hated each other got divorced but moved to the same city funny about that huh so maybe its one of those obsessive lovehate things a dropin on ol jay is clearly the next step but if he is our bad guy he could be smart and manipulative and as the ex he could be expecting us so i figured id tap your ample brain for strategy when were you planning on talking to him soon as you finish opining he works in brentwood hopefully hes there or home what does he do for a living salesman at a highend clothing store he retrieved his notepad from the attache domenico valli i said thats why you got spiffed up just the opposite he rubbed a lapel ended up with brittle threads on his fingertips i come in like this hell feel superior maybe let his guard down i laughed what kind of record does sloat have some lightweight vehicular stuffoperating without a license the requisite duis every selfrespecting marginal character needs for selfvalidation the serious stuff is two ag assaults one with a crowbar who was the victim guy at a drinking establishment he and sloat had words sloat followed him outside sloat brained him but also received some fairly serious injuries that enabled him to claim selfdefense and maybe there was something to it because charges were dropped the other case was similar but it happened inside a bar that time sloat used his fists he got pled down received ninety days at county served twentysix enough violence to be worrisome i said two incidents in bars could mean hes got a drinking problemmaybe what he and vita had in common more important hed be familiar with vitas drinking habits know she was a nighttime boozer would be vulnerable and if there was a lovehate relationship he couldve wheedled his way into the apartment arrives with what looks like a pizza he said hi honey i miss you remember how we used to share an extralarge pepperoni with sausage he rolled the beer bottle between his hands everything we know about vita said she was distrustful maybe borderlineparanoid you think shed fall for that with the help of jack daniels and oldtimessake i said maybe real old times my phone subpoena covered eighteen months of her records and his numbers not on it what about a different type of contact i said vita used the court system at least once and got rewarded shes still dragging him to court yeah that might kick up the anger level he called deputy da john nguyen asked for a quick scan of any legal proceedings between vita gertrude berlin and jackson junius sloat nguyen said a quick one i can do for the last five years thatll work john hold on nope nothing here berlins your nasty one right hows that going nothing profound theres been talk in the office all that weirdness could be the first installment of a whacko serial thought you were my friend john im not wishing it on you just repeating what i heard and the leak didnt start with us are there any looserlipped dudes than cops wish i could argue with that said milo anything else i should know about some of our guys are hoping it will go serial so they can jockey to take it and careerbuild but if you want it youll get it nguyen laughed with bob ivey retiring i really am the senior junior dude meaning even if the boss takes it officially im doing the real work so keep me posted long as you pray for me john little offering to buddhas fine im an atheist ill take whatever i can get chapter while he ate and washed the dishes i gave him my best guesses about how to approach jay sloat keep it nonthreatening preface the news of vitas murder by emphasizing that sloat was not a suspect just someone milo was turning to for valuable information however sloat reacted verbally his body language would be the thing to watch criminal psychopaths operate with lower anxiety levels than the rest of us but its a myth that they lack emotion the smartest coldest antisocials avoid violence completely because violence is a stupid strategy look for their smiling faces on election posters but those a notch lower on the iq scale often need to prep before indulging their urges with alcohol or dope or by chanting internal rage mantras that provide selfjustification so if jay sloat was anything but the coldest of killers and had carved up his ex simply bringing up the topic could result in some sort of physical tell sudden rise in neck pulse constricted pupils muscular tension the merest hint of moisture around the hairline an increase in blink rate milo said im the polygraph i said isnt that what you do anyway what if sloat doesnt respond then that tells us something about him nothing he didnt already know but he seemed more relaxed as he drove to brentwood maybe it was the sandwiches domenico valli mens couture was located on th street just south of san vicente directly across from the brentwood country mart bordered by a restaurant run by the latest celebrity chef and another clothing store that hawked fourfigure outfits for trustfund toddlers the haberdashery was paneled in violingrain maple and floored in skinnyplank black oak subdued techno pulsed from the sound system light was courtesy of stainlesssteel gallery tracks the goods were sparingly displayed like works of art a few suits a smattering of sport coats small steel tables that wouldve felt comfortable in the morgue stocked like altars with offerings of cashmere and brocade a wall rack featured gleaming handmade shoes and boots black velvet slippers with gold crests on the toes no shoppers were availing themselves of all that chic a man sat behind a steel desk doing paperwork big fiftyish with broad shoulders he had a long sunlamped face defined by a wide meaty nose a steelgray caesardo tried but failed to cover a receding hairline a bushy white soul patch sprouted under hyphen lips bristly and stiff as icicles he looked up help you guys were looking for jay sloat his eyes narrowed and he stood and stepped around the desk just a touch under milos six three and nearly as bulky he wore a faded untucked blue chambray shirt with pearl buttons stovepipe black jeans gray suede needletoe boots a diamond in his left earlobe lots of muscle but also some middleaged padding dont bother telling me youre obviously cops i havent done anything so what gives broad faintly slavic midwestern intonation lieutenant sturgis mr sloat milo extended his hand sloat studied it for a second endured a brief clasp before retrieving his big paw okay now were all bffs could you please tell me whats going on sorry if this is upsetting you mr sloat its certainly not our intention its not upsetting me said sloat i mean im not worried personally because i know i havent done anything i just dont get why the cops are here when im trying to work he frowned oh man dont tell me its something to do with george if it is i cant help you i just work for the guy milo didnt answer jay sloat pressed his palms together prayerfully tell me it aint so guys okay i need this job it aint so george is the owner sloat relaxed exhaled so its not about that excellent okay then whats up milo repeated the question sloat said yeah hes the owner george hassan hes really an okay guy why would we be looking for him no reason no reason but hes the first one you thought of sloats brown eyes turned piggishly small as they studied milo then me then milo again george is going through a complicated divorce and she keeps claiming hes holding back on her shes threatening to close down the business if he doesnt open the books last week she sent around a private investigator pretending to be a customer dudes dressed like a dork starts asking me if i have more of these nice worsted suits in the back worsted what a doofus i said hey dan tana if you actually want to try something on lets do it if this is a game go play it elsewhere guy turned white and got the fuck out sloat grinned and winked his bronzed face was smoother than when wed entered recounting his dominance put him back in his comfort zone milo said i hear you well this has nothing to do with george what then its about your exwife sloats jaw muscles swelled his pupils expanded vita what about her shes dead dead said sloat as in police dead oh man what happened someone murdered her yeah i got that i mean who how when milo ticked his fingers dont know nasty five nights ago sloat stroked his soul patch woho he said in a soft almost boyish voice someone finally did the bitch we didnt respond he said i need a cigarette lets go outside milo said lets grabbing a pack of wheatcolored nat shermans from the steel desk jay sloat led us out of the store to the curb where he positioned himself in front of the display window and lit up with a goldplated lighter cant smoke inside george doesnt want odor on the merchandise milo waited until hed puffed a third of the cigarette before speaking someone did the bitch so for you its not bad news me and vita broke up a long time ago fifteen years ago milo cited the date of the final decree the detail caused sloat to recoil what you guys are looking into my past weve researched vita mr sloat your name came up so you know about my arrests we do then you also know they were bullshit dorks asking for trouble and getting it neither of us argued sloat said i watch those shows i get it im the ex you think i did it what shows crimetrue crap puts me to sleep at night sloat grinned when i dont have help getting some nightynight you get help often get pussy as often as i can good for the complexion he laughed got it every night last week including five nights ago from who a chick who rode me like a rodeo horse and righteously blew my mind how about a name how about shes married were discreet jay yeah i bet on those shows cops make promises and break them and anyway why do i need an alibi like you said it was fifteen years ago whatever vita did since then was out of my life fifteen years ago was the divorce said milo our research says the war kept going okay said sloat so she kept jerking me around for another few but then it ended i havent seen vita in a long time how long is another few jay lets see last time the bitch took me to court was id have to say six maybe seven years ago that matched nguyens failing to come up with anything for five whatd she want what do you think more money she get it she got some said sloat its not like i had that much to give whens the last time you actually saw her right after maybe a month she jerks me around in court then has the nerve to drop in middle of the night what for what do you think you go to jay you want to play milo said she sues you then does a bootycall she was crazy said sloat also old habits die hard he puffed out his chest im a tough habit to break he laughed smoked greedily dry hairline steady hands steady lips i said youre a tough habit to break but for six seven years vita managed sloats face darkened she didnt end it i did that time she dropped over i wouldnt let her in told her she ever did that again id get a restraining order and sue her ass so fast she wouldnt know what was reaming her she knew i meant it im not a guy takes bullshit like those guys in the bar you got it said sloat and i aint embarrassed about it back in chicago i used to work dispatch for a trucking company they fucked me over giving the good shifts to some loser who bribed the supervisor wanting me to work night shift even though id been there ten years i sued and won another time one of our darkskinned brothers dented my car i had this little benz convertible gray on gray sweet drive this dusky fellow isnt looking where hes going pow everyone said dont hassle those types never have insurance its a lost cause i said screw that sued his ass my lawyer found out his mother owned a house had given the dude a share we attached mommys house moved to evict her he paid up you like the court system what i like is protecting my rights which i know i got right now in terms of talking to you guys i dont have to say squat but its cool you dont bother me i had nothing to do with vita getting killed trust me the way vita was shed have no trouble arranging it all by herself you think she organized her own murder no no what im saying is vita was the biggest bitch this side of i dont know cruella whatshername from the cartoon thered be tons of people she pissed off all vita had to do was go on being vita eventually someone was gonna get pissed off any suggestions as to who nah vita was out of my life i dont have a clue who she was hanging with think back i said when you were still seeing her did she have any enemies enemies said sloat walk down the street and pick people at random to know her was to hate the bitch you married her when i married her i dug her then i hated her she was different back then nope said sloat only i thought she was she conned me you know being nice i said nah vita was never nice but she hid what a bitch she was by being quiet about it you know how by being cold superfrosty shed give you this look this imabitchbutillstillsuckyourcock look and she did there was a time she had talent still looked pretty good tall and cold with sharp edges i used to call her miss everest then she stopped faking it why bother when you can be a total bitch the attraction wore off i was attracted to her tits said sloat she had a nice face too she took care of herself plucking the eyebrows wearing the makeup doing the platinumblond hair like that actress novak kim novak people old enough to remember said she looked like kim novak i went to see vertigo novak was a helluva lot hotter give me ten vitas for one kim novak youll still owe me change but vita was cute ill grant her that good where it counted also that part she kept up even after we broke up ill grant her that sexy i said sexy is a chick hungry to do you vita was in the mood shed pop you quick problem is she got old and fat stopped dyeing the hair stopped taking care of herself the drinking got worse sticking out his tongue her breath stunk she was a mess so even if she wanted to jump your bones you didnt want those bones jumped finally i said no more lifes too short you know milo said we sure do bet you do said sloat listen im not going to stand here and lie and tell you i give a shit when i dont vita tried to take everything i owned including the benz i went to all that trouble to get fixed including half any money i made until i went totally broke and stopped working long enough to convince her i wasnt worth going after i havent seen her in like i said seven years but at the back of my head is always this thought shes going to come back like those guys in the horror moviesthe dude in the leather mask so its obvious i didnt kill her why would i ruin my life for her i said one thing you had in common vita also liked using the court system just against me she never sued anyone else nah said sloat she was a wimp like when i went after that black guy shes yelling at me what if hes a gang member the car isnt worth it which didnt stop her from going after it years later same thing with suing the trucking company dont do it jay they could be mafia its not worth it i said to you its not worth it to me it is rights are rights thats why we fight wars milo said you were in the service my dad was three years in europe so can i go back to work still no anxiety tell milo said what youre saying makes sense jay on the other hand you hated her youre clearly not upset shes dead and you wont back up your alibi i can back it up but i dont want to why sloat looked over his shoulder through the glass at the interior of the store milo said dont worry no customers i know that theres never any i said the cowgirl has something to do with the shop rapid constriction of pupil a carotid pulse sprang into action milo saw it give us a name jay or were going to develop a chronic interest in menswear sloat blew out acrid tobaccoair aw man milo said were talking murder jay i know i knowokay but swear to keep it secret we dont swear jay we dont even promise but unless theres some reason to go public we wont what kind of reason i didnt kill vita then youll have no problem jay sloat sucked down half an inch of cigarette okay okay its nina nina hassan georges ex he finds out hell fire my ass and roast my balls on one of those shishkebab thingies milo pulled out his pad whats her number you have to write it down phone number jay you actually have to call her milo stared him down sloat gave up the number just dont say what i

his plans i said how long were you and vita married six years no kids we didnt want both of us not into kids kids are a pain said sloat so whenre you seeing nina milo said when were ready shell clear me shell impress you shes a very impressive girl bye jay jay sloat said you absolutely need to talk to her we walked away from him milo looked up nina hassans address found it on the western edge of bel air a short drive away vita and jay he said heading east on sunset thank god those two didnt breed so what do you think of him i said unless hes oscarcaliber i dont see it me neither half a mile later screw those da ghouls this isnt going serial its gonna be one of those wrongtime wrongplace things vita finally ticked off the wrong guy speaking of which i did sic reed on western peds see if he could come up with any oncology parents with bad tempers specifically black parents youre telling me this because im telling you in the spirit of openness i said do what you need to do no one would tell him anything good i figured youd say that chapter nina hassans house in the bel air hills was sleek contemporary gorgeous just like her she eased open one of the twin brushedcopper double doors regarded us as if we were salesmen late thirties with velvety skin a tad darker than the doors she sported a mauve top that revealed an inch of hard belly a pair of sprayedon white jeans silver sandals that revealed pampered lavendernailed feet her face was heartshaped topped by a cloud of black waves and curls a full nose was graced by a cute little upward sweep at the tip probably surgical but well done massive white hoops hung from seashell ears a long smooth neck swooped to a pair of highend collarbones milo flashed the badge yes and her eyes were a uniform black defying analysis of her pupils wed like to talk to you about jay sloat him hes not okay as if inquiring about the weather why wouldnt he be okay my husband said nina hassan hes not human hes an animal jays fine may we

these are what we call routine questions nina she said i dont like maam too old too maamish a maserati coupe purred past the house the woman behind the wheel slowed to study us thin blond steely as the car nina hassan waved gaily milo said its better if we talk inside hassans turn to study us how do i know youre really the police would you like another look at my anyone can make a badge who else would we be scumbags hired by george george is your ex my scumbag ex hes always sending them around trying to find something he can use against me i sleep with jay so what george sleeps with young girlsmaybe you should investigate him he says theyre twenty maybe theyre younger she tapped a foot what am i supposed to do sit around like his mother and have no fun and tell stories from the old country milo said sounds like good riddance nina but were investigating a murder so if you can remember the last time you were with jay that would be helpful exwife she said liarwas she hot the way we found her not in the least can you remember of course i can remember im not old the last time was two nights ago she smiled every night until two nights ago then i told him i needed a rest five nights

pardon you want to know do we do it all night whys that your business sorry for any misunderstanding said milo what im after is can jays whereabouts be accounted for five nights ago five nights said nina hassan wait out here she returned moments later with a receipt here it is five nights ago takeout from chinois i keep everything for documentation so that bastard has to pay what he deserves takeout from for two people she said me and jay he tried to get me to eat chicken feet yuck he was here all night you bet said nina hassan winking he was too tired to leave okay thanks i helped him out huh too bad i dont like liars she tossed her hair but i tell it like it is thats how to handle all of you boys buhbye stepping back into her house she nudged the door shut with a manicured finger we drove back to sunset passing big houses small dogs leading maids gardeners blowing dirt with airguns milo said scratch the ex why should life be logical but its got to be someone else vita really got to too bad she didnt leave an enemy list thats for presidents he harrumphed incriminating tapes would be nice too okay ill drop you back home go enjoy your life while we poor civil servants toil not that im passiveaggressive just as we approached the glen his cell played mahler and he switched to speaker sean binchy said loot you found a pizza psycho unfortunately no but there is something youre going to want to what theres another one chapter the mans shirt was folded neatly by his side his pants and underwear had been lowered to midthigh arranged neatly no rumpling he lay on his back ten feet to the west of a dirt entry road in a clearing created by a sevenfoot gap in a long hedge of oleander toxic plant for the person whod snapped the mans neck perfect cover no towels under this body a blue tarp had been spread neatly a few blood specks dotted plastic and dry dirt a bit more than at vita berlins apartment but nothing extensive and no castoff low or highvelocity the earth surrounding the tarp had been smoothed free of footprints the mans degradation mimicked vitas broken neck same changepurse incision pattern identical display of scoopedout viscera the killspot was off temescal canyon in pacific palisades a quarter mile into the grounds of a former summer camp occasionally used for film shoots but for the most part abandoned an old wire gate spanning pitted asphalt was hinged to a wooden post a second post had rotted and crumbled and access was as easy as walking in the lack of security was a joke with the locals according to the first uniform on the scene a few of them bitch about it lieutenant but mostly they like it because its like having an extra park and you know the type of people who live here her name was cheryl gates she was tall blond squareshouldered falconeyed outwardly unaffected by what shed discovered on routine patrol by what she and milo and i were looking at through the gap in the oleander milo said rich folk rich and entitled and connected folk sir by that i mean deputy chief salmons sister lives not far away so my instruction is to drive by every day takes up time but it is kind of pretty and nothing much ever happens one time i found a boy and a girl sixteen went overboard with e and tequila spent the night next to the barbecues up there buck naked totally wasted funny thing was neither family reported them missing all the parents in europe or wherever sometimes i find bottles roaches condoms food wrappers but nothing serious outwardly unaffected but talking fast a bit too loud milo said the spot you found my victim is that part of your routine yes sir i figure its a good place for some homeless type to crash and god forbid the locals should be surprised by some wildeyed whack when they stroll in with their poodles come across any whacks recently no sir when i find them and its only once in a while its always up there near those barbecues they like to cook fix themselves a hot meal which is a riskfires and all that so i warn them and ive never had one come back twice but i figure better safe than sorry so yes i do check it daily which is how i found your vic any particular whack you think i should be looking into doubt it sir said gates these arent aggressive guys just the opposite passive out of it messed up physically she eyed the body im no expert but that looks pretty organized the way the dirts kinda been swept up i mean thats just my impression makes sense said milo thanks for holding the scene doing what im supposed to sir once backup arrived i stayed right here and had officers ruiz and oliphant check the grounds looking just for obvious stuff we didnt want to mess anything up they found nothing sir and theres no exit out of here other than the way you come in so im pretty confident we didnt miss any suspect hiding out good work so what do you think sir was this a sex thing those pants down maybe some gay thing that got crazy could be with a sex thing though said gates wouldnt you see direct involvement of the genitals not just that there are no rules officer gates tucked a strand of blond hair behind her ear of course sir id best be leaving you to go about your business if theres nothing else were fine officer hope tomorrow mornings more pleasant gates stood taller actually sir and this is probably an inopportune time to say so but ive been thinking about applying to be a d would you recommend that youre observant officer gates go for it and good luck same to you sir on the case i mean sean binchy and moe reed and three other uniforms remained stationed at the entrance guarding the road between sunset and the broken gate the coroners investigator hadnt arrived so all we could do was stand at the mouth of the clearing and peer in the man was middleagedcloser to fiftyfive than fortyfivewith thick curly hair pewter on top silver at the sides so tightly coiled it showed no sign of disarray not so for the head and neck below the hair incompatible with life not a particularly memorablelooking man average height average build average everything the pants were cotton medium beige pressed pleated cuffed clean where blood hadnt intruded the shirt was nutbrown a polo folded in a way that obscured any logo his shoes were white nikes with wellworn soles a runner or a serious walker no car parked near the entrance fit with that blue socks clashed he hadnt figured on being inspected id approached the scene expecting to react more strongly than i had to vita berlins corpse the opposite occurred taking in the butchery released an odd detergent wash of calm that settled my nervous system getting used to it maybe that was the worst part of it milo said no pizza box guess thats not part of the signature so maybe its just something the bastard came upon and used for vita not tracing it wont be any big deal poor devil i hope he was a total sonofabitch vitas spiritual brother a female voice said hi again unfortunately the ci named gloria walked between us and gazed into the opening good god she gloved up and covered her feet with paper booties stepped in got to work a wallet emerged from the right rear pocket of the mans khakis a drivers license idd him as marlon quigg fiftysix with an address on sunset a mile or two east of the campground a unit number said condo or apartment wed passed some nice buildings on the way over neatly kept places on the south side of the boulevard some affording ocean views five eight one sixtyeight gray hair brown eyes needs corrective lenses gloria checked his eyes contacts are still in there kind of surprising considering the force it took to snap the neck i said they couldve fallen out and the killer put them back hes all about order she thought about that tweezed out the tiny clear disks bagged and tagged armed with a name milo got busy learning about his victim quiggs ride was a threeyearold kia no wants or warrants or brushes with the criminal justice system the wallet held seventythree dollars in cash and three credit cards two snapshots remained in plastic sleeves one featured quigg and a smallish darkhaired woman around his age the other showed the couple with a pair of brunettes in their early twenties one girl resembled quigg down to the tight curly hair the other couldve been anyones progeny but her arm rested on the shoulder of the older woman so the reasonable guess was daughter number two both shots were studio poses backdropped by green fauxmarble everyone dressed up a little stiff and uncertain but smiling gloria said hes not wearing a watch no pale stripe on his arm either so maybe he wasnt a timebound type a or he took off his watch when he walked said milo i said the soles of his shoes say he liked to cover ground they do said gloria but why come in here itd be kind of spooky in the dark no milo said the locals consider it their private park he lives close maybe felt it was safe okay but maybe he was meeting someone she shifted uncomfortably the way the pants are you know anythings possible kid though i guess with something sexual youd expect the genitals to be attacked she looked at me i said same answer she checked the pants using a magnifier well look at this ive got foreign hairs whole bunch of them long ones blond milo kneeled down beside her plucked several filaments with latexsheathed fingers that looked too big and thick for the task holding the hairs up to the light he squinted sniffed maybe marilyn monroe came back from the grave to do him but they look kinda coarse and im picking up doggy odor gloria said my nose is stuffed she tried anyway sorry im not picking up anything but you could be right about the texture smiling unless someones using a real bad conditioner she produced an evidence bag i know the techies generally do hair unless were running drug screens on the shaft but we happen to have an intern from the u doing dna analysis on all kinds of critters want me to take it maybe i can get you something on species and breed appreciate it gloria took another look at quigg poor guy goes out for his nightly dogwalk and this happens frowning so wheres the canine in question maybe fido got left at home milo said or maybe our bad guy took a live trophy rover stands by and watches his master get murdered and then goes off willingly with the perpetrator not a protective breed thats for sure catching her breath or the poor things lying somewhere looking like mr quigg uniforms checked the immediate area but well go over it again after the techies arrive gloria scanned the dirt dont see any prints in here dog or human our bad guy cleaned up carefully just like the first time she said to me that makes it even more repulsive i said i dont see him cleaning every inch of ground all the way to sunset milo cellphoned reed moses keep the entire area tight no one in or out until whoevers on duty helps you examine every inch of dirt between sunset and the gate for prints im talking tire foot paw anything clicked off without waiting for an answer gloria bent back down and turned out marlon quiggs remaining pants pockets empty back on her feet she photographed the scene at multiple angles ending with closeups of the folded brown shirt she inspected the label macys generic size m no blood the garment had been removed prior to the cutting she got back down near the body started rolling it stopped and reached under and drew something out piece of paper folded into a packet corners perfectly square she photographed it closed then placed a sterile cloth under it and spread it open white standard letter size in the center a simple message chapter marlon quiggs apartment was in one of the nice buildings wed passed a nearby traffic light wouldve provided easy crossing of sunset the walk to temescal canyon wouldve been pleasant the complex was designed to resemble an enormous hacienda tricked out with a toored tile roof a false bell tower and a front loggia that shaded arched entry doors a tileroofed carport faced the main structure across a broad flagstone court eight slots in the port quiggs kia sat in number two quigg b and m appeared on unit twos mailbox groundfloor unit in the middle of the building i recognized the woman who answered the door because id just seen her photo milo said mrs quigg yes yes im belle you found them them marlon and louie we found mr quigg not louie marlon went out walking him last night they never came back ive been frantic when i called you people you said it couldnt be a missing person until she stopped put a hand to her mouth marlons okay milo sighed im sorry hes not hes hurt maam this is hard to belle quigg said oh no oh no no no no no im so sorry mrs quigg she raised her hands and yanked down as if tugging clouds from a cruel clear sky glared at us gasped then she began beating milo on the chest small woman pummeling big man isnt much of an assault milo bore it until she ran out of steam and dropped her fists to her side mrs qui her head flopped to one side skin blanched to a bad shade of gray eyes rolling upward she rasped once before pitching backward both of us lunged we each caught an arm eased her inside her home she woke up on the way to the nearest armchair milo stayed with her while i fetched water when i held the glass to her lips her mouth opened with all the volition of a marionette i took her pulse slow but steady i eased more water into her mouth she dribbled put her head back the eyes rolled again after a few seconds her pulse normalized and some color returned to her face she stared up at us what milo held her hand im lieutenant sturgis she said oh you so wheres louie it took another few minutes for her to settle into griefstricken numbness milo sat holding her hand i worked the water glass when she said no more i returned the glass to the kitchen spacious sunlit kitchen shiny granite stainless steel the rest of the apartment was done up nicely too furnished with timeless furniture maybe a few real antiques unremarkable but inoffensive seascapes a double set of sliding glass doors granted an oblique view of blue swimming pool bleeding to bluer pacific the sky was clear the grass around the pool was clipped birds flew a squirrel scampered up a magnificent canary island pine marlon quigg had arrived at a nice place in middle age at least one person cared about him i knew i shouldnt be judging but that made his monstrous end seem even worse than vitas belle quigg said oh god god louies probably also gone louies your dog said milo more like marlons dog the two of them were like we got him as a rescue louie loved everyone but mostly he loved marlon i loved marlon britt and sarah loved marlon everyone loved marlon she grabbed milos sleeve who would hurt himwas he robbed it doesnt look that way maam what then what who would do this who were gonna work real hard to find out maam im sorry to have to be the one to deliver such terrible news and i know this isnt a good time but if i could ask you some questions what kind of questions the more we know about marlon the better we can do our job i love marlon weve been together twentysixoh god our anniversary is next week i already made reservations what am i going to do two bouts of sobbing later milo said what kind of work did marlon do work said belle quigg yes he worked of course he worked marlon wasnt a bumwhy did one of those bums kill him those bums they call them homeless i call them bums because thats what they are you see them at sunset and pch panhandling drunk the lights long gives them plenty of time to come up and beg i never give them a dime marlon always gave them something why would you suspect one of them because theyre bums said belle quigg i always told marlon that dont encourage them he has a soft heart the crime occurred over in temescal canyon the little indians camp i told marlon not to walk there at night that just proves what i was saying anyone can walk in whats to stop a bum you want to find them go down to sunset and pch well definitely check that out maam is there anyone else we should be thinking of what do you mean anyone marlon mightve had conflict with say at work never what kind of work did he do marlon was an accountant where peterson danville and shapiro in century city he handled one major client the happy boy supermarket chain marlon did a great job always got the best performance ratings how long had he been working there fifteen years she said before that he worked for the citydwpbut only for a year while he was waiting to take his cpa before that he was a teacher he worked with disabled children before he picked up the happy boy account did he work with any insurance companies happy boy has been his assignment right from the beginning theyre a huge chain its all marlon can do to keep up with their taxes so no problems at work why would there be a problem no of course not this had nothing to do with marlon marlons the best and obviously your personal life is great better than great said belle quigg its excellent her lips parted color began leeching again im going to have to tell britt and sar oh god how can i do that how old are they britts eighteen sarahs twentytwo are they close by head shake britts in colorado sarahs in i where is she that place underneath colorado her face screwed up its on the tip of my that place i said new mexico new mexico shes in gallup it sounds like horses running around thats how i remember it shes there because her boyfriend lives in gallup so she does too she used to drive a car now she rides a lot of horses its a ranch one of those ranches britts not married i hope she will be but shes not she lives in colorado vail she works as a waitress gets real busy when its ski season she skis sarah rides horses theyre beautiful girlshow am i going to tell them if youd like us to stick around while you call no no no you call youre sure maam its your job said belle quigg everyone needs to do their job she turned silent almost stuporous as milo phoned her daughters the conversations were brief terrible and every second seemed to diminish him if belle quigg had eavesdropped she showed no signs of reacting he sat back down sarah would like to talk to you mrs quigg britt too britt will call you back when she composes herself composes said belle quigg like a composition she was always good in english will you speak with sarah no no no tell her ill call back i need to sleep i need to sleep forever is there someone a friend a neighbor that we could call to come over to be with you be with me while i sleep to offer support maam im fine i just want to die in peace i returned to the kitchen looked for an address book found a cell phone a scan of recent calls listed a speeddial number for letty i phoned it a woman said belle i said im calling on belles behalf it took a while to clarify longer until letty pomeroy stopped gasping but she agreed readily to come over to take care of her friend are you nearby like a fiveminute drive we really appreciate it mrs pomeroy of course marlons really im afraid so thats crazydo you know who did it not yet where did it happen in temescal canyon where marlon walked louie thats common knowledge anyone who knows marlon knows he likes to walk louie there because he didnt need to clean up after louie its so rural i mean i guess officially he did but was louie also louies missing figures said letty pomeroy that he wouldnt protect marlon pushover moron what kind of breed is he golden retriever or maybe a retriever mix mixedup is more like it that has to be the dumbest animal ive ever encountered you could step on him hed grin up at you like the village idiot kind of like marlon i guess no that came out wrong im not saying marlon was stupid god forbid no marlon was smart he was a bright man very mathematical but easygoing i said thats what i meant marlon was the easiestgoing guy i cant believe someone would hurt him i mean marlon for gods sake he was the original bleeding heart thats how he got louie no one wanted to adopt louie probably because hes so dim my husband and i used to call him the dumb blond a breathing pooping throw rug anyone whod steal that mutt is a worse idiot sorry im ranting i still cant believe this someone actually hurt marlon unbelievable mrs quiggs pretty traumatized if you think youre up to coming over right now ill be there in a jif back in the living room belle quigg was resting her head on milos shoulder eyes closed maybe sleeping maybe withdrawing deeper than slumber shed caught him in an awkward position but he didnt budge i told him a friend would be showing up shortly belle quigg stirred milo said maam huh if you can handle a few more questions her eyes opened whu is the name vita berlin familiar like the city yes no not familiar with vita berlin sounds like a food supplement what about an insurance company named wellstart huh he repeated the name we use allstate allstates casualty wellstart does health insurance we use one of the blue ones marlon paid all the bills so neither vita berlin or wellstart rings a bell no flash of clarity she sat up but remained pressed against him no neither why just routine questions smiling the new widow placed a hand on his chest snuggling closer she said youre so big chapter two women entered the quigg condo first through the door was a tall buxom redhead with short feathered hair wearing a green sweater over a black unitard and red chinese slippers she announced herself as letty identified her shorter sweatsattired companion as sally ritter shes also a friend belle quigg didnt react her eyes were open but theyd been blank for the last quarter hour one hand continued to grip milos wrist the other rested on his chest letty pomeroy said oh honey and surged forward milo manage to extricate himself and stretch sally ritter said so what exactly happened i said ive explained to ms pomeroy from what she told me on the way over thats not much milo said we dont know much thats why we need to investigate thanks ladies he headed for the door belle quigg said wait everyone looked at her youve remembered something maam she shook her head but everyone should stay milo started up the engine before closing the drivers door sped onto sunset crossing the next intersection on an iffy amber evoked honks and curses he said sue me and steered with one finger as he celled moe reed any shoe prints out front reeds voice came on speaker grainy but audible a few closer to the gate like you suggested techies arrived just after you left and i had them cast unfortunately nothing was clear enough all they got is an approximation of shoe size which is were talking at least five different sets ranging from small to big what about tire tracks i really have to be the one to tell you huh that bad no tracks whatsoever loo whoever sliced that poor guy up either walked in and out or he parked somewhere in the surrounding neighborhood street parking is illegal after eight pm any vehicle wouldve stood out and the locals wouldve probably complained i checked with traffic no one called in anything and no tickets were issued last night have the uniforms canvass the entire grounds again uniforms just finished canvassing a second time nothing do it a third time you supervise have sean participate sometimes he notices things seans doing a doortodoor with the nearest neighbors you then make sure its done right yes sir im not only talking juicy obvious evidence moses im talking random trash a bottle a candy wrapper anything but the damn trees and shrubs and rocks that god put there only different thing that came up the second time was a dead snake near an empty garbage can california king a baby pretty little thing with blue and yellow and red stripes and im not sure you can call that out of place didnt know you watched animal planet kid bring me a cobra and ill be impressed reed laughed really was a nice snake poor thing milo ended the call a second later it beeped brahms sturgis oh hi thanks for calling back sure actually i understand the whole schedule thing a good friend of mines a physician richard silverman hes also at cedars you do yes he is so when can i speak to both of you sooners better than later i see well thats fine just give me your room number great see you in twenty he accelerated zoomed around curves the unmarkeds loose suspension griped he kept racing zipping past the treeshrouded northern border of the us massive campus i said vitas downstairs neighbors the drs feldman that was the male half they both just got off call found out about vita and are too freaked out to return home so theyre staying at the sofitel across from cedars i said freaked out because they know something or just general anxiety well find out soon enough im headed straight there any thoughts about poor mr quigg i repeated what letty pomeroy had told me mr nice guy he growled as if that was the gravest personality flaw of all maybe too trusting sounds like louie sure was no protective instinct at all and now hes probably lying in a ditch with his own guts churned up what the hells going on alex one victims the most hated woman in southern california the others ready to be sainted theres a rational pattern for you i said only thing i can see in common is they were about the same age a psycho who targets aging boomers now all i have to do is keep a close watch on a few million potential carvees hell alex maybe i sic aarp on the damn case here id convinced myself this had something to do with vita specifically now im picking up that random stench or something so crazy it might as well be random please tell me im wrong too much planning went into the killings for a random strike same goes for the cleanup and sitting by the bodies until they were safely dead before mutilating so something nuts wonderful calculated evil not insanity my bet is vita and quigg were both stalked vita was a stayathome who went out to shop and eat quigg took the same walk with his dog every night creatures of habit he said fine but what made them targets vita pissing off some psycho i can see but mildmannered marlon so maybe quiggs not as perfect as his wife made out you have time to revisit her maybe shell give something up i have time but she sure seemed to like your big manly chest hate to deprive her but youll be an excellent second choice a mile later he said the dog bothers me so hes no pit bull but standing around while quigg got butchered i said all the killer needed to do was incapacitate quigg then tie the dogs leash to a branch or pin it under a rock if louie did react to seeing his master die horribly that couldve heightened the pleasure a sadist with a captive audience think the dogs dead or a live trophy could go either way either he said god i hate that word chapter dr david feldman sat on the edge of the hotel bed dr sondra feldman sat so close the two of them looked glued together the room was compact tidy airconditioned frigid he was thirty or so tall thin and longlimbed as an egret with wavy black hair and the anxious nobility of a velasquez prince his wife pretty and grave with nervous hands and straight black hair couldve been mistaken for his sib theyd insisted that milo slip id under the door before unlatching the chain had remained in place while two sets of eyes checked us over through the crack after letting us in sondra feldman bolted and rechained and david feldman doublechecked the strength of the hardware both feldmans wore jeans sneakers and polo shirts hers a pink ralph lauren polo his a skyblue lacoste their white coats were draped individually over separate chairbacks a bowl of fruit on a nightstand was untouched a bottle of merlot had been touched to half empty sondra feldman saw me looking at the wine we thought it might help but it was all we could do to hold it down milo said thanks for getting back to me david feldman said were hoping you can protect us or is that unrealistic you think youre in danger a neighbor gets murdered right above us wouldnt you consider that danger sondra said theres no alarm system in the apartment that always bothered me have you had security problems no but were into prevention not treatment we talked to stanleighmr belleveaux he was reluctant to install anything for a oneyear lease david said for lack of contradictory data were assuming were in danger well be moving soon as we find another place but at some point well need to go back to retrieve our stuff is there any way we could receive some sort of police escort i know were not celebs and the citys tight financially but were not asking for anything extensive maybe one cop milo said until you find a new place youll be staying here sondra frowned the cost is crazy and we get what two hundred square feet david said we both have tons of loans stanleighs place seemed like a great deal because he was friendly and honest and it was reasonably close to both our work but after this not a chance youre a resident at cedars and sonnys at the u the mention of work seemed to relax them i said what are your specialties im in medicine want to do a gastro fellowship sonnys pediatrics sondra feldman said can we interpret your not answering the request for an escort as a no milo said not at all once youre ready get in touch if i cant accompany you myself ill get someone else youd do that sure ill be back to the scene several times anyway the feldmans exchanged quick rabbity looks sondra said well thank you milo said hey a neighbor murdered is heavyduty i dont blame you for being on edge but is there some specific reason you feel you might be targeted another exchange of jumpy eyelanguage david said we may just be paranoid but we think we might have seen something sondra said someone the first time was around three weeks ago davey saw himyou tell them honey david nodded i cant be sure exactly when this was given our sleep patterns time blurs we get home take ambien collapse the only reason i noticed him in the first place was the neighborhoods generally quiet you never see anyone out past five not like philly we lived in city center there was street life all the time sondra said the second time was maybe two weeks ago and i was the one who saw him davey hadnt told me he saw him so i never mentioned it it was only after what happened to vita that we compared notes milo said whos him she said before we get into it lieutenant we need to feel certain were doing the right thing believe me doctor you are we dont mean morally we mean personalsafetywise what if it gets back to him that we played a role in his apprehension and he comes after us dr feldman were a long way from that were just saying said sondra once we pass along information were part of the process therell be no way to get un involved milo said i appreciate your concern but ive been doing this a long time and ive never had someone in your situation harmed david said please excuse us for not finding that comforting theres always a first time i said you returned lieutenant sturgiss call that wasnt just to ask for a police escort to pick up your stuff thats true said david we wanted to do the right thing but then we got to discussing it a criminal investigation is a complex process before anyones apprehended let alone charged and brought to trial therell be thousands of bits of data added to the pile your contribution wont stand out sondra said you sound like my father hes a psych prof always dissecting things logically what does your father think you should do i havent told him neither of us has told anyone david said if he knew hed be here on the next plane trying to run things telling us see i was right you shouldve stayed in philly she smiled your mom too in spades meddlecity they held hands i said whod you both see sondra said if our contributions so insignificant you probably dont need us in the first place not insignificant i said but not conspicuous either isnt medicine like that you dont always know what will work david said wed like to think medicine can be pretty scientific wed like to think criminal investigations can be scientific but reality doesnt always cooperate the information you have may turn out to be irrelevant but if it narrows things down it could help sondra said okay fine sonny its the right thing davey lets just get it over with he inhaled massaged the little crocodile snarling at his left breast i was coming home from work around a month ago saw a guy across the street it was at night but i could see him i guess there were stars out i really dont know my initial impression was he was staring at our building up at the second story i said vitas apartment i cant swear to it but from the way his neck was tilted thats what it seemed like i found that curious because in all the time wed been there we never saw vita have a visitor i suppose its possible she entertained during the day when we were gone but all the times we were home during the day we never saw anyone total loner said sondra no surprise whys that her personality abrasive combative obnoxious pick your adjective said david shes on top were on bottom if anyones going to hear footsteps its us but we never complained and trust me her steps were heavy she wasnt exactly a fashion model sometimes after wed been on call it was hell being woken up by her clomping around sondra said it seemed to happen a lot when we came back from call milo said you think she was trying to bug you we wondered david said we didnt get into it with her whats the point then she goes and complains to stanleigh about us sondra said how can you hear footsteps from downstairs plus we always go barefoot plus were careful stanleigh was cool said he was sorry obviously he was paying lip service after that anytime wed see vita shed give us the stink eye david said anyway back to the salient issue she never once had a visitor that we saw and now some guy was looking up at her place i said from across the street he took off the moment he saw me watching him what did he look like white maybe five eleven what i did find unusual was how he was dressed it was a warm day but he was wearing a coat no one wears coats in la i brought one from philly its still in a garment bag what kind of coat kind of bulky or maybe he was bulky and filled it out sondra said given the benefit of hindsight maybe he chose a bulky garment in order to conceal a gun was she shot milo said she was stabbed she gripped her husbands arm god even if we had been there it couldve gone on right under our noses and we might not have heard it thats repellent i said what else can you remember about this person david thats it what was his age i really cant say when he left how did he move he thought he didnt limp if thats what youre getting at didnt move like an old guy so probably not too old i wasnt close enough to get details i was more concerned about what he was doing there in fact i wasnt really worried more like curious its when he got out of there that i started to wonder milo said think he was younger than fifty hmm probably younger than forty that i cant tell you if you had to guess twenties or thirties he said and i dont even know why im saying that fair enough milo turned to sondra she said three weeks agoi know that because i was rotating at a clinic in palmdale too far to commute so mostly i slept out there but that night i got off early and david was on call and i wanted to clean up the apartment so that would make it a week or two after davey saw him it was also at night nineish id gotten home at eight eaten showered was doing some puttering it relaxes me part of that was emptying the trash baskets into a big garbage bag and taking them out to the alley she bit her lip in retrospect its terrifying i said someone was in the alley she nodded not near our garbage near the garbage next door i mustve spooked him because as soon as i got to our garbage i heard footsteps then i saw him running that freaked me out not only had he been there and i was unaware but the fact that he ran away why would you run if you werent up to no good he ran fast west up the alley some of the properties have security lights and as he passed under them i could see his form diminishing could see his coat billowing thats why i knowi thinkits the same person davey saw it was a warm night why wear a coat i cant give you his age saw him from the distance and from the back but from the way he movedmore like a bear than a deeri got the feeling he was kind of husky the bulk just wasnt the coat do you think vitas murder had to do with her specifically milo said as opposed to a random psychopath david said obviously wed rather it be something specific and not some sexual predator targeting all women sondra said that night when i went down to the garbage it really was warm i had on a tank top and shorts and im not sure i drew all the drapes on our windows her eyes teared up milo said we have no evidence he was after anyone at the building other than vita okay she said her tone belied any confidence david said no matter were out of there i said sonny when you saw this person running away what did you do i hurried back inside the only rational response said david her eyes shot to the left i said did you look around at all before you hurried back david said why would she sondra said actually david stared at her just for a second davey i was frightened but i was also curious what would someone be doing there i wanted to see if he left something some kind of evidence so id have something to report to the police if he came back wow said david wowow its okay hon he was long gone there was absolutely no danger i only looked around a bit and then i went right back inside i said whatd you see not much there was a box on the ground so i assumed hed been rooting around in the trash i wondered if he was just a homeless guy scrounging for something to eat that could explain the coat when i rotated through psych they told us schizophrenics sometimes dressed way too heavy what kind of box a pizza box empty i know that because i picked it up and put it in the trash and from the weight you could tell it was empty david said ugh time for purell she shot him a sharp look like i didnt im kidding milo said any markings on the pizza box i didnt notice why does pizza have something to do with vita milo said nope so maybe said sondra he was just a mentally disturbed homeless guy dumpsterdiving no big deal anything else twin head shakes okay thanks heres my card and when you need that escort give a ring both feldmans stood he was an easy six four she was four inches shorter one day they might breed and create a brainy power forward as we headed for the door i said philly as in penn sondra said undergrad and med school for me med school for davey he did undergrad at princeton david allowed himself a smile we come across as ivy league twits you come across as serious thinkers thanks he said i think thinking said his wife can be a big pain chapter milo had his phone out before beginning the drive back to the station he started with moe reed checking again on the campgrounds reed said nothing but sean has something for you sean binchy came on a neighbor thinks she saw someone lurking three days ago white indeterminate age wore a coat which she thought was weird seeing as it was a warm night what kind of coat i didnt ask is that important maybe he recounted the feldmans sightings sondras theory about a concealed weapon oh boy said binchy ill go back and requestion her no need said milo give me her info we sped to temescal canyon the house was a woodsided twostory craftsman on a generous lot due west and slightly north of the campground entrance separated from the road by a densely planted berm plenty of hiding places among trees and shrubs not ideal for a woman living alone and thats what the informant turned out to be stunning fortyish athletically built she responded to milos id with hi milo b sturgis im erica a vail stepping out onto her lawn she bent to pluck a dead bud from an azalea bush she wore a skimpy black top leggings in a curious shade of green that took on pink highlights when the sun hit the fabric at a certain angle pink vans her hair was huge dark artfully mussed a diamond chip pierced her left nostril i dont know what i can add to what i told that young cop didnt know you guys could be so hip spiky hair that whole surfer thing doc martens someone brought that to me in a script id tell them to get authentic but apparently i need to be more broadminded youre a director producer she namedropped a comedy series that had been off the air for five years added the fact that she had three pilots in development for three separate networks glad detective binchy was helpful said milo im his boss erica vail flashed blindingly white teeth i merit the boss flattered maybe youll be a little more forthcoming who exactly got killed a man who lives nearby how nearby couple of miles by lives do you mean actually lives like in a house or one of those homeless guys who congregate at pch he had a home his name was marlon quigg never heard of him she said id figured it for a homeless guy once in a while they wander in but when one of us asks them to leave weve never had a problemdid one of them kill mr quigg too early to say ms vail the guy i saw didnt impress me as homeless too healthylooking even a little on the heavy side tell us about it sure said erica vail brighteyed cheerful three nights ago mustve been close to ten i came out and there he was pointing to the berm i was just about where i am now and i could see him because the moon was fat it created kind of a halo around him she smiled almost a specialeffects thing forgive me i tend to think in terms of movie frames milo said you dont seem upset about the murder or seeing him either the murder doesnt bother me because its too abstract and back in a former life i was a surgical nurse including duty in afghanistan so it takes a lot to gross me out seeing him didnt bother me because of bella whos bella she jogged back inside her house returned moments later with a beast in tow at least a hundred fifty pounds of defined bluegray muscle was graced by a massive bluntnosed head spots of gold accented the brow above the small watchful eyes same for the bottoms of the legs a colormorphed rottweiler but bigger and leggier than a rottweiler with a tail docked to a stub and ears cropped to pointy remnants circling a treetrunk neck was a stainlesssteel pinch collar tethered to a stout leather leash say hello to the nice policemen bella the dogs lips drew back baring lionsized fangs a low but thunderous noiseabdominal menacingemerged from its maws erica vail said apart from me bella doesnt like people as if on cue the dog lunged at us even with a pinch chain erica vail had to labor to hold her at bay erica vail laughed men in particular she was my present to myself after my divorce whats her breed i said cane corso combination of roman war dog and some sort of sicilian hound back in the old country they guard mafia estates and hunt boar bella growled i am woman hear me roar said milo erica vail laughed you can see why mr lurker didnt bother me bella smelled him when she was still in the house thats why i came out she was getting all restless whining near the door once we got out she went straight for him wouldve had him for a snack if i hadnt been able to hold her back howd he react thats the funny thing she said most people see bella coming they cross the street this idiot just stood there maybe he was trying to prove how macho he was but it was stupid bella pulls hard enough im not sacrificing my shoulder she tossed her hair loosened her grip on the dog bella edged closer i tried a closedmouth smile some dogs view teeth as a threat she cocked her head not unlike blanche when shes thinking favored me with a long stare and settled for aloof condescension erica vail said i was about to warn the fool when he finally got smart and split milo said which way did he go down the street that waysouth if hed disappeared into the berm id have called you guys anything else you remember about him i figured him for a perv because he was wearing a coat you know a yanker joe raincoat exhibitionist said milo exhibitionists im used to said vail see em every day on the set so what you think he killed mr quigley were just starting to investigate how big was the guy you saw average size tapping my shoulder more like him than you what about the coat kneelength he wore it open thats another you could tell it was open because the shape too wide to be zipped up i got the impression of bulk so nothing like microfiber hope you catch whoever killed that poor man bella and i are going back inside to read scripts the dog had sidled close i ventured a pet of her head she purred erica vail stared at me unbelievable she never likes guys smiling you married milo said what kind of scripts does bella like shes eclectic said vail but discerning if she doesnt whine at a page of dialogue i give it a second look the caliber of stuff im getting lately she whines plenty chapter over the next few days data trickled in neither of marlon quiggs daughters had any idea whod want to harm their father the same went for family friends milo and reed and binchy interviewed belle quigg requestioned through a fog of sedation repeated a mantra everyone loved marlon this had to be a maniac animal control reported thirtythree dead canines collected across the county since quiggs murder milo and the young ds took the time to check each one none was louie most of the dogs had been abandoned and had died of malnutrition or disease or from being hit by cars a golden retriever mix discovered on a canoga park side street had been shot in the head executionstyle and milo took the time to contact its owners two college girls had shared maximilian both were bereft and guiltstricken the exboyfriend of one young woman was their prime suspect and a background check revealed a husky thirtyyearold with a misdemeanor record of assaults and disorderly conduct milo grew excited and looked for the man he turned out to have been on the open sea for seven months working as a deckhand on a commercial freighter on its way to japan the shelter where marlon quigg had adopted louie employed no one who matched the description of the broadly built white man seen lurking near both murder scenes with the exception of a vietnamese american high school student and two octogenarian retirees the staff was exclusively female the woman whod handled louies paperwork recalled marlon quigg because hed been so easy to deal with and opined that hed seemed the perfect match for louie quiet laidback nofuss kind of guy i thought easy victim binchy and reed visited other shelters with no better results inspection of quiggs phone and financial records revealed nothing suspicious an additional search of the campgrounds and interviews with a score of homeless people congregating near pch and sunset were futile though one of the panhandlers a wildeyed gaptoothed woman named aggie was certain quigg had once driven by and given her fifty dollars milo said big haul oh yeah he was great what kind of car was he driving aggie what else big rollsroyce like i say some of those rich folk are nice quiggs autopsy and lab results came in a significant bruise where the back of the neck met the skull suggested hed been subjected to a single hard blow from behind the ci hadnt caught it at the scene because quiggs thick hair concealed it not a fatal blow but hard enough to stun no human hairs other than quiggs had been found on his person but louie had shed a few more strands onto his masters shirt three additional fibers turned out to be synthetic sheepskin i said our bad guy wears a bulky coat maybe its a cheap shearling dressed for the hunt in montana maybe milo scrawled in his pad what do you think of that head wound i said classic sneakattack sucker punch vita didnt need to be blitzed because she was reeling drunk and the pizza ruse caught her off guard if the killers the guy erica vail saw he was near the scene three days before he did quigg quiggs walks were predictable it wouldnt have been much of a challenge to pretend to be taking a walk himself pass by and smile and wave maybe even stop to pet louie friendly stalking he said till its not id go back to belle quigg and ask if marlon ever mentioned encountering anyone during his walks more writing on my list so we have a good idea how each of them was done but that still begs the big question what turned them into victims theres got to be something in common but hell if i can find it i was hoping it would be vitas lawsuit but its not shaping up that way the suits at wellstart ended up being a lot more forthcoming than i expected not because theyre nice guys because vitas murder has them worried the original gag order will be rescinded theyll have to deal with a whole bunch of bad publicity they actually sent a lawyer over yesterday and she showed me a lot of paper the prelim motions all the interviews with the accused coworkers shackers report which came across as a lot of shrinky bullshit no offense but all in all nothing new and the mouthpiece swore the company had no connection with quigg i didnt take her word for it emailed wellstarts ceos second in command in hartford connecticut he called me personally gave me the name of the accounting firm that does their books greased the skids so theyd talk to me theyd never hired quigg nor to their knowledge had quigg ever applied for a job that was backed up by mrs quigg marlon wasnt a seeker happy with the status quo and figuring on retiring in a few years despite that i got hold of quiggs boss at the cpa firm and probed about quigg doing insurance work the firm does some but not for wellstart and not for wellstarts liability carrier and even if they had quigg wouldnt have been assigned to it he was more than busy with his supermarket account he described ol marlon the way everyone else has pleasant compliant eventempered so why were the two of them singled out or maybe there is no x factor and this bastard drives around spots random prey stalks and studies and sets up the hunt nothing about this kind of murder was ever random but it wasnt the time to say so meanwhile he said both cases are thawing out fast bastard quits right now he may get away with it he neednt have worried about that chapter the following day milos mood lifted from subterranean to glum belle quigg had remembered a nice young fellow marlon had met during his nightly walk louie had taken to the man a clear sign to quigg that he was a person of sterling character milo hmmphed because we all know dogs are such great judges he spooned lentils onto a hillock of basmati rice suckedout lobster claws were heaped in front of him a gruesome display if you thought too much about it we were at his usual corner table at cafe moghul an indian restaurant around the corner from the station that serves as his second office over the years hed handled a few disruptive psychotics wandering in from santa monica boulevard the owner a sweet bespectacled woman who never wears the same sari twice views him as lord protector and feeds him accordingly today it was the lobster plus tandoori lamb and a farmplots worth of slowcooked vegetables enriched by clarified butter hed downed six glasses of iced clove tea with nowhere to go on the murders i figured it for an easy day and was nursing my second grolsch marlon say anything else about this nice fellow if he did belle doesnt remember by the way i talked to a fabric analyst at the lab and the synthetic fleece found on quigg would definitely be consistent with a lowbudget shearlingtype lining not that it leads me anywhere i said you heard what david feldman said he still hasnt unwrapped his winter coat the fact that our boy wears his could mean hes originally from a cold climate or just rummaged at the right thrift shop but if i come across a dogsled and mittens ill go with that i find the fact that quigg couldve been primed for days hugely creepy like those wasps stroking caterpillars into a stupor before they plunge the stinger i said priming could serve an additional purpose weve got a wasp who enjoys playing with his food joy of the hunt a shearling might be something a hunter would own homicidal foreprey his laughter was harsh the woman in the sari glided over todays garment was a celebration of turquoise and coralpink and saffronyellow the pink matched her eyeglass frames you are enjoying as always more lobster milo patted his paunch couldnt handle another bite ive already demolished an entire coral reef she was confused by the reference covered with a smile you want more tell me please lieutenant will do but honestly im done not totally done she said dessert hmm he said gulab jamun sounds good very fine she glided away moving her lips i caught two words my lieutenant milo caught nothing because his phone was vibrating on the table when he processed the digital readout his shoulders dropped sturgis sir oh hi maria oh jesuwhen oh okay yeah right away pushing away from the table he threw cash down swiped his chin viciously with a napkin as i followed his trot for the door the woman in the sari emerged from the kitchen bearing a platter of dough balls glazed with rosewater syrup and two bowls filled to the brim with rice pudding theres kir too she said for extra sweet unfortunately life isnt said milo shoving the door open and leaving me to catch it he racewalked south on butler heading back to the station flushed and breathing hard and wiping his face and grinding his teeth i said whats up what do you think maria thomas is a pencilpusher something mindlessly bureaucratic like a meeting youve been avoiding he stopped short wiped his face so hard it was almost a slap our bad boys back in action and instead of calling me the watch commander went straight to his splendiferousness who handed off to maria because he didnt want to hear the sound of my voice obviously ive been under the microscope on these murders and not engendering confidence im heading over to the scene now dont be surprised if they yank me off he resumed his march i said whos the victim his jaw was tight the answer came out hoarse and strangled think plural this time the bastard doubled his fun the house was a low wide ranch on a street of similar structures in a noname neighborhood of west la the man had been found in the backyard lying on his stomach wearing a black silk bathrobe deep stab wounds concentrated in a tight circle at the center of his chest a couple of coup de grace throat slashes had severed the right jugular and carotid and the trachea no disembowelment nothing similar to vita and quigg i watched as milo examined the body the mans hair was long dark and wavy his mustache was clipped precisely thirty to forty goodsized well muscled no effort to clean up the blood the grass beneath the body was glazed a slick unpleasant brown no shredded lawn or damaged shrubs or other sign of struggle no blow from behind this time the ci had probed under the hair immediately found no swelling or bruising the killer had taken on a serious foe facetoface dispatched him easily maybe darkness had been his ally milo circled the body for the fourth time the crime scene techs had finished their initial work and were waiting for him before leaving deputy chief maria thomas had taken her time calling him to the scene out in front of the house the coroners van was waiting to transport nice sunny day on the westside the yard where the man in the robe lay dead was ringed with high block walls laced with trumpet vine in missouri where id grown up no one bothered with fences and a kid could pretend he owned the world behind our rattrap house was a dense black forest that yielded an occasional dead animal and two human corpses the first had been a hunter shot accidentally by a buddy the second had been a little girl five years old my age at the time i supposed freedom could be the stuff of bad dreams but right now this boxy confined space felt oppressive why was i thinking about that because i had nothing constructive to offer milo completed another circle before heading for maria thomas the dc had positioned herself midway up the blue houses driveway on the near side of two parked vehicles sheltered from the ugliness she made love to her cell phone blondcoiffed and trim with a preference for tailored suits maria had been a captain when id met her a couple of years ago well spoken cautious decorous she was the ideal corporate cog the only time id seen her in action shed screwed up bigtime by usurping a detectives role leading to the death of a suspect in an interview room somehow that disaster had earned her a promotion she kept milo waiting as she talked finally pointed to the houses rear door but didnt end the conversation milo and i made our way through the bright neatly kept house the laundry room and the kitchen and the living room appeared untouched no blood from the yard tracked in the kitchen smelled of cinnamon everything neat and clean and normal the master bedroom was another story the woman lay on her back atop a queensize bed her hair was short and wavy a careful blend of several shades of subdued caramel her left hand was tethered to a brass headboard with a blue necktie the ties label was visible gucci no towels or tarp had been spread underneath her naked body a few ruby specks dotted pale blue sheets but no arterial explosion or castoff or significant leakage waiting until every organ system had shut down before doing his thing the exact same thing hed done to vita berlin and marlon quigg this womans eyes were wide open maybe positioned that way postmortem or perhaps theyd opened spasmodically and stayed that way big and gray and artfully shadowed the lashes enriched with mascara disturbingly lifelike despite the impossible angle of her broken neck and putrid guts piled up in grotesque decoration on the carpet next to the bed was a filmy pink negligee the womans nails were silver nacre her toes claret just beneath the baby toe of her left foot was a sheet of white paper milo growled youre getting boring asshole the uniform by the door said pardon milo ignored him and took in the room i was already scanning the space for the second time concentrating on the lefthand nightstand where a pair of frilly pink panties draped a lamp shade spread across the stand was a careless array a tube of love jam apricotflavored lubricant a package of ribbed condoms an unopened bottle of sauvignon blanc a corkscrew two wineglasses a similar lamp graced the other stand minus the undergarment the only object it housed besides the lamp was a silverframed photo goodlooking couple tux and wedding dress big smiles as they cut into a fourtiered cake festooned with yellow sugar roses no younger than they appeared now newlyweds a ceiling lamp glowed faint orange a dimmer switch near the bed was set on low romantic lighting the scene shot into my head as surely as if id scripted it the two of them retire for bed counting on a night of romance one or both of them hears something out back they ignore it because you cant go check on every little leafrustle and imagined intrusion they hear it again someone something out in the yard no big deal at worst a raccoon or a possum or a skunk or just a stray cat or dog that had happened before they hear it again a faint scratching rustling of foliage again too enduring to be ignored is there really something out there honey no prob ill check be careful im sure its nothing he throws on his robe goes to check it out because thats what husbands do she waits thinking its nice to be married have someone to squish bugs and play protector lying back she relaxes anticipating deliciousness he doesnt return quickly the way he usually does the moments pile up she begins to wonder dont be silly maybe he really did encounter a critter and had to deal with it hopefully not a raccoon they carry rabies and get mean when cornered but no sound of struggle so maybe hes just being careful the notion of her darling and a critter makes her smile so primal hell be careful he always is and itll turn out to be one of those funny stories theyll tell their grandchildren but it is taking a long time more time passes she calls his name silence then the door closes good everythings fine maybe hell come in with one of his yummy surprises last time it was godiva chocolate this time it could be another treat food or otherwise she closes her eyes arranges herself the way he likes the comforting sound of male footsteps grows louder she loves that sound she coos his name silence or perhaps a vague masculine grunt babys playing caveman excellent this is going to be one of those nights something not to tell the grandchildren she smiles purrs positions herself a little racier than usual creating sublime invitation hes in the room now she hears his breathing intensify baby she says silence fine that game hes right next to her she senses him feels his heat but something different she opens her eyes everything changes papers in the desk of the home office next to the bedroom conformed to dmv info barron and glenda parnell hed lived just over two months past his thirtysixth birthday shed made it thirteen months longer a picture id badge from north hollywood day hospital tagged her as g a usfelparnell md nuclear medicine in the picture she was grave still pretty wearing big rimless glasses milo found them in a nightstand drawer i wondered about the extent of dr glenda parnells visual impairment what had she actually seen when shed opened her eyes had she ever really focused trembled at the horror but composed herself sufficiently to bargain fear about her husbands fate would have shaken her but perhaps shed been able to put that aside sufficiently adrenalized to concentrate on her own survival had the killer pretended to go along as he had her tie her own arm to the bedpost or had he relied at the outset on terror and intimidation had she sensed it was futile the moment hed breached the door complied out of selfpreservation as well as love for barron hoping cooperation would spare both of them if so shed spoken a completely different language from the killer to him barron was nothing more than an obstacle to overcome hed pulled the prelim off perfectly drawing the guy into his trap now the fun part once prints had been taken milo gloved up and gave the office desk a thorough search glenda parnells malpractice insurance was paid up as were her subscriptions to several medical journals mail addressed to barron parnell appended cfp to his name a mailer from a brokerage house expanded that to certified financial planner so did a letter from an attorney representing the cameron family trust that specified malfeasance and incautious investing the date was nineteen months ago milo copied down the particulars further excavation of the desk drawers indicated parnell worked out of the home with no apparent clients other than himself and his wife hed done well amassing just over a million dollars in a stock account two hundred thousand more in a corporate bond account just under ten thousand in a joint savingschecking account the two vehicles parked in the driveway were a threeyearold yellow porsche cayman registered to barron and a gray infiniti qx registered to glenda both had been recently washed and appeared undisturbed also unmolested was a pricey bank of computers in the office some serious jewelry in a leather box barely concealed behind blankets in the linen closet a case of sparkling christofle silverware in the pantry a home entertainment system in the living room that included a sixtyinch plasma tv we returned to the bedroom in barrons sock drawer milo found a silverframed glamour shot of glenda fuzzy focus the suggestion of nudity cornucopia of cleavage glistening teeth to barry boo from sweet gee love ever happy anniversary xxxx the inscribed date was fortytwo days ago maria thomas stuck her head in the room anything milo shook his head got a sec yeah he mightve been agreeing to doityourself root canal the three of us powwowed in the parnells spotless kitchen someone had put money into the decor matteblack euro cabinets trimmed in chrome white marble counters that appeared unused copper pots hanging from a castiron ceiling rack everything else brushed steel maria thomas plinked a counter with a fingernail marbles good for rolling pastry dough not cooking no one did serious food here didnt know you were into the culinary arts maria im not my daughter is that translates to shes the one gets addicted to top chef im the one pays tuition at some overpriced institute in new york now she wants to spend next summer in france learning how to properly slice onions this is a kid who survived the first four years of her life on hot dogs and chocolate milk she fingered a crisp tweed lapel her hair was sprayed in place not helmetstiff a higher level of fixative that lent the illusion of softness an expensivelooking phone dangled from her other hand some mess huh milo said its a step up from what not from for he said the offender he took risks with the husband in order to get to the wife earned himself a twofer kicked up the thrill level but you know that already seeing as youve been here for a while she stared at him someones touchy he turned his back on her interesting move she outranked him significantly hed been there when shed screwed up had never exploited it maybe maria figured that gave him a certain power maybe that would eventually work against him okay she said lets clear the air right now so we can go about our respective businesses thought we were in the same business thomass gray eyes turned to pond pebbles im here because the chief has been following this since the second one misterconsulting her phonequigg the reason the chief was informed early is someone thought a serial pattern might be forming and that the details were sufficiently out of the ordinary for the chief to need to be apprised dont ask who informed him thats irrelevant i couldnt care less about any of that maria all i want to do is clear four murders thats what we all want think theres a remote chance of your accomplishing it anytime in the near future you betcha boss he said everything will be giftwrapped and presented for your approval byreading his timexnine fortythree tonight give or take a nanosecond also on the schedule is the capture of osamas entire organization but in the meantime be sure to warn his amazingness to treat any packages from pakistan with caution hey is there a remote chance what kind of question is that maria you think this is writing traffic tickets ah the temper she winked the classic irish temper and i can say that because half my family traces back to county derry whoopee for genealogy maria is there a point to this conversation thomas caressed marble ran a finger under the counter rim indulge yourself milo keep venting get all the bad feeling out so we can both do our jobs like grownups she turned to me seeking confirmation of something i kept studying the doublewide refrigerator no magnets no memos or photos nothing like a blank panel of steel to keep one fascinated maria thomas turned back to milo you bet its a reasonable question whens the last time you dealt with a serial remotely similar to this milo a necktie of guts jesus its beyond disgusting he didnt answer she said i cant see any common thread among the victims other than theyre all white can you not yet not yet she repeated to me you ever see anything like this a sexual psychopath who throws such a wide net milo said its not necessarily sexual then what some kind of grudge the first victim was engaged in a bigtime lawsuit and i just found a financial complaint in mr parnells desk i saw that she said you cant seriously think a money thing led to that and what about mr quigg he sue anyone or vice versa nothings come up yet you shouldve checked his financials i have and you havent found anything so the answers no not nothings come up meaning theres no common thread meaning a money things less than unlikely you go along with his theory dr delaware you dont see this as a sexual psychopath cant say cant or wont i dont see the point of guessing so far ive heard nothing but guessingall right enough of this pleasantry im expected to go back to the boss and report something what do you suggest milo milo said tell him each time the killer strikes he increases the possibility of a lead in the meantime ill be concentrating on the parnells each time she said maybe by the time we get ten eleven victims well be in great shape very reassuring milo grinned in that lupine way teeth bared in anticipation of ripping flesh maria thomas said you always see humor when no one else does when were you planning to go to the public his perfectness thinks i should word to the wise milo you really need to stop with the obnoxious nicknames one day itll get back to him he doesnt like being perfect the public when i hadnt thought about it no thats too bad because the chief thinks it might be useful she looked over her shoulder in the direction of the bedroom given the steadily rising corpse count and something tells me he wont find your lassitude reassuring milo walked away from her again her face tensed with anger but before she could speak he circled back okay heres something to tell him if this was a confirmed sexually motivated psychopath some rapist who escalated to murder id have been talking to public affairs as soon as the second one surfaced hoping an earlier live victim would come forth the same goes for a serial asshole targeting a specific victim populationhookers convenience clerks whatever in that case thered be a moral as well as a practical benefit letting highrisk targets know so they can protect themselves but what do we go public on here maria a bogeyman stalking and butchering random citizens that risks setting off a panic with very little upside whats your alternative she said a nice collection of murder books i havent even started working these two victims maybe ill learn something that will change everything if you let me do the damn job im holding you back wasting time explaining myself is holding me back oh so youre different from anyone else back to me whats with the question mark on these two doctor i said the same thing was left with the first two victims she blinked yes of course so what does it mean could be a taunt i said milo smiled or our bad boys expressing his curiosity about what said thomas the mysteries of the human body thats grotesque you know what i thought when i saw it some weird mystical symbolism like the zodiac used to send you look into any witchcraft angles im open to anything maria meaning you havent and youre opposed to going public how many bodies will it take to get you flexible if nothing on these two good she said youre openminded when forced to be hell be happy to hear it he respects you you know im touched you really should be get back to me if you learn something sooner rather than later youre the glove said milo pardon he doesnt want to dirty his hands so he gloves up maria thomas examined her spotless manicured digits you have a way with words sure view me as a glove and bear in mind that fingerpoking can be painful chapter thomas left the scene scolding her phone drove off in a sparkling blue city sedan milo said before she stuck her nose in i was thinking about going public at some point but right now i dont see what itll accomplish and the panic things an issue i said if you release any data id choose the question marks theyre unique to our bad guy might jog someones memory he shuffled over to the parnells cars looked inside i dont make some kind of progress soon the decision wont be mine you got the point of thomas showing up behave or else more than that the chief smells a bigtime loser in these cases so hes keeping his distance he flipped his pad open wheres that lawyer who threatened barron parnell here we go william leventhal esquire representing the cameron family trust sounds like a big money deal lets see if this legal eagle earned his cut william b leventhal ran a oneman practice on olympic near sepulveda on the way over milo said booze and surprise for vita sucker punch for marlon now he does two young healthy ones i said same basic technique surprise supplemented this time by darkness barron was the serious threat so he was drawn outside blitzed and stabbed to death but no surgery not even later when our bad guy had a chance that says glenda was the primary target and with barron unlocking the door she was easy prey also her glasses were off because the two of them were planning a romantic evening and the room was dim leading to a loss of focus before she had time to figure out what was going on he was in charge we know he stalked his first two victims so he probably did the same with her you dont see it as a twofer doubling his pleasure upping the body count was a bonus but i think barron was a hurdle to jump so he could get to glenda so im wasting my time with leventhal only one way to find out i said the lawyers front office staff was a woman in her seventies at a hundredyearold desk a brass nameplate said miss dorothy band exec secy to mr wm b leventhal an ibm selectric took up half her desk near the machine sat a precisely cornered stack of elegant beige stationery a shorter pile of carbon paper and a bakelite intercom box that predated the truman administration unflustered by our dropin miss dorothy band pressed a button on the box mr l police to see you the machine barked back i paid those tickets they say its about the cameron case what about it they say they need to talk to you directly thats a civil case none of their business sir fine see yend them in the trek to leventhals inner sanctum took us past a vast law library a man was there to greet us a good ten years older than dorothy band short thick and broadshouldered william leventhal had bright burntchocolate eyes white hair still tinged rusty in spots an uncannily deep voice said police heh cmon in leventhals office was vast woodpaneled shagcarpeted in the precise green of pimiento olives redolent of dill pickles and old paper and musky aftershave heat streamed from a floor vent creating a tropical ambience william b leventhal wore a threepiece englishcut herringbone suit of heavy tweed a starched white shirt and a bolo tie held in place by a mammoth nugget of amethyst not a trace of sweat on his plump face a tweedy leprechaun he lowered himself into a tufted leather chair commodious enough to harbor a panda the girl informs me this is about cameron milo started to explain leventhal said murder you wont find the solution here never met parnell never even deposed him heh you sent him a letter he was named along with everyone else in that firm the case settled finis goodbye what firm is that sir sir said leventhal a kid with manners i like that if you must know the miscreants in question are lakewood parriser and dibono alleged money managers parnell worked there as a fixedincome specialist in plain terms boys he bought bonds for rich people the cameron trust is an inspired creation that has allowed two generations of nottoobright camerons to avoid gainful employment parnells investments didnt do well they did fine said leventhal though a trained parakeet couldve handled the task were talking triplea conservative investments you read a daily list and pick or peck if youre a parakeet heh then why did you in order to proceed optimally against the primary scoundrels i was required to name everyone through whose hands cameron money had passed he rubbed chubby palms together i got to sue their office manager their human resources person their bookkeepers the cleaning crews fortunate they werent named heh the scoundrels were lakewood leventhal ticked a finger dibono parriser not necessarily in that order what im getting at said milo is the nature of their scam no scam said leventhal i never said scam no no no no ooow a clear case of deceit wouldve been easy to ferret out no these geniuses were subtle promising verbally to invest in secure products but engaging in all sorts of risky nonsense commodity futures derivatives inadequately secured real estate loans the veneer of solidity but once you looked closely a house of cards he winked i sued their outside accountant brought the lot of them to their knees so the camerons never lost money preventive medicine boys the rascals tried to claim that the original terms of the trust gave them lifetime control i put the lie to that notion the left side of leventhals mouth rose and now the camerons remain free to avoid honest labor congratulations said milo virtue is its own reward young man no actually a fat contingency commission is far better recompense so who murdered poor mr parnell whom ive never met thats what were trying to find out well you wont find out here was the wife involved why do you ask that because she was a battleax i say that because when we served parnell she was abusive to the server he described her with the b word but ill stick with battleax because memories of my mother washing my mouth out with soap still linger the process server told you this hes my greatgrandson of course he told me wed like to speak with him suit yourselves said leventhal rattling off an international number thats england brians international cell phone brian cohn no e cambridge university hes on fellowship international relations whatever that is jesus college brian cohn at jesus college heh tell him he owes me ten hours of work youre thinking the wife was involved she was definitely involved said milo shes also dead i see did her death occur within the same approximate time frame as mr parnells yes sir both bodies at the scene sir ill take that as a yes said leventhal wouldnt the obvious answer be murdersuicide why would you think that sir because when a couple expires in a nearsimultaneous manner we always zeroed in on the murdersuicide angle and we were almost invariably correct im referring to back in the day when i did criminal prosecution at the brooklyn da two bodies weapon on the scene first thing wed look for was one party going berserk and victimizing the alleged loved one you could put money on it sometimes we did office pools and such that didnt happen here mr leventhal youre certain we are okay hmm did the wife have a boyfriend did he have a girl friend was money taken jewelry other valuables do acquaintances imply loss of mental control for one of the partiessome sort of personality disintegration how were the two of them dispatched gun knife blunt object none of the above milo said sorry we cant of course you cant said leventhal because if you could you might stumble upon someone with half a brain sixtytwo years of legal experience onethird of that prosecutorial but why make your life easier he sprang up and waved us to the door despite your reticence ill reiterate some sage advice boys check out the wife even without a murdersuicide angle we always hurt the one we love and someone as shorttempered as her was bound to evoke hostility take a close look to see if shed engaged in any sort of emotional dustup recently if you find out she had a boyfriend to boot were talking emotional tnt thanks for the tip sir no problem said leventhal i wont even bill you milo called cambridge from the car brian cohn picked up sounding hungover yuh milo explained cohn said this is england man you know what time it is he coughed cleared his throat phlegmladen laughter oh man there he goes again who wild bill aka greatestgrandpa he gets up at four am so we all have to hes quite a guy says you owe him ten hours of work yada yada yada by his calculation which was probably done on an abacus cohn laughed again a female voice sounded in the background one sec babe yawn okay im quasiawake what do you need to know about that crazy shrew tell us about your encounter why shes dead oh thats too bad even for someone like that milo said like what hostile no one likes to be served but the worst you usually get is a sneer some cursing she came to the door wearing her white coat i figured good a doctor someone rational because plenty of times youre dealing with neanderthals this was one of those deals where i didnt need to hand it to parnell personally just ascertain his primary residence and verify that someone had accepted it i used the flower ruse bought some cheap ones at the supermarket she came to the door said is this from barry hold on ill get you a tip i said not necessary handed her the papers informed her shed just accepted service and split she came after me running into the street screaming im a lowlife then she grabbed me by the shoulder tried to force the paper back on me first time anyone ever got physical other than one drunk guy and that time i was prepared took a friend who played halfback at the u from a woman let alone a doctor i wasnt ready for it im trying to peel her off me her nails are digging in my arm the papers are flying all over the place finally i free myself and get the hell out of there so what she pissed someone off and they killed her dont know yet well said brian cohn id sure look into that possibility as we drove away from leventhals building milo said another tough personality shades of vita without quigg stuck between the two of them id say we had ourselves a nice little pattern women with short fuses be interesting to see if glendas coworkers saw her that way interesting would be okay he said intriguing would be better chapter north hollywood day hospital was an offwhite sugar cube on a marginal block of

smogburst of tobacco when we got close he stepped in front of the door and folded his arms across his chest milo said youre kidding huh a pro like you cant sniff out a big clue wuh clue we aint selling catheters marshal dillon out came the badge the guard shifted just wide enough to clear the entry fast learner said milo and we strode past him the waiting area was bright stuffy standing room only despair vied with boredom for the dominant emotion wheelchairs walkers oxygen tanks abounded anyone who seemed physically okay looked psychologically stricken all the joy of death row the queue at the reception window was a dozen deep milo pushed past and rapped his knuckles on the glass the woman on the other side kept clicking computer keys he rapped again her eyes remained on her keyboard third times the charm she snapped just hold on a speaker box transformed her voice into something metallic and unwelcoming or maybe that was just her milo banged hard enough to vibrate the glass and the receptionist wheeled teeth bared ready to confront the badge silenced her and she took it out on a button under her desktop stabbing viciously a door on the far side of the waiting room gave off a loud click someone said how come he gets to jump milo said because im handsome another large but soft guard waited on the other side behind him was a beige corridor lined with doors the same color identical hue also for the vinyl flooring and the plastic signs directing the infirm toward exam exam ecru faces on the patients as well welcome to planet bread dough police what for said the guard i need to talk to dr glenda usfelparnells boss the guards lips moved as he tried to get his mouth around the hyphenation milo said get me the head of nuclear medicine the guard reached into his pocket and drew out a wilted piece of paper um thats usfel g not anymore whos her boss i dunno how long you been working here three weeks tomorrow you know dr usfel you dont hardly see the doctors they go in and out through there pointing to a door at the end of the hallway whos the big boss that would be mr ostrovine that would be who you go find the man who burst through the rear door wore a toosnug gray suit of ambiguous cloth a blue shirt with a high stiff collar and a pink paisley tie that had never gone near a silkworm with better fabrics the result wouldve been foppish this screamed trying too hard the same went for fruity aftershave a scary tan and a toupee that landed well short of possible mick ostrovine how can i help you were here about dr usfel what about her shes deceased ostrovines spray tan drained to the ambient beige glenda she worked a double shift yesterday she was fine what happened someone broke into her home and killed her oh my god thats insane her home some kind of home invasion were sorting things out mr ostrovine a nearby door opened silent as the gillslit on a shark a heavy woman in scrubs pushed a wheelchair toward us her passenger was an ancient man wrapped in a blanket hairless blueveined slumped barely conscious hey mr o she said got all them tests run taking him to the physical therapy for that exercise sure sure said ostrovine his abruptness made her blink as the chair rolled past another exam room disgorged a burly man brandishing a crutch the implement was tucked under one arm he took a couple of unaided steps saw us placed his weight on the device and assumed an exaggerated limp mr o he said gonna get myself some hydrotherapy good good said ostrovine when a third door opened and a twentyyearold girl came skipping out waving a shiny chromium cane like a cheerleaders baton milo said could we go somewhere to talk nudging me you know hospitals handle this ostrovines office was a beige rectangle that faced the parking lot the rest of the hospitals rear section housed orthopedics nuclear medicine physical medicine anesthesiology radiology not a bed in sight i said you do outpatient care were adjunctive said ostrovine settling behind a desk bare but for a laptop the room looked unused meaning we fill a niche whats that ostrovine sighed were better equipped than a clinic and more efficiently specialized than a larger institution we dont do er so that frees us up for other modes of delivery our primary specialty is aftercare pain management disability evaluation lifestyle readjustment what was dr usfels specialty glenda ran nuke med thats cuttingedge technology assessing how parts of the body are actually working as opposed to conventional radiology which is primarily static nuke uses dyes radioisotopes to capture ongoing function he shook his head and the toupee shifted downward he nudged it back in place without a trace of selfconsciousness glenda was terrific this is horrible i said howd she get along with patients and staff everyone here gets along did she have an easygoing personality ostrovines jaw rotated settled slightly left of center what are you getting at weve heard she could display a bit of temper i dont know what you heard but it doesnt apply to her performance here so anyone we talk to here is going to tell us she was easygoing he unbuttoned his suit jacket let out an inch of abdomen sucked it back in refastened glenda was businesslike efficient but not touchyfeely she never had a problem with anyone i said you cant think of anyone whod resent her i cannot who are her friends here he thought i suppose she didnt socialize much on the job were taskoriented anyway a lot of our employees are floats whod she work with most closely that would be her technicians wed like to talk to them ostrovine opened the laptop typed the tech on duty today is cheryl wannamaker shes fairly new i doubt she can tell you much well give her a try anyway and please give us the names of the others what makes you think glendas work had anything to do with what happened to her we need to look at everything i suppose said ostrovine but in this case youd be best off looking outside the workplace were low on drama run a business not a production company insurance business the business of wellness often involves thirdparty payment do you deal a lot with wellstart we deal with everyone if i give you some names could you check if theyve been your patients impossible said ostrovine confidentialitys our first commandment how about checking and if the names arent there we wont have to come back with subpoenas im afraid i cant do that i understand as im sure you will when we show up with the appropriate paperwork and all those tasks youre oriented toward come to a grinding halt ostrovine flashed oversized dental caps is this really necessary guys im sure glendas tragedy had nothing to do with work milo said maybe you should switch careers and become a detective fine give me those names but if they are here i cant give you details vita berlin keyboard arpeggio sigh of relief no next marlon quigg no again now if theres nothing more dr usfels techs oh said ostrovine that fine ill call cheryl for you cheryl wannamaker was young stoic dreadlocked with a jamaican lilt to her speech we talked to her in the parking lot near a black mercedes parked in m ostrovine s spot the news of glenda usfelparnells death seemed not to impact her immediately then her eyes got wet and her chin shook another one maam said milo lost my nephew she said two weeks ago hit by a drunk driver im so sorry dejon was twelve she wiped her eyes now dr u this world dear god how long did you work with dr u five weeks anyone have a beef with her not that i saw what kind of person was she she was an okay person said cheryl wannamaker friendly sure she smiled actually not so much she was all about lets get the work done and go home not a lot of chitchat no chitchat at all sir that create tension not for me said wannamaker i dont like wasting time what about others everything seemed okay weve heard she had a temper well said wannamaker she kind of did whod she get mad at not mad more like grumpy when things got backed up when people didnt do what she wanted howd she show her grumpiness shed get all quiet cheryl wannamaker licked her lips too quiet like a kettle gonna overflow what happened when she overflowed she never did she just got that heavy quiet thing going youd talk to her she wouldnt answer even though you knew she heard you so you just guessed what she wanted and hoped it was what she wanted you never saw her go off on anyone never she said but i heard someone went off on her who some patient said wannamaker before my time i just heard about it whatd you hear someone lost it in the scan room who told you margaret she said margaret wheeling shes on when im off how long before you arrived did this happen i couldnt say but people were still talking about it when you began work no just margaret to educate me about dr u what she was like how she could be tough when the patient went off on her she didnt back down stood right up to him and said calm down or leave right now and he did margaret was saying we all needed to be assertive like that because you never know whats going to walk in did that patient ever show up again couldnt tell you sir margaret tell you anything else about dr usfel she said when doctor gets quiet give her space where can we find margaret right here said cheryl wannamaker producing a cell phone i have her number margaret wheeling lived a quarter hour from her job in a town house on laurel canyon just north of riverside she opened the door holding a glass of ice water milo gave her the news gently she said oh my god im sorry to have to tell you dr u she said glenda come in rawboned and ruddy with curly gray hair and unadorned yellowgray eyes she led us to a living room heavy on golden maple furniture and needlepoint pillows toby mugs filled a glassfront cabinet another was chocked with souvenir ashtrays with an emphasis on national parks and nevada casinos a jowly man sat drowsing on a sofa sports pages spread on his lap my husband said margaret wheeling sounding proud of the fact she kissed his forehead lightly don theyre here don wheeling blinked stood shook our hands she told him about glenda usfel he said youre kidding oh don isnt that horrid he cupped the bottom of her chin you be okay meg ill be fine go use the bedroom take a real nap you need me you know where to find me meg when he was gone she said don was in law enforcement rode a motorcycle for tulsa pd for a year back when he was right out of the service by the time i met him he was already in asphalt and concrete please sit some cookies coffee tea soda no thanks said milo margaret wheeling said dr u murdered i still cant believe it you have any idea who did it unfortunately we dont cheryl wannamaker told us about a patient who gave dr u a hassle that small thing why would anyone kill over something like that tell us about it it was stupid said wheeling one of those stupid things dr u keeps the temp low in the scan room for the machines this idiot got all huffy because we didnt have blankets because the linen service hadnt delivered that morning not our fault i tried to explain to him but he got abusive abusive how cursing me out saying i was stupid like its my fault the service screwed up whatd you do called dr u she said she makes decisions i just follow directions then what happened he started in with her im cold you should have a blanket a grown man but he acted like a spoiled kid she told him to calm down its not the end of the world well do the procedure quickly and get you out of here he called her the same names he called me that was it for dr u she went up to him told him off not loud but firm whatd she say that his behavior was out of line and he needed to leave now i said no second chance he had his chance said wheeling we had a waiting room full of scans who needed him the idiot probably thought her being a woman he could intimidate her it was a little chilly sure but its not like he didnt have insulation what do you mean plenty of body fat and obviously he wasnt screwed on too tight because he came in wearing a heavy coat and it wasnt cold outside just the opposite not that at first he looked like a weirdo that being the case id have called security from the beginning he seemed okay real quiet then it was just like he came apart do you call security a lot when i need to we get all types but this guy set off no warning bells i guess i shouldve noticed that crazy coat but im not looking at them im checking the machines he came apart went from normal to ticked off like that snapping her fingers scary i said but dr usfel handled it shes tough went to med school in guadalajara mexico told me she saw things there you wouldnt see in the states you dont really think that guy had anything to do with it i mean how would he find her and this was like two months ago and he never came back i said what else can you tell us about him just what i told you white normallooking thirty thirtyfive cleanshaven yup hair brown short pretty neat appearance actually except for that crazy coat were talking heavyduty winter wear one of those shearlings what color some kind of brown i think any distinguishing marks like scars tattoos unusual features she thought no he looked like a regular person to get scanned hed need paperwork did you see his we dont see paperwork the front desk handles all that they come in with a daychart that has an id number not even a name i said what procedure was he sent for who remembers i gave her time she shook her head im not sure i even looked milo said how about you sit down with an artist and help produce a drawing youre saying it was him no maam but weve got to nail down every detail we can if were gonna solve dr usfels murder my name wouldnt be on it right she said the drawing of course not really youd be wasting your time all id tell an artist is what i just told you would you be willing to give it a try to help us out i can totally keep myself out of it absolutely she crossed a leg scratched a bare ankle you really think its important honestly ms wheeling we dont know but unless you can tell us of some other person dr u had problems with weve got to follow up what kind of person would go kill someone over a small thing not a normal person thats for sure an artist i dont know milo said back when don was in law enforcement ill bet he appreciated any help he could get i suppose said margaret wheeling okay ill try but youre wasting your time he just looked like a regular person chapter wheelings door closed behind us and we headed for the unmarked milo said heavyset guy in a shearling usfel pissed him off royally no doubt vita did too he frowned and somehow nice mr quigg managed to get on his bad side i said his confrontation with usfel was a brief onetimer that took on huge proportions in his mind only so his brushes with the others wouldnt need to be dramatic touchy fellow leading to increased element of surprise we got in the car i said one thing different about usfel is he tied her up maybe because hed seen her in action knew she was tough enough to be a threat not so tough that she didnt give in easily alex there was no sign of struggle in that bedroom he could have controlled her with a gun she probably expected to be raped figured on negotiating her life had no idea what he was really after if he used a gun on usfel he couldve done the same for the others knock knock pizza delivery heres my little steel friend vita being drunk would have made his job easier and a guy like quigg wouldnt have fought back okay lets put a face on this choirboy he called alex shimoff a hollenbeck detective with serious artistic talent whom hed used before when shimoffs cell and home lines didnt pick up he left a message and tried petra connor at hollywood division same story he turned on the engine i dont get my blankie i gut you theres a reasonable motive i said that place is an insurance mill and vita was involved in a lawsuit maybe she and shearling met there or at a place like it though vitas alleged damages were emotional she wouldnt have needed any scans and i cant see wellstart paying for them maybe her lawyer had a deal with ostrovine or someone like him problem is i cant find out who handled the suit wellstart wont say and because it settled early nothing was filed ill try them again he headed for the station a few miles later i thought of something wanting a blanket even though hes overdressed could be a psychiatric issue but it could also mean his temperature regulation really is off and that could be due to a physical condition such as the first thing that comes to mind is low thyroid function nothing severe enough to incapacitate him but just enough to make him put on a few pounds and feel chilly and hypothyroidism can also increase irritability perfect he said he ever gets caught some lawyer claims diminished capacity due to bad glands i like the other thing you said he and vita crossed paths during some medical procedure a waiting room spat given vitas level of tact i can see her dissing his damn coat and that being enough was there anything in the paper wellstart showed you that said she got medically evaluated nope but who knows hell given the fact that this guys obviously unbalanced maybe he and vita ran into each other at shackers office shackers got a separate exit so patients dont cross paths but anythings possible why dont you call him see if he knows shearling he wasnt that comfortable talking about vita and asking him to identify a patient would be off the table ethically unless you could show imminent danger to a specific person the specific persons his next damn victim yeah youre right but bug him anyway i need to do something i made the call left a message on shackers voicemail he said thanks any other ideas i said ostrovine buckled when we threatened to shut him down for a day if he was lying about vita maybe hell eventually give up the info lets go back there he said hanging a u he balks ill grab that stupid rug on his head and hold it for ransom this time ostrovine kept us waiting for twenty minutes when we entered his office there were papers on the desk columns of numbers probably financial spreadsheets he put down a gold cross pen and said what now lieutenant milo told him youre kidding nothing funny about dr usfels murder sir of course not said ostrovine but i cant help you first of all ive never heard about any confrontation between glenda and any patient second i still dont believe glendas death had anything to do with her work here and third like i told you i have no knowledge of anyone named vita berlin we know a confrontation occurred said milo how come there wasnt a report obviously dr usfel never informed security of the need for one because she viewed it as insignificant ostrovine laid his hands flat on the desk milo had pulled his chair close the wig was in reach of his long arm and frankly so do i who referred this guy to you how can i tell you that when i dont even know his name check the patient list for that day he wouldnt be on there because incompletes arent recorded not even their referrals not anything said ostrovine why would we pile up extraneous data as is weve got storage issues what if the patient was referred for another procedure that was completed youre asking me to examine my entire patient database just white males seen two months ago give or take two weeks either way thats huge said ostrovine and what will i be looking for inappropriate clothing we dont list attire in our charts just tease out white males in a particular age range and well take it from there no can do lieutenant even if we had the manpower for that kind of scavenger hunt were legally forbidden in terms of manpower i can send you a couple of detectives thats generous of you said ostrovine but it doesnt solve the main problem rooting around in patient records without clear justification is illegal milo waited ostrovine fiddled with his pen placed his hand on his toupee as if anticipating attack look guys glenda was one of ours her death is a tragedy and if i could help you id jump at the opportunity but i cant you have to understand then well have to go the subpoena route sir which would cause all those delays we discussed before ostrovine clicked his tongue we didnt discuss anything lieutenant sturgis you threatened me i understand that youve got an important job to do but further intimidation is not going to work ive talked to our attorneys and they say itll never get that far milo stood guess well just have to see we wont see anything lieutenant the rules are clear im sorry i really am but what took place in the scan room was just one of those things business as usual people as usual said ostrovine put enough of them together and heads will bump thats a far cry from murder human nature said milo you learn about it from all those insurance scams you do ostrovines smile sped toward sincere screeched to a halt just short of the goal i learned about it from reality on the way back to the station dr bern shacker returned my call ten to the hour catching up between patients i thanked him he said the police have caught someone they may have a lead i described the man in the shearling silence doctor but no ones been caught so youre telling me this because were wondering if vita crossed paths with him perhaps during an evaluation i dont want to put you in a bind but it could be a tarasoff situation imminent danger he said to whom hes killed two other people thats horrible but obviously theyre no longer in danger its a tough situation bern i know i know dreadful well fortunately he isnt a patient of mine no one in my practice dresses like that okay thanks selfswaddling he said that smells a bit like schizophrenia no or a medical problem such as hypothyroidism hmm interesting yes i suppose so but id still lean toward the psychological in view of what hes done and it sounds as if hes reacting to threat at the core psychotics are helpless no fear biters not attack dogs true what a mess said shacker poor vita all the others as well just before we turned onto butler alex shimoff called back you need another masterpiece lieutenant youre the man detective last time was easy said shimoff dr delawares girlfriend had a good eye for detail she gave me a lot to work with nothing like a challenge said milo im married with children i know about challenge sure whats your schedule ill get back to you with a time and place tomorrow would be good said shimoff got a day off my wife wants me to take her shopping you can help me get out of it back at his desk milo phoned dc maria thomas told her of his intention to release a suspect drawing and the question marks to the media asked her to facilitate with public affairs she said cart before horse milo pardon go get your rendering but nothing gets facilitated until the basic decision is reified thats a fancy word for it turns real that means the chief clears it his orders do anyone elses matter she hung up milo cursed and called margaret wheeling shed had enough time to retreat from the offer to cooperate claimed she really hadnt seen the man in the shearling well enough to be useful he worked with her for a while to get her to agree to the sitdown with shimoff he was reaching for a panatela when his phone rang homicide sturgis better be said a raspy brooklyntinged voice this is your fucking extension afternoon sir the chief said when all else fails go the artistic route whatever works sir you have enough to turn out a decent enough drawing cause we probably wont get more than one bite of the apple and i dont want to waste it on some ambiguous bullshit me neither sir but at this point nothing else has worked youre stuck youre freaking out about more victims popping up i get it sturgis which is why i swallowed my pride and put in a call to a guy i know at the bureau who is a lardass pencilpusher but used to be a behavioral sciences honcho at quantico not that i think their bullshit profiles are more than a carny show which is why i called him personally said forget your stupid questionnaire and just give me something off the top of your head about a loony who snaps necks then cuts out guts and plays with them he gave me bigtime ph d wisdom so now youre going to hear it white male twentyfive to fifty probably a loner probably doesnt have a happy domestic life probably going to be living in a weird home situation probably jacks off when he thinks about what he did that any worse than what delawares given you so far so what does this suspect whose image you want to foist on a neurotic public look like white thirty to forty there you go said the chief science milo said he wears a heavy coat in all sorts of weather big deal hes concealing a weapon that could be part of it sir but dr delaware says it could be a sign of mental illness does he the chief laughed big fucking genius id say ripping peoples intestines out covers that base pretty well i said it sure does silence i figured you were there doctor hows life treating you fine that makes one of us charlie sends his regards charlie was his son and the regards part was a lie a brilliant alienated kid hed asked me to write a college recommendation emailed me a couple of times a month from the seminary he was using to defer college he hated loved feared his father would never use him for a messenger i said hope hes doing well hes being charlie by the way the department still owes you some consult money on the last one true you havent bugged my office about it would it have helped dead air your loyalty in the face of our bureaucratic ineptitude is laudable doc so you concur that broadcasting this lunatics face is a good idea i think if we keep the information tight its got potential what does tight mean limit it to the artist rendering and the question marks and dont let on that anyone could theoretically be a victim yeah that would set off some skivvysoiling panic wouldnt it speaking of those question marks what the hell do they mean the fbi guy said hed never seen that before checked his files and there was nothing only similar gutting was jack the ripper and there were enough differences between our boy and jack to make that avenue a dead end dont know dont know what what the question marks mean so much for higher education what do you think about releasing details on the coat could jog some citizens memory it might also cause the bad guy to ditch the coat and youd lose potential evidence silence yeah there could be spatter on the fucking thing gut juice whatever okay keep it tight but you could still be screwedim talking to you sturgis he sees himself on the six oclock he rabbits theres always that chance sir another silence longer the chief said doctor whats your take on another victim coming up sooner rather than later hard to say that all you do sidestep questions thats a poser chief shrink humor he said i wouldnt count on getting a sitcom anytime in the near future you still awake sturgis wide awake stay that way god forbid i should sleep sir more to the point said the chief i forbid chapter alex shimoff delivered his rendering to milos office the following afternoon dont tell anyone who did this he said this is garbage the last time hed sat down to draw for milo shimoff had produced a stunningly accurate recreation of a girl whose face had been blown off what he presented this time was an ambiguous pale disk filled with bland male features color it yellow youd have mr happy faces noncommittal brother and yet it twanged a memory synapse deep in my brain had i seen him before mental scouring produced nothing milo told shimoff thanks kid dont thank me for doing crap el tee that wheeling lady couldnt come up with anything useful i hate the computer identikit but after she gave me nothing i tried it she said it confused her more too many choices she couldnt even respond to my questions wider longer rounder nothing she claimed she barely saw the guy did she seem scared i said maybe said shimoff or shes just stupid and cant process visually milo studied the likeness its better than what we had before shimoff looked ready to vomit its any piefaced white guy hey kiddo maybe this is what he actually looks like like that cartoon the kid brings in a stick figure drawing of his family on parentteacher day stick figures show up shimoff wasnt amused i tried again to figure out why the crude drawing gnawed at me blank mental screen shimoff said at art school i could get away sometimes with jokes real life it sucks to turn out garbage top of that i still have to take my wife shopping tonight clenching his fists he left milo murmured creative types and took the photo to the big detective room where he told moe reed to scan and email it to maria thomas that evening at six the rendering was featured on the news along with a sketchy tale of a westside home invader who broke his victims necks and left behind a calling card ambiguity made the story more frightening and the phones began ringing seconds after the ensuing commercial by six fifteen milo had commandeered moe reed and sean binchy to help work the lines he moved out of his office and took a desk in the big droom left unoccupied by a daywatch detective on sick leave manipulating three separate lines himself pushing buttons like a concertina player he kept the conversations brief took a few notes the most frequent notation being bs followed by schizo esp and prank reeds dominant notation was neg binchys tng when sean saw me trying to figure that out he cupped his hand over the receiver smiled and said totally no good i heard reed say yes i understand maam but you live in bakersfield theres no reason to be worried binchy absolutely sir theres no indication he has anything against samoans milo i know about the chance cards in monopoly no there wasnt one slipping out of the room i drove home thinking about victims robin said no blanket doesnt take much to set this maniac off we sat near the pond tossing pellets at the fish blanche wedged between us snoring lightly id finished a couple ounces of chivas was nursing the ice robin hadnt made much headway with a glass of riesling the night smelled of ozone and jasmine the sky was charcoal felt stretched tight a few stars peeked through like icepick wounds she said she kicks him out of the clinic and he comes back to get her months later i said maybe he took his time because planning was part of the fun for all i know he set up the confrontation to give himself an excuse even psychopaths need to selfjustify and i dont think his real motive is avenging insult its got to be rooted in fantasies hes had since childhood but he frames his victims as bad people so he can feel righteous glenda usfel maintained control by being the alpha female only this time it backfired the same probably went for berlin spreading bad cheer was her hobby but she tried it with the wrong guy what doesnt fit is brutalizing marlon quigg whos described by everyone as the mildest man on the planet maybe he wasnt always that way reformed crank people can change she smiled someone once told me that what did quigg do for a living accountant not an irs auditor by any chance not even close just a cog in a big firm sat at his desk and numbercrunched for a big grocery chain someone didnt like the tomatoes they wouldnt take it out on him did he have any outside interests no ones mentioned any family man walked his dog led a quiet life before that he taught disabled kids were talking a softie rob totally different from the other two victims interesting switch she said what is trading a job where youre constantly dealing with people for one where you stare at ledgers all day his wife said the money wasnt there so he took the cpa exam im sure thats it you have your doubts it just seems like a radical shift alex but money is important i thought about that something happened when quigg was teaching that pushed him in a totally different direction you just said the killers motive goes back to childhood disabled kids covers a lot of territory a student with serious psychiatric issues i said revenge on the teacher oh man she said what if quigg left teaching because he encountered a student who scared him out of the profession i know its farfetched but you just said this guy loves the thrill of the hunt what if now that hes an adult hes decided to revisit old enemies the sky seemed to darken and drop stars receding robin tried to flex her fingers and i realized i was squeezing her hand and let go im just tossing stuff out she said raising the wineglass to her lips good vintage but tonight it evoked a frown and she put it aside lets change the subject i said mind if i make a call belle quigg said who is this i repeated my name i was at your home the other day and also with lieutenant sturgis oh youre the other one has something happened about marlon i have a few more questions mrs quigg how long ago did marlon teach school a long time why were being thorough i dont understand i said the more we know about marlon the better our chances of catching whoever did that to him did that she said you can say killed i say it i think it i think it all the time i didnt answer she said i dont see what his teaching has to do with it that was years ago this is a madman who killed marlon and louie and it had nothing to do with anything marlon did or said im sure youre right maam but if you could marlon didnt teach at a school he taught at a hospital ventura state once the largest psychiatric facility in the state longshuttered how long ago this was before we got married id just met him and he told me he used to be a teacher so at least twentyfour years ago what kind of disabled children did he teach he just said disabled she said he didnt talk much about it and i wasnt that curious that kind of things not for me marlon said the reason he quit was the pay was awful thats why he was doing bookkeeping for the city studying for his cpa also he found out the hospital was closing down told me years later thats the real reason he quit he didnt want to be left stranded howd he feel about the closure it bothered him because of the kids he said where will they go belle that was marlon he cared chapter niceguy marlon quigg had lied to his wife there had been no plans to close ventura state back when he worked there i knew that because id been there weeks before the hospital had emptied hired by a law firm representing two wards of wheelchairbound minimally functioning children facing a terrifyingly ambiguous future i evaluated each patient and made detailed recommendations for the aftercare promised by the state some of what i advised was put into effect mostly the state reneged several years before that well after quigg had already quit id rotated through as an intern augmenting my training at langley porter with a month of observation at the largest mental hospital west of the mississippi that spring id set out from san francisco at sundown slept on the beach in san simeon and watched elephant seals lolling ended up in camarillo by midmorning where i showered and dressed in the restroom of a public beach checked my map and got back on the freeway a poorly marked road slanting east of the had guided me inland over a dry creek past empty fields copses of native sycamore and oak and australian eucalyptus that had long made themselves comfortable in southern california for the next few miles nothing hinted at the hospitals presence then a twentyfoot gate of heavyduty iron painted red snapped into view just around a severe bend and forced me to brake hard a watchful guard checked my id frowned pointed to a five mph sign and buzzed me through snailing through more twisting shaded road i came to a stop at the mouth of a stadiumworthy parking lot full of cars rising behind the auto glare were buildings sheathed in dun stucco and prettied by moldings medallions pediments and arched loggias most of the windows were grilled in that same rusty red city of the sad decades before ventura state had gained infamy as a place where anything went if a doctor said so a host of horrors had taken place behind its walls until world war ii drew the doctors to europe and the pacific and the holocaust got people thinking harder about degradation of personal liberty lobotomies and other untested surgeries crude versions of shock and insulin therapy forced commitment of those labeled a nuisance forced sterilizations of those deemed unfit to breed reforms had been drastic and thorough and the hospital had gained a reputation for enlightenment and humanism i was eager to experience a new clinical setting and to be back in southern california i spent my first two days in orientation sessions delivered by a nursing supervisor accompanied by freshly minted psychiatric residents other psychology interns newhire nurses and orderlies once educated we were free to explore the grounds with the exception of the easternmost end where a compound marked specialized care sat an orderly asked the training nurse what specialized meant she said unique situations it varies and went on to the next topic with hours to go before my first assignment i wandered the campus staggered by the dimensions and ambitions of the place the nearworshipful silence of the other rookies as they explored told me i wasnt alone in my reaction built in the twenties as the california state mental hygiene sanitarium at ventura the place that had come to be known as vstate was graced by a combination of old world craftsmanship and new deal optimism that had created some of the finest public buildings in the state in the case of the hospital that meant twentyeight buildings on over two hundred fifty acres pink flagstone pathways slinked through the grounds like rosy streams flower beds were riotous with color shrubs appeared trimmed by nail scissors the entire property sat in a shallow valley graced by fogcapped mountains on three sides auxiliary structures on the west end kept the hospital selfsufficient refrigeration house butcher dairy vegetable and fruit gardens bowling alley two movie theaters and a concert stage employee dorms onsite police and fire departments selfsufficiency was partly the product of noble rehabilitative intentions it also shielded the rest of ventura county from neighbors locked up by reason of insanity deficiency and unique situations i spent my entire month with children more advanced than the unfortunates i evaluated years later but still too impaired to handle school more often than not an organic factor was at play seizure disorders postencephalitic brain injury genetic syndromes and puzzling groups of symptoms that decades later would be labeled autismspectrum disorder but were classified back then by a variety of terms the one i remembered was idiopathic neurosocial irregularity i spent sixty hours a week honing my observational skills doing some testing and receiving solid training in child psychopathology play therapy cognitive restructuring and applied behavioral analysis most important i learned humility and the value of reserving judgment vstate was no place for those craving heroism when improvement occurred it was gradual and minuscule i learned to fuel each day with a mantra keep your goals specific and realistic be happy when anything goes well at first glance the hospital was a pastoral retreat from reality but i came to learn that turgid silence could be shattered without warning by screams and mewls and the crack of what sounded like wood on flesh from the easternmost tip of the campus specialized care was a hospital within a hospital a cluster of low mean structures nudging up against an eastern butte of granite sectioned by the everpresent red iron fencing topped by razor wire the bars were stouter the windows skimpier behind the fence uniformed guards patrolled irregularly mostly the surrounding yard was unoccupied never once did i spot a patient one day i asked my supervisor what went on there an elegant grayhaired psychologist gertrude vanderveul was american but britishtrained at the maudsley hospital fond of beautifully tailored suits and inexpensive sensible shoes passionate about mahler but otherwise dismissive of postbach music a former research assistant to anna freud during the london years lovely woman but far too attached to daddy to acquire a conventional social life the day i posed the question gertrude was supervising me outdoors because the weather was perfect we walked the hospital grounds under a cloudless sky the air fragrant as fresh laundry drinking coffee and reviewing my cases that done she shifted the focus to a discussion of the limitations of piagets methodology encouraging me to give my opinions excellent she said your insights are acute thanks i said could i ask you about specialized care she didnt answer thinking she hadnt heard i began to repeat myself she held up a silencing finger and we continued our stroll a few moments later she said that place isnt for you dear boy im too green theres that she said also i like you when i didnt reply she said trust me on this alex had marlon quigg learned the same thing through direct experience interesting career switch smart girl robin i went out back to tell her she might be onto something but shed left the pond and her studio windows were lit and i could hear the whir of a saw i returned to my office and phoned milo quigg didnt teach at a school he worked at ventura state hospital okay distracted i said he may have given his wife a phony reason for changing careers and that makes me wonder if somethingor someoneat vstate scared him i recounted the unsettling sounds id heard from specialized care gertrudes protectiveness that could be quiggs connection he said patient with an old grudge how long ago are we talking alex quigg was out of there twentyfour years ago but our guy could have a long memory twentyfour years and something sets him off killing sets him off i said he got into the swing thought back to his bad old days at vstate kill teach so quigg wasnt such a softie back then not necessarily for someone with paranoid tendencies it couldve been a wrong look anything wonderful but other than you think quigg fibbed theres no proof he actually worked that special ward not yet but ill keep digging fine lets talk after i get back where you going to meet victim number five oh no when body just turned up this time it was hollywood division that got lucky petra caught it shes a tough girl but she sounded pretty shaken im on my way over now whats the address dont bother he said its already a circus and you know what youre gonna see okay he exhaled look im not sure im gonna be kept on word is his grandiloquence is reassessing so theres no sense you ruining your night top of that im fielding a pile of useless tips and i have a sitdown with usfels and parnells families at an airport hotel first thing tomorrow morning both sets of parents this is gonna be rollicking a murder so soon after the media play felt like a taunt and i reassessed my theory about the question marks figured milo had been right i went to my office sat at the computer and shuffled varying combinations of ventura state hospital criminally insane child murderer young disembowel question mark when that pulled up nothing useful i spent some time wondering if shimoffs drawing had stimulated my memory because years ago id seen a younger version of the roundfaced man on the grounds of vstate a patient id worked with or just passed in the wards a dangerous kid whod eluded specialized care because hed been smooth enough to fool the staff and remain on an open ward hospital teachers spent more time with patients than anyone had marlon quigg noticed something about a deeply disturbed boy that everyone else had missed had he spoken up and convinced the doctors about the need for extreme confinement motive for a majorleague grudge but milos question remained why wait so long to wreak vengeance because the dangerous kid had turned into a truly frightening adult and had been locked up all these years now released he sets about righting wrongs locating quigg stalking him grooming him with cordial greetings during quiggs dogwalk in the park recognizing quigg but no reason for quigg to associate a child with a grown man in a shearling guess why im doing this ha ha ha gertrude vanderveul had known enough about what went on at specialized care to keep me away trust me on this alex maybe now shed agree to tell me why i looked for her in cyberspace starting with the apa directory and the state psychology board website and fanning out from there she wasnt listed anywhere but a magnus vanderveul md practiced ophthalmology in seattle maybe kin maybe not and too late in the day to find out i played with the computer some more hit nothing but sour notes was feeling cranky when robin and blanche returned to the house worked hard at faking pleasant blanche sensed my true mood right away but she licked my hand and nuzzled my leg a cobby little wrinkly bundle of empathy robin was there a second later whats the matter i told her about quiggs lie you might have put it together lady sherlock she said what kind of things did the scariest kids do dont know because i never saw them i described specialized care gertrudes protectiveness couldnt get her to explain im trying to locate her maybe shell be more open work on her maternal instincts how so tell her all youve accomplished make her proud and confident milo hadnt gotten in touch by ten the following morning nothing about the latest victim appeared in the news and i figured the chief had kept things tight i tried dr magnus vanderveuls office in seattle a woman answered lasik by design doctor was busy with procedures all day but if i wanted information about myopia or presbyopia shed be happy to transfer me to an educational recording appreciate that but i need to speak to dr vanderveul personally regarding his mother and i are old friends and im trying to get in touch with her im afraid thats impossible said the receptionist she passed last year doctor flew to the funeral im sorry i said feeling that on multiple levels where was the funeral a second of silence sir ill give him your message bye now i found the death certificate palm beach florida downloaded the obituary from the archives of a local paper professor gertrude vanderveul had succumbed to a brief illness her tenure at vstate was noted as was a subsequent move to connecticut to teach at the university level shed published a book on child psychotherapy and served as a consultant to a white house commission on foster care ten years ago shed relocated to florida where shed advised various welfare agencies and pursued a lifelong interest in lily cultivation predeceased decades ago by an orchestra conductor husband she was survived by a son dr magnus vanderveul of redmond washington daughters dr trude prosser of glendale california and dr ava mcclatchey of vero beach and eight grandchildren contributions to the florida foundation for child development were requested in lieu of flowers trude prosser practiced clinical neuropsychology from a brand boulevard office a voicemail greeting recited by an automated voice greeted me same deal at ava mcclatcheys obstetrics group having left messages for all three of gertrudes erudite progeny i went for a run wondering if any of them would bother to call by the time i returned all three had keeping it local i started with trude this time she picked up announcing dr prosser in a sweet girlish voice this is alex delaware thanks for getting back you were one of mothers students statement not a question she supervised me during an internship rotation she was a wonderful teacher yes she was said trude prosser how can i help you i started to explain she said did mother ever talk about a murderous little monster no she never talked about any of her patients and i should tell you that while i dont know you i know about you through mother she found what you do now quite fascinating the investigative work i had no idea she was aware of it quite aware she read about some case in the paper and remembered you we were having lunch and she pointed to your name quite tickled really this was one of my trainees trude bright boy very inquisitive i kept him away from the nasty stuff but apparently i only whetted his appetite any idea what she was protecting me from i said i assumed the dangerous patients in specialized care mother felt they were untreatable that nothing psychology or psychiatry had to offer could put a dent in personality issues of that severity did she herself ever work with patients there if she did she never shared that said trude prosser not only was she ethical she avoided talking to us about work in general but she was at vstate for years so its possible she circulated there how much time did you spend with her alex a memorable month i said she was a wonderful mother father died when we were young and she raised us by herself one of my brothers teachers once asked her what the secret was to raising such wellbehaved kids did she have some kind of psychological formula she laughed the truth is at home we were wild animals but we knew enough to fake it on the outside mother nodded gravely and told the woman its very simple i lock them in a root cellar and feed them crusts and stagnant water the poor thing nearly fell over before she realized mother was having her on anyway sorry i cant help more this is going to sound strange but did the issue of question marks ever come up pardon a child who drew question marks did your mother ever allude to something like that no she said really mothers patients never came up period she was ironclad about confidentiality did she ever mention a teacher named marlon quigg marlon she said like the fish now that i can say yes to i remember the name because it became a bit of family entertainment magmy brotherwas home from college and had quickly regressed to being a loudmouthed oaf so when mother announced that someone named marlon was coming over could we please make ourselves scarce and not intrude it was an obvious cue for mag to get obnoxious insisting to mother we should ply mr fish with tuna salad and watch him wax cannibalistic of course avamy sisterand i thought that was hilarious though we were old enough not to act like blithering idiots but mag brought that out in us when he was home we all regressed and of course that spurred mag on and he began making more terrible punsmarlon had no sole marlon was getting crabby what a shrimp et cetera when mother stopped laughing she demanded that we not show our faces until the poor boy left because he was a teacher at vstate going through a rough patch and needed some bucking up she called quigg a boy hmm said trude prosser it was long ago but i believe im recalling accurately he wasnt of course he mustve been a man being a teacher but perhaps his vulnerability made her think of him as a child anyway we knew better than to mess with mother when she was waxing clinically protective so we went to a movie and by the time we got back it was just mother in the house did quigg ever show up again if he did im unaware youre wondering if something happened back then that ties in to his murder some homicidal patient killed him after all these years right now the investigations pretty much deadended so were looking at everything is there anyone else i might talk to whod remember those days at vstate mothers boss was a psychiatrist named emil cahane i think he was the assistant director of the hospital or something along those lines she spelled the name i met him a couple of timeschristmas parties that kind of thing he came for dinner a few times he was older than mother would be well into his eighties by now did you know any of her other students she never brought students home or talked about them until she pointed out that article in the paper id never heard of you so no staff person ever visited other than marlon quigg and dr cahane dr cahane coming for dinner was more social she said besides that nothing she told you quigg was having a rough patch that could mean anything i suppose but now that i think about it for mother to bend her rules it mustve been serious so perhaps youre onto something but someone bearing a grudge that long goodness thats grisly i said your brother and sister also called me back think they might have something to add mags a bit older so perhaps his perspective would be different but by then he really wasnt around very much avas the youngest i doubt shed know anything i dont but give her a try i appreciate your taking the time i appreciate your getting me to talk about mother dr ava mcclatchey said trude just called me at first i didnt even remember the guys visit once trude reminded me of mags stupid fish puns i got a vague memory but nothing trude didnt already tell you got a csection to do good luck dr magnus vanderveul said nope we went to the movies before the fellow came over and he was gone when we came back i did start to torment mother with more fish punswas he gone because she was into catch and release he chuckled the look on her face told me to cool it upset bothered he said now that i think about it that was odd mother was superwoman it took a lot to bother her chapter id never met dr emil cahane no reason for the hospitals deputy director to have contact with a floating intern if i got lucky that would change soon cahane wasnt listed in any public directories nor was he a member of the american psychiatric association any psychoanalytic institutes or scientific interest groups no active medical license in california same for the neighboring states i checked east coast locales with high concentrations of psychiatrists nothing in new england new york pennsylvania illinois new jersey florida where gertrude had ended up nothing well into his eighties the worstcase scenario loomed then a search using cahanes name pulled up a career achievement award hed received from the la mental health commission eighteen months ago an accompanying photo revealed a thin hawkish whitehaired man with a crooked smile and a listing physique that suggested a stroke or other injury cahanes listed accomplishments included his years at vstate two decades of volunteer work with abused children foster families and the offspring of military veterans hed researched posttraumatic stress disorder closed head injuries and integrated methods of pain control had endowed a study of the emotional effects of prolonged parental separation at the med school crosstown where he held a clinical professorship the same med school had graced me with an identical title twenty years of volunteer work said hed left vstate a few years after marlon quigg i phoned the med school got a receptionist who knew me and asked for a current address and number for cahane here you go doctor ventura boulevard address in encino that had to be office space no active license but working at what a woman answered crisply cahane and geraldo how may i help you this is dr delaware calling dr cahane this is the office of mister michael cahane hes a lawyer business manager i got this number from the medical school the medical schooloh she said mr cahanes uncle uses us as a maildrop dr emil cahane what is it exactly that you want i trained under dr cahane at ventura state hospital and was looking to get in touch i couldnt give out his personal information could i speak with mr cahane in a meeting when will he be free how about i give him your number statement no question thanks please let dr cahane know that another staffer from the hospital passed away and i thought he might want to know marlon quigg how sad she said without emotion you get to an age and your friends start dropping off the phone rang nine minutes later i picked it up ready with my sales pitch for dr cahane milo said petra and i are having a skull session feel free when and where in an hour the usual place cafe moghul was empty but for two slumping detectives milos everest of tandoori lamb was untouched ditto petra connors seafood salad his greeting was a choppy wave that could be misinterpreted as apathy petra managed a half smile i sat down petras a young bright homicide d working hollywood division a former commercial artist with an especially keen eye and a quiet thoughtful manner that some mistake for iciness shes got the kind of slender angular good looks that rightly or wrongly imply confidence and imperturbability thick straight black hair cut in a functional wedge is never mussed her makeups minimal but artful her eyes clear and dark she dresses in tailored black or navy pantsuits and moves with economy listens more than she talks all in all she comes across as the girl everyone looked up to in high school over the years shed let out enough personal details to tell me it hadnt been that easy today her lips were pallid and parched her eyes redrimmed every hair remained in place but her hands clasped each other with enough force to blanch fineboned knuckles one cuticle was raw she looked as if shed been on a long harrowing journey seeing it she loosened her hands placed them flat on the table milo rubbed the side of his nose a bespectacled woman came over in a swoosh of red sari silk and asked what she could get me i ordered iced tea petra ate a lettuce leaf and checked a cell phone that didnt need checking milo dared to fork some lamb into his mouth grimaced as if hed just swallowed vomit he shoved the platter away ran a finger under his belt pushed his chair back a few inches distancing himself from the notion of eating he looked at petra she said go ahead he said number five is a poor soul named lemuel eccles male cauc sixtyseven homeless street person crashed in various alleys one of which served as his final resting place east hollywood specifically just north of the boulevard just shy of western behind an auto parts store i said who found him private garbage service eccles was left next to a dumpster same technique petra flinched and muttered dear god before looking away patrol knew eccles hes got an extensive record aggressive panhandling shoplifting drunk and disorderly creating a disturbance for shoving a tourist he was in and out of county your basic revolvingdoor juicehead nuisance said milo she said obviously someone thought he was more than a nuisance to do that to him not necessarily i said both of them stared at me things wed consider petty could loom huge in our boys mind righting wrongs real or imaginary gives him justification to act out his bodyexploration fantasies petra said people irk him so he guts them insane milo patted my shoulder ergo his presence she closed her eyes massaged the lids exhaled long and slow i said glenda usfel kicked him out of the clinic vita berlin was constitutionally nasty its not hard to imagine her getting in his face and mr eccless tendency to beg with a heavy hand and become rowdy while drunk would fit too most people would walk away shearling took another approach that section of hollywoods commercial and industrial meaning at night there wouldnt be a lot of people around an elderly wino snoozing in the alley wouldve been easy prey were there any other wounds besides the abdominal incisions petra said blackandblue mark on his upper lip right under the nose a coldcock like marlon quigg but from the front because eccles was probably inebriated or sleeping in the alley could be but eccless entire body was full of bruises and most of them looked old maybe bleeding issues due to alcohol or he bumped into things milo said to me the lip bruise looked fresher im betting on a coldcock while he was out of it or said petra eccles heard the bad guy approaching stirred and got sent back to slumberland fine said milo once again were getting a notion of how but the whys still far from clear not that i dont buy your theory about overreacting to small slights alex giving himself an excuse to do what he loves to do but marlon quigg doesnt fit any of that unless you found out he taught shearling when shearling was a tyke rapped his knuckles with a steel ruler or something not there yet but im getting closer i told them what id learned from the vanderveul children milo said quigg pays her a visit for moral support that could mean anything not in gertrudes case i said she was adamant about separating work from her home life had never entertained anyone else from the hospital in that manner so whatever quigg had on his mind was serious and she made sure her kids werent around to hear it heavyduty therapy maybe heavyduty advice i said like telling quigg to quit the hospital and shortly after he did left teaching completely and took up a whole new profession and lied to his wife about his reason petra said something happened at work that freaked him out what if he came upon a patient committing acts that alarmed him and warned the staff about it if he was ignored that couldve been extremely upsetting if he wasnt it couldve gotten the patient a transfer to specialized care and earned quigg a serious enemy i described the layout of the ward behind the fence curdled silence broken by the occasional ragged noise if quigg succeeded in having a child moved there it wouldve brought about a profound shift in quality of life trading an open therapeutic environment for what was essentially a prison possibly for years the main hospital was that cushy said milo there were a few locked wards but they were used for the patients safety profoundly delayed individuals whod hurt themselves if allowed to wander specialized care was designed with everyone elses safety in mind shackles and rubber rooms i never found out what went on there because gertrude wouldnt let me near the place because she liked me they have teachers there same answer i couldnt say petra said well something bothered quigg enough to get him out of that place how old of a scary kid would we be talking about the few descriptions we have of our suspect are a man in his thirties and quigg left vstate twentyfour years ago so probably a preteen or an early adolescent the hospital closed down ten years ago if he was kept there until the end were talking a disturbed angry man in his twenties possibly released to the streets or it took him this long to act out because he wasnt released he was transferred to atascadero or starkweather before finally earning his freedom or said milo hes been out for a while and these arent his only murders petra said other surgeries and shook her head no one including the feebies has seen anything like his pattern not every murder gets discovered kid for ten years hes careful and conceals his handiwork then all of a sudden he goes public it happens said milo they get confident or i said they start to get bored and need more stimulation milo pulled out his phone lets find this psychiatristcahane he called in a real estate search negative petra said hes in his eighties could be in some kind of assisted living milo said hopefully hes not too senile to help us i said if he doesnt pan out there are others who might knowsomeone who actually worked in specialized petra said we could look for old hospital personnel records producing a tube of mac lipstick from her purse she refreshed smiled being de tec tives and all as we left the restaurant both their phones went off simultaneously not coincidence two minions from the chiefs office were ordering them downtown immediately for a planning session as we headed for the west la parking lot petras cell chirped again this time the call was from her partner raul biro back at his desk in hollywood division hed located lemuel eccless son an attorney from san diego because of the distance biro had done a telephonic notification but lem jr had business in san gabriel tomorrow and would stop in la for a facetoface petra said we can do the interview together big guy or if youre tied up ill handle it assuming we dont get planned off the case assuming said milo they walked off wordlessly a bear and a gazelle five paces later petra stopped and looked back thanks for the ideas alex without breaking step milo bellowed i second the motion chapter i got home prepared to examine ventura state hospitals history seeking out anyone who could tell me about the patients in specialized care one curious boy in particular if that failed id press emil cahanes nephew to gain access to the psychiatrist as i settled in my chair my service called in i have a dr angel on the line she says its important donna angel and i go way back to my first job fresh out of training working the cancer ward at western pediatric donna had been an oncology fellow one of the best and the department had asked her to stay on as a faculty member after i went into private practice she referred occasional patients always with insight and wisdom picking up a new patient right now would be a distraction but sick kids never lost their priority i said put her through good to talk to you alex donnas tallulah voice was even huskier than usual when id met her she smoked a habit picked up in college it had taken years for her to quit i hoped the vocal change meant nothing she coughed darn cold kids are like petri dishes for viruses i said heal up whats new ive got someone you should meet sure not a referral she said this time im helping you she told me about it i said when right now if you can swing it theres some eagerness at play i made the drive to sunset and vermont in a little under an hour western pediatric medical center was in its usual state of demolition and construction another gleaming building rising from a rebarlined maw new marble on the facade chronic deficits be damned the campus was a vein of noble intention in the drab bedrock that was east hollywood half a mile to the north lemuel eccles had been savaged and dumped no time to ponder coincidence or karma or metaphysics i parked in the doctors lot rode to the fifth floor of a glassfronted structure named after a longdead benefactor smiled my way past the hemonc receptionist and knocked on donnas door she opened before my knuckles left the wood hugged me and guided me inside her desk was the usual clutter a man stood next to one of two visitors chairs dr delaware this is mr banforth john said the man extending a hand thanks for seeing me maybe i should be thanking you banforth waited for me to sit before lowering himself into the chair thirtyfive or so he was six feet tall solidly built black with closecropped hair graying early and tortoiseshell eyeglasses resting on a small straight nose he wore a brown cashmere crewneck mocha slacks mahogany suede running shoes a golfball pin was fastened to the left breast of the sweater a thin gold chain around his neck held two tiny figurines outlines of a boy and a girl donna said ill leave you two to talk and headed for the door when it closed john banforth said this has been weighing on me he crossed his legs frowned as if anything close to relaxation felt wrong and planted both feet on the floor okay he said here goes inhaling as dr angel told you my daughter cerise is her patient shes five years old her diagnosis is wilms tumor she was diagnosed at stage three one of her kidneys had to be removed and we thought we were going to lose her but shes doing great now really responding to treatment and we firmly believe all of us including dr angel that shes going to live to a ripe old age thats fantastic i cant say enough about dr angel if anyone fits their name its her but its still an ordeal cerises treatment her bodys sensitive she reacts to everything a few weeks ago she finished another course had to be hospitalized until her labs stabilized finally we were able to take her home we live in playa del rey and were on the freeway when cerise started crying she was hungry i got off at the next exit which was robertson mostly fastfood places then this cafebijouthat looked nice if cerise was going to eat we wanted it to be good quality also to be honest it was lunchtime my wife and i figured wed eat too madeleines a dance instructor im a golf pro we try to keep in shape makes sense so we went in and ordered some food and everything was going okay then cerise got cranky i guess we shouldve taken her home right then and there but her labs were really good your kid goes through hell she wants something you give it to her right of course still said banforth we shouldve known because sometimes after treatment cerise overestimates her strength his eyes watered shes been through hell but shes always trying to be strong fishing out a wallet he showed me photos a chubbycheeked little girl sporting a mass of brasscolored ringlets then the same child barely older bald paler whyme eyes rendered huge by the shrinkage of the surrounding face i said shes adorable was surprised by the catch in my voice you see what i mean it tugs at your heart you say yes maybe when you shouldnt of course so thats what we did and everything was okay for a while then cerise started to get supercranky moaning at first we thought she was in pain but when we asked she said no but she couldnt tell us what was bothering her sometimes i think she really doesnt know then all of a sudden she said what would make her happy was ice cream normally she gets ice cream once shes finished her dinner but he made another attempt to cross his legs same discomfort and reversal yes we spoil her jaredour son hes tencomplains about it all the time but with everything cerise has gone through anyway we ordered ice cream but when it arrived cerise changed her mind started making noise again the waitress came over and asked if she wanted a fresh donut she said yes banforths forehead had slicked he dabbed with a linen handkerchief sure she manipulates us we figure its the only power she has when shes out of the woods well start to anyway at this point were thinking we definitely need to pay and leave but before i get my wallet out the woman in the next booth shoots up like shes been bitten in the butt stamps over and glares down at cerise like she hates her cerise is sensitive she freaks out starts wailing a normal person would realize and back off not this one she actually glares harder like shes trying to break cerises spirit just break her in two you know unbelievable i said my wife and i are too shocked to react this woman evileyes me i say whats the problem she says you people are sick people eat in hospitals not restaurants im tonguetied i mean i cant believe what i just heard but madeleine shes always rational she starts to explain and this crazy woman this terrible woman waves her off and says you people what makes you think its okay to inflict your brat on the rest of us and i just lost it i mean i really lost it banforth looked at the floor i shouldve known better i was in the military trained to withstand pressure but this was my kid calling cerise a brat it was like she was mixing up some explosive to make me blow and i understood that but still i lost it didnt touch her that crazy im not but i jumped up got in her face i tell you doctor i was this close to doing something stupid but fortunately my army training helped also madeleines got hold of my hand and shes begging me to back off so i did and the bitch went back to her booth but she kept on smirking at us like she won we got the hell out of there all three of us are real quiet including cerise but when we got home she said i make everything bad and oh man madeleine and i just lost it in a whole different way after cerise went down for a nap we collapsed and bawled like babies im so sorry you had to go through that yeah it sucked but were okay now and you know what the next day cerise was fine like it never happened he shrugged we roll with the punches cerise shows us the way he fingered the chain found the child figurines and touched each one so why he said did i tell dr angel i wanted to talk to you actually it was her idea after i told her another part of the story how it was weighing on me she said she knew a doctor used to work here now works with that particular detectiveim getting ahead of myself a third legcrossing endured but banforth still looked as if hed been forced into a painful contortion heres the part thats going to sound weird i went back there doc to bijou a couple days later i know it sounds crazy but id composed myself thought maybe id go back and if by some chance she was there id try to talk to her rationally educate her you know about sick kids how you need to be flexible i wanted to make it rightto be rational with her no matter how she behaved so i could prove to myself i had it together he looked to the side it was stupid what can i say anyway i went in and the ownera longhaired guy with an earringrecognized me and was real nice saying my family was welcome back anytime he felt awful about what happened i thanked him and then i asked if that woman ever came back maybe one day i could explain to her about sick kidskeeping it friendly and he got this weird expression and said vita she was murdered i said oh crap when he said a few days after you were here im speechless i leave but later driving to work i remember something that happened the day this vita started up with us i put it aside for sure its nothing but it stays in my head and i cant stop thinking about it and finally i tell dr angel i waited john banforth said when we left and reached our car a guy came out behind us at first he walked the other way then he turned and walked toward us im thinking oh no another nutcase so i hustle to get cerise and madeleine into the car he comes closer and hes smiling but i dont know if its a friendly smile or a crazy smile sometimes you cant tell i mustve tensed up because he stops a few feet away and does this he held both palms frontward like i come in peace i stay on my guard anyway and he winks and smiles friendly but also weird i cant tell you why i felt that he just creeped me out then he winks again and gives the vsign for victory and he walks away it confused me and creeped me out but my mind was on getting home and settling cerise but when i found out this vita got murdered i start wondering but im like no way he was just reassuring us being a nice guy but the vsign didnt fit that it was like he was saying we were on the same team and wed won and that didnt make sense so it started bothering me what if he thought he was doing us a favor its probably nothing i tend to dwell on stuff i actually called the police and asked whos handling the murder of a woman named vita it took them a while but finally they said detective sturgis well put you through i hung up figured theyd trace me id get a callback but it never happened police lines dont have caller id i said so people wont be inhibited about giving tips oh makes sense anyway i couldnt stop wondering if he actually did it some crazy sonofabitch who thought we were on the same side finally i told dr angel and she said funny thing you worked with that exact detective and i said whoa karma i definitely need to get this off my chest shrugging so here we are doc thanks for getting in touch what did the guy look like so it is relevant said banforth damn not necessarily john at this point the cops look at everything they dont have a suspect theyve got various bits of information that may or may not be important what did he look like white guy he said around thirtyfive forty heavyset kind of a round face thats about it hair color brownshort like it was growing back from a buzz eye color couldnt tell you he never spoke nope just the wink and the vsign its not like evidence thats why i tried to put it aside your first impression was something about him seemed off but i cant tell you why sorry i gave him time he shook his head how was he dressed in a coat like a winter coat even though it was a warm day thats different i guess maybe thats what seemed off what kind of coat one of those fleecelined things said banforth brown on the outside maybe suede maybe cloth i wasnt paying attention oh yeah something else he was carrying a book like students do but he didnt look like a student what kind of book not a hardcovermore like a magazine actually maybe some sort of puzzle magazine because it had a big question mark on the cover my heart raced now i knew why alex shimoffs sketch had tweaked my brain the morning after the murder when milo and i had visited bijou an applefaced man had been there sitting in a booth behind the soccer moms and their toddlers eating steak and eggs a book in front of him penciling a puzzle enjoying a hearty breakfast hours after hed gutted vita john banforth said doc you did the right thing hes the guy oh man not necessarily but its a lead and detective sturgis needs anything he can get well okay then i feel better not wasting anyones time would you mind sitting with a police sketch artist so we can get a clearer image they still do that thought everything was computers they still do an artist huh would my name have to be on it no then guess so he said if you can fit it to my schedule and if madeleine doesnt know she has no idea about any of this including the fact that im here well do it at your convenience all right heres my business card call the top number its my reservation line for lessons thanks very much just doing what i had to we headed for the door he got there first stopped she was a nasty one that vita madeleine and i took to calling her the evil one as in wonder who the evil ones tormenting now we turned it into a joke to ease what happened but i guess no one deserves to be murdered his voice wavered on guess chapter on the way home i detoured and drove through vita berlins neighborhood rolling through sunlit streets and shadowed alleys searching for a man dressed too heavily for the weather when four circuits produced nothing i headed to bijou it was just past the three oclock closing time the storefront window afforded a view of ralph veronese sweeping up his long hair bunched in a topknot that was part girlie part samurai warrior i rapped on the glass without breaking rhythm he pointed to the closed sign i rapped harder and he looked up he cracked the door halfway propped his broom against the jamb hey im doing followup on vita you caught the guy not yet i want to ask you about a customer i noticed the first time i was here i described shearling nope doesnt ring a bell hes been here at least twice twice doesnt make him a regular half the time im in back he sat in that corner booth eating steak and eggs worked on a puzzle book veronese said oh you remember him not so much him i remember the book thinking heres another camper going to use us as the public library but then he ordered campers just like to stretch out a coffee bring their laptops gripe when they find out we dont have wireless has he been here any other times not that i know of how about checking your receipts for both the days we know he was here receipts are with my bookkeeper i send paperwork to her every friday then please call her he dialed a preset number spoke to someone named amy hung up she says its already in the storage bin she can try to find it but itll take time sooners better than later ralph she charges me by the hour send me the bill youre serious you bet he texted amy i said youre in the back but hedys always out front please get her on the line for me and if you cant reach her give me her number her numbers my number said veronese were thinking of getting married congratulations i pointed to his phone he reached hedy explained passed it over she said the guy with the puzzle book sure i remember him but i have to tell you he paid cash i know for sure because it was all singles and a lot of coins like he busted open his piggy bank what else can you say about him um he cleaned his plate didnt talk except to order had kind of a girlie voicehighpitched didnt fit his body hes kind of a footballplayer type you know not much for conversation kept his head in that book even when he was eating what kind of puzzles was he working on couldnt tell you youre thinking hes the one who killed vita hes someone we want to talk to because hes a little off off how you know mentally he impressed you that way im no shrink she said but he just wasnt like he never made eye contact kind of mumbled in that high voice like he was trying to whisperto like stay in the background not sociable exactly just the opposite like i want to be in my own world so i respected that my job you have to be a shrink anything else about him strike you as odd his clothes its pretty warm inside bijou we dont have the best ac and hes wearing this fleecelined shearling ive got one of those in my closet from when i lived in pittsburgh havent used it once since i moved to la was he sweating hmm i dont think sooh yeah one more thing he had a scar in the front of his neck like at the bottom nothing gross like a white line running across his neck across the adams apple lower in the soft part like someone cut him a long time ago but it healed up pretty good any other marks not that i saw tattoos if he has em they were covered up he was pretty much covered up what else was he wearing besides the shearling you think hes the one she said that kind of freaks me out what if he comes in again no reason to worry but if that happens just call this number i recited milos extension hedy said got it what else was he wearing i guess he had a shirt on underneath but i wasnt paying attention sorry the shearlings all i noticed because it was out of place mostly i was concentrating on getting the orders right you want to know exactly what his order was i can tell you steak and scramble with onions and mushrooms steak medium no instructions on the scramble he left like a ten percent tip all coins but i didnt mind because it wasnt like he was trying to be a jerk you know more like he didnt know better i said exactly she said a little out of it you feel sorry for those people i drove a mile north to a newspaper stand i knew on robertson near pico the primary merchandise was a mix of fan mags and porn small selection of puzzle books in a corner nothing with a question mark on the cover i flashed my dubious consultants id to the sikh proprietor and described shearling he said no sir i dont know him i gave him milos card anyway asked him to call if shearling showed up he might buy a puzzle book he smiled as if it was a perfectly reasonable request certainly sir anything to help good attitude so i spent ten bucks on a glossy design magazine robin likes looking at dream houses i tried milo again from the car then petra and when she was also out i switched to raul biro his voicemail answered but i left no message was shearlings presence at bijou evidence of longterm stalking or had he happened upon the cafe seen vita torment cerise banforth and decided she merited execution if the latter maybe he lived nearby reversing direction on robertson i gave vitas neighborhood another try starting with her street stanleigh belleveaux was outside watering his shrubs a for lease sign was staked on the lawn of the duplex two vacant units i drove slowly enough for belleveaux to notice but he didnt look up and i continued south no sign of a man in a shearling and other than a young woman wheeling a baby in a stroller all the activity was automotive people pulling in and out of driveways a door opened and a beanpole kid came out with a basketball began shooting hoops everything back to normal people need to believe in normal it was close to eleven pm when milo called still on the case and so is petra congratulations or condolences his magnanimousness made it painfully clear i didnt deserve it but starting from scratch ran the risk of buttfucking this one into oblivion i said next christmas hell be santa at the office party he laughed petra and i know the real reason hes not shifting gears to robberyhomicide any hotshots who arent already on longtermers are being flown to arizona courtesy the taxpayers for a confab on mexican drug cartels gonna be powerpoint galore whats up i told him about john banforth shearlings presence at bijou hours after vitas murder hedys description a nutcase with a taste for steak plus the way he atefixed on his foodsmacks of an institutional background thirtyfive to forty means that back when quigg was working at vstate hed have been eleven to sixteen a kid he said but scary enough to be transferred to specialized care im also convinced of the thyroid angle the waitress noticed a neck scar so maybe a thyroid scans what brought him to north hollywood day the most common reason for a thyroidectomy is cancer there are also immune disorders that can justify it like hashimotos disease whatever the reason hed need to take a daily pill to regulate his metabolism sometimes dosages can be tricky and if hes a street guy he may not be getting optimal care that could explain feeling cold and putting on a few pounds cancer he said now im dealing with a psycho with serious sympathy issues thyroid cancers one of the most curable malignancies hed have the potential to live to a ripe old age except his chemistrys off which would explain the scan he needs his prescription renewed would have to see a doctor at some point a physician who picked up on his symptoms and found out he hadnt been followed up regularly might want comprehensive data before adjusting his dosage north hollywood day is an insurance mill but no doubt they see lots of medical patients so a referral there makes sense he comes in to get nuked gets on glenda usfels bad side she boots his ass out wrong guy to boot ladies and gentlemen of the jury yes my clients a bit touchy but not only is he certifiably loony his glands are out of whack and he endured the big c cart before the horse big guy yeah yeah find him first before someone else gets on his bad side so where do i go with this thyroid stuff alex call every endocrinologist in town theyre unlikely to talk to you but the general public wont have those compunctions have john banforth sit down with shimoff and work up a better likeness if banforth cant give enough details ill try to fill them in because i got a decent look at the guy that and the scar the coat and the puzzle book could tweak someones memory even if hes underground hes got to surface occasionally assuming hes got an institutional background id also check health clinics welfare offices halfway houses and aftercare facilities near each of the murder sites he paid for his meal with coins i doubt thats interest from a brokerage account on the dole he said or he panhandles like eccles hell maybe thats why he did eccles the two of them got into a competitive thing and shearling decided to engage in unfair business practices okay ill get banforth and shimoff together this is helpful amigo one more thing i said check out newsstands see if anyone sells a puzzle book with a question mark on the cover the one near vitas scene doesnt but there are plenty of others theres a big one off hollywood boulevard not that far from where lem eccles got it speaking of which jernigan called on eccless autopsy the bruise on eccless lip was from a hard blow or a kick most likely a kick from a blunttoed shoe not severe enough to be lethal but it couldve stunned him other than that the details are like the others eccless sons trip to la is tomorrow want to be there wouldnt miss it chapter lemuel eccles jr aka lee was thirtyeight and rockjawed with meaty shoulders blue eyes that tended to wander and longish light brown hair lightened to blond at the tips your basic aging surfer this one sported a manicure a twothousanddollar charcoal chalkstripe suit a purple hermes tie a canaryandviolet pocket square his card said he was an attorney specializing in real estate milo said leases and mortgages eccles said used to be now its evictions and foreclosures basically im a vulture his smile was practiced and pretty but lacked staying power wed been in the interview room for less than a minute eccles had spent most of that time sneaking glances at petra connor easy to see why especially given the competition her lips had moistened since yesterday her eyes were clear her skin tone had warmed she wore a simple gold chain and diamondchip earstuds the drape of her black pantsuit was even better than that of lee eccless suit the first few times she caught eccles checking her out she pretended not to notice finally she smiled at him and edged closer shes in a committed relationship with a former detective named eric stahl but you use what you have milo sniffed the chemistry early on and let her take the interview lee she said as if savoring the word were so sorry about your dad thanks appreciate it eccles loosened a jacket button i guess i shouldnt be totally surprised because he led what you guys would call a highrisk life but still you can never be prepared for something like this lee eccless eyes filmed a bit a tissue box sat nearby petra didnt offer it no sense highlighting vulnerability eccles used his pocket square to swipe quickly took the time to refold and put the handkerchief back with four points showing what exactly happened petra said your dad was murdered and were determined to catch the bad guy anything you can tell us will be a big help the first thing you need to know said eccles is he was crazy i mean that literally paranoid schizophrenic he was diagnosed years ago not long after i was born he and my mom divorced when i was four and i rarely saw him after i got out of law school he found me somehow and dropped in at my office i was foolish enough to bring him home it didnt take long for things to get hairy right from the beginning he scared tracymy wife he ended up scaring me too in what way lee he wasnt actually violent but the threat of violence always seemed to hover around him and in a sense that was even worse the look in his eyes the way hed suddenly go silent in the midst of a conversation then one time we let him sleep over and he punched holes in the wall woke us up in the middle of the night we were terrified when i went in to see what was wrong he was sitting on the floor huddled in a corner claimed hed fended off an intruder but the alarm was still on no one had gotten in i finally calmed him down and left later i heard him crying in bed what an ordeal said petra i learned that it kicked in when he drank problem is that was often eventually tracy and i agreed no more visits we really needed to cut him off the next time he showed up we told him and he got pissed off and cussed us out i offered to rent him a motel for as long as he needed and we could still see each other during the day that pissed him off even more he stormed off a few weeks later he showed up and tried to force himself inside the housepushed the door as i held it thats when i decided to have him committed i tried three separate times for his sake as much as for ours he needed to be cared for in a supervised setting not drift around on the street each time i showed up in court some dogooder legal aid type was there to block me some asshole whod never met him but claimed to be defending his rights apparently they scan the dockets and even when someones only requesting a seventytwohour hold they come to make trouble oh man said petra lee eccles said im talking publicly funded wienies who know all the angles and braindead judges they probably take out to lunch im an attorney and i still couldnt get it done after the third time i talked to a buddy who does health law and he said dont waste your time and money until he actually assaultswhich means drawing bloodor makes a suicide attempt its not going to happen even then all theyre going to do is warehouse him for a couple of days and turn him loose not enough imminent danger said petra what a crock the mere fact he was living on the street put him in imminent danger obviously his strong jaw shifted to the side settled back in place you know what id like to do haul one of those wienies over to the morgue and show them what their meddling accomplished he tugged at his tie knot do you have any idea who did this to him him he no dad pops father the old man unfortunately not yet lee do you i wish where was he killed in an alley near hollywood and western oh jesus said eccles thats right where i dropped him off when i bailed him out of jail when was that lee about a month ago hed gotten busted for pushing someone while panhandling he used his call to beg me to get him out i figured hed get out anyway be pissed if i didnt help him so i paid the bail and picked him up and dropped him where he wanted to be dropped where he instructed me to drop him like im his limo driver so thats where it happened petra said did you observe where he went after you dropped him off no i just booked out of there as fast as i could did you notice him making any contact with someone no but something just occurred to me its probably psychotic delusion but i might as well tell you on the ride from the jail he got on one of his rants about some guy hassling him he was scared then he got all paranoid with me i was a goddamn lawyer lawyers ran the system why couldnt i help him i said if he was scared i could find him somewhere to stay he went ballistic accused me of wanting to lock him up in some loony bin and throw away the key i was like all lawyers a scumbag i said youre the one complaining someones after you im just trying to help that made him clam up ignore me totally when i reached where he wanted he said stop here and he got out didnt bother to look back petra said whod he say was he scared of trust me it was delusional an old delusion what do you mean this guy he complained about didnt exist hes been bitching about it my whole life according to my mother since he actually was locked up in a mental hospital wheres that said petra a place that no longer exists said lee eccles ventura state hospital he got committed for an indefinite term but was out in pretty short time according to my mother back then it was easier to commit someone a judge put him in after he busted some guys jaw in a bar got on the stand and claimed the guy was implanting radio speakers in his head how long ago was this lee lets see i was thirteen no fourteen i was playing baseball which means i was in high school so twentythree years ago i remember the baseball part because i was always worried hed show up at a game and embarrass me so whats the old delusion while he was locked up one of the guards supposedly killed his wife not my mother not even a real wife some woman hed been living with a barfly like him where was he living before he was committed oxnard we were in santa monica which sounds far enough but the things mom told me i was always worried hed show up so was she she moved us down to oc trying to put some distance between us this woman who was allegedly murdered said petra did your mom mention her name i think mom said rosetta or rosita i dont know but dont waste your time detective the story was insane like a guard could poison someone or want to im not sure the woman even existed or if she did that what happened to her is what he told mom whats that rosita comes to visit him leaves drops dead in the parking lot he knows this guard did it to get back at him why i cant tell you anyway now its the same person whos bothering him in hollywood and im supposed to do something about it because im a lawyer this imaginary person has a name petty he said or maybe it was pitty my father was originally from oklahoma had a twang that got worse when he was agitated his story was the guys popping up on the street following him giving him quote unquote xray eyes it was a ridiculous story all those years ago and didnt get better in the retelling but i figure you should know everything appreciate it lee said petra would you mind if we talked to your mother just to fill in details id love if youd talk to her because that would mean shes alive unfortunately parkinsons disease had other ideas im so sorry so am i detective they say you dont grow up until you lose your parents frankly id prefer to be immature petras mother had died giving birth to her her father had succumbed a few years back she said ive heard that eccles stood checked the folds of his hankie i guess he said im responsible for the body a uniformed officer saw lee eccles out petra said he has no idea what he just gave us marlon quigg worked at that hospital at the same time lem eccles was committed there looks like you were right about some sort of ancient history alex i said maybe for those two but i cant see vita and glenda usfel connected to vstate that long ago usfel was a young child and vita grew up in chicago fine said milo so their problems with mr shearling were more recent hes an equalopportunity disemboweler petra said eccles junior is one angry man that boy did not like his daddy cant say that i blame him but hes lucky daddys murder is part of a serial because if i picked it up as a oneshot id be looking at him as my prime and if eccles alienated his own offspring that thoroughly imagine what he could evoke in a homicidal maniac especially if the two of them went way back to vstate milo said mr crazy meet mr curious where do we go with this pittypattypetty dude if any of its true weve got complications because shearlings too young to have worked as a guard twentythree years ago i said the story could be partially true eccles knew someone named pitty years ago convinced himself the guy was after him he notices someone stalking him and resurrects his old personal bogeyman you believe the stalking part said petra eccles was murdered milo said the bumper sticker what even paranoids have enemies she laughed milo said even if pitty did exist alex is probably right and hes irrelevant eccles was schizo had a fixation flashed back to it or pittys a squid in a threepiece suit or some other figment in any event weve got multiple sightings of shearling petra said if shearling was a patient at vstate we might be able to find some known associates family anything that could lead us to him any word back from that psychiatrist alex no milo said got his address just before eccles junior showed up social security records dont ask she said excellent lets pay him a visit big guy i dont know hes under no obligation to let us past the door let alone cough up patient info we get heavyhanded he invokes the doctor confidentiality thing so my votes for having alex try first shrinktoshrink petra looked at me i said he could refuse me too but sure milo fished out a scrap of paper and handed it over van nuys address landline meanwhile we can have shimoff do a better drawing with banforth and push to get it on the media along with the new info ive got sean and moe checking out newsstands and bookstores see if anyone remembers an asshole buying puzzle books petra said rauls been talking to street people but so far no one had a special beef with eccles basically everyone thought he was a general pain smiling ill tell him to look for a cephalopod in a suit i said eccless last arrest the one his son bailed him out for was for shoving a tourist have you looked at the arrest report i read the summary your basic citizen versus nutcase citizen have a name i didnt make note of it why maybe its worthwhile on the off chance that it was shearling nutcase versus nutcase said milo flagrant psychotic versus someone able to maintain outward control i said what was the exact nature of the charge petra said eccles tried to get money from a tourist the tourist resisted eccles did some screaming and pushing and shoving did the tourist phone in the complaint no someone on the street did and a car was a block away i said think what the officers wouldve found a he saidhe said between a quiet young man and an angry alcoholic with a record for aggressive panhandling whom they knew as a neighborhood nuisance milo said shearlings able to fake normal five murders without a trace of physical evidence says hes organized meticulous able to slip in and out without setting off alarms he impressed hedy the waitress as eccentric but didnt scare her john banforth thought his behavior was odd but it didnt trouble him too much until he learned of vitas murder so were talking someone whos not overwhelmingly threatening when contrasted with eccless ravings theres no doubt who the cops wouldve seen as the offender monster trumps maniac she said okay ill check the complete report and as long as were dotting i s im going to call oxnard pd and see if i can dig up something about this rosetta woman winking the bumper sticker and all that the three of us headed for the exit crazy said milo the only time i like it is when patsy clines singing about it chapter caught in a traffic jam on wilshire and westwood i phoned my service three calls none of them from emil cahane i tried the valley number milo had given me no answer when i got home i began working the computer searching for staff lists at vstate and finally coming upon an old one that listed cahane as deputy director with one person above him dr saul landesberg a search using landesbergs name pulled up a fouryearold obituary him gertrude i wasnt even sure if cahane was coherent ancient history but not to a man in a fleecelined coat robin was working out back i dropped in kissed her petted blanche engaged in a brief discussion of dinner yes japanese sounded fine maybe wed splurge on matsuhisa when i returned to my office the phone was ringing milo said guess what we actually learned some stuff a clerk at a stand on san vicente in brentwood told reed he sold an armload of puzzle books to someone about a week ago unfortunately he remembers the books not the purchaser who cleaned him out and paid with small bills and coins i said go west from that location hook north to sunset and keep going youll reach quiggs apartment couple of miles farther youre at temescal canyon stocking up on reading material for a thorough surveillance interesting the second thing is petra found out from oxnard that there really was a rosetta who died in the parking lot at vstate last name macomber she lived in a public housing project had coke and booze issues so eccles had at least some reality testing but there was no evidence it was murder more likely a heart attack not a scratch on her i said thats why eccles thought shed been poisoned was she visiting him the cop petra talked to didnt know only reason he remembered was hed patrolled near the hospital was called to the scene by their onsite security thought it was ironic for someone to walk out of a hospital and keel over even though it wasnt that kind of hospital the last bit of news is shimoffs second drawing is much more detailed than the one he did with wheeling im working on getting it to the media so thanks for directing us to mr banforth anything from cahane not yet he gets back to you fine he doesnt well figure out what to do sayonara i returned to the list of vstate senior staffers tried the next name the head social worker a helen barofsky her personal data had managed to elude me for nearly an hour by the time my service rang in a dr cahane called said the operator he said it wasnt an emergency depends on your definition the number she gave me matched the one id received from milo i waited seven rings before a soft voice said yes dr cahane this is alex delaware returning dr delaware soft wispy voice tremulous at the tail end of each word like an amp set on slow vibrato im afraid your name isnt familiar no reason it should be i said i floated through vstate years ago as an intern gertrude vanderveul was my supervisor years later when the hospital closed down i did some consulting on getting the patients in e ward some decent aftercare aftercare he said promises were made werent they sigh i was gone by then gertrude have you been in contact with her unfortunately she passed away oh how terrible she was young a beat relatively my nephews secretary said something about a mr quib passing but i cant say i know who that is either marlon quigg i spelled it no sorry doesnt ring a bell yet hed returned my call as if reading my mind he said i responded to your message because at my age any bit of novelty is welcome in any event sorry i couldnt be more helpful marlon quigg worked as a teacher at vstate during your tenure we employed many teachers said cahane at the height of our glory we were quite the enlightened institution this teacher was murdered and the police have reason to believe his death relates to his work at the hospital silence dr cahane this is a bit to digest dr delaware the police have reason to believe yet theyre not calling me you are i work with them in what capacity a consultant meaning sometimes they think psychology has something to offer could you spare a few minutes to meet hmm he said and if i phoned the police alex theyd confirm that youre a consultant i rattled off milos name rank and private number hed be more than happy to speak to you doctor hes the one who asked me to get in contact with you why is that you were the deputy director at vstate when marlon quigg worked there had access to information patient information specifically dangerous patients that as im sure you know raises all kinds of issues the situation i said is way beyond tarasoff were not talking imminent danger were talking empirical brutality with a significant risk of more that sounds rather dramatic i saw the body dr cahane silence he said what exactly are you looking for the identity of a child quigg was teaching whose behavior frightened him perhaps to the point of suggesting a transfer to specialized care and this person killed him said cahane all these years later its possible youre supposing you really dont know if i knew i wouldnt need to speak to you dr cahane specialized care he said did you ever rotate through there gertrude felt i shouldnt why was that she said it was because she liked me i see well there are always judgments to make and for the most part gertrude made sound ones but specialc wasnt a hellhole far from it whatever steps were taken to control patients were taken judiciously this isnt about hospital procedure dr cahane its about a particularly calculating vicious murderer acting out years of resentment and fantasy why exactly do the police believe mr quiggs death had something to do with a patient at vstate because i told them so i said its complex could we meet facetoface you want a prolonged opportunity to convince me i dont think youll need much convincing whys that something was left on mr quiggs body i said a piece of paper upon which the killer had printed a question mark i could hear cahanes breathing rapid and shallow finally he said i dont drive anymore youd need to come to me the address milo gave me matched an apartment building a few miles east of cahanes nephews office in encino a plainfaced twostory rhombus stuccoed the color of raspberry yogurt and planted with yuccas palms and enough agave to cook up a years worth of margaritas the freeway passed within a couple of blocks its roar the awakening yawn of an especially cranky ogre the buildings front door was closed but unlocked the centerspine hallway was freshly painted and immaculately maintained five units above five below cahanes flat was ground floor rear as i approached the door the ogres growl muted to a disgruntled hum i knocked open cahane sat ten feet away in a scarred leather easy chair that faced the door his body tilted to the left his face was even thinner than in the tribute photo white hair longer and shaggier a couple days worth of stubble snowing chin and cheeks he had long legs and arms not much upper body was dressed in a clean white shirt and pressed navy slacks under a fuzzy plaid bathrobe black suede slippers that had once been expensive fit over white socks that hadnt been a mahogany piecrust table held a cup of stillsteaming tea and a book evelyn waughs hilarious take on travel extending a quivering hand he said forgive me for not rising but the joints arent cooperating today his palm was cool and waxy his grip surprisingly strong but contact was as brief as he could manage without being rude he shook his head cant say i remember you no reason sometimes images register anyway would you care for something to drink pointing to a kitchen behind the front room ive got soda and juice and the kettles still warm even bourbon if youd like im fine then please sit no puzzle about where to settle the sole option was a blue brocade sofa pushed to the wall opposite cahanes chair like the slippers it looked pricey but worn same for the piecrust table and the persian rug that stretched unevenly atop sootcolored walltowall disparate bookcases covered every inch of wall space save for doorways into the kitchen and the bedroom every case was full and some shelves were doublestacked a quick scan of the titles showed cahanes reading taste to be unclassifiable history geography religion photography physics gardening cooking a wide range of fiction political satire two shelves directly behind his chair held volumes on psychology and psychiatry basic stuff and not much of it considering chair beverage robe and slippers reading material he had enough money to endow a program had pruned to the basics he kept studying my face as if trying to retrieve a memory or just reverting to what hed learned in school when in doubt do nothing i half expected to be presented a rorschach card i said doctor tell me about marlon quiggs end i described the murder giving him the level of detail i figured milo would approve wanting to communicate the horror without divulging too much and making sure not to mention the other victims lest cahane interpret that as pointing away from vstate he said that is beyond brutal does the question mark mean anything to you dr cahane his lips folded inward he rubbed chin stubble how about fetching that bourbon bring two glasses the kitchen was as spare as the front room clean but shabby the glasses were cut crystal the bourbon was knob creek cahane said a finger and a half for me calibrate your own dosage i allotted myself a thin amber stripe we clinked crystal no one toasted i sat down and watched him drain his glass in two swallows he rubbed his stubble again youre wondering why i live this way it wasnt the first thing on my mind but you are curious i didnt argue he said like most people i spent quite a bit of my adult life accumulating things after my wife died i began to feel smothered by things so i gave most of them away im not stupid or impulsive nor am i ruled by neurotic anhedonia i held on to enough passive income to ensure freedom from worry it was an experiment really to see how it felt to cleanse oneself of the rococo trim we think we crave sometimes i miss my big house my cars my art mostly i do not long monologue probably a stall i had no choice but to listen cahane said youve put me in a difficult position youve come to me with nothing more than hypotheses granted hypotheses are often based on logic but the problem is you dont have facts and now youre asking me to break confidentiality your position at vstate wouldnt necessarily obligate you to confidentiality i said his eyebrows dipped what do you mean a case can be made that administrators arent bound the way clinicians are of course if you did treat the person in question that assertion might be challenged he lifted his empty glass would you mind fetching the bottle i complied and he poured himself another two fingers finished half his eyes had grown restless he closed them his hands had begun to shake then they stilled and he didnt move i waited for a moment i thought hed fallen asleep the eyes opened he looked at me sadly and i braced myself for refusal there was a boy he said a curious boy chapter emil cahane poured another half inch of bourbon studying the liquid as if it held both promise and threat he took a tentative sip then swigged like a sot his head tilted up at the ceiling his eyes closed his breathing grew rapid all right he said but he spent another half minute sitting there then this child this unusual boy was sent to us from another state no sense specifying it doesnt matter they had no idea how to deal with him and we were considered among the best he arrived in a pale green sedan a ford he was accompanied by two state troopers large men it emphasized how small he was i tried to interview him but he wouldnt talk i placed him in g building perhaps you remember it id spent most of my time there an open ward rather than specialized care there were no youngsters in specialized care said cahane i felt it wouldve been barbaric to subject someone of that age to the offenders housed there were talking murderers rapists necrophiles cannibals psychotics judged too disturbed for the prison system and sheltered from the outside world for their sake and ours he massaged his empty glass this was a child how old was he he shifted in his chair young preadolescent eleven he said you can see how we were faced with a unique set of circumstances he had his own room in g with an atmosphere that emphasized treatment not confinement you remember the array of services we offered he made good use of our programs caused no trouble whatsoever i said his crime justified specialized care but his age complicated matters he shot me a sharp look youre trying to draw out details im not sure im willing to offer i appreciate your talking with me dr cahane but without details if im not performing to your satisfaction feel free to walk through that door i sat there i apologize he said im having a difficult time with this i can understand that with all due respect dr delaware you really cant understand youre assuming im waffling because of medicolegal constraints but thats not it he poured yet more bourbon tossed it back tamped white hair succeeded only in mussing the long brittle strands his eyes had pinkened his lips vibrated he looked like an old wild man im too old to care about the medicolegal system my reservations are selfish covering my geriatric buttocks you think you screwed up i dont think i know dr delaware with patients like that its often impossible to know he waved me quiet thanks for the attempt at empathy but you cant know that place was a city the director was a donothing ass and that left me the mayor the buck stopped at me tears filled his eyes i said still please stop the soft voice the sympathetic look even if you are being sincere and not using rapport to crack me open sympathy without context churns my bowels i said lets talk about him what did he do at eleven that his home state couldnt handle eleven he said and every bit a child a small soft prepubescent boy with a soft voice and soft little hands and soft outwardly innocent eyes i held his hand as i led him to the room that would be his new home he clutched me with fear sweaty when can i go back i had no comforting answer but i never lie so i did what we mindscience types do when were flummoxed i veered into bland reassuranceshed be comfortable wed take good care of him then i used another tactic peppered him with questions so i wouldnt have to provide answers what did he like to eat what did he do for fun he turned silent and slumped as if hed given up but he marched on like a good little soldier sat on his bed and picked up one of the books we provided and began reading i stuck around but he ignored me finally i asked if there was anything he needed and he looked up and smiled and said no thank you sir im fine cahane winced after that i resorted to cowardice inquiring periodically about his progress but having no direct contact with him the official reason was it wasnt part of my job description by that time i was essentially an administrator saw no patients whatsoever the real reason of course is i had nothing to offer him didnt want to be reminded of that he confused you instead of responding to that he said i did keep tabs on him the consensus was that he was doing better than expected no problems at all really bracing his hands on the arms of his chair he tried to get up fell back and gave a sick smile when i moved to help him he said im fine and struggled to his feet bathroom tottering he trudged through the doorway that bisected his bookshelves ten minutes passed before a toilet flushed and sinkwater burbled when he returned his color had deepened and his hands were trembling settling back down he said so he was doing fine then he wasnt or so i was told by marlon quigg by a senior staff member whod been informed by an intern whod been informed by a teacher he sighed yes your mr quigg one of those breathlessly idealistic young men who thought hed found a calling what did he report regression said cahane severe behavioral regression back to what brought the boy to you dear god said cahane he laughed oddly i said anatomical curiosity his hands pressed together he mumbled i said what was his original crime cahane shook a finger at me i expected reproach the finger curled arced back toward him hooked in an ear he sat back he killed his mother shot her in the back of the head as she watched television no one missed her at the farm where she cleaned barns because it was the weekend she didnt socialize much it was just her and him their home in kan they lived in a trailer at the edge of the farm he stayed with her corpse nod i went on once he was sure she was dead he used a knife knives said cahane from the kitchen carving tools as well a christmas gift from her so he could whittle he used a whetstone shed employed when she slaughtered chickens that she brought home for their dinner she used to slaughter the birds in front of him wasted nothing reserved the blood for sausage when the police finally found her the stench was overpowering but he didnt seem to mind displayed no emotion at all the police were stunned didnt know where to take him and ended up using a locked room at a local clinic because the jail was filled with adult criminals no one knew what would happen to him in that environment he didnt protest he was a polite boy later when one of the nurses asked him why hed stayed with the body he said hed been trying to know her better i described the wounds shearling had left on quigg he said the troopers who brought him also brought crime scene photos from the trailer when im feeling remorseful about something i dial those images up and make myself downright miserable the home was a sty utter disorder but not his room his room was neat hed decorated the walls anatomical charts hanging everywhere where a child that age would obtain such things baffled me the police hadnt been interested enough to ask but i pressed them and they made inquiries a physician a general practitioner to whom the boy had been taken far too infrequently had befriended him because he seemed like such a good little boy with his interest in biology might very well make a splendid doctor one day what do you know about his mother reclusive hardworking shed moved to town from parts unknown with a twoyearold got the job cleaning barns and kept it the trailer she lived in was at the far end of a wheat field owned by the farmer and she was allowed to live there gratis was there evidence of premeditation he shot her while she was watching her favorite tv show apart from that i couldnt say any remorse no how was she discovered on monday she didnt show up for work the first time shed ever missed she was dependable you could set your clock by her she had no phone so a farmhand went to check smelled the stench and cracked the door and saw her the boy was sitting next to her exploring hed fixed himself a sandwich peanut butter but no jelly he smiled the details policemen put in their reports they found a few smudges on the charts in his room didnt know what to make of that my guess is he was looking for confirmation between what was on the chart and what hed palpated her intestines in particular seemed of interest i said homeschooling himself in biology kansas couldnt deal so you got him several institutions were solicited and refused we accepted him because i was arrogant im sure youre familiar with vstates history all those terrible things carried out in the name of medicine by the time i got therethe reason i went thereall that had been expunged and we had a welljustified reputation for being humane he studied me when you were there did you find indications to the contrary not at all i got great training glad to hear you say that glad and proud there was the notion that he wouldnt be safe in kansas too much notoriety what caused marlon quigg to be concerned im sure you recall the beauty of our grounds apparent non sequitur i nodded he said pastoral was a term i heard bandied about quite often abundant flora and fauna i said animals he trapped them resumed exploring small animals said cahane analysis of the bones identified squirrels mice lizards a garter snake a stray cat birds as well we never figured out how he caught them caught any of them he was clever enough to conceal his handiwork for months found a quiet spot behind a remote storage shed conducted his experiments buried the remains and tidied the ground hed been allowed to leave the ward for two hours a day once in the morning once before dinner from the body count we estimated he worked with one creature a day tidying i thought of the clean dirt at marlon quiggs killsite how was he discovered young mr quigg had grown suspicious and chose to follow him one evening the chosen creature was a baby mole what made quigg suspicious the boy had grown uncommunicative even surly should someone else have noticed perhaps what can i tell you teachers and nurses spend a lot more time with patients than we do they do in any event faced with a new set of facts we needed to shift our paradigm but we werent sure how some of the staff most vocally marlon quigg agitated for an immediate transfer to specialized care others disagreed cahanes eyes shifted to the right i listened to everyone said id take some time and decide as if i was being deliberative the truth was i was unable to make a decision not only because he posed problems i was ill prepared for my own life was in shambles my father had just died id applied for positions at harvard and uc san francisco had been turned down at both places my marriage was falling apart there had always been issues but id brought them to a head by straying with another woman a beautiful brilliant woman but of course that doesnt excuse it in a pathetic attempt to reconcile with my wife i booked a cruise through the panama canal even under the guise of sensitivity i was being selfish because sailing through the canal was something id always wanted he picked up his glass changed his mind put it down hard twentyfour days on a ship preceded by several weeks on the outer banks of north carolina because eleanor hailed from there i was away from the hospital for fortythree days and during my absence someone took it upon himself to deal with the boy the psychologist whod come to me with quiggs original complaint he agreed with quigg viewed the boy as untreatable and tainted his term he was a foolish authoritarian man too confident in his own meager abilities id long had my reservations about him but his credentials though foreign were excellent as a state employee he had all sorts of contractual protection had never made an error that would jeopardize that cahanes shaky fingers entangled in his hair then he did and now this moment has arrived his eyes lost focus there i was on a beautiful ship dining dancing marveling at the canal he poured bourbon spilled some studied the droplets on his sleeve dear god i said the boy was sent to specialized care if only that was all of it said cahane that man that overconfident ass decidedon his own with no evidence or prior discussionthat the boys problems were primarily hormonal glandular irregularity was the way he termed it like something out of a victorian medical book he prepared papers had the boy transported to a clinic in camarillo where he was operated on by a surgeon who lacked the judgment to question the request thyroidectomy i said cahanes head jerked back you already know a witness described a scar across the front of his neck he gripped his glass with both hands hurled it awkwardly across the room it landed on the carpet rolled a complete thyroidectomy for absolutely no reason at all after a weeks recuperation the boy was transferred to specialized care the quack claimed he was looking out for the boytrying to regulate his behavior because clearly nothing else had worked but i always suspected there was an element of base vicious revenge you like to operate sonny see how it feels one of the animals the boy had chosen to explore had been the fools unofficial pet a stray cat that he fed from time to time of course he denied that this was all about helping the lad i returned from my cruise learned what had happened was horrified livid at my staff for not intervening everyone claimed theyd been unaware i sat the bastard down had a long talk with him told him he was retiring and that if he ever applied for a position at another state hospital id write a letter he protested switched to sniveling tried to bargain ended up making a pathetic threat anything hed done had been under my supervision so i wouldnt escape scrutiny i called his bluff and he deflated he was over the hill anyway pushing eighty he smiled younger than i am today some of us rot more quickly than others foreign credentials i said from where belgium my chest tightened university of louvain cahane nodded a fussy little twit with a fussy comical teutonic accent who wore ridiculous bow ties and slicked his hair and strutted around as if hed kissed freuds ring what was his name unnecessary request cahane said why the hell not his name was shacker buhrrrn hard shacker dont waste your time looking for him hes quite dead suffered a heart attack the day after i fired him collapsed right in the hospital parking lot no doubt stress was a factor but those sandwiches he brought to staff lunches couldnt have helped fatty pork and the like slathered with butter what happened to the boy did i remove him from specialc said cahane that didnt seem advisable given signs of impending puberty and the enormity of what had been done to him instead i created a custom environment for him within the walls of special kept him out of a barred cell and put him in a locked room that been used for storage but had a window and a nice view of the mountains we painted it a cheerful blue moved in a proper bed not a cot installed walltowall carpeting a television a radio a stereo audiotapes it was a nice room you kept him in specialc because you expected him to grow increasingly violent and he defied my expectations dr delaware developed into a pleasant compliant adolescent who spent his days reading at that point i was a good deal more handson visiting him making sure everything was going well i brought in an endocrinologist to monitor his synthroid dosage he responded well to t maintenance did he receive any psychiatric treatment he didnt want any and he wasnt displaying symptoms after what hed been through the last thing i wanted to do was coerce which isnt to say he wasnt monitored thoroughly every effort was made to ensure that he didnt regress no access to animals his recreational time was supervised and confined to the specialc yard he shot hoops did calisthenics walked around he ate well groomed himself just fine denied any delusions or hallucinations who supervised him guards any guard in particular no do you recall a guard named pitty or petty i didnt know any of their names why the name came up with regard to a murder quiggs yes i lied cahane stared a murderous team its possible pitty petty he said no that name isnt familiar to me what happened to the boy after the hospital closed down i was gone by then you have no idea i was living in another city miami he reached for his glass realized hed tossed it clamped his eyes shut as if in pain opened them and stared into mine why would you suggest that i said gertrude moved to miami and men have been known to follow beautiful brilliant women gertrude he said did she ever speak of me not by name she did imply she was in love again another lie blatant manipulative use what you have emil cahane sighed no i moved down here to la it wasnt until years later that i showed up at her doorstep in miami unannounced hoping she was still single i emptied my heart she let me down easy said that what wed had was wonderful but that was ancient history there was no looking back i was utterly crushed but pretended to be valiant got on the next plane back here unable to settle myself i moved to colorado took a job that proved lucrative but unsatisfying quit and did the exact same thing it took four job changes before i realized i was little more than a prescribing robot i decided to live off my pension and give away most of what i owned my charity has extended to the point where i need to budget ergo my mansion he laughed ever the narcissist i cant refrain from boasting i said where would you guess the boy went after vstate shut down many of the specialized patients were transferred to other institutions which ones atascadero starkweather no doubt some of them ended up in prison thats our system were all about punishment help me understand the timeline i said what year did the boy arrive at vstate just over twentyfive years ago eleven years old a few months shy of twelve how long did he stay on the open ward a year and some months so he was thirteen when he got operated on and transferred right around the time marlon quigg had left the hospital and abandoned a teaching career had the switch been due to horror at what hed witnessed behind the shed or remorse over what his suspicions had led to either way hed been called to pay i said whats the boys name cahane turned away doctor i need a name before other people die people such as myself ever the narcissist its possible dont worry about me dr delaware if youre correct that he killed quigg out of revenge i cant imagine any personal danger to myself because quigg got the ball rolling without quigg none of the rest of it wouldve ensued i on the other hand did my utmost to help the boy and he recognized that providing a nice room a protective environment that provided security visavis the other patients you know he appreciated that because he thanked me when when i told him i was leaving how old was he then fifteen two years in specialized in specialized technically he said but for all purposes he had his own private ward he thanked me dr delaware hed have no reason to harm me that assumes rationality on his part do you have some concrete evidence that im in peril dr delaware were talking about a highly disturbed he smirked youre trying to fish out information this isnt about you i said he needs to be stopped give me a name id raised my voice put some steel into it for no obvious reason cahane brightened alex would you be so kind as to check my bathroom i believe ive left my glasses there and id like to spend a pleasant afternoon with spinoza and leibniz rationality and all that first tell me young man he said i dont like being out of focus help restore some visual coherence and perhaps well chat further i passed through the doorway to the lav the space was cramped white tiles crisscrossed by grubby grout a threadbare gray towel hung from a pebbled glass shower door the smell was bay rum cheap soap faulty plumbing no eyeglasses anywhere something white and peaked sat atop the toilet tank piece of paper folded origamistyle the folds uneven the flaps wrinkled by unsteady hands some sort of small squat animal serrated edges said the paper had been ripped from a spiral notebook i spotted the book in a ragged wicker basket to the left of the commode along with a tract on philosophy and several old copies of smithsonian every page of the notebook was blank i unfolded black ballpoint block printing centered the page made ragged by several hesitation breaks grant huggler the curious boy i hurried back to cahanes living room note in hand the big leather chair was empty cahane was nowhere in sight to the left of the bathroom was a closed door i knocked no answer dr cahane i need to sleep i turned the knob locked is there anything else you can tell me i need to sleep thank you i need to sleep chapter alex shimoffs second drawing aired on the six oclock news a bored talkinghead noted the suspects winter coat and a possible history of thyroid issues total broadcast time thirtytwo seconds i froze the frame this sketch was lifelike the broad face impassive this was the man id seen huddled in a corner booth at bijou inches from a group of moms and tots robin said he looks blank like somethings missing or maybe shimoff didnt have enough to work with he did she looked at me id already told her some of what cahane had related took it no further blanche studied each of us we sat there robin said eleven years old and walked out of the room milod been off the radar all day but he phoned about an hour after the broadcast my searches using grant hugglers name had proved fruitless he said catch it big improvement no his exaltedness pulled strings because shit needs turning over so it wont stink worse than it already is anyway weve got a piece of fine art even shimoffs satisfied the tip lines just started to light up so far its fewer than we got the first time maybe joe publics played out but moe caught one worth looking into anonymous female caller says a guy fitting shearlings description received his thyroid prescription at a clinic in hollywood she hung up when reed asked her which one a place in hollywood fits a guy on the streets and puts him in proximity to lem eccles all the clinics petra called are closed until tomorrow shell follow up and if gods feeling generous well get a name god loves you i said his names grant huggler what i recapped the meeting with cahane he said he leaves it for you to find in the damn bathroom what was that pretending he wasnt actually a snitch he left it folded like origami setting up a little production but distancing himself from it hes a complicated guy spends a lot of energy on selfjustification is he a reliable guy i believe what he told me grant huggler he said eleven years old a quarter century ago makes him thirtysix which fits our witness reports cant be too many with that name im plugging him in nowwell looky here male cauc six feet two thirtysix picked up five years ago in morro bay for trespassing possible intent to commit burglary a doctors office that probably means they nabbed him just as he broke in to score dope which fits with a street guy with psych issues no prison sentence he got pled down to jail time served heres the mug shot long hair scruffy beard but the face behind all that pelt looks kinda chubby talk about weird eyes dead like hes staring into the great abyss no busts before then nope thats it not much of a criminal history for someone whos now a serial gutter i said morro bays not far from atascadero which is one of the places dangerous patients were transferred when vstate shut down a first offense five years ago could mean he was locked up until then if so hes been incarcerated for twenty years plenty of time to stew and to fantasize hed be treated with meds right possibly im asking that because if it was dope he was after maybe he got hooked on something tried to boost from a doctors office though once he got out wouldnt he be sent to some kind of outpatient facility where he could score legally that assumes hed show up i said and few patients crave psychotropics something recreational would be more likely im betting he was noncompliant about aftercare if for no other reason than hed want to avoid waiting rooms little medical phobia huh yeah getting your neck sliced for no reason can do that to youso maybe he was trying to swipe thyroid meds because he hated waiting rooms anxiety about medical settings could explain being so tense in glenda usfels scan room toss in some hormonal irritability add usfels aggressive nature and youd have a volatile situation but he didnt react impulsively just the opposite he bided his time planned stalked her took action i suppose spending most of your life in a highly structured environment could instill patience and an interesting sense of focus losing an organ he didnt have to lose he said doing that to a kid barbaric now hes out practicing his own brand of surgery avenging old wrongs and some new ones i said id like to know the name of the surgeon who operated on him all cahane remembered was that the office was in camarillo another victim before he got to la no similars have shown up anywhere one person who did meet an interesting end was the psychologist who orchestrated the thyroidectomy when cahane got back he lost no time firing him and the following day he dropped dead in the hospital parking lot apparent heart attack sound familiar lem eccless wiferosetta oh jesus eccles was nuts but not wrong theres more big guy the psychologists name was bernhard shacker same as the guy who analyzed vita for wellstart what the hells going on some sort of identity theft has to be i said the man i spoke to was in his late forties and the real shacker was nearly eighty when he keeled over the real shacker was belgian and the diploma i saw in that office was from a university in belgium when shackerthe guy calling himself shackersaw me looking at it he said something about his catholic phase photoshopping fancylooking paper isnt any big deal a scamster making it in bh im wondering if his transgressions go beyond practicing without a license because pulling off the murders would be a lot easier with two people involved whered that come from eccless fear of a guard at vstate huggler may be your prototypical odd loner but that doesnt preclude someone from gaining his trust someone he met while at vstate another lunatic he said working as a guard now hes palming himself off as a shrink good lord faking it would be a lot easier for someone whod worked on psych wards long enough to soak up the terminology eccles was confined at vstate the same time as huggler maybe in specialized care because hed gotten overly aggressive with a judge theres no reason to think he didnt continue being his usual combative obnoxious self that got him on a guards bad side but the guard was too clever to face off against eccles took it out on eccless only visitor the woman eccles considered his wife she really was poisoned and when he got away with it he did the same to bernhard shacker get on my bad side you die he said another touchy one common ground for a relationship cahane described huggler as cooperative compliant even so his recreational time was supervised for his safety that meant being supervised by a guard whenever he left his room what if it was the same guard each time and a bond developed the man passing himself off as shacker wouldve been in his twenties back then perfect age to be a mentor to an isolated adolescent the bond was solidified forever when he eliminated the man whod robbed huggler of a vital organ and the bond couldve remained strong enough for the mentor to travel with hugglerseeking out a job at atascadero when huggler got transferred there and now theyre traveling together for at least five years i said if thats the case hugglers not crashing on the street hes living securely with his selfappointed guardian whos making a nice living in a beverly hills office and who could be sending huggler to inflict his particular brand of curiosity upon those whove gotten on his nerves case in point vita huggler witnessed her tormenting the banforth family but i dont see him as out for truth and justice more likely he was already at bijou because hed been stalking vita for a while and the reason for that was vita had offended fake dr shacker i know that because he told me shed just about come out and called him a quack no one had ever treated him that way he was bothered it was the only time he dropped his professional guard doing her mean thing he said no pity from pitty hold on click click no shacker or pitty in the files not at dmv either all im finding is the office address on bedford i said lets work out a plan tonight bop over there tomorrow analyze the analyst he said hes that dangerous we should bring an army i figured id talk to him youd be there for backup whats your angle does he remember anything else about vita if it feels right ill probe deeper about the quack issue if not ill bring up additional victims did he have any theories get people talking they make mistakes let me call petra see what she thinks six minutes later poor kid was having some facetime with her loveydove at loise in brentwood not far from your place you mind hosting us in say an hour no prob check with robin shell be fine with it how do you know she loves you rare lapse of taste on her part he said an hour chapter petra rang the bell white paper bag in hand she had on a sleeveless navy silk sheath red sandals with heels strategic pearls darkerthanusual lipstick first time id seen her in a dress robin said date night interrupted woman plans god laughs petra bent to pet blanche blanche rolled on her back earned a massage petra said we made it through the first course i took dessert to go i said want some coffee strong if you dont mind i brewed kenyan kicking up the octane robin and petra settled at the table and petra pulled plastictopped boxes out of the bag assortment of cookies four slabs of chocolate cake robin said thats more like catering i brought for everyone seeing as you guys are donating home and hearth to the dark side a heavy hand pounded the door milo trudged in bearing a brown bag greasy flecked with powdered sugar he scowled who mugged a pastry chef robin sniffed the air this magi brings churros it seemed like a good idea his eyes fixed on the chocolate cake flourless said petra got nothing against flour but why not he put the churros aside was ingesting cake before his haunches met his chair blanche waddled over and nuzzled his ankle he said yeah yeah and conceded a rub behind her ear she purred like a cat yeah yeah again robin took her cup and headed for the back door blanche followed good luck no one invited her to stay they like her petra said this fake psychologist is hugglers confederate as well as the pitty character eccles claimed was stalking him milo said working assumption kid but it feels right he steals one identity why not another cant find any pitty in the file so maybe its a nickname or eccles was totally delusional and were wrong she turned to me how did fakeo come across when you talked to him pleasant professional the right paper on the wall the only time he stepped out of the role was when he complained that vita had implied he was a quack at the time i took it as collegial banter looks like she was right sometimes i wonder if those nasty people dont have special insights maybe because they see everyone as a threat milo said but look what happens after they get elected good point she turned to me you see vita insulting him as the reason she got killed i nodded his trigger hugglers fun we have two people working in concert with layers of pathology building on each other im not sure either of them understands it fully at the base is hugglers fascination with human plumbing and no i cant tell you how that developed its normal for children to wonder how their bodies work and kids who hold on to that curiosity sometimes channel it professionallybecome mechanics engineers anatomists surgeons for a few interest grows to obsession and gets tangled up with sexuality in a really bad way she said dahmer nilsen gein all of whom were described as odd children but none of whom had especially horrific childhoods i said huggler killing his mother at eleven suggests a lessthanoptimal upbringing but it doesnt come close to explaining the act whatever the reason something shortcircuited in his brain and he began pairing sexual gratification with plunging his hands into visceral muck being locked up for most of his life made him a prime target for observation and im betting one of his sharpest and most frequent observers wasnt a doctor it was a young man working a lowstatus job someone whod never be invited to staff meetings but craved authority and had the time to pick up all sorts of interesting things doctors come and go she said but guards stay on the ward for eighthour shifts and this guards ability to sniff out depravity couldve been finetuned because he could relate to it on a personal level his own kinks milo said psychopath pheromones one beast smells another i said pitty or whatever his name really is studied huggler long enough to become a huggler scholar he befriended the boy and a mentortrainee relationship developed the boy had finally met someone who appreciated his urges instead of condemning them maybe it was pitty who caught small animals for huggler to play with what was the payoff for him adulation subservience or maybe just having someone like himself to relate to given hugglers age and his apparent adjustment there was a good chance hed get out when he became an adult then marlon quigg ruined everything by exercising his own powers of observation huggler was subjected to unnecessary surgery and got put in specialized care if im right about his only being out for five or so years he was shipped off to another hospital probably atascadero and got thoroughly institutionalized a relationship with someone who claimed to care about him wouldve been his only link to reality pitty moves with him pittys reality becomes his said petra she shook her head that surgery talk about institutional abuse i guess you could see a titfortat they cut his neck he breaks other peoples necks but then why havent we seen any throatslashing wouldnt that be a more direct symbolic revenge i could theorize for you all daymaybe he chose to avoid slashing because it cut too close to home so to speak the truth is we may never know whats been stoking hugglers engine milo said vstate closes mentor follows mentee mentee finally gets out mentor turns him into a lethal weapon thats your layer two i nodded a weapon aimed at people who anger each or both of them pitty might not want to soil his own hands but if hes the brittle powercraving narcissist i think he is hed crave payback for slights the rest of us would shrug off petra said are we talking something sexual between the two of them maybe but not necessarily its possible neither of them has anything close to a conventional sex life people irk me milo said i sic lil buddy at them and they become anatomy projects i said and lil buddy loves the assignment thats layer three a perfect partnership that satisfies both of their needs lets start with vita berlin obnoxious combative spreading misery wherever she went like most bullies she had a keen sense about whod make a safe victim and the man she knew as dr shacker seemed perfect physically unprepossessing outwardly mild and a psychologistwere expected to be patient nonjudgmental think of the movies youve seen about therapists most show them as absentminded wimps vita may have been forced into sessions with the little wuss in order to collect her insurance settlement but she was damn sure going to have fun along the way right from the start she resisted needled him finally came out and let him know she thought he was a charlatan unfortunately for her hes anything but nonjudgmental i wouldnt be surprised if the death sentence was passed the moment the words left her mouth call in huggler said milo easy hit because fakeoshacker had her address phone number knew what she looked like i said and despite her resistance she mightve given out some personal details during the evaluation that also made stalking her easier huggler was spotted lurking near her garbage cans my guess is he went through them found her empties knew she was a serious solitary drinker if he found pizza boxes that would also have helped set up the kill in general her routine was easy to learn because she rarely went out except for shopping and occasional meals at bijou think pitty was in on the kill its possible he held a gun on the victims served as a lookout two actors would explain no sign of struggle even from someone as aggressive as vita petra said the pizza box ruse was still a gamble given vitas temper what if she was sober enough to make a ruckus i said oops gee sorry maam wrong address huggler leaves and they wait for a second chance milo said eccles snoozing in the alley wouldve been a piece of cake same for quigg petra said if were right about quigg hed have been the major targetthe person to blame for everything bad that happened to huggler with that kind of rage why wait five years to get him maybe there were other targets just as importantlike shackerand theyre going down a list milo said like the doc who actually did the throatcutting oh i said they looked at me huggler was busted for trespassing behind a medical office the police assumed he was about to break in and steal dope but what if huggler had a more personal connection to the doctor milo said stalking the surgeon problem with that is the arrest was in morro bay and hugglers surgery took place a hundred miles away in camarillo people move the same surgeon just happened to live near two hospitals where huggler was confined i thought about that maybe huggler was taken to that particular surgeon because of an arrangement with vstatesome sort of consultancy when vstate closed the guy went for the same thing at atascadero petra said a guy who couldnt make it in private practice maybe he had his own issues i said obviously he had ethical issues going for government dole said milo i guess anythings possible she produced her iphone poked and scrolled milo said whats on that my notes youre totally digital i copy stuff from the murder book so i can follow up at home here we go huggler was busted at bayview surgical group of san luis obispo county its the right specialty isnt it we shifted to my office and i ran a search on bayview found no current listings but a fouryearold item from a san luis obispo tv station featured the disappearance of local surgeon dr louis wainright staff member of bayview surgical group wainright was last seen hiking in the foothills above san luis obispo with his dog days ago the doctors suv was found in a park service lot but neither he nor his german shorthaired pointer ned has been seen since additional hits on the disappearance described futile searches conducted by law enforcement and a cadre of eagle scouts a picture of wainright showed him grim grayhaired and bearded with a strong jaw and outdoor skin dr hemingway said petra walking with his dog just like quigg and our boy has a thing for animals milo said lets make sure wainright didnt eventually show up he phoned the morro bay police department a desk officer named lucchese remembered wainright because the surgeon had once removed a fatty tumor from his back good surgeon not really said lucchese left me a lump scar no bedside manner either just get in there and slice only reason i used him is he had a contract with the union any theories about what happened to him that was some pretty rough terrain he was climbing best guess is he broke a leg or fainted or had a heart attack or a stroke or whatever lay there without anyone noticing and either died outright or from dehydration or hypothermia eventually he probably got taken care of by mountain lions or kyeoats or both human suspects were never on the radar no reason for them to be whys this interest you lieutenant a former patient of wainrights is a suspect in a killing down here that so who former inmate at ventura state in camarillo back when wainright worked there a nutter we got plenty of those over at atascadero and i guess one of them couldve known wainright from there but those guys never get out theyre the least of our problems he chuckled best therapy lock em up and toss the key wainright worked at atascadero parttime said lucchese guess he had a contract there too but there were no escapes around the time he went missing no alerts nothing ill ask around for you but i wont learn anything milo thanked him and clicked off petra said oh my i said shacker was first then as soon as huggler got out they went after wainright the trespassing bust delayed but didnt deter them a year later wainright was dispatched easy to stalk the guy while he hiked said milo why would he fear a vengeful patient from almost twenty years before even hugglers arrest wouldnt have alerted him if he even rememberedor knewhugglers name morro bay pd figured huggler for an addict out to score no reason to id him to wainright after they picked him up even if they had why would wainright connect a grown man to a kid hed operated on years before surgeon becomes patient said petra god how many others are out there milo said if huggler and his mentor could wait to handle wainright and quigg and whoever else they mightve done in between whyd shacker have to go right away i said shacker was a solo act by pitty so pitty could prove himself to huggler and cement their bond for that he needed a quick dramatic result look what i did for you little buddy said petra there was also time pressure shacker was elderly and hed just been fired meaning he wouldve left town so pitty reverted to something that had worked for him a few months before poisoning as in eccless lady friend said petra two people drop dead within moments of leaving the hospital what kind of poison could be calibrated that precisely i said it wouldnt have to be poison per se with a man of shackers age and dietary habits a huge dose of a strong heart stimulant could do the trick as an alcoholic and a cocaine abuser eccless wife would also be vulnerable to cardiac insult milo said no poison per se means nothing on the tox screen he got up paced tugged an earlobe everything youre saying makes sense alex but unless one of these two monsters confesses i dont see mentor going down for anything other than id theft and practicing without a license and men tee could get away clean hes left no trace evidence and all we have on him are ambiguous sightings and a vsign he shot to john banforth that could be interpreted any number of ways i said find them and separate them huggler could be crackable your mouth fedexed to gods ears said petra ive got another timing issue if pitty got slimed one too many times by eccles and took it out on eccless wife why wait all these years to get the slimer himself maybe he figured hed get more immediate pleasure from watching eccles suffer than from dispatching him from having eccles know what had happened and being powerless to do anything about it milo said who the hells gonna pay attention to some lunatics ravings i said pitty couldve planned to do eccles after eccles was discharged but eccles went underground and pitty couldnt find him as to why didnt eccles try to get back at pitty maybe his mental illness got in the waytoo disturbed and scattered to devise a plan or said petra he was scared and got the heck out of dodge milo said then pitty just happens to spot eccles years later in hollyweird i said its not that big a coincidence youve got a tip placing huggler at a hollywood clinic the neighborhoods a magnet for drifters and shortterm residents with shacker renting a beverly hills office ive been figuring him for a nice crib but maybe he economizes in order to afford that office and he and huggler are bunking in some paybytheweek on my turf said petra thrilling milo said we could write screenplays all night but at this point we dont even know if huggler was actually transferred to atascadero let alone pitty or whatever his name is moving to be with him so lets stake out this fake shrink nab him on id theft and see what shakes out bh business district is small well need to be subtle meaning more sets of eyes extralow profile im gonna have moe and sean with me and whoever bh wants to send assuming they cooperate wouldnt mind raul either if its okay with you petra made the call done i said did you manage to get hold of eccless last arrest report sure did and the complainant wasnt named pitty or close something stewart whatd he list for an address you really think he could be pitty something about him got eccles hyped up back to her iphone mr loyal steward with a d she read off a phone number and a street address and her eyes got tight main street city of ventura thats commercial isnt it its also two towns north of camarillo her aerial gps confirmed it big old parking lot guys she checked the phone number loyal steward had given to the arresting officers inactive and a call to the phone company revealed it had never been in use loyal steward said milo thats gotta be phony i said its not a name its how he sees himself chapter milo played database piano on my computer with the grim concentration of a lonely kid at an arcade no residential listings drivers license or criminal record for loyal steward he said big surprise and called deputy chief maria thomas she was miffed about being interrupted at home and balked at disturbing the chief milo began with tact eased into bland persistence ended up with barely veiled menace like a lot of bureaucrats she had a weak will when confronted with dedication within minutes the chief had phoned milo and milo was doing a lot of blankfaced listening soon after a senior beverly hills detective named eaton rang in milo started to explain eaton said it came straight from my boss like im gonna say no when milo hung up petra said maybe one day i can be a loo tenant thats like wishing for wrinkles kid six the following morning found eight people surveilling the office building on bedford drive where a yettobeidentified man pretended to be dr bernhard shacker downtown beverly hills was yawning itself awake vanilla swirls of daylight scratching their way through a graysatin sky a few delivery trucks rumbled by but for a scatter of joggers and putupon citizens ruled by the intestinal tracts of fluffy dogs the sidewalks were bare bhpd knew the building couldnt recall a problem there since three years ago when a plastic surgeon and his wife had been hauled off for mutual domestic violence they start whaling on each other in the waiting room said bh detective roland munoz anorexic women with stitchedup faces are sitting there freaking out an hour into the watch a custodian unlocked the buildings brass front doors tenants had keys and the alarm code and could come and go but none had appeared after nine the night before when munoz and detective richard eaton had earned overtime watching the last trickle of weary healthcare providers none of them shacker exiting between nine and this morning hourly drivebys by bh patrol cars had spotted no activity in or around the structure not an ironclad assurance but confidence was high that the identity thief had yet to appear the rear alley door was also keyoperated and sean binchy watched it from the front seat of a borrowed con edison van accompanied by munoz a jovial man whose mood was even rosier because hed rather be doing this than responding to false intruder calls phoned in by hysterical rich people lost cats too last week a woman on north linden drive had d on melissa making her sound like a human in jeopardy not an angora up a tree the building offered no onsite parking but doctors and their staffs got a discount at the private pay facility two doors south that opened at six thirty this early plenty of metered street parking remained available but only seven vehicles had seized the opportunity milo ran the tags nothing interesting he and i were stationed on the east side of bedford drive twenty yards north of the brass doors in a silver blackwindowed mercedes that hed borrowed from the lapd confiscation lot the former owner was an ecstasy dealer from torrance the interior was spotless black calfskin the brightwork polished steel the white bunnyrabbit headliner and matching carpeting sucked free of lint a strong shampoo fragrance lingered mixed in with the smell of honeyroasted peanuts milo had told me to dress bh meaning knock yourself out so you blend in with the hoohahs the best i could come up with was jeans and a gray wool pullover emblazoned with an italian designers surname the sweater was a tenyearold gift from the sister i never saw other peoples names on my clothing make me feel like an impostor this was the first time id worn it milos costume consisted of a royalblue velour tracksuit piped with thick strands of silver lame resembling rivulets of mercury oversized designer logo on the sleeves and on one thigh some sort of hiphop artiste id never heard of the outfit managed to be too large for him settled in folds tucks and wrinkles a sharpei would covet id controlled myself but now i said congrats for what highbidding on suge knights storage bin hmmph got it at the barneys sale vip night if you will in case you find that relevant my job everythings relevant howd you get vipped store manager was in a car crash rick saved his nose a slim dark figure zipped past us heading north petra dressed in black bicycle pants and pullover neared completion of her second squareblock jog the role milo had assigned her was a variant of her normal morning routine and she ran like she meant it up near wilshire a grubby homeless person in shapeless graybrown tatters shuffled bobbed his skicapped head gazed up at the morning sun jaywalked east moe reed had volunteered for that part milod said cleancut kid like you i did it last year el tee checking out a bad guy in hollywood petra had said he was convincing trust me fine said milo well get you some bum duds no need said reed still have the threads from last year wash em sure then you wont be authentic but hey go for it observers seven and eight were two female bh officers patrolling in a blackandwhite on a tenminute circuit shimoffs second drawing of grant shearling huggler was taped to their dashboard along with a description of fauxdrshacker that id supplied nothing unusual about a conspicuous police presence in beverly hills response time was three minutes and citizens liked seeing their protectors by six thirty the pay lot had opened and cars trickled in thirteen more street spots had been taken every tag checked out clean except for a woman with an address on south doheny drive who owed over six hundred bucks in parking tickets this morning her lexus was being driven by an asian woman in a white housekeepers uniform doing a pickup at the deli on the corner no sign of either suspect and that remained the status by eight am when patients began showing up at the brass doors same for nine am ten ten thirty milo yawned turned to me when you were in practice when did you start work depended i said on what the patient load emergencies court maybe all he does is insurance work that could mean easy hours insurance companies hire a murderous fraud he smiled maybe he put that on his application he got out loped to the deli ordered something and scanned the three customers at the counter a few minutes later he returned with bagels and overboiled coffee we ate and drank and lapsed into silence at eleven am he stretched and yawned again and said enough radioing reed he instructed the young detective to alter his bumshamble from wilshire to bedford where he could keep an eye on the buildings entrance then he informed everyone else that he was going inside to have a look i said ill go too i can point him out to you he thought about that doubt hes in there but sure as we walked through the bluecarpeted oakpaneled hallway his oversized tracksuit flapped eliciting a few amused looks my designer sweater didnt seem overly humorous but two young women in nurses uniforms smiled at me then broke into muted giggles as i passed just a coupla wannabe clowns providing comic relief we took the stairs to the second floor where milo cracked the door and scanned the corridor suite was just a few feet away the nameplate on shackers door was gone he went and had a close look waved me over the glue outlines surrounding the sign were visible recent removal shimoffs too good an artist he said bastard saw his prodigys face on tv burrowed straight underground he radioed the detail told them the suspects were unlikely to show but to stay in place anyway we took the stairs back down searched the directory for the buildings manager found no listing a clerk at the groundfloor dispensing apothecarie had a business card on file nourzadeh realty headquartered in a building on camden drive right around the corner the name on the card was the managing partner ali nourzadeh he wasnt in and milo spoke to a secretary ten minutes later a young woman in a red cowlneck cashmere sweater studded with rhinestones at neck and cuffs black tights and threeinch heels arrived with a ring of keys big enough to burglarize a suburb im donna nourzadeh what seems to be the problem milo flashed his card pointed to the glueframe unless your signs tend to fall off looks like your tenant cut out darn she said youre sure no but lets have a look inside i dont know if i can do that why not the tenant has rights not if he abandoned the office we dont know that we will once we go in hmm donna how long has dr shacker been renting seven months shortly before hed screened vita berlin using fake credentials maybe hed offered wellstart a bargain fee that got them slavering milo said was he a good tenant donna nourzadeh thought about that we never heard any complaints from him and he paid six months up front how much was that twentyfour thousand milo eyed the keys donna nourzadeh said he did something quite likely you dont need a warrant like i said if dr shacker left prematurely you control the premises and all i need is your permission hmm call your boss said milo please she complied spoke in farsi selected a key and moved toward the lock milo stilled her with a big index finger atop a small wrist better i do it what do i do in the meantime other business he took the key she hurried away the tiny white waiting room was unchanged from the time id seen it same trio of chairs identical magazines same newage music some sort of digitalized harp solo streaming at low volume the red light on the twobulb panel was lit in session milo freed his mm approached the door to the inner office and knocked no answer he rapped again tried the doorknob it rotated with a squeal stepping to the left of the door he called out doctor no answer louder dr shacker the music switched to flute a nasal arpeggio vibrating with the subtlety of a human voice an unhappy human keening whining milo nudged the door another inch with his toe waited afforded himself another half inch and peeked through cherrysized lumps sprouted along his jawline his teeth clicked as he holstered his gun he motioned me to follow him in chapter drapes were drawn on the window overlooking bedford drive lowvoltage light from a desk lamp turned the pale aqua walls grayish blue the walnut desk was bare the same diplomas remained affixed to the walls he had no further need for them had moved on to another role in reduced light the cubist print of fruit and bread looked drab and cheap the scandinavian chairs had been nudged closer together set for an intimate chat one chair was bare something occupied its mate milo flicked on the ceiling light and we had a look a mason jar filled with clear greasy liquid was propped against the chairback floating inside were two grayish round things milo gloved up kneeled lifted the jar one of the orbs shifted exposing additional color pale blue dot centered by a black sphere pinkish strands streamed like tiny worms from the other side he shifted the jar again and the second orb bounced and turned showed the same decoration the same fuzzy pink filaments a pair of eyeballs human oversized pearl onions bobbing in a horrific cocktail milo put the jar where it had originally sat called for a crime scene crew priority as he radioed the others i noticed a discordant detail across the room the largest diploma placed dead center behind the desk chair had been altered when id seen it it had verified bernhard shackers doctorate from the university of louvain now a sheet of white paper blocked that boast i walked over glue marks were evident at the periphery of the glass bubbling the underside of the sheet blank white rectangle but for a single message chapter a coroners investigator named rubenfeld took possession of the jar never seen that before he said always a first time milo said any way to tell how long theyve been in there rubenfeld squinted if the fluid was real old id expect more discoloration but cant really say he bobbled the jar gently the severed ends are a little faded outthats small blood vessels youre seeing look like feathers the eyes themselves seem a little rubbery no that could mean theyve been preserved for a while could be lab specimens theyre specimens all right said milo but not from a lab rubenfeld licked his lips giving time estimates of body parts really isnt my pay grade lieutenant maybe dr jernigan will be able to tell you he glanced back at the chair one thing you can be pretty sure of that blue in the irises your victims probably caucasian thanks for the tip said milo well before the crime scene crew arrived hed obtained a readout of dr louis wainrights last recorded california drivers license blue eyes no need for corrective lenses rubenfeld swung the carrier gently least i dont need a gurney milo got the cleaning schedule from donna nourzadeh the suites were tended to weekly by a crew of five but this week thered been a delay and no office had been touched for three nights scheduling issues she said now if you dont need me milo let her go turned to me sometime during the last seventytwo hours the bastard planted the jar i thought hed displayed the eyes expecting to be discovered left the question mark behind to confirm his connection to the murders boasting unworried because he was on to a new phase whatever his intentions the man who called himself shacker had cleaned up with care vacuuming the rugs so thoroughly that the crime scene techs pulled up only a few crumbs hard surfaces had been wiped free of prints including in places where youd expect to find them the crime scene crew began to lose energy as it went through the final motions then one of the techs said hey and brandished a tape shed pulled off the glass fronting one of the diplomas shackers datealtered psychology license positioned to the left of the paperedover diploma photoshopped on goodquality paper even up close the forgery was convincing the tech held the tape up to the light nice clear pattern of ridges and swirls lifted from the upper righthand corner of the pane looks like a thumb and a finger said the tech like someone leaned on it i pointed to the page with the question mark maybe to catch his balance while gluing that or its just from the cleaning crew said milo aw cmon lieutenant the tech said think positive okay he said hows this ive got a pension plan might live long enough to use some of it the afis match to the latent came back at seven thirteen pm handdelivered by sean binchy to milo as he presided over a tableful of food at cafe moghul petra moe reed raul biro and i sat around the table everyone was hungry in a frustrated miserably compulsive way putting away lamb and rice and lentils and vegetables without tasting much milo read the report bared his teeth passed it on james pittson harrie male caucasian fortysix had been fingerprinted upon joining the staff of ventura state hospital a little over twentyfive years ago harries fiveyearold dmv shot featured the smiling visage of the elfinfaced rosycheeked man id met slightly longer hair made for a less artful combover five six one forty one of the few who didnt bother to fib about his stats honor among fiends harries listed address was a pob in oxnard sean said already checked and its a parcel shipping outlet in a strip mall theyre still in business but they havent had boxes for five years well before harrie used it im thinking he lived in or around that general area lied to stay off the grid i said oxnards one town north of camarillo and one below ventura where he also lied about living as loyal steward biro said everythings revolving around the beach towns returning to roost i nodded sean said his last registered ride is a fifteenyearold blue acura but he hasnt paid his regs for years got his license suspended want me to put a bolo on the tags anyway you bet said milo good work kid wanna join us for some grub thanks but id rather be working binchy blushed not that you guys arent working milo said go be productive sean and binchy hurried out of the restaurant petra studied james pittson harries photo aka pitty finally we have a face and a name dont imagine driving illegally weighs on someone like that but if he was stupid enough to hold on to his old wheels and keep expired tags on that bolo could be exactly what we need milo cracked his knuckles where the hell are the two of them crashing like raul said the beach towns keep popping up but that wouldnt stop them from drifting down here to do their dirty work and sticking around for a while i said if harrie moved to atascadero after huggler got transferred there maybe he listed a forwarding when he left a call to the hospital was fruitless two records clerks and a supervisor claiming old personnel records couldnt be accessed until business hours began the following morning even with that dont get your hopes up said the supervisor weve got major storage issues dont hold on to everything a second intrusion into maria thomass domestic life resulted in a call from atascaderos deputy director of human resources whod somehow managed to pull harries employment application during nonbusiness hours milo got the restaurants fax number from the woman in the sari and told him to send everything he had he asked a few more questions scrawled unreadable notes thanked the man and hung up and began reciting on his atascadero application james pittson harrie had claimed a ba in psychology from the university of oregon in eugene for one year after graduation hed worked as a veterinary technician at a local animal hospital then moved to camarillo where he applied to be a psychiatry tech at vstate from four legs to two legs said petra maybe harries the one who likes dogs thats why they take them reed said the question is likes them for what ugh milo read on he didnt receive a tech job but they did hire him as a janitor looks like he did that for thirteen fourteen months got promoted to custodial officer level one custodial as in guard not as in sweeping up that seems to be as high as he got there but then he moved to atascadero as part of a compensation program staffers whod lost their jobs at vstate were given priority at other state facilities and atascadero granted his wish he came on as a psychiatric technician level one the hr guy insisted they have no records of which specific wards he worked but he mustve performed okay because he got promoted to level three and left voluntarily a little over five years ago which happens to be shortly before grant huggler was discharged and guess who stayed on dr louis wainright guy had a halftime consultancy with atascadero doing outpatient surgical procedures received the same transfer courtesy i said how long after harrie resigned was huggler arrested behind wainrights office milo squinted to decipher his own shorthand looks like three days guess they got right to work reed said anyone want to lay odds on who bailed huggler out petra said that leaves four years until they did vita way too long for there to be no one else reed said maybe another doctor was involved in hugglers surgery an anesthesiologist or a nurse i said bodies never showed up because at that point huggler and harrie were still concealing their handiwork id concentrate on disappearances between morro bay and camarillo anyone with a healthcare job milo said wainright gave up whatever private practice he had in camarillo to keep working for the state unbeknownst to him he made harrie and hugglers job easy but harrie and huggler still waited until huggler got out to do him said petra fifteen years of waiting i said the key at that point was for huggler to be directly involved think of it as therapy biro toyed with his food wonder if those eyes are wainrights petra said anyone here want to volunteer approaching wainrights family and explaining why we want their dna even worse said reed we do it and the eyes turn out not to be wainrights milo said enough banter kiddies still hungry raul biro looked at his plate nah im finished then how about starting with the calls from morro south anyone with a medical background disappearing between wainrights final hike and vita berlins murder you bet he walked to a corner of the restaurant the woman in the sari came over with a silver tray faxes for you lieutenant nothing like dessert milo scanned the material handed it to petra who did the same and passed it on james pittson harries atascadero personnel photo portrayed a young man with long thick straight hair draping his brow from hairline to eyeridge much of the remaining facial space was taken up by a dense beard hippie in a uniform grant hugglers patient id showed him with even longer hair and a patchy beard long enough to conceal his top shirt button moe reed said wainright was last seen in the mountains and these two look like mountain men maybe they camped up there were ready for him milo compared the photo with harries drivers license he cleaned up well enough to fake being a bh shrink got himself insurance gigs but he had to be doing well before he rented that office because he anted up twentyfour g in cash so maybe he practiced somewhere else or had another scam going i said or he collects monthly pension checks as a state employee for over two decades hed have a generous payout maybe a bonus for leaving early and huggler would qualify for all sorts of welfare if the two of them have lived prudently they couldve saved up plenty and if they are living off the state the checks get mailed somewhere milo tried maria thomas again sat there for a while tapping his fingers on the table dammit answer unanswered prayer he tried another number same result petra said who was your second choice his voluminousness you have his personal line ive got a line he sometimes answers a got him the pension boards main office in sacramento closed until working hours tomorrow morning he cursed shoveled food biro returned to the table got an interesting hit in camarillo woman named joanne morton eighteen months ago went hiking in the foothills not that far from where vstate used to be and hasnt been seen since it was initially worked as a lowpriority mp then they started considering suicide because morton had a history of depression and her third divorce had really knocked her low it was the ex who reported her missing but he didnt stay a suspect for long lives in reno and could account for his whereabouts whyd he call said petra concerned about her they broke up but it was friendly he told them joanne had issues he was worried she might hurt herself and yes she was a surgical nurse freelanced around town reed said if i helped wainright mutilate kids i might have issues milo said was she hiking with a dog if she was said biro its not in the report petra said a pets not a prereq for getting carved up its just a perk for the bad guys eighteen months ago they are going down a list eighteen months ago said reed leaves plenty of time for someone between wainright and morton or after her and before berlin i said or they started off gradually picked up the pace because its no longer just about revenge whats it about said milo recreation no one spoke for several seconds milo said moe you and sean and whoever else you can get whos competent do a total and comprehensive recanvass of all the murder neighborhoods using the drawing of huggler and harries dmv photo petra how about you and raul try to find the clinic where the tipster claimed huggler got his thyroid meds that doesnt work out go back to north hollywood day and lean on mick ostrovine to produce medical records for grant huggler we know he was there and im not buying ostrovines hearnoevil ill contact the pension board first thing tomorrow find out if checks are being mailed to one or both of our creepos if i get an address we reconvene and map out an assault probably with swat ill also talk to jernigan see if those eyeballs can be dnad and if they can ill approach wainrights family he snatched up his phone called in a dmv on wainrights nurse joanne morton brown eyes so theyre not hers any questions without waiting for an answer he stood brushed off his trousers threw money on the table when the others reached into their wallets he said not a chance reed said youre always footing the bill el tee pay me back with good deeds chapter petra and raul biro divided the assignments hed look for free clinics where grant huggler mightve gotten his prescription shed have a go at mick ostrovine figuring a soft touch might work better with the administrator than another dose of male cop ostrovine sighed a lot said here we go again paid lip service to patient confidentiality but sooner than petra expected he said oh all right come around and look for yourself she crossed to his side of the desk as he opened up some files see said ostrovine nudging closer and favoring her with a burntwhiskey whiff of some terrible cologne alphabetized patient records no huggler how about james harrie with an ie maybe middle initial p long theatrical sigh ostrovine pecked see nothing its like i told those first officers were not connected to any of this petra said im sure youre right mick but mr huggler was definitely here for a thyroid scan i explained the first time he never received the scan so thered be no record petra flashed him her best wholesome smile just to be sure mick id like to show mr harries photograph and this drawing of mr huggler to your staff oh no were swamped the horde shed seen in the waiting room said the mope wasnt lying i know you are mick but id really appreciate it she showed ostrovine the images first the drawing elicited nothing but he blinked at the photo giving him a chance to fill in the blank she sat back down what he said irritated maybe her feminine touch had lost its mojo never seen him not in this world or any other no one on staff recognized either man even margaret wheeling about to prep a sleepylooking homeless type for a nodoubtpricey mri had seemed confused when shown alex shimoffs second drawing guess so petra said when you spoke to lieutenant sturgis you were sure youd met him well my drawing was different like she was the artist petra said this one doesnt resemble the man who confronted dr usfel wheeling squinted id need to put on my glasses you dont need to see accurately when youre magnetizing someone go right ahead ms wheeling wheeling let out a long exhalation followed by an eye roll another dramatic type this place was like one of those summer camps for histrionic kids obsessed with musical theater glasses in place the fool continued to just stand there ms wheeling i think its him maybe thats the best i can do it was a long time ago what about this man hes a friend of hugglers emphatic head shake that i can tell you never petra reported to milo he said good work onward kid she frowned at the unearned praise at biros third clinic the hollywood benevolent health center he got as far as a volunteer receptionist the place was makeshift set up with rolling partitions and what looked to be pretty tired medical equipment in the basement of a church on selma just west of vine big old beautiful catholic church with intricate plaster details and an oak door that had to weigh a ton smaller than but not unlike st catherine in riverside where biros parents had taken him for mass when he was a kid all that grace and style ended in the basement the space was dank windowless patchily lit by bare bulbs suspended from extension cords stapled to the ceiling the wires drooped some of the bulbs were dead where the walls werent chipped white plaster they were rough gray block wilting posters about stds and immunizations and nutrition were taped randomly everything in federal government spanish the waiting room wasnt a room at all just a clearing surrounded on three sides by stacks of long wooden folded tables half of the lawn chairs provided were occupied all by latino women who kept their eyes down and pretended not to notice biro as he approached the desk his spotless beige suit white shirt and olive paisley silk tie drew some admiring glances then he flashed his badge and someones breath caught and all eyes shot downward had to be one of those sanctuary deals for undocumenteds biro felt like shouting he wasnt la migra one thing in his favor an anglo male like huggler would stand out maybe this would lead somewhere the receptionist was also hispanic a wellgroomed dyed blonde in her late twenties a little extracurvy in places where that was okay no name tag no welcoming smile raul grinned at her anyway explained what he needed her face closed up all our doctors are volunteers they come in and out so i dont know who youd talk to raul said the doctor who treated grant huggler i dont know who that is the doctor or huggler both said the receptionist either could you please check your files we dont have files what do you mean just that we dont have files how can you run a clinic without records there are records she said the doctors take them when they leave why the patients are theirs not ours biro said aw cmon thats the way we do it she said thats the way weve always done it were not an official healthcare provider what are you then a space a space the church merely provides access for providers to provide merely and access and providers gave that the sound of a prepared speech this place was definitely set up for illegals scared people coming in with godknowswhat diseases afraid to broach the county system even though no one there asked questions he glanced at the women in the lawn chairs they continued to pretend he didnt exist no one appeared especially sick but you never knew his mother had just told him about one of her friends visiting relatives in guadalajara and coming back with tuberculosis telling it the way she always did as if raul had the power to prevent such disasters he said no charts here at all the receptionist said not a one that sounds a little disorganized miss actually its superorganized she said not offering a name so we can multitask multitask how when the church needs to use the space for something else we wheel everything out of the way how often do doctors come in and use the space most every day so you dont do much wheeling shrug raul leaned in and half whispered youve got people waiting but i dont see any doctors dr keefers due in when soon but he cant help you whys that hes new yesterday was his first day so he wouldnt know your mr whatever huggler funny name biro looked at her she said i dont know him he gave her a look at his business card she said you already showed me your badge i believe that youre police see what this says moments hesitation okay homicide said biro thats all i care about solving murders okay grant huggler may have a funny name but hes suspected of committing several really nasty murders he needs to be stopped before he does more damage he glanced back at the waiting women trying to imply that they could turn up as victims the receptionist blinked he showed her the drawing she shook her head dont know him we dont want murderers here if i knew him id tell you are you the only receptionist herewhat is your name leticia no im not a bunch of us volunteer how many is a bunch i dont know he pulled out an enlargement of james pittson harries lapsed drivers license how about him to biros surprise she went pale whats the matter hes a doctor what kind mental health she said a therapist he came in to ask questions but he never came back what kind of questions did we do insurance work he said he had a lot of experience with it could help if someone needed help with an accident or an injury i told him we didnt do that here he gave me his card but i threw it out i didnt even read his name but you remember him we dont usually get doctors walking in to drum up business what was his attitude like a doctor meaning businesslike he didnt seem like one of those but i guess he was one of those what slipandfall scammers those we get from time to time scouts working for lawyers trying to exploit your patients nod no attempt to claim theyre not our patients so mr harrie told you he was a psychologist or a psychiatrist i forget hes not nope oh howd he react when you turned him down just said thanks and gave me the card how long ago did this happen a while back said leticia months how many i dont knowsix five that long ago but you remember him like i told you it was unusual she said also he was anglo we dont get too many white guys period except for homeless who come in from the boulevard unzipping his file case raul showed her a mug shot of lemuel eccles like him sure thats lem he comes in once in a while for what youd have to ask his doctor whos that dr mendes first name anna mendes raul kept the photo in her face she turned to the side he said so lem comes in but this white guyswitching back to the drawing of huggleryou dont know about correct do these guys know each other or something you could say that the other one too the psychologist what else can you tell me about lem just that he comes in she said he can be difficult but mostly hes okay difficult how nervous kind of wired talks to himself like hes crazy like said biro we dont judge do you have a list of the other receptionists i dont keep any lists and i dont know who they are cause when im here theyre not and you all volunteer yeah through what agency no agency i do it for community service she was too old for a high school student didnt look like an excon any kind of troublemaker what kind of community service are you doing its for a class urban issues im a senior at cal state la you think maybe upstairs in the church office theyd have a list could be biro said okay im going to leave you my card the way mr harrie did but please dont throw it out she hesitated take it leticia good people need to be good even when theyre not volunteering her mouth dropped open raul began climbing the steps to the churchs groundfloor lobby one of the women in the lawn chairs said something in spanish too soft for biro to make out the words but the emotion was obvious relief as he headed for the church office a young man in a white coat and carrying a box crossed his path m keefer md resident in medicine at county general ninetyhour work weeks but he had time to volunteer raul said hi there doctor ever seen this guy m keefer said no sorry and bounced down the stairs the church office was locked the magnificent marble sanctuary unoccupied raul returned to his car and got a number for an anna q mendes md in boyle heights this receptionist answered in spanish and maybe it was biro responding in kind maybe not but she said of course and a moment later a warm female voice said dr mendes how can i help you she listened to biros explanation said the thyroid case sure i referred him for the scan he came in for a refill of his synthroid but his medical history was patchy he looked a little underdosed to me and he was well overdue for a good look at his neck he was reluctant but his therapist helped me convince him his therapist some psychologist came with him i thought that level of care was pretty impressive especially because the psychologists office was in beverly hills and huggler clearly wasnt a paying private patient the ease with which she tossed out facts surprised biro not even an attempt at resistance and he wondered if shed been the anonymous tipster he said did the psychologist give his name he did but i cant recall dr shacker you know i think thats it said anna mendes he readily agreed that in order to optimize the dosage wed need better data in the meantime i upped mr hugglers dosage a tiny bit and wrote a scrip for three months worth anything else you can tell me about huggler you said you were in homicide said mendes so obviously he killed someone biro hadnt mentioned homicide and obviously huggler couldve been a victim as easily as an offender definitely the tipster looks like that doctor my brother was murdered six years ago she said stupid wrongaddress driveby the imbeciles shot him with an ak while he slept in his bed im so sorry they never caught the bastards who did it thats why im talking to you someone kills someone they should get what they deserve but no thats really all i can tell you about huggler what was his attitude quiet passive didnt say much didnt make eye contact in fact he was so quiet that even before the therapistshackercame in id started wondering about some sort of mental illness could that be because of his thyroid no way she said if he was a bit hypothyroid like i suspected he might slow down a tad maybe lose some energy gain some weight but nothing significant he might also feel cold which is the first thing that tipped me off he was overdressed for the weather big heavy fleecelined coat i never confirmed my hypothesis though because he never came back with any lab results could we expect him to get sicker not if he takes his meds even with his old dosage this was no weakling just the opposite i checked him out and his muscle tone was really good excellent actually he had huge muscles in clothes you couldnt tell he looked almost pudgy overdressed because he felt cold or maybe it was a symptom of mental illness you see that from time to time biro said speaking of mental patients they told me at the clinic that lem eccles was your patient was something happened to him afraid so said biro hes dead a beat and thats connected to huggler could be oh wow said mendes well if youre going to ask me did i see them together i didnt could you check your records and see if they happened to be at the clinic on the same day i could if i was at my other office in montebello where i keep all the clinic records kind of a strange system said biro doctors taking the paperwork with them big pain said mendes but they insist upon it that way theyre not an official clinic just donate space in case la migra asks mendes laughed its not very subtle is it i dont get involved in any of that i treat patients politics isnt my thing you work there on a volunteer basis she laughed harder did it look like there was any serious money to be made there yes i volunteer i was a scholarship student at immaculate heart and the archdiocese helped with my med school tuition they ask for a favor i say sure so what did this huggler actually do its nasty said biro then forget i asked detective i trained at county saw more than enough nasty i certainly hope you catch him and if i ever see him again youll be the first to know couple more things said raul you said dr shacker showed up after huggler so huggler came in by himself technically i guess he did said mendes a few minutes later shacker showed up said hed been parking the car i got the clear impression theyd arrived together now if you dont mind ive got patients waiting parking the car small point to her but rauls brain was screaming a vehicle ripe for a bolo he said one more question how come you referred huggler to north hollywood day because dr shacker recommended it you should get the details from him he really seemed to care about huggler then again hed probably have confidentiality issues so do i but murders different biro filled petra in she said its a good bet shacker spotted eccles at that clinic ill go back to the uniforms who busted eccles see if theres anything else they remember about loyal steward and seeing as harrie directed the doctor to north hollywood day and hes an insurance whore and theyre an insurance mill its obvious my charm didnt work as well with ostrovine as i thought and hes still holding back you up for badcopping him more than up said raul raring to go on the way to the valley he phoned in and reported to milo milo said good work raul onward id just stepped into his office he wheeled his chair back see how supportive i am with the younguns admirable not that anything theyve learned adds up to a warm bucket of spit until we locate these freakoids he summarized id been up late trying to answer some questions of my own mentally reviewing my brief talk with james harrie to see if id missed something understanding why someone like huggler would welcome harries caretaking but not getting what was in it for harrie because if a man that calculated was able to exact his own brand of vengeance why raise the risk of discovery by collaborating with someone so deeply disturbed engaging in twentyplus years of what was effectively fosterparenting what was in it for the parent the small questions had resolved quickly but the big picture remained clouded and i couldnt shake the feeling that id made several wrong turns i said the pension angle didnt work out the pension board is absolutely certain that no checks are mailed from any government agency to james p harrie same for the welfare office regarding assistance payments to grant huggler i tried out a whole bunch of spelling variations because paperwork gets messed up even checked under shackers name because hed also been a state employee maybe harrie had stolen his benefits as well as his identity no such luck those checks are sent to a cousin in brussels so maybe were dealing with freeenterprise criminals intent on making it the oldfashioned way i said how much money are we talking about best estimate i could get was someone in harries situation could pull a pension of three to four grand a month depending if he claimed stress or disability no way to know exactly what hugglers qualified for theres an alphabet soup of welfare goodies for someone who knows how to work the system top estimate was two or so a month the two of them pool their funds they can rake in as much as sixty seventy thousand a year taxfree i dont see them forgoing that big guy even with harrie making money as a fake psychologist he put up serious money for that office mustve started with some sort of stash so the checks are going somewhere what if harrie stole ids other than shackers for himself and for huggler someone crosschecks social security numbers theyd get found out big if i said but okay what if they went the legal route and changed their names in court any switch for huggler would have to be within the last four years because he was still using his real name when he got arrested behind wainrights office send the check to jack the ripper and his lil pal the zodiac some computer obliges without a squawk wonderful he called a superior court clerk hed befriended years ago hung up looking deflated guess what court orders are no longer required for name changes all you have to do now is use your new moniker consistently while conducting official business and eventually the new datas integrated into the county data bank he yanked a drawer open snatched a panatela rolled it still wrapped between his fingers but youre right no way theyd pass up that much easy dough his cell phone played erik satie he barked sturgis then in an even louder voice what he turned scarlet back up sean give me the details he listened for a long time scrawled notes so angrily the paper tore twice when he clicked off he was breathing fast i said what he shook his head attacked the phone with both thumbs the image appeared moments later a grainy gray peep show on the phones tiny screen tagged at the top with rolling digital time and the id number of a malibu sheriff cruisers dashcam six thirteen am malibu pacific coast highway mountains to the east so north of the colony where the beach city turns rural the deputy aaron sanchez justifying the stop on the fifteenyearold acura not because of the bolo the tags matched a recent theft from the cross creek shopping center felony stop extreme caution six fourteen am deputy sanchez calls for backup then on loudspeaker exit the vehicle now sir and place your hands on your head no response deputy sanchez exit the vehicle immediately sir and place drivers door opens a man small thin wearing a sweatshirt and jeans emerges places his hands on his head flash of bald spot bad combover deputy sanchez exits his own vehicle gun out aimed at the driver walk toward me slowly the man complies stop the man complies lie down on the ground the man appears to comply then whips around pulling something out of his waistband crouching he points deputy sanchez fires five times the mans small frame absorbs each impact billowing like a sail he falls sirens in the distance gain volume backup no longer needed the whole thing has taken less than a minute milo said bastard they ran the car found the bolo contacted binchy because his name was on the request was the thing in his hand for real ninemillimeter he said unloaded i said suicide by cop whackjob suicide by cop was the sheriffs initial assumption because harrie getting that hardcore to avoid a license plate theft rap made no sense and initially they saw nothing in harries car to make him squirrelly just fruits and vegetables and beef jerky and bottled water probably from one of those stands on the highway then they popped the trunk and found a bunch more firearms ammo duct tape rope handcuffs knives i said rapemurder kit and stains on the carpet presumptive for blood what they didnt find was any sign harrie was running with an accomplice i said because hugglers waiting back home for harrie to return from his grocery run somewhere north of where harrie was pulled over thats a lot of territory what does a kit say to you none of our victims showed evidence of restraint and none of the females was assaulted or posed sexually id bet on a separate victim pool games harrie played solo more likely with backup by huggler jesus it fills in a missing piece i said harrie taking huggler under his wing because of altruism never made sense he was attracted to a disturbed child because of a shared fascination with dominance and violence think of their relationship as hugglers alternative therapy the entire time the staffs at vstate and atascadero were struggling to devise a treatment plan for him harrie was sabotaging them by nurturing hugglers drives and coaching huggler in concealing his bad behavior when huggler got transferred harrie moved with him when huggler finally gained his freedom he and harrie embarked on a new life together foundation for a wholesome relationship he said too bad harrie bit it before the two of them could be booked on the talkshow circuit chapter sean binchys second call pinpointed the coordinates of the shooting james pittson harrie had died miles above the colony leaving or so miles of the beach city and anywhere beyond for a hidespot milo said dont see them scoring a pad on the sand or an oceanview ranch in the hills but if theyre still doing the mountain man bit they could be squatting in some remote place up in the hills i said im certain theyre cashing government checks at some point one or both of them ventures out to get cash so someones seen them my mind keeps fixing on the beach cities above malibu harries used two phony addresses we know about the parking lot on main street in ventura when he told the hollywood cops he was loyal steward and the dead maildrop in oxnard for his drivers license something in the region attracts him what attracts me is nailing huggler before he does more damage once the media latch onto harries deathand they will a cop shootings always a storyhes bound to rabbit that assumes hugglers wired into the media why wouldnt he be harrie couldve made himself hugglers sole link to the outside world no mtv for ol grant huh he said keeps his nose buried in puzzle books until harrie tells him its time to balance the scales with an anatomy lesson even so alex when harrie doesnt return hugglers gonna get antsy if fear overtakes him he might reveal himself and get taken down easy but if he goes the rageroute more people are gonna die and those guns in harries trunk might not be the total stash all i need is a lunatic loaded with heavyduty firepower balance the scales unbalanced my mind raced braked hard a warm wave of clarity washed over me the tickle at the back of my brain finally gone he said you just floated off somewhere what you just said about balancing the scales reminded me of something harrie mentioned when i met with him he asked me about my work with the police then claimed to have no interest in the darker aspects of life called them terrible dyssynchronies obviously he was lying and i think he was playing with me by alluding precisely to whats framed the murders from the onset achieving equilibrium by symbolically undoing the past and that might help focus the search for huggler start where it all began vstate he said theyd go back there they would if it was part of harries treatment plan for huggler you just said his treatment was encouraging hugglers gutgames i did but i was missing something harrie really came to see himself as a therapist like most psychopaths he had an inflated belief in his own abilities no need to actually earn a degree he was already smarter than the shrinks so all he had to do was learn enough jargon to impersonate convincingly and when he went into practice he started right at the top highrent couch row he zeroed in on insurance evaluations because they were lucrative thin on oversight and most important short term with no clinical demands patients wouldnt spend enough time with him to get suspicious and he wouldnt be required to actually help anyone vita got suspicious maybe she sensed something i said or she was just being vita overall harrie got away with it and that had to be a massive ego trip and that led him to see himself as a master therapist with a single longterm patient yes the past five years have been about bloodlust and revenge but theyve also been part of a regimen harrie devised for huggler achieving synchrony by working through old traumas and what better way to achieve that than by returning triumphant to the place where control was ripped away necksnapping and gutsquishing in the name of selfactualization he said the hospital closed down years ago whats there now lets find out milo typed away moments later we had a capsule history courtesy of a historical preservation group the original plan had been to maintain the hospital buildings and convert them to a college campus shortage of funds caused that to languish until six years ago when a group of private developers had purchased the site in a sweetheart deal and put up a planned community called seabird estates he found the website luxury living for the discerning doesnt sound like our boys would fit in i scrolled it also says nestled in sylvan surroundings enough woodland and our boys couldve found refuge he shot to his feet flung his office door open paced the corridor a few times returned using both hands to sketch an imaginary window he peered through an artless mime looks like nice weather for a drive lets go chapter fifty minutes to camarillo courtesy milos leaden foot the same exit off the the same winding road through old dense trees the same feeling of arriving at a strange place untested unsure ready to be surprised what had once been an open field of wildflowers was planted with lemon trees hundreds of them arranged in rows the ground cleared of stray fruit the logo of a citrus collective graced several signs on the borders of the grove the sky was a perfect improbable crayon blue milo sped past the grove i peered through each row looking for errant human presence just a tractor unmanned at the far end the next sign appeared half a mile later lettered in aqua and topped by a rendering of three intenselooking gulls seabird estates a planned community a few yards up shoulderhigh blue gates were hinged to creamcolored stucco posts superficially reassuring but a whole different level of security from vstates twentyfoot bloodred barrier keeping them out was different from keeping them in a guard inside a tiny booth was texting milo tooted his horn the guard looked over but his fingers kept working he slid a window open milos badge pretzeled the guards lips we didnt call in no problem no you didnt can we come in please the guard pondered that resuming texting he stabbed at a button on a builtin console missed the first time got it right on the second the gates swung open the main street was sea bird lane it snaked up a slope that picked up as it climbed condos appeared on both sides of the road landscaping consisted of predictably placed date palms redleaf plum trees beds of lowmaintenance succulents that clung to each curve like green cashmere every building was styled identically neospanish cream like the gateposts red composite roofs trying to pass themselves off as genuine tile superficial resemblance to the old vstate buildings no bars on these windows no foot traffic to speak of during the hospitals tenure staff and lowrisk patients had strolled freely creating an easy energy strangely enough seabird estates felt more custodial milo drove fifty yards in with a light foot before i spotted an original structure the mammoth reception hall where id been oriented a sign staked near the entry read sea horse club house as we continued to explore other hospital structures appeared sea breeze card room sea foam a meeting place former wards and treatment centers and whoknewwhat coexisting with new construction transplanted smoothly a wonder of cosmetic surgery finally a few people showed themselves whitehaired couples strolling casually dressed tan relaxed i was wondering if they had any idea of their neighborhoods origins when a redhaired man in a blue poly blazer one size too large baggy khakis and ripplesoled shoes stepped into the middle of the road and blocked our progress milo braked blazer examined us then came around to the drivers side rudy borchard head of security what can i do for you milo sturgis lapd please to meet you rudy mutual badgeflashes borchards was significantly larger than milos a goldplated star that evoked the ok corral probably larger than anything earp had worn because why offer a generous target so said borchard tentative as if hed only memorized the script this far he placed a protective finger on the knot of his clipon tie his hair was too long in places too short in others dyed the color of overcooked pumpkin a oneweek mustache was a sprinkle of cayenne on a puffy upper lip la police huh this aint la neither is it kansas said milo borchards eyes tilted in confusion he puffed his chest to compensate we didnt call in any problem we know but its like this borchard cut in residents privacy is real important im talking affluent senior retirees they want to feel private and safe safetys our goal too rudy thats why were inquiring about a suspect who might be in the area a suspect here i dont think so guys hope youre right in the area or just close to the area could go either way naw i dont think so said borchard no one gets in here without my sayso our easy entry put the lie to that milo said thats excellent but wed still like to have a look borchard said whos this suspect milo showed him the drawing of huggler borchard said nope not here never been here milo kept the drawing in borchards face borchard stepped back im telling you nope looks like your basic lowlife wouldnt last two seconds here do me a favor and put that away okay i dont want some resident getting their undies all scrunched keep it rudy should you want to post it that would be fine borchard took the drawing folded slipped it into his pocket what exactly this lowlife do killed a bunch of people the red dots atop borchards lip bounced as he chewed air you kidding no way im posting that picture the residents hear killed someonell have a heart attack for sure rudy said milo if grant huggler gets in here its gonna be a lot worse than a heart attack trust me he wont you guys keep it that tight tighter than a virginsreal tight trust me on that how many ways are there to get in here you just saw it the front gate is all basically basically but not completely theres a service entry around the back said borchard hooking a thumb eastward but thats just deliveries and its locked twentyfour seven and its monitored by ccircuit and we know exactly who ingresses and egresses what comes in that way deliveries largescale smallscale come through the front every parcel is checked out before its delivered checked out how the residents give us authorization to sign for ups and fedex and we verify addresses and handdeliver that way no one gets bothered its all part of the service a honk from behind made us turn elderly couple in a white mercedes itching to proceed the woman was stoic but the mans mouth worked you better move over said borchard milo pulled to the curb and we got out the mercedes passed and borchard favored the occupants with a wide wave they ignored him tooled to the next street turned left sea cloud road rudy borchard said have a nice day guys milo said what constitutes largescale deliveries you know bulk stuff were like a town supplies for the clubhouse and the restaurantswe got two the formal and the informalcome in all the time we got nearly eight hundred residents i said the clubhouse is back there so theres a way for the trucks to approach it from the back and drive straight to the loading dock zactly said borchard we cant have semis rumbling through messing up the pavement creating a ruckus where does the service road connect from cuts through the middle of what the rest of the property theres a section thats not developed zactly phase two whens it going to be developed borchard shrugged milo said how do you get to the service road without driving through here you probably took lewis off the freeway right next time get off one exit before then you travel a few streets and go on some farm roads but trust me no ones gonna get in that way and even if they didand they didntthered be nowhere to hide plus the residents have panic buttons in their condos and they can pay extra for portable ones to carry around we got no problems here never milo said so the delivery road cuts through the back and ends up at a loading dock not one dock a bunch and theres always people around trust me your lowlife wouldnt last a minute what even makes you think hes anywhere near here because he used to live here in camarillo its a big place not the city rudy here huh oh he was one of those one of who a nutter from when this was a nuthouse i said do the residents know about that borchard smiled its not on the brochure but sure some of them would have to but no one gives two rats because that was a long time ago and now everythings normal and safe why would a nutter come back to where he was locked up anyway thats not logical psychologically speaking milo suppressed a smile maybe so rudy how many guys on your security staff five including me its enough trust me nothing happens here the whole nut things a joke to us like when something gets dug up dug up when theyre doing landscaping said borchard someones turning the dirt for plants whatever something pops up like what oh no dont go thinking criminal im talking spoons forks cups with the hospital brand on it this big vs one time some buckles and a strap got dug up probably from one of those straitjackets what do you do with all that when you find it i dont find it the landscaping crew does they give it to me and i throw it out what do you think its junk borchard checked his watch your maniac aint here but if he shows up ill take care of it unbuttoning the oversized jacket he gave us a view of a holstered glock nice piece said milo and i know how to use it you were in the military borchard flushed i go to the range have a nice day guys milo said how about showing us that service road youre kidding just so we can tell the boss weve been careful bosses said borchard yeah i hear that fine ill show you but its clear on the other end you dont wanna walk so well drive borchard eyed the unmarked im not getting in the back of that looks bad to the residents you know i promise not to cuff you rudy i like your jokes not he touched the spot beneath his jacket where the gun was positioned you really need to be doing this we drove all the way from la so go get a fish taco in town and say you looked milo smiled okay okay hold on a man with a cane was approaching and borchard hurried to intercept him borchard smiled and talked the man walked away midsentence muttering borchard shot us an itoldyouso look disappeared around a leafy turn and emerged several minutes later driving a canvastopped golf cart hop in for the e ride milo sat next to him i took the rear bench the plastic seat was aqua blue patterned with green herons guys im only doing this coptocop trust me your nutter didnt stow away in some eighteenwheeler everything comes from recognized vendors we log every ingress and egress now if the tunnels were still open i might consider you have a point but theyre not so you dont what tunnels ha knew id get you with that said borchard chuckling im messing with you trust me its nothing no tunnels not anymore and theyre all filled with concrete none but theyre filled you know what i mean you cant go in em milo looked back at me i shook my head borchard said what it was back in the day there were these underground passages between some of the hospital buildings for moving supplies i guess he laughed harder or maybe they ran the nutters down there for exercise punishment whatever anyway when the developers bought the property the county made them fill them all with concrete because of earthquakes you want to see why not said milo casually giving you the full tour gonna be a surcharge laughing and flooring the carts accelerator borchard swung a quick uturn and headed up the road at five mph moments later he stopped at a side street that led to a clump of condos sea wave road motioning us out he squatted parted some bushes inlaid in the dirt was a metal disk around six feet in diameter painted brown unmarked like an oversized manhole cover with two metal eyelets watch this is cool looping a finger around one of the eyelets borchard tried to lift the lid didnt budge he strained must be stuck or something want some help said milo no no no borchard used two hands turned scarlet the lid lifted an inch and borchard let go and some sort of pneumatic mechanism kicked in the lid rose until it was perpendicular with the ground underneath was a circle of concrete borchard stood on top of it jumped like a kid on a trampoline solid all the way through rebar and concrete extrastrong to handle the big one how many openings like this are there rudy who knows most of them are buried over they run under the condos its only when theyre in landscaped areas that we find them ive seen four of those and trust me theyre all solid like this one he jumped twice more nutter skulking through a tunnel would be a good movie unfortunately this is reality guys you really dont want to bother seeing the back fence do you milo shrugged what can i tell you rudy knew youd say that we putputted along sea bird lane switched to sea star drive reached the rear of the development the service road was a single lane of asphalt that passed through a high chainlink gate a closedcircuit camera was bolted to the righthand post through the links a slice of blue sky and brown field and mauve mountains was visible but the broad view afforded only sky above twentyplus feet of ficus hedge the trees had been densely planted on both sides of the fence creating an impenetrable wall of green i strained to catch a lateral glimpse but borchard swung the cart away and drove along the developments south rim parallel to the hedge the road continued for several minutes before branching to a threetine fork okay satisfied milo said where do these roads go theyre not roads theyre driveways that ones to the clubhouse thats to the recreation centerbasically for towels from the linen serviceand that one goes to la mer which is the formal open for dinner only and also to cafe seabird which is right next door and does three meals a day and also has a tearoom for snackswhat the hell ill show you three loading docks all of them bolted shut not a truck in sight despite borchards boast of observers everywhere no workers quiet day said milo its always quiet said borchard as if he regretted the fact reversing the car he headed back toward the front as we passed the chainlink gate milo said stop for a sec and hopped out and peered through he came back stoic whatd you see said borchard empty land right no nutters in sight can i go on you keep the disks from that cc camera knew youd ask that the disk erases itself every twentyfour and we recycle cause theres never nothing on it now im taking you back i already got too many curious residents wanting to know whats up i said what are you going to tell them that you guys are from the county making sure were earthquakesafe which we are totally back at the unmarked milo asked borchard for detailed directions to the undeveloped land just what i told you how about if we dont want to get back on the freeway borchard scratched his head i guess you could as you get out of here turn left then left again but its way longer youre making a big square then you have to drive a ways till you see an artichoke field at least now its artichokes sometimes they plant it with something elsewhen its onions trust me youll smell it you get to the artichokes you still keep going and then youll see a whole bunch of nothing like you just saw through the back gate he scraped a tooth with a fingernail thats how youll know youre there its a whole lot more nothing than anywhere else around here chapter after several wrong turns we found the artichoke field the crop was ample but not ready for picking a solitary man stood sentry near the south edge of the acreage positioned on a dirt road above a drainage ditch drinking ambercolored soda small and darkskinned he wore gray work clothes and a broadbrimmed straw hat when milo pulled the unmarked within a yard of his feet he didnt budge human scarecrow effective not a bird in sight we got out and he finally turned the soda was jarritos tamarindo his workshirt had two flap pockets one was empty the other sagged under the weight of a cellophanewrapped half sandwich some kind of lunch meat spanish writing on the pack hola amigo said milo hola ever see this person the drawing of huggler evoked a head shake same for the photo of the late james pittson harrie ever see anyone around here no never no okay gracias the man tipped his hat and returned to his post repositioning himself with his back to the car milo consulted the notes hed taken from borchards sketchy directions drove another quarter mile made a turn came to a stop guess ol rudy was right humming first seven bars of plenty of nuthin he knuckled an eye a vast field stretched west to the twentyfoot ficus hedge and seabirds rear gate thousands of square feet of brambles and weeds much of it tall as a man droughtfriendly wildflowers with pinched gray foliage alternated with coarse grass bleached to hay ragged bare spots were occupied by shards of rusted metal and tan stucco fragments edged with the snipped ends of chicken wire at the far end a second ficus hedge stood untrimmed and taller than seabirds rear border by a good ten feet the east end where specialized care had once stood behind the wall of green the foothills sprouted like massive tubers we sat in the car dispirited the failure of my theory meant huggler could be anywhere milo said what the hell we tried he lit up a woodtipped panatela exhaled acrid smoke through the drivers window and called in for messages starting with petra the officers whod arrested lemuel eccles thought complainant loyal steward might be james harrie but they couldnt be positive theyd been concentrating on the offender not the victim raul biro had pressured mick ostrovine into giving up the truth yes dr shacker had sent insurance cases to north hollywood day no thered been no kickback he was just another referral source wellstart insurance was through returning calls biro said there had to be kickbacks i found out who owns the place bunch of russians headquartered in arcadia and theyre billing medical gazillions but i dont see pursuing that unless theres an organized crime aspect to our cases god forbid said milo thats what i thought cant think of anywhere else to go with this el tee take your girlfriend out to dinner dont have one said biro not this month then find one said milo meals on me why cause you do your job and dont bitch havent done much on this one el tee so run a tab biro laughed and hung up and milo called the coroner dr jernigan was out but shed authorized her investigator to summarize james pittson harries autopsy for milo harries heart and lungs and brain had been perforated by five bullets fired from the service gun of sheriffs deputy aaron sanchez any of which couldve proved fatal no id had been found on harries person but his fingerprints matched some from twentyfive years ago when hed begun work as a janitor at vstate the human blood in the acuras trunk came from three separate samples two type as one type o dna swabs would take a while to analyze but a sex screen had come back female milo hung up and gazed at weedchoked acreage a tunnel wouldve been nice when you were here you never heard of that no i said whyd you end up here anyway to learn about kids like huggler the patients i saw werent dangerous not even close they get better we made their lives better he said uhhuh his eyes closed he stretched his long legs rested his head on the seatback stayed that way for a while except for the occasional puff on the cigar he appeared to be sleeping i thought about an unusual child living in a special room milo shook himself like a wet dog stubbed the cigar in the ashtray the city officially forbade him from using lets drive around camarillo check out mailbox outlets shitty motels and other potential squats afterward well celebrate nothing with a nice fish dinner at andrea in ventura been there robin and i went whalewatching last year its right near the launch rick and i went whalewatching last year too closest we got was when i caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror i was expected to chuckle so i did he spit a tobacco shred out the window just as he started up the car something moved chapter blurred movement a flickering dot bobbing somewhere past the midpoint of the fields length clear of the rear ficus wall but at this distance no way to gauge how far in front we watched as the shape bounced above the lower grass was obscured by taller vegetation up and down in and out sunlight caught the outer edges limned them gold the gold endured a golden shape some sort of animal too large and not furtive enough to be a coyote the shape got closer lumbering a dog oblivious to our presence making its way through the weeds milo and i got out of the car walked along the border of the field got close enough to make out more details sizable dog obvious golden retriever heritage but too long and narrow in the snout for a purebred one ear perked the other flopped it stopped to pee no legraising a brief submissive squat lowering its head it continued stopping starting sniffing with no obvious goal maybe harking back to some ancient hunting dog imperative we kept walking the dog looked up sniffed the air turned soft eyes grizzled muzzle not a trace of anxiety i said nice to meet you louie we stood on the roadside as louie peed again squatting longer he strained to defecate finally succeeded and pawed the ground before continuing through the field a second shape appeared off to his right materializing from nowhere just as louie had the second dog looked ancient limping and hobbling as it struggled to catch up with louie tenuous steps alternated with shaky halts a few seconds of that led to what appeared to be convulsive loss of control that plunged the animal to the ground it struggled moaned got to its feet trembling louie turned ambled over the other dog remained rooted chest heaving louie licked its face the other dog seemed to revive managed a few more steps louie and his pal entered a low patch that gave us a clear view we edged into the field saw the toopronounced rib cages of both animals louie was underweight the older dog emaciated with a belly tucked tighter than a greyhounds not the abdomen intended for this breed what had once been a muscular body was white skin speckled with brown stretched over spindly bones the head remained noble brown with floppy ears solid bone structure eyes that appeared vacant but continued to dart around intelligently a single brown patch ran along a spinal ridge corrugated by age and malnutrition german shorthaired pointer i said dr wainrights hiking buddy ned all these years milo said they cut up animals but save these two boys and their pets ned paused again breathing hard fighting for balance louie nuzzled him sidled up and kept his own body close to that of the pointer helping the older dog maintain equilibrium they explored some more ned stumbling louie there to brace him each time the pointer marshaled its energies louie rewarded with a lick canine behavior therapist for the next quarter hour we watched both dogs zigzag through the field if they noticed the unmarked parked off to the side they gave no indication one time louie lifted his head and did seem to be looking at us again but matteroffactly with no alarm a trusting creature milo said theyve been starved if theyre here hes got to be he scanned the horizon fingers meandering toward his holster cmon you sick bastard show yourself or ill sic peta on you the dogs wandered around a bit more for no apparent reason then the pointer squatted took an interminable time to do its business while louie stood by patiently louie led ned along what seemed to be an agonizing trek both dogs entered a patch of high grass and faded from view twenty minutes later they hadnt reappeared milo motioned me forward and we stepped into high grass focusing on the spot where wed last seen the dogs muting noise by parting handfuls of brush before passing through stopping every ten paces to make sure we werent being watched no sign of the dogs no sign of any other creature a few hundred feet in the vegetation died and we faced a clearing irregular patch of dirt twenty or so yards in front of the ficus wall smooth brown swept clean just like marlon quiggs killspot crossing the patch were two sets of paw prints milo kneeled and pointed to the left of the dog tracks a human shoe print several mostly obscured by the dogs i made out the shape of a heel a boomerangshaped arc of sole feet facing the road someone had left this place the dogs trail ended at a hole in the ground not irregular a perfect circle six or so feet in diameter rimmed with rusty metal yawning mouth flush to the ground with the slope of the field and the high foliage you had to get close to see it a tunnel entry identical to the one borchard had showed us in place of a pneumatic lid this one was wide open milo motioned me back took out his gun crept to the opening and hazarded a look his gunarm grew rigid louies head sprouted from the opening he panted grinned goofily unimpressed by milos glock milo waved and louie emerged tail wagging padding up to milo he flipped onto his back in a grand display of surrender with his free hand milo rubbed louies tummy louies eyes clamped shut in ecstasy no genius but once a handsome fellow now his pelt was graytipped and mangy milo motioned for louie to sit louie sat milo tiptoed back to the mouth of the opening a sound burst from inside the tunnel wheezy and wet and amplified by the subterranean tube louies upright ear stiffened but he remained on his haunches heavy breathing scraping ned the pointer stuck his head out he studied milo me louie louies composure must have convinced his buddy the old dog sank down and rested his chin along the rim of the hole milo motioned me over handed me the keys to the unmarked gave me my assignment the man guarding the artichoke field hadnt budged i allowed him ten paces of warning before coming up behind him and saying scuse me he turned as if hed expected me tipped the broadbrimmed hat the soda bottle was still in his hand but now it was empty the sandwich in his pocket was untouched i showed him the twentydollar bill pointed to the sandwich his eyebrows arched veinte para esto si he handed me the sandwich gracias i tried to give him the twenty he shook his head i said por favor dropped the bill in his pocket he shrugged and went back to watching the artichokes using the sandwich milo coaxed both dogs away from the tunnel hole he took hold of louie and i placed my hand on neds scruff skin and bones was an overstatement hed probably once weighed close to seventy pounds was lucky if he was half of that now i lifted him gently like hoisting a bale of twigs as i carried him to the car his head swiveled toward me and i saw that one of his eyes was a grayblue film stretched over a sunken orbit i said youre doing great guy he moaned licked my face with a dry fetid tongue milo was able to guide louie with the slightest prod of finger behind ear we put both dogs in the rear of the unmarked cracked the windows for air the sandwich wasnt much just a scanty portion of lunch meat between slices of white bread but neither pooch griped when milo broke off small bites and fed them equal amounts louie chewed pretty well but the pointer didnt have too many teeth left and was forced to gum unneutered male but well past the point where testosterone made a difference we gave them both water from bottles wed brought for ourselves made sure they lapped slowly ned rolled onto his back curled up against the car door louie placed his paw on his pals haunch they both slipped into sleep snoring in tandem a comical waltzlike cadence we got out of the car and milo locked up and turned back to the field of weeds homing in on the spot invisible once more where the tunnel mouth sat only one set of shoe prints he said assuming thats harrie whatre the odds on huggler still being down there i said good to excellent hes getting anxious that harrie hasnt returned with the groceries but has nowhere to go so well assume hes down there problem is theres no way to know where the tunnel leads what if borchards wrong and not all of seabirds tunnels are sealed and hugglers able to get in there trust me im head of security and it couldnt happen he laughed turned serious you were right its all about synchrony he looked back at the snoozing dogs maybe theyve got the right idea follow your ignorance reach your bliss we returned to the car and pushed it nosefirst into the grass if grant huggler headed for the road hed eventually spot us but if he remained near his hideaway the same geography that blocked the tunnel from view would work in our favor if id guessed wrong and hed already wandered away and chose to return from any direction wed be a clear target we stood next to the car milo said once we get going mind looking back every so often so i can concentrate on whats ahead no prob lots of probs but were solvers a bird flew seagull soaring westward before passing out of view then nothing milo said damn oil painting i said the tunnel is where specialized care used to stand home sweet home he gazed through the window crack these two geezers are gonna need medical care a long sonorous tone issued from the car louie farting in b minor couldnt agree more pal said milo unfortunately animal control will have to wait its turn i said time to call in the human cops that would be proper procedure wouldnt it he bared his gums the question is what constitutes optimal backup in a situation like this if i call camarillo pd and explain the situation they might be cooperative or they might figure since its their jurisdiction they dont need to listen and end up doing something heavyhanded like bringing in swat andor one of those hostage negotiators who reads from a script half the time it turns out bad because lets face it you cant stop someone if theyre intent on checking out and with a loon like hugglerif hes even in there god i hope he isno crashcourse in sweettalks gonna help right right they wanna go all military i cant stop them and then were stuck with one of those longterm standoffs and huggler ends up biting it just like harrie did maybe a bunch of cops too if hes got firepower down there with only one way into the tunnel its a nightmare tear gas could help if its a short passage but if hes got lots of room to back into it could get complicated he rubbed his face i couldnt give an iota of ratshit about huggler personally but i need to talk to him find out what harrie needed a rape kit for how many dbs havent we found who belonged to those damn eyeballs he phoned petra again updated her on the tunnel told her to clue the other detectives in then make the hour drive to camarillo with reed or binchy or biro whoever was closest but dont come out here stay in town ill let you know if i need you where exactly are you she said he told her i know a place not far she said decent pizza eric and i go there when we shop the outlets eric shops i shop he pretends not to hate it okay ill get there soon as i can good luck just as he clicked off louie broke wind again what the hell was in that sandwich looked like some variant of baloney i said were stuck here long enough im gonna regret sharing chapter the first hour slogged by the second slothcrawled the dogs alternated among sleep flatulence and a mellow glassyeyed torpor that evoked a weedfragrant college dorm room milo said someones thinking right and closed his eyes i was wide awake and i was the one who saw same place different shape taller than the dogs upright wearing something brown with a pale collar moving forward stopping moving again stopping facing away from us so far so good i nudged milo roused stared took hold of his gun got out of the car shut the drivers door just shy of latching walked forward silently he stood mostly concealed by weeds as the man in the brown jacket trudged through the field the mans head stayed canted toward the ground his pace was deliberate but jerky broken by frequent stops that seemed to serve no function like a poorly oiled machine milo kept the glock in his right hand and used his left to part the grass crouched until he was as high as an average man and stepped in i waited before lowering the car windows a bit more not enough for the dogs to get their heads stuck but sufficient for good ventilation they remained drowsy i got out backtracking i mapped out a trajectory that would keep me perpendicular to milos hunters prowl aiming to cross the field in a way that kept me to the rear of the man in the brown coat placing him at the apex of a human triangle as we converged on the target milo pushed forward unaware of my presence then he saw me and froze shot me a long stare but made no attempt to wave me back knowing it wouldnt work the two of us maintained the same pace the man in the brown coat kept trudging without an apparent goal head down weaving lost in some private world his head was bare pale shiny shaved recently milo and i got thirty yards behind him then twenty i stopped parting the grass and muting the scratchy sound making no attempt at quiet the man in brown kept pausing searching the horizon to the north maybe because he was looking for the dogs and thats where they usually headed or he had his own incomprehensible navigational logic i picked up my speed outpaced milo milo saw it and stiffened and that gave me another few seconds of advantage i used them to rush behind the man in brown he continued to plod thick shoulders rounded hands jammed in his coat pockets i kept coming trotting now he stopped raised the back of the coat and scratched his rear still not hearing me then a patch of particularly brittle grass caught on my pant leg and when i pulled away the zzzip was audible the man in the brown coat turned saw me he didnt move i waved flamboyantly as if meeting an old friend by chance the man in brown gaped his flabby face quivered like uncooked haggis i moved in on him waving grinning hey grant long time his jowls tightened widening his stance he planted his legs flailed the air randomly puddingfaced snubfeatured unlined by contemplation problematic abstraction or any of the mean little demands imposed by sanity terrified this was the bogeyman the nightmare apparition the cruel messenger in the dark whod wreaked so much chaos and misery now he was too scared to budge remained frozen in his tooheavy shearling fleece collar unraveling brown suede greasy mangy as the dogs a misshapen tent of a garment that drooped over a white shirt and filthy jeans i got within arms reach grant my name is alex windmilling air with both hands he stumbled back im not out to hurt you grant his mouth opened formed an o no sound came out then a squeak the same sound mice made mired in sticky traps as my fathers boot rose above them turning his back on me he ran straight into the arms of a big man with a gun milo used his free hand to spin huggler so that he was facing me again twisted hugglers left arm behind his thick torso got a handcuff around it hed linked two sets of cuffs together standard procedure for a broad suspect huggler sniffed began crying his right arm remained at his side milo one hand on his weapon struggled to bend the uncooperative limb behind your back grant hugglers body sagged as if ready to comply but the arm stayed rigid i stepped forward milo warned me back with a head shake repeated the command tears flowed down hugglers cheeks his right arm was steel milo holstered the glock clamped both hands on hugglers left wrist twisted viciously hugglers left arm finally relented twisting back and up milo tried to affix the second cuff but hugglers width and the bulk of the coat brought him a couple of inches short of the goal he pushed hugglers right hand toward its mate huggler cried out in pain its okay grant said milo lying the way detectives do huggler said really in a soft high boyish voice just a little more son here we go hugglers right hand was a millimeter from capture when his shoulders shook like those of a rhino rudely awakened the movement caught milo off guard caused his foot to catch for a second his concentration shifted to maintaining his balance all at once huggler was facing him had gripped the sides of milos head with huge soft hairless hands expressionless he began twisting clockwise milos optimal move mightve been a quick grab of his gun but when visegrip hands take hold of your head and try to rotate it and instincts tell you it wont take much to sever your spine and drain your brain of lifemaintaining thoughtengendering nectar you go for those hands anything to stop the process milos fingers dug into the tops of hugglers hands straining clawing drawing blood huggler remained impassive kept twisting patient dryeyed comfort of the familiar wellpracticed routine with predictable results one way then the other feel the body grow limp lay it down gently sit and wait explore milo strained to free himself his eyes bugged his face was scarlet his struggle had twisted his body just enough to put the glock out of my visual range could i get hold of it fast enough find a safe way to shoot my own instincts kicked in and i threw myself behind huggler kicked him hard behind the knee its a blow that can reduce strong men to blithering cripples huggler stood there impassive managed to move milos head a fraction of an inch enough to make milo gasp i kicked hugglers other knee like butting an oak stump hooking my hands over the fleece collar i got them around his massive neck tried to compress his carotids his flesh was sweatslick i failed to get purchase he moved milos neck another tiny fraction of the fatal arc i found his adams apple lowered my thumbs to the front of his neck where hed been incised years ago and robbed of a healthy gland i squeezed he screamed his hands flew to the side he fell back tottered clutching his neck i punched him beneath his rib cage got one foot behind his left heel and hooked him forward as i shoved his chest backward with all the strength i could muster still clutching his neck he fell back spine thudding hard on dirt he lay there helpless synchrony milo panting green eyes aflame with fear that wasnt fading quickly enough fumbled for his glock twohanding the weapon aiming it at hugglers prone bulk his hands were shaking too hard for one to suffice huggler saw the gun his hands left his neck his throat was rosy swollen he coughed smiled sat up and lunged milo fired into his left shoe huggler looked down a small almost delicate mouth dropped open the toe of one grubby sneaker began seeping red hugglers cuffed left hand jangled as he shuddered he watched the blood stream from the spot where his big toe had once been entranced mystery of the body milo rolled him over roughly yanked hugglers right hand hard enough to dislocate finally got both limbs cuffed huggler lay on his belly the surrounding earth turned purple as his foot continued to bleed no spurt venous seepage huggler said something the dirt muffled his words and he turned his head to the side milo sucked in air he touched the side of his face grimaced not looking at me he walked several steps away another gull soared overhead or maybe the same bird curious grant huggler said wow i said wow what my foot can i see it please chapter petras pizza had just arrived when milo called her she left it behind arrived nine minutes later taking care of business during the drive calling for an ambulance making contact with camarillo pd and using charm and calm and just enough facts to keep the locals from screaming she studied huggler sitting on the dirt cuffed ankles bound wounded foot wrapped in one of the clean rags milo keeps in the trunk all those years with bodies it pays to have something for the gore hugglers neck had swelled and was starting to purple he coughed a lot but was breathing okay the finger marks on milos face had faded to ambiguous splotches petra knew something was up and i watched her eyes dance as her brain tried to figure it out she said nothing too smart to ask huggler didnt react to her arrival hadnt reacted to much of anything now he looked at milo um mister plaintive please sir may i have more gruel what huggler glanced at the bloody rag could you take this off too tight um whats the problem i want to see see what the inside of what huggler pouted me milo said sorry you need to keep it wrapped apologizing to the man whod nearly sheared his spine huggler said um okay his face settled back into smooth serene immobility i thought about his victims the broad pale disk that had been the final image searing so many peoples retinas before the lights went out for good petra was good at maintaining composure but hugglers request had startled her and she frowned and turned her back on all of us and looked up at the gorgeous sky pulling some gum from her purse she chewed hard extended an arm in my direction and offered me a stick i took it when i beared down to masticate my entire face exploded in pain every muscle and nerve on fullfire it had been a while since theyd relaxed milo looked at his watch then at hugglers shoe the rag had bloodied some more but hugglers color was decent no sign of shock feel okay huggler nodded your hands are strong had to be to deal with you grant its always worked before said huggler puzzled oh well camarillo emts strapped him onto a fullrestraint gurney the local detective was a whitehaired man named ramos who told the driver to wait as he approached milo he slid from distrust to professional curiosity to camaraderie as milo explained the situation guess you did us a favor how many victims we talking about at least six probably more a situation said ramos been doing this thirty years never had anything like it you dont have to have it now said milo unless youve got some masochistic urge to complicate your life you want to handle all of it we started it were ready to finish paperwork alones gonna be a fulltime job ramos grinned and pulled out a hardpack of winstons milo accepted the offer of a cigarette and the two of them smoked youre making a point said ramos so what we patch him up and ship him back to you in a brinks truck a cage would be better milo touched the right side of his face we still hadnt made eye contact and id stayed a few inches behind him so as not to push the issue ramos said ill check with my boss but hes a lazy type cant see there being any problem whatever works said milo the legal eagles are gonna be on this our people will call your people well do lunch said ramos half a dozen bodies huh im figuring i should send someone in the ambulance with the asshole just be careful he glanced at the ambulance first impression he looks like a nerd the kid who never got chose for baseball part of his charm hes charming huh not in the least ramos chuckled now i got a new worst thing before this it was a case i picked up thirtynine months ago woman shot her kid in the head because he was mouthing off just picked up a gun and drilled him im talking a twelveyearold she looked like a schoolteacher he glanced at the ambulance this is a whole different thing youre doing me a favor he waved a paramedic over ramos said im coming with you beckoning a tall husky cop officer baakeland too tight fit said the emt well survive said ramos thats the point hey whos that animal control said milo ramos looked over at the stillsleeping dogs oh yeah for them too bad they cant talk gaining access to the tunnel proved tricky with no evidence any crime had been committed on the premises john nguyen said a warrant was probably required milo said probably gray area with something like this you err on the side of caution john your only alternative is to contact whoever owns the property and get consent thats a development firm then thats who you contact sea line development was jointheadquartered in newport beach and coral gables florida no one answered at either office same for an emergency number milo left a message walked over to the mouth of the tunnel opening squatted and stuck his head in and got back on his feet too dark cant see a thing i said they removed the hatch but theres got to be an inner door not too far down he phoned nguyen again cant reach the owners got a recommendation for a judge the usual suspects no answers at four usually cooperative jurists a fifth said camarillo get someone local anyone in particular what said the judge i look like a referral agency milo took out rudy borchards card punched the number cursed viciously and clicked off no one answers their own damn phones anymore next week robots are scheduled to wipe our asses talking in my presence but not to me petra said itll work out easy for you to say youre cute and thin he trudged to the car got back in when i slipped into the passenger seat he pretended to sleep his phone rang and he waited a while to answer yes maria yes thats true yes ive talked to them and its all ours why because it is whatever maria he ended the conversation the phone rang again he turned it off went back to fakesleep i got out of the car petra came over stuck her head in sniffed smells like a kennel milo opened his eyes next time ill use a better deodorant she said speaking of scent that dirt clearing looks awfully clean what do you think about bringing in a cadaver pooch soon as we get the damn warrant she turned to me this feels weird a huge one gets closed and we end up sitting around lets do something thenput up some tape around the hole or the entire clearing how much tape do you have not enough milos phone played mendelssohn he said damn pencilpushers and switched to conference what now a deep male voice said pardon whos this my name is norm pettigrew and im returning lieutenant sturgiss call sturgis here youre with sea line vice president and coordinator of operations what can i do for you milo told him pettigrew said incredible we had no idea anyone was squatting or that there was even a tunnel we thought we had all of those sealed looks like the grass was cleared to gain access how would anyone know to do that lieutenant and why good question said milo lying easily pettigrew said well by all means go down there do whatever you need to do thank you sir obviously lieutenant wed prefer if sea line wasnt linked to any of this ill do my best sir let me be more specific said pettigrew any encumbrances that can be avoided would be highly appreciated have you ever been to laguna beach a while back sir weve got a project there highend condos with ocean views a couple of the demos are fully furnished and livable and suitable for shortterm usage in your case being a devoted public servant capable of providing security im sure we can reach an agreement you and the missus for a weekend if you enjoy yourselves two weekends weve got a great italian restaurant about to open sounds great sea shore villas said pettigrew thats the name of the project call me personally ill set it up thank you sir and thanks for permission to search oh sure i mean it about laguna come and enjoy the ocean on us the line went dead petra said last thing anyone offered me was a hit of crank if i didnt bust him you like the beach you dont too damn peaceful okay kids lets spelunk chapter inches below the hole was a steel ladder that descended ten feet and planted us on a square of concrete with barely enough space for the three of us to stand a bulb in a wire cage was screwed into the ceiling the tunnel continued to the left a cementlined tube barely taller than milo a circular steel hatch like the one borchard had showed us blocked further exploration this one responded to the slightest tug before hissing open we passed through another twenty feet of vacant passage no obvious ventilation but the tunnel was cool dry surprisingly pleasant no smell of death not much odor at all but for occasional wisps of mold and raw rock and as we kept going burgeoning human perspiration milo and petra both had their flashlights in hand but didnt need to turn them on caged bulbs were set every five steps bathing the tunnel in hard yellow light from hospital days old wires forgotten but still active the floor was free of debris swept clean like the clearing another circular hatch appeared left wide open a room appeared to the right fifteen or so square feet an old porcelain sign lettered in gothic was bolted into the stone wall hospital storage nonperishables only stack neatly on the floor were two futons rolled up precisely between them sat twin dressers still stickered with ikea labels the chest on the left bore a batteryop digital clock two pairs of cheap reading glasses a tube of lubricant a box of tissues three hardcover books introduction to psychology abnormal psychology consultations in forensic psychology three drawers contained a modest assortment of mens clothing size s laundry tickets were pinned to several items a cedar freshener had been placed in each compartment the stand on the right was piled high with softcover books four stacks at least twenty per pile crosswords anagrams sudoku sum doku word search brainteasers kakuro anacrostics drawers below contained sweats tshirts boxers and tube socks size xl an adjoining room smaller colder contained two chemical portatoilets one clean the other reeking gallon water bottles were lined up against a wall a card table was piled with folded white towels bulk rolls of toilet paper still in cellophane sat nearby off to the side two cardboard cartons of cookies bread cereal beef jerky canned spaghetti and chili shared space with three bags of generic dry dog food keeping house said petra cozy i noticed something behind the tallest stack of provisions pointed it out milo drew out a brown cardboard pizza delivery box pristine unopened printed with the image of a portly gleeful mustachioed chef lotta taste ooh la la three identical cartons were pinioned against the wall by cans and cases we returned to the tunnel passed through a third hatch the passageway ended at a final room a gothic sign said no further entry petra tapped the rear stone wall to which the message had been bolted kind of redundant milo said some sign contractor probably greased palms my lieutenant she said though he wasnt sage but so cynical milo stepped into the final room approached the sole piece of furniture baretopped desk stickered like the end tables muttering doing what they could for the swedish economy he slid the top drawer open inside was paper a detectives treasure check stubs documented a variety of welfare and disabilities payments from the state of california santa barbara and ventura counties mailed regularly to a malibu post office box near carbon beach and cashed promptly at a nearby bank of america totals varied from twelve hundred to nearly twice that amount the recipient lewisohn clark petra said some moniker sounds like the millionaire on gilligan say it out loud i said she did oh milo said lewis and clark i said master explorers a separate collection of stubs revealed monthly payments of sent to the same pob a recent letter from the state pension board announced that an automatic costofliving increase would add just under a hundred eighty bucks to next months installment the recipient sven galley milo checked his pad harrie used his own damn social security number petra said guess not everyones curious she inspected a stub svengali her jawline sharpened im glad hes dead a dark green simulated alligator box beneath the receipts told a new story faded polaroids of women young trussed terrified the same terrible sequence for each rope around neck fearfrozen eyes lifeless eyes gaping mouth underneath the photos were articles printed off the internet missing girls eight of them the cases arranged chronologically the first victim a college student at uc santa cruz had vanished ten years ago during a carmel vacation the most recent a sixteenyearold runaway from new hampshire had been last seen five months ago hitchhiking on ocean avenue not far from the santa monica pier it didnt take long to match the photos milo opened the bottom drawer another case this one larger and covered in soiled gray shagreen sat atop yet more paper the press of a buttonlatch revealed an array of surgical tools resting in green velvet each instrument snuggled in formfitted compartments tiny gold lettering on the inside of the lid spelled out chiron tutlingen the paper beneath the case was blank milo removed a sheet anyway on the underside centered perfectly was the inevitable message milo said not anymore asshole lets get out of here petra said good idea i need a breather too its not that kid he brandished his cell phone not getting reception as we made our way out i let petra pass in front of me advanced closer to milo and stared until he made eye contact he nodded moved on by the time the black lab and the springer spaniel arrived darkness had settled over the field and field lamps faciliated by detective arthur ramos had been propped the handler a civilian from oxnard named judy kantor who also bred and showed both breeds said they love the dark less distraction whats the area milo said that clearance thats it said kantor no trees or brush or water piece of cake theres something down there theyll find it she clapped her hands cmon hansel cmon gretel do your sniffy thing judy kantor led the dogs around the perimeter then she let them explore within moments each animal was sitting ten feet apart judy kantor marked the spots signaled for them to resume two more tells this time the dogs stayed seated she said thats it lieutenant milo said we suspect as many as eight victims if there was another grave nearby theyd tell you she said unless its superdeephey maybe youve got stacked bodies milo thanked her she gave the dogs treats the three of them departed with obvious joy no stacking a quartet of intact skeletons interred barely three feet below the surface petra said theyre all pretty petite dont need to be an anthropologist to know theyre girls chapter it did take an anthropologist to make sense of the bones moe reeds girlfriend dr liz wilkinson had the report on milos desk nine days later the skeletons were consistent with the four most recent victims depicted in james harries photo stash dental records for two victims solidified the ids and the remaining two girls were differentiated using femur length wilkinson opined that two of the victims had probably given birth a fact that didnt emerge during interviews with their parents no reason to bring that up milo helped facilitate delivery of the bones and has attended every funeral a wider deeper excavation of the field has produced no other bodies no evidence of any kind the burial sites of dr louis wainright and nurse joanne morton remain unknown the eyes left behind in bern shackers beverly hills office were too degraded by formaldehyde for dna analysis dr clarice jernigan has opined that they may not belong to any victim could very well be anatomy specimens sold commercially to optometrists and ophthalmologists shes a toughminded expert pathologist with a wealth of experience then again everyone engages in wishful thinking the pizza boxes found in the tunnel match those used by only one restaurant between santa barbara and malibu a stand in oxnard just off highway catering to the motor trade no one working there is aware of any pilferage a teenage girl onsite during weekend evenings is almost certain a pleasant man resembling james harrie was an occasional customer an astudent taking a full load of advanced placement courses shes nearly as confident about his order same thing each time small plain cheese pie large pepperoni and mushrooms grant huggler awaits trial at starkweather state hospital for the criminally insane he is a model patient and has defied easy diagnosis his public defender and deputy da john nguyen have separately indicated their intention to call me as an expert witness should the case go to trial ive communicated my reluctance to both of them they havent pushed but theyre lawyers havent backed off either i can live with the uncertainty milo has never mentioned what happened in the field he has asked metwice because hes been more absentminded than usualif i think huggler will ever make it into a courtroom or remain stashed in his isolation room or even shipped off to another loony bin maybe kansas huh we owe them both times i told him i wasnt feeling like a gambling man ive been a little edgy though i think ive been handling it pretty well with robin and blanche saying and doing the right things playacting a normal life for the most part the dreams have stopped i do think about the eyes the four girls whose bodies havent been found louis wainright joanne morton belle quigg was offered louie but she demurred telling milo it was all she could do to make it through each day louie and ned were adopted by a family from ojai a mormon clan with twelve kids and a long honorable history of caring for old ill castaway pets i hear that both dogs have fattened up and once in a while neds got the energy to play ive turned down several patient referrals have increased my running time spend more time listening to music everything from steve vai to bachs brandenburg concerto no every day i go into my office close the door pretend to work mostly i sit at my desk thinking then trying not to ive contemplated recapturing my selfhypnosis chops or learning some new form of meditation that might succeed at emptying my head i think about meeting the parents of the four girls whose bodies havent been found saying something to dr louis wainrights two adult kids no one has inquired about wainrights nurse joanne morton and that bothers me more than it should i wonder about what created grant huggler james harrie at this point im not sure i want answers
