psychologist ttomalss researcher in china tvenkel landcruiser gunner in besancon franc ullhass soldier captured by us army ussmak landcruiser driver i for nostalgias sake fleetlord atvar called up the hologram of the tosevite warrior he had often studied before the invasion fleet actually reached the world of tosev nostalgia was an emotion that came easily to the race with a unified history of a hundred thousand years with an empire that stretched over three solar systems and now reached out to a fourth the past seemed a safe comfortable place not least because it was so much like the present the hologram sprang into being before the fleetlord a stalwart savage his pinkish face sprouting yellowish hairs clad in soft iron mail and woven animal and plant fibers armed with spear and rustflecked sword and mounted on a tosevite quadruped that looked distinctly too scrawny for the job of carrying him sighing atvar turned to the shiplord kirel who commanded the th emperor hetto bannership of the invasion fleet he stabbed a fingerclaw at the image if only it had been so easy he said with a sigh yes exalted fleetlord kirel sighed too he turned both eye turrets toward the hologram it was what the probe led us to expect yes atvar said sourly preparing in its methodical way for another conquest the race had sent a probe across the interstellar void sixteen hundred years before years of the race of course tosev orbited its primary only about half as fast the probe dutifully sampled the planet sent its images and data back home the race prepared the invasion fleet and sent it out certain of easy victory how much could a world change in a mere sixteen hundred years atvar touched a control in the base of the holographic projector the tosevite warrior disappeared new images took the big uglys place a russki landcruiser red star painted on its turret lightly armed and protected by the races standards but welldesigned with sloped armor and wide treads for getting over the worst ground an american heavy machine gun with a belt full of big slugs that tore through body armor as if it were fiberboard a deutsch killercraft turbojets slung under swept wings nose bristling with cannon kirel pointed toward the killercraft that one concerns me more than either of the others exalted fleetlord by the emperorboth he and atvar briefly cast down their eyes at the mention of the sovereignthe deutsche did not have that aircraft less than two years ago when our campaign began i know atvar said all their aircraftall tosevite aircraft thenwere those slow awkward things propelled by rapidly rotating airfoils but now the british are flying jets too he summoned an image of the new british killercraft it didnt look as menacing as the machine the deutsche made its wings lacked sweep and its lines were more graceful less predatory from the reports atvar had read it didnt perform quite as well as the deutsch killercraft either but it was a quantum leap better than anything the british had put into the air before fleetlord and shiplord stared glumly at the hologram the trouble with the natives of tosev was that they were by the races standards insanely inventive the social scientists attached to the fleet were still trying to figure out how the big uglies had gone from barbarism to a fullgrown industrial civilization in the blink of an historical eye their solutionsor rather conjectureshad yet to satisfy atvar part of the answer he suspected lay in the squabbling multiplicity of empires that divided up tosev s meager land surface some of them werent even empires in the strict sense of the word the regime of the sssr for instance openly boasted of liquidating its former ruling dynasty the idea of impericide was enough to make atvar queasy empires and notempires had competed fiercely among themselves theyd been fighting a planetwide war when the race arrived doctrine from earlier conquests said the race ought to have been able to take advantage of their factionalism play off one side against another the tactic had worked now and again but not as well and not as often as doctrine suggested it would atvar sighed and told kirel before i came to tosev i was like any sensible male i was sure doctrine held all the answers follow it and youd obtain the results it predicted the males who designed our doctrines should have seen this world first it would have broadened their horizons this is truth exalted fleetlord the shiplord said one thing tosev has taught us is the difference between precept and experience yes well put atvar said the last world conquest the race had undertaken lay thousands of years in the past the fleetlord had pored over the manuals of what had worked then and in the races previous victory even more thousands of years before that but no one having had any practice using what was in the manuals the tosevites by contrast conquered one another and dickered with one another all the time they made deception and deceit into an art and were perfectly willing to educate the race as to their use atvar had learned the hard way how muchor rather how littlebig ugly promises were worth the other trouble is they make war the same way they conduct the rest of their dealings with us they cheat atvar grumbled truth again exalted fleetlord kirel said the fleetlord knew it was truth machine against machine the big uglies could not match the race one landcruiser atvar commanded for instance was worth anywhere between ten and thirty of its tosevite opponents the big uglies fought back with everything from minecarrying animals trained to run under landcruiser tracks to set off their explosives to attacks that concentrated so many of their inferior weapons against the races thinstretched resources that they achieved breakthrough in spite of lower technology kirel might have plucked that thought from atvars head will we resume our assault on the city by the lake in the northern section of the smaller continental mass chicago the local name is not immediately atvar answered trying to keep from his voice all the frustration he felt at the failure taking advantage of tosev s truly abominable winter weather the americans had broken through the flanks of the assault force cut off the lead element and wrecked most of it it was the worstand most expensiveembarrassment the race had suffered on tosev we do not enjoy as many resources as we would like kirel observed now atvar had to say truth the race was careful and thorough the weapons theyd brought from home would have conquered a hundred times over the tosev they thought they would find very possibly without losing a male but on the industrialized planet they discovered theyd taken major losses theyd inflicted far worse but the big uglies factories kept turning out weapons we need to keep working to coopt as much of their industrial capacity as we can kirel said and to wreck that part which persists in producing arms used against us unfortunately the two goals often contradict each other atvar said nor is our progress in destroying their fuel sources as great as they would wish us to believe though we persist in those efforts the three males who had bombed the refineries at ploesti which supplied the deutsche with much of their fuel were convinced theyd wrecked the place since then a pall of smoke had continuously lain over it making reconnaissance difficult for as long as he couldfor longer than he should haveatvar believed with his pilots that that smoke meant the deutsche could not control the refinery fires but it wasnt so he couldnt make himself think it was any more the big uglies were shipping refined petroleum out of ploesti every way they knew how by water by their battered rail network by motorized conveyance even by animaldrawn wagon the story wasnt much different at the other refinery complexes scattered across tosev they were easy to damage hard to eliminate since they were huge fire hazards just by existing the big uglies had built them to minimize danger from explosions they ferociously defended them and repaired bomb damage faster than the races alleged experts had thought possible atvars phone squawked at him he welcomed the distraction from his own gloomy thoughts yes he said into the speaker exalted fleetlord the male drefsab awaits your pleasure in the antechamber an aide reported i am still conferring with the shiplord kirel atvar said tell drefsab i shall see him directly when im finished it shall be done exalted fleetlord the aide switched off being reminded of drefsab did nothing to improve atvars mood theres something else that hasnt worked as well as id hoped he complained whats that exalted fleetlord kirel asked the whole problem with that vile tosevite herb ginger atvar said drefsab recently tracked down and eliminated the big ugly who was a major supplier of the horrid drug and i had hoped that would help us control our addicted males demand for it unfortunately a thicket of smaller dealers has sprung up to take the exterminated major suppliers place frustrating kirel observed to say nothing of dangerous to our cause atvar swung one eye turret toward kirel in a sidelong glance of suspicion the commander of the bannership was the second highest ranking male in the fleet his body paint less elaborate only than atvars own if atvars policies led to disaster he was the next logical choice as fleetlord he was stable and conservative and had always acted loyal but who could say when the fangs of ambition would begin to grow any remark that sounded like criticism made atvar wary not that ginger wasnt a problem one more thing we didnt learn from the probe atvar thought the cursed herb made males feel they were brighter and stronger than they really were it also made them want to recapture that feeling as often as they could theyd do almost anything to get ginger even trade weapons and information to the big uglies with the problem ginger poses to our security it occurs to me that we may have been lucky the big uglies succeeded in blowing up the ship which carried the bulk of our nuclear weapons the fleetlord said otherwise some male seeking pleasure for his tongue might have sought to convey one to the tosevites in exchange for his precious herb theres a pleasant thought kirel exclaimed the tosevites are barbarians without care for tomorrowthey would not hesitate to ruin their own planet if it meant defeating us truth atvar said glumly after initial inatmosphere bursts to wreck tosevite communications with electromagnetic pulse unsuccessfully because the big uglies electronic devices were too primitive to use solidstate components the race had expended only two nuclear devices against berlin and washington centers of local resistance but resistance had continued anyhow ironic that we have a greater obligation to maintain this world as nearly intact as possible than does the species that evolved on it kirel said of course the tosevites are not aware our colonization fleet is on the way behind us indeed atvar said if it arrives and finds tosev uninhabitable we will have failed here no matter what else we accomplish we also have to bear in mind that the big uglies are engaging in nuclear weapons research of their own certainly with the material their guerrillas captured from us in the sssr and the evidence would suggest with projects altogether their own as well kirel said should one of those projects succeed our problems here will become measurably more difficult immeasurably you mean atvar said the big uglies would not worry about what they did to tosev as long as that meant getting rid of the race deutschland the sssr the united states maybe those little island empires toonippon and britainwe have to keep both eye turrets on every one of them the trouble is a planet is a very large place their projects will not be easy to track down but it must be done he spoke as much to remind himself as to tell kirel it shall be done the shiplord echoed loyally it had better be done they thought together the horsedrawn wagon pulled to a stop in new salem north dakota sam yeager looked around as a seventeenyear veteran of bushleague baseball and its endless travel he was a connoisseur of small towns new salem might have had a thousand people in it then again it might not he scrambled out of the wagon barbara larssen handed him his springfield he took the rifle slung it over his shoulder then held out a hand to help barbara down they clung to each other for a moment he kissed the top of her head the ends of her dark blond hair still showed traces of permanent wave most of it was straight though a long time had gone by since shed got a permanent he didnt want to let her go but he had to he grabbed the rifle again pointed it at the wagon military routine he thought and then military fiddlesticks but since he wore a corporals stripes these days he played the game by the rules come on out boys he called ristin and ullhass the two lizard pows who accompanied the metallurgical laboratorys wagon train on the way from chicago to the labs planned new home in denver poked their heads up over the side of the wagon it shall be done superior sir they chorused in hissing english they dropped down in front of yeager and barbara hard to thinkthingsso small could be so dangerous barbara murmured neither of the lizards came up even to her shoulder they arent small with guns in their hands or inside tanks or inside planes or inside their spaceships yeager answered i fought against them remember before my unit captured these boys we thought you kill us ullhass said we thought you kill us then eat us ristin agreed yeager laughed youd been reading too much science fiction both of you he laughed again more reflectively if he hadnt been in the habit of reading science fiction himself to pass the time on trains and buses he never would have volunteeredor been acceptedas the lizards principal guard translator and explainer of matters earthly hed been with them continuously for better than six months now long enough to come to see them as individuals rather than mere creatures they never had been much like the bugeyed monsters he used to read about they were short and skinny and even dressed in multiple layers of warm clothes that hung on them like sacks complained all the time about how cold it was it wasnt just midwinter on the northern great plains either theyd complained about all but the hottest days back in chicago too by now yeager took for granted their turreted eyes that chameleonlike moved independently of each other the greenbrown scales they used for skin their clawed hands and feet their wide mouths full of little pointed teeth even the bifurcated tongues they sometimes used to lick their hard immobile lips were just part of them although hed needed quite a while to get used to those we will be warm tonight ristin asked though he spoke english at the end of the sentence he tacked on the little cough the lizards used sort of an audible question mark we will be warm tonight sam answered in the lizards language punctuating his sentence with a different cough the one that put emphasis on his words he had reason for his confidence the lizards bombers hadnt hit north dakota badly not much up here needed hitting yeager thought the flat farming country reminded him of the flat farming country in eastern nebraska where hed grown up new salem could easily have been one of the little towns between lincoln and omaha the wagon had stopped not far from a snowcovered boulder with an unnaturally flat top barbara brushed off the snow with her sleeve oh it has a plaque on it she said and brushed away more snow so she could read the words on the bronze she started to laugh whats so funny yeager asked he absentmindedly tacked the interrogative cough onto that question too this is the wrong side up monument she answered thats what the plaque says anyhow seems one of the early farmers had just started breaking the ground so he could plant for the first time when an indian came along looked at a chunk of sod set it back the right way and said wrong side up the farmer thought about it decided he was right and went into dairying instead this is part of a big dairy area now we should eat well tonight then yeagers mouth watered at the thought of milk cheese probably big steaks toothe folk around here might well be inclined to do some slaughtering for their guests because they wouldnt be able to keep feeding all their livestock now that the lizards had made moving grain and hay on a large scale impossible more wagons from the convoy came into town some carrying people but more loaded down with the equipment that had filled much of eckhart hall back at the university of chicago not all the wagons would stop here tonight they were spread out for miles along the highway and back roads that ran parallel to it both to avoid looking interesting to the lizards and to keep from taking too much destruction from an air attack if they did enrico fermi helped his wife laura down from their wagon then waved to yeager he waved back he still felt a rush of pride at hanging around with scientists and even helping them when they had questions for the lizard prisoners till a few months ago his closest brush with scientists had been with the nearsupermen who populated the pages of astounding the real ones while bright enough werent a lot like their fictional counterparts for one thing a lot of the best onesfermi leo szilard edward teller eugene wignerwere dumpy foreigners with funny accents fermi talked like bobby fiores father he wondered what had happened to his old roommate the second baseman on the decatur commodores for another just about all of them foreign and american were much more human than their fictional analogs theyd have a drink or more than one theyd tell stories and theyd argue with their wives yeager liked them more for it not less steaks there proved to be cooked over open flames and eaten by the firesideno gas and no electricity in new salem yeager cut his into very small pieces as he ate it though he wouldnt be thirtysix for another couple of months he had full upper and lower plates hed almost died in the influenza epidemic of and his teeth had rotted in his head the only teeth of his own he had were the ones that gave everybody else trouble seven or eight years after the epidemic his wisdom teeth had come in fine ullhass and ristin by contrast held big chunks of meat up to their mouths and worried bites off them the lizards didnt chew much theyd get a gobbet in and then gulp it down the locals watched with undisguised curiositythese were the first lizards theyd ever seen yeager had watched that at every stop all the way across minnesota and north dakota where you going to put those critters tonight a man asked him we sure as hell dont want them getting loose theyre not critters theyre peoplefunny kind of people but people yeager said with smalltown politeness the man didnt argue but obviously didnt believe him either yeager shrugged hed seen that happen before too he asked do you have a jail here the local hooked a thumb into the strap of his denim overalls yah we do he said yeager hid a smilehed heard yah for yes at every stop in north dakota grinning the local went on well put a drunk indian in there every now and againor sometimes a drunk squarehead too hell im an eighth sioux myself even if my name is thorkil olson thatd be perfect yeager said especially if you can put a board or a blanket or something over the window if there is one lizards cant take as much cold as people can can you take us there let me look it over with ristin and ullhass safely behind bars yeager figured he had the night off a lot of times hed had to stay alert because they were in the next room of a private house he didnt think theyd try to escape they risked both freezing and getting shot on a world not their own you couldnt afford to take chances though he and barbara went home with olson and his wife louise a pleasant redcheeked woman in her late forties take the spare bedroom for the night and welcome louise said weve rattled around the house since our boy george and his wife headed down to kansas city so he could work in a defense plant her face clouded the lizards are in kansas city i pray hes all right so do i maam yeager said barbaras hand tightened on his her husband jens a met lab physicist had never come back from a crosscountry trip that had skirted lizardheld territory plenty of blankets on the bed folks and grandmas old thundermug under it thorkil olson boomed as he showed them the spare room well feed you breakfast when you get up in the morning sleep tight now there were plenty o blankets heavy wool ones from sears with a goosedown comforter on top we can even get undressed yeager said happily im sick of sleeping in three four layers of clothes barbara looked at him sidelong stay undressed you mean she said and blew out the candle olson had set on the nightstand the room plunged into darkness afterwards sam peeled off his rubber then groped around under the bed till he found the chamber pot something for them to cluck over after we leave he said he dove back under the covers as fast as he could without them the bedroom was a chilly place barbara clung to him for warmth but for reassurance too he ran a hand down the velvety skin of her back i love you he said softly i love you too her voice caught she shoved herself against him i dont know what i would have done without you id have been so lost i her face was buried in the hollow of his shoulder a hot tear splashed down on him after a few seconds she raised her head i miss him so much sometimes i cant help it i know you wouldnt be who you are if you didnt yeager spoke with the philosophy of a man who had spent his entire adult life playing bushleague ball and never come close to the majors you do the best you can with the cards you get dealt even if some of them are pretty rotten me i never got an ace before now he squeezed her she shook her head her hair brushed softly across his chest but its not fair to you sam jens is dead he has to be dead if im going to go onif were going to go on i have to look ahead not backwards as you said ill do the best i can cant ask for more than that yeager agreed slowly he went on seems to me honey that if you hadnt loved your jens a lot and if he hadnt loved you too you wouldnt have been anybody idve wanted to fall in love with and even if i had just on account of youre such a finelooking womanhe poked her in the ribs because he knew shed squeakyou wouldnt have loved me back you wouldnt have known how to youre sweet you make good sense too you seem to have a way of doing that instead of clutching now barbara snuggled against him he felt her body relax the tip of her nipple brushed his arm just above the elbow he wondered if she felt like making love again but before he could try to find out she yawned enormously voice still blurry she said if i dont get some sleep god only knows what kind of wreck ill be tomorrow in the darkness her lips found his but only for a moment good night sam i love you she rolled over onto her side of the bed i love you too good night sam found himself yawning too even if she had been interested he wasnt sure he could have managed two rounds so close together he wasnt a kid any more he rolled over onto his left side his behind brushed against barbaras they chuckled and moved a little farther apart he popped out his dentures set them on the nightstand inside a minute and a half he was snoring jens larssen most cordially cursed the united states army first in english and then in the fragmentary norwegian hed picked up from his grandfather even as the oaths fell from his lips he knew he was being unfair if the army hadnt scooped him up as he was making his way across indiana he might well have got himself killed trying to sneak into chicago as the lizard attacks on the city rose to a climax and even now after general patton and general bradley had pinched off the neck of that attack nobody would let him fly out to join the rest of the met lab team in denver again the brass had their reasonssave for combat missions aviation had almost disappeared in the united states human aviation had almost disappeared anyhow the lizards dominated the skies hellfire he muttered clinging to the rail of the steamer duluth queen the damn army wouldnt even tell me where theyd gone i had to go into chicago and find out for myself that rankled it struck him as security gone mad so did everyones refusal to let him send on any word to the met lab crew he couldnt even let his wife know he was alive once more though the muckymucks had a point he couldnt honestly deny the met lab was americas only hope of producing an atomic bomb like the ones the lizards had used on berlin and washington dc without that bomb the war against the aliens would probably fail nobody then could afford to draw any sort of attention toward the metallurgical laboratory or communicate with it in any way for fear the lizards would intercept a message and draw the wrongor rather the rightconclusions from it the orders hed been given made just enough sense for him not to try disobeying but oh how he hated them and now i cant even get into duluth he grumbled he could see the town which lay by the edge of lake superior where it narrowed to its westernmost point he could see the gray granite bluffs that dwarfed mans houses and buildings and felt he could almost reach out and touch some of the homes atop these bluffs the taller business buildings that climbed the steep streets toward them but the feeling was an illusion a sheet of bluegray ice held the duluth queen away from the minnesota town that had given it its name jens turned to a passing sailor how far out on the lake are we the man paused to think his breath came out thick as smoke as he answered cant be more than four five miles up to less than a mouth ago it was open water all the way in he chuckled at larssens groan some years the port stays open all winter long more often though itll freeze for twenty miles out so this aint so bad he went on his way whistling a cheery tune hed misunderstood why jens groaned it wasnt at the cold weather jens had grown up in minnesota and spent enough time skating on frozen lakes to take for granted that watereven as massive a body of water as lake superiorturned to ice when winter came but a month before he could have gone straight into town that ate at him probably the same blizzard that let patton launch his attack against the lizards had also finally frozen the lake in any other year the duluth queen would have stopped sailing for the winter the lizards though had paid much more attention to knocking out road and rail traffic than to knocking out ships jens wondered what that meant about their home planetmaybe it didnt have enough water for them to take shipping seriously as a way of getting things from one place to another if that was so the aliens were missing a trick the duluth queen carried ball bearings ammunition gasoline and motor oil to keep resistance to the lizards strong in minnesota it would take back steel from duluth and milled grain from minneapolis to forge into new weapons and feed the people who fought and built lots of little boatsboats small enough to haul across the ice some of them even rowboatsclustered around the steamship deck cranes lowered crates to them and picked up others with a lot of shouted warnings going back and forth with the goods a quasiharbor had sprung into being at the edge of the ice crates from the duluth queen went back and forth toward town on manhauled sledges while others outbound were muscled onto the boats for transport out to the queen jens doubted the system was even a tenth as efficient as a proper harbor but the proper harbor was icebound and what the locals had worked out was a lot better than nothing from his point of view the only real trouble was that cargo was so much more important than passengers that he couldnt get off the steamship the sailor came back down the deck still whistling larssen felt like throttling him how much longer before youll be able to start moving actual real live people off he asked shouldnt be more than another day or two sir the fellow answered a day or two jens exploded he wanted to dive into lake superior and swim the mile or so over to the edge of the ice he knew perfectly well though that hed freeze to death if he tried it were doing the best we can the sailor said everythings screwed up since the lizards came thats all wherever you need to get to people will understand that youve been held up that this was true made it no easier to bear unconsciously larssen had assumed that because the lizards had been beaten back from chicago and he was free to travel again without the army trying to tie him down the world would automatically unfold at his feet but the world was not in the habit of working that way the sailor went on long as youre stuck on board sir you might as well enjoy yourself the grubs good here and there arent many places ashore where youll find steam heat running water and electric lights isnt that the sad and sorry truth jens said the lizards invasion had badly disrupted the complex web the united states had become and pointed out the hard way how much every part of the country depended on every otherand how illequipped most parts were to go it alone burning wood to keep warm and depending on musclesanimal or humanto move things about made america feel as if it had slipped back a century from and yet if jens ever made it to denver hed get back to work on a project that seemed to belong at least a hundred years in the future the world to come would spring into being amidst the obtrusive reemergence of the past and where was the present the present thought jens who had a weakness for puns is absent he went below to get out of the cold and to remind himself the present still existed the duluth queens galley boasted not only electric lights but a big pot of hot coffee a luxury that grew rarer as stocks dwindled and a radio jens remembered his parents saving up to buy their first set in the late twenties it had felt like inviting the world into their parlor now most places you couldnt invite the world in even if you wanted to but the duluth queen didnt depend on distant power plants now likely to be either wrecked or out of fuel for electricity it made its own and so static squawked and muttered as hank vernon spun the tuning knob and the red pointer slid across the dial music suddenly came out the ships engineer turned to larssen who was getting a mug of coffee the andrews sisters suit you theyre okay but if you can find some news that would be even better jens poured in cream the duluth queen had plenty of that but no sugar lets see what i can do i wish this was a shortwave set vernon worked the knob again more slowly now pausing to listen to every faint station he brought in after three or four tries he grunted in satisfaction here you go he turned up the volume larssen bent his head toward the radio even through the waterfall of static he recognized the newscasters deep slow voice three days of rioting reported from italy where people went into the streets to protest the governments cooperation with the lizards pope pius xiis radio appeal for calm monitored in london seems to have had little effect rioters are calling for the return of benito mussolini who was spirited to germany after being placed under arrest by the lizards hank vernon shook his head in bemusement isnt it a hell of a thing a year ago mussolini was the enemy with a capital e because he was buddies with hitler now hes a hero because the krauts got him away from the lizards and hitlers not such a bad guy any more since the germans are still fighting hard just because youre fighting the lizards doesnt make you a good guy in my book was joe stalin a good guy just on account of he was fighting the nazis people say so yeah but they cant make me believe it what do you think youre probably right larssen answered he agreed with most of what the engineer had said but wished vernon hadnt chosen just then to say ithis loud nasal tones drowned out edward r murrow to whom jens was trying to listen vernon however kept right on talking so jens got the news in disconnected snatches ration cuts in england fighting between smolensk and moscow more fighting in siberia a lizard push toward vladivostok a passive resistance campaign in india is that against the english or the lizards he asked if its all the way over in india what the devil difference does it make the engineer said on a cosmic scale larssen supposed he had a point but for someone who was trying to catch up with what was going on in the world losing any facts felt frustrating from the radio murrow said and for those who think the lizard devoid of humor consider this outside of los angeles the army air force recently had occasion to build a dummy airport complete with dummy planes two lizard aircraft are said to have attacked itwith dummy bombs this is edward r murrow somewhere in the united states nobody on the radio admits where they are any more you notice that vernon said from fdr on down its somewhere in the united states its like if anybody knows where you are you cant be a bigshot cause if you were a bigshot and the lizards knew where you are theyd go after you am i right or am i right youre probably right jens said again you dont happen to have a cigarette do you now that he didnt get the chance to drink coffee often one cup kicked the way three or four had in the good old days the same was even more true of tobacco wish to hell i did vernon answered i smoked cigars myself but i wouldnt turn down anything these days i used to work on the rivers in virginia north carolina and wed go right past the tobacco farms never even think a thing about em but when it cant get from where they grow it to where you want to smoke it yeah larssen said it was true of more than tobacco that was why the lizards didnt have to conquer the whole country to make the united states stop working it was why the duluth queen sat off the ice and unloaded anything to keep the wheels turning he stayed stuck for the next three days biding his time and biting his nails when he finally did get to descend into one of the small boats that was unloading the duluth queen he almost wished hed stayed stuck longer clambering down a cargo net with a knapsack and a rifle slung over his shoulder was not his notion of fun one of the sailors lowered his schwinn on a line it banged against the side of the steamship a couple of times on the way down jens grabbed it and undid the knot the line snaked back up to the duluth queen the small boat had a crew of four they all looked at the bicycle youre not going anywhere far by yourself on that are you mister one of them said at last what if i am larssen had ridden a bicycle across most of ohio and indiana he was in the best shape of his life hed always look skinny but he was stronger than most people with bulging biceps oh i wont say you couldnt do itdont get me wrong the crewman said its just thatthis is minnesota after all he patted himself he was wearing boots with fur tops an overcoat over a jacket over a sweater and earmuffs on top of a knitted wool cap you dont want to get stuck in a snowstorm is what i mean you do and you wont even start to stink till springand spring comes late around duluth i know what minnesotas like i was raised here jens said then you ought to have better sense the sailor told him he started to come back with a hot reply hut it didnt get past his lips he remembered all the winter days hed had to stay home from school when snow made the going impossible and his grammar school had been only a couple of miles from the farm where hed grown up the high school less than five if a bad storm hit while he was in the middle of nowhere hed be in trouble and no doubt about it he said things must move or else you guys wouldnt be out here working in the middle of winter how do you do it we convoy the sailor answered seriously you wait until theres a bunch of people going the same way you are and then you go along with em where you headin for mister denver eventually jens said any place west of duluth now i guess in a pocket of his overcoat he had a letter from general patton that essentially ordered the entire civilized world to drop whatever it was doing and give him a hand it had got him his cabin on the duluth queen but the duluth queen was going from chicago to duluth anyhow even a sizzling letter from patton probably couldnt call a land convoy into being at the drop of a hat but that sparked a thought any trains still running yeah we try to keep em going best we can anyhow i tell you though its like playing russian roulette maybe youll get through maybe youll get your ass bombed off if it was me i wouldnt ride one not now the lizards go after em on purpose not for the hell of it like they do ships i may take my chances larssen said if the trains were running right he could be in denver in a couple of days not a couple of weeks or a couple of months if they werenthe tried not to worry about that the boat drifted to a stop at the edge of the ice gunnysacks made the treacherous surface easier to walk on the crew handed larssen his gear wished him good luck and headed back to the duluth queen he headed over toward a dogdrawn sledge that didnt have too many crates in it can i get a ride he called and the driver nodded he felt like a character out of jack london as he got in behind the man the trip across the ice gave him more time to think it also convinced him that if he was going to live in the twentieth century hed use its tools where he could hed do better even if the lizards did bomb him while he was just partway to denver when at last he got into duluth he went looking for the train station the hauler aircraft rolled to a stop ussmak stared out the window at the tosevite landscape it was different from the flat plains of the sssr where the landcruiser driver had served before but that didnt make it any better not as far as he was concerned the plants were a dark wetlooking green under sunlight that seemed too white too harsh not that the star tosev adequately heated its third world ussmak felt the chill as soon as he descended from the hauler onto the concrete of the runway here though at least water wasnt falling frozen from the sky that was something landcruiser crew replacements a male bawled ussmak and three or four others who had just deplaned tramped over to him the male took their names and identity numbers then waved them into the back of an armored transporter where are we ussmak asked as the machine jounced into life whom are we fighting that was a better question the names the big uglies gave to pieces of tosev meant little to him this place is called france a gunner named forssis answered i served here for a while shortly after we landed before the commander decided it was largely pacified and transferred my unit to the sssr all the males let their mouths fall open in derisive laughter at that everything had seemed so easy in the days right after the landing ussmak remembered being part of a drive that had smashed soviet landcruisers as if they were made of cardboard even then though he should have had a clue a sniper had picked off his commander when votal like any good landcruiser leader stuck his head out the cupola to get a decent view of what was going on and krentel the commander who replaced him did not deserve the body paint that proclaimed his rank well krentel was dead too and telerep the gunner with him a guerrillaussmak did not know whether he was russki or deutschhad blown the turret right off the landcruiser while they were trying to protect the crews cleaning up nuclear material scattered when the big uglies had managed to wreck the starship that carried the bulk of the races atomic weapons from his drivers position ussmak had bailed out of the landcruiser when it was strickenout of the landcruiser and into radioactive mud hed been in a hospital ship ever since till now so whom are we fighting he repeated the francais no the deutsche mostly forssis answered they were ruling here when we arrived i hear the weapons well be facing are better than the ones they threw at us the last time i was here silence settled over the transporters passenger compartment fighting the big uglies ussmak thought was like poisoning pests the survivors kept getting more resistant to what you were trying to do to them and like any other pests the big uglies changed faster than you could alter your methods of coping with them the heated compartment the smooth ride over a paved highway and the soft purr of the hydrogenburning engine helped most of the males doze off before long veterans they knew the value of snatching sleep while they had the chance ussmak tried to rest too but couldnt the longing for ginger gnawed at him and would not let go an orderly had sold him some of the precious herb in the hospital ship hed started tasting as much out of boredom as for any other reason when he was full of ginger he felt wise and brave and invulnerable when he wasntthat was when he discovered the trap into which hed fallen without ginger he seemed stupid and fearful and softskinned as a big ugly a contrast just made worse because he so vividly remembered how wonderful he knew himself to be when he tasted the powdered herb he didnt care how much he gave the orderly for his ginger he had pay saved up and nothing hed rather spend it on the orderly had an ingenious arrangement whereby he got ussmaks funds even though they didnt go directly into his computer account in the end it hadnt saved him one day a new orderly came in to police up ussmaks chamber discreet questioning ussmak could afford to be discreet then with several tastes hidden away showed that the only thing he knew about ginger was the fleetlords general order prohibiting its use ussmak had stretched out the intervals between tastes as long as he could but finally the last one was gone hed been gingerlessand melancholyever since the road climbed up through rugged mountains ussmak got only glimpses out the transporters firing ports after the monotonous flatlands of the sssr and the even more boring sameness of the hospital ship cubicle a jagged horizon was welcome but it didnt much remind ussmak of the mountains of home for one thing these mountains were covered with frozen water of one sort or another a measure of how miserably cold tosev was for another the dark conical trees that peeked out through the mantling of white were even more alien to his eye than the big uglies those trees also concealed tosevites as ussmak discovered a short while later somewhere up there in the woods a machine gun began to chatter bullets spanged off the transporters armor its own light cannon returned fire filling the passenger compartment with thunder the males who had been dozing were jerked rudely back to awareness they tumbled for the firing ports to see what was happening ussmak among them he couldnt see anything not even muzzle flashes scary forssis observed im used to sitting inside a landcruiser where the armor shields you from anything i cant help thinking that if the tosevites had a real gun up there wed be cooked ussmak knew only too well that not even landcruiser armor guaranteed protection against the big uglies but before he could say as much the transporter driver came on the intercom sorry about the racket my males but we havent rooted out all the guerrillas yet theyre just a nuisance as long as we dont run over any mines the driver sounded downright cheery ussmak wondered if he was tasting ginger i wonder how often they do run over mines forssis said darkly this male hasnt or he wouldnt still be driving us ussmak said a couple of the other landcruiser crewmales opened their mouths at him after a while the mountains gave way to wide gently rolling valleys forssis pointed to neat rows of gnarled plants that clung to stakes on southfacing slopes he said i saw those when i was in this france place before the tosevites ferment alcoholic brews from them he ran his tongue over his lips some have a very interesting flavor the passenger compartment had no view straight forward the driver had to make an announcement for the males he was hauling we are coming into the big ugly town of besancon our forward base for combat against the deutsche you will be assigned to crews here all ussmak had seen of tosevite architecture was the wooden farming villages of the sssr besancon was certainly different from those he didnt quite know what to make of it compared to the tall blocklike structures of steel and glass that formed the cities of home its buildings seemed toys yet they were very ornate toys with columns and elaborate stone and brickwork and steep roofs so the frozen water that fell from the sky hereabouts would slide off the races headquarters in besancon was on a bluff in the southeastern part of the town not only was the place on high ground ussmak discovered on alighting from the transporter that a river flowed around two sides of it well sited for defense he remarked interesting you should say that the driver answered this used to be a big ugly fortress he pointed to a long low gloomylooking building go in there theyll process you and assign you to a crew it shall be done ussmak hurried toward the doorway the cold was nipping at his fingers and eye turrets inside the building was heated to the point of comfort for civilized beingsussmak hissed gratefully otherwise though the local males were mostly using the furnishings theyd found a planet was a big place and the race hadnt brought enough of everything to supply all its garrisons and so a personnel officer seemed half swallowed by the fancy red velvet chair in which he sat a chair designed to fit a big ugly the male had to stretch to reach the computer on the heavy dark wood table in front of him the table was higher off the ground than any the race would have built the personnel officer turned one eye toward ussmak name specialization and number he said in a bored voice superior sir i am ussmak landcruiser driver ussmak answered and gave the number by which he was recorded paid and would be interred if he got unlucky the personnel officer entered the information used his free eye to read ussmaks data as they came up you were serving in the sssr against the soviets is that correct until your landcruiser was destroyed and you were exposed to excess radiation yes superior sir that is correct then youve not had combat experience against the deutsche superior sir i am told the guerrilla team that wrecked my vehicle was part deutsch part soviet if you are asking whether ive faced their landcruisers the answer is no that is what i meant the personnel officer said you will need to maintain a higher level of alertness hereabouts than was your habit in the sssr landcruiser driver tactically the deutsche are more often clever than perhaps any other tosevite group their newest landcruisers have heavier guns than you will have seen too combine these factors with their superior knowledge of the local terrain and they become opponents not to be despised i understand superior sir ussmak said will my landcruiser commander be experienced i hope the personnel officer punched at the computer again waited for a response to appear on the screen youre going to be assigned to landcruiser commander hessefs machine his driver was wounded in a bandit attack here in besancon a few days ago hessef compiled an excellent record in espafia south and west of here as we expanded out of our landing zone hes relatively new to the northern sector ussmak hadnt known espafia from france until the moment the personnel officer named them and no matter what that officer said about the superior skills of the deutsche to ussmak one band of big uglies seemed pretty much like another im glad to hear that he has fought superior sir where do i report to him the hall we are using as a barracks is out the door through which you entered and to your left if you do not find hessef and your gunnerwhose name is tvenkelthere try the vehicle park down past the antiaircraft missile launcher ussmak tried the vehicle park first on the theory that any commander worth his body paint took better care of his landcruiser than he did of himself seeing the big machines lined up in their sandbagged revetments made him eager to get back to the work for which hed been trained and also eager for the tightknit fellowship that flowered among the males of a good landcruiser crew crewmales working on their landcruisers directed him to the one hessef commanded but when he walked into its stall he found it buttoned up tight that presumably meant hessef and tvenkel were back at the barracks not a good sign ussmak thought as he began to retrace his steps he longed to feel a part of something larger than himself that was what the race was all about obedience from below obligation from above all working together for the common good hed known that feeling with votal his first commander but after votal died krentel proved such an incompetent that ussmak could not bond to him as subordinate was supposed to bond to superior then krentel had got himself killed too and ussmaks original gunner with him that worsened the drivers feeling of separation almost of exclusion from the rest of the race the long stay in the hospital ship and his discovery of ginger had pushed him even further out of the niche hed been intended to fit if he couldnt have ginger any more crew solidarity would have been a good second best but how could he really feel part of a crew that didnt have the simple sense to treat their landcruiser as if their lives depended on it as he walked back past the missile launcher bells began to ring down in the town of besancon he turned to one of the males im new here are those alarms where should i go what should i do nothingtake no notice of them the fellow answered the big uglies just have a lot of mechanical clocks that chime to divide up the day and night they startled me at first too after a while here you wont even notice them one is spectacular for something without electronics it must have seventy dials and these figures all worked by gears and pulleys come out and prance around and then disappear back into the machine when you get some slack time you ought to go see it its worth turning both eye turrets that way thanks maybe i will relieved ussmak kept on toward the barracks building just as he pushed the door open the sweet metallic clangor ceased even the cots the males were using had formerly belonged to the big uglies the thin mattresses looked lumpy the blankets scratchy they were undoubtedly woven from the hair of some native beast or other an idea that made ussmak itch all by itself a few males lounged around doing nothing in particular i seek the landcruiser commander hessef ussmak said as some of those males turned an eye or two toward him i am hessef one of them said coming forward by your paint you must be my new driver yes superior sir ussmak put more respect into his voice than he truly felt hessef was a jitterylooking male his body paint sloppily applied ussmaks own paint was none too neat but he thought commanders should adhere to a higher standard another male came up to stand beside hessef ussmak i introduce you to tvenkel our gunner the landcruiser commander said be good to have a whole crew again go out and fight tvenkel said like hessef he couldnt quite hold still his body paint was if possible in even worse shape than the landcruiser commanderssmeared blotched daubed on in a hurry ussmak wondered what hed done to deserve becoming part of this substandard crew hessef said sitting around the barracks all day with nothing to do is as boring as staying awake while you go into cold sleep then why arent you out tending to your landcruiser ussmak thought but that wasnt something he could say not to his new commander instead he answered boredom i know all about superior sir i just spent a good long while in a hospital ship recovering from radiation sickness there were times when i thought id been in that cubicle forever yes that could be bad just staring at the metal walls hessef agreed still though i think id sooner stay in a hospital ship than in this ugly brick shed that was never made for our kind he waved to show what he meant ussmak had to agree the barracks was indeed a dismal place he suspected even big uglies would have found themselves bored here how did you get through the days tvenkel asked recovering from sickness makes time pass twice as slowly for one thing i have every video from the hospital ships library memorized ussmak said which drew a laugh from his new crewmales for another he stopped short ginger was against regulations he didnt want to make the commander and gunner aware of his habit here drop your gear on this bed by ours hessef said weve been saving it against the day when wed be whole again ussmak did as he was asked the other two males crowded close around him as if to create the unity that held a good landcruiser crew together the rest of the males in the barracks looked on from a distance politely allowing ussmak to bond with his new comrades before they came forward to introduce themselves quietly tvenkel said you may not know it driver but the big uglies have an herb that makes life a lot less boring would you care to try a taste see what i mean ussmaks eyes both swung abruptly bored into the gunner he lowered his voice too you haveginger he hesitated before he named the precious powder now tvenkel and hessef stared at him you know about ginger the landcruiser commander whispered his mouth fell open in an enormous grin yes i know about ginger id love a taste thanks ussmak wanted to caper like a hatchling instead the three males looked at each other for a long time none of them saying anything ussmak broke the silence superior sirs i think were going to be an outstanding crew neither commander nor gunner argued with him the big maybach engine coughed sputtered died colonel heinrich jager swore and flipped up the panther ds cupola more than twice the horsepower of my old panzer iii he grumbled and it runs less than half as often he pulled himself out dropped down to the ground the rest of the crew scrambled out too the driver a big sandyhaired youngster named rolf wittman grinned impudently could be worse sir he said at least it hasnt caught fire the way a lot of them do oh for the blithe spirit of the young jager said acid in his voice he wasnt young himself hed fought in the trenches in the first world war stayed in the weimar republics reichswehr after it was over hed switched over to panzers as soon as he could after hitler began rearming germany and was commanding a company of panzer iiis in the sixteenth panzer division south of kharkov when the lizards came now at last the reich had made a machine that might make the lizards sit up and take notice when they met it jager had killed a lizard tank with his panzer iii but he was the first to admit hed been lucky anybody who came out alive let alone victorious after a runin with lizard armor was lucky the panther he now stood beside seemed decades ahead of his old machine it incorporated all the best features of the soviet tthick sloped armor wide tracks a powerful mm guninto a german design with a smooth suspension an excellent transmission and better sights and gun control than jager had ever imagined before the only trouble was it was a brandnew german design bumping up against the t and the even heavier kvl in had been a nasty surprise for the wehrmacht the panzer divisions had held their own through superior tactics and started upgunning their panzer iiis and ivs but getting better tanks became urgent when the lizards arrived urgent turned mandatory and so development had been rushed and the panther powerful machine that it was conspicuously lacked the mechanical reliability that characterized older german models jager kicked at the overlapping road wheels that carried the tracks this panzer might as well have been built by an englishman he growled he knew no stronger way to condemn an armored fighting vehicle the rest of the crew leaped to their panzers defense its not as bad as that sir wittman said it has a real gun in it by jesus added sergeant klaus meinecke not one of the peashooters the english use the gun was his responsibility he sat to jagers right in the turret on a chair that looked like a blackleathercovered hockey puck with a twoslat back having a real gun doesnt matter if we cant get to where were supposed to use it jager retorted lets fix this beast shall we before the lizards fly by and strafe us that got the men moving in a hurry attack from the air had been frightening enough when it was a shturmovik with red stars painted on wings and fuselage it was infinitely worse now the rockets the lizards fired hardly ever missed probably the fuel lines again wittman said or maybe the fuel pump he rummaged in one of the outside stowage bins for a wrench attacked the bolts that held the engine louvers onto the panthers rear deck the crew was a good one jager thought only veterans and select veterans at that got to handle panthers no point in frittering away the important new weapon by giving it to men who couldnt get the most out of it klaus meinecke grunted in triumph here we go this gasket in the pump is kaput do we have a spare more rummaging in the bins produced one the gunner replaced the damaged part screwed the top back onto the fuel pump case and said all right lets start it up again the crew had to take off the jack to get at the starter dog clutch thats poor design jager said and pulled a piece of paper and pencil out of a pocket of his black panzer crewmans tunic why not stow jack vertically between exhausts not horizontally below them he scribbled cranking up the panther was a twoman job wittman and meinecke did the honors the engine belched farted and came back to life after handshakes all around the crew climbed back into the machine and rolled on down the road well want to look for a good patch of woods where we can take cover for the night jager said such a patch might be hard to find he checked his map they were somewhere between thann and belfort heading down to try to hold the lizards away from the latter strategic town jager stuck his head out of the drumshaped cupola if he was where he thought he washe nodded pleased with his navigation there ahead stood rougementlechateau a romanesque priory now in picturesque ruin navigating through the rugged terrain of alsace and the franchecomte was a very different business from getting around on the ukrainian steppe where as on the sea you picked a compass heading and followed it if you got lost here heading across country wasnt so easy more often than not you had to back up and retrace your path by road which cost precious time the woods were still leafless but jager found a spot where bare branches interlaced thickly overhead behind scattered clouds the pale winter sun was low in the west good enough he said and ordered wittman to pull off the road and conceal the panther from prying eyes in the sky within the next half hour four more tanksanother panther two of the new panzer ivs with relatively light protection but a long mm gun almost as good as the panthers and a huge tiger that mounted an and armor poorly sloped but so thick and heavy that it made the panzer slower than it should have beenjoined him there the crews swapped rations spare parts and lies somebody had a deck of cards they played skat and poker till it got too dark to see jager thought back to the splendid organization of sixteenth panzer when the division plunged into the soviet union back then the thought of getting tanks into action by these dribs and drabs would have caused apoplexy in the high command that was before the lizards had started plastering the german rail and road networks now any movement toward the front was counted a success he squeezed butter and meat paste from their tubes onto a chunk of black bread as he chewed he reflected that a lot of things had happened to him that he never would have expected before the lizards came hed fought against the alien invaders side by side with a band of russian partisans most of them jews he hadnt had much use for jews before then he still didnt have a whole lot of use for them but now he understood why the jews of warsaw had risen against the towns german occupiers to help the lizards take it nothing the aliens did to them could come close to what theyd suffered at the hands of the reich and yet those same polish jews had let him cross their territory and hadnt even confiscated from him all the explosive metal that had been his booty from the joint germansoviet raid on the lizards true theyd taken half to send it to the united states but theyd let him deliver the rest to his own superiors even now german scientists were working to avenge berlin he took another bite even that wasnt the strangest had anyone told him on june that he wouldhave an affair with fall in love with he still wasnt sure about that himselfa soviet pilot his most likely reaction would have been to punch the teller in the eye for calling him a fairy on the day the war with the soviet union started no one in germany knew the russians would use female fliers in combat he hoped ludmila was all right theyd first met in the ukraine where shed plucked him and his gunner he hoped georg schultz was all right too off a collective farm and taken them to moscow so they could explain to the red army brass how theyd managed to kill a lizard panzer hed written to her after thatshe had some german he a little russianbut got no answer then theyd come together at berchtesgaden where hitler had pinned on him the german cross in gold a medal so ugly he wore only the ribbon these days and shed flown in molotov for consultation with the fuhrer he smiled slowly that had been as magical a week as hed ever known but what now he wondered ludmila had flown back to the soviet union where the nkvd would not look kindly upon her for sleeping with a nazi any more than the gestapo was pleased with him for sleeping with a red screw em all he muttered which drew a quizzical glance from rolf wittman jager did not explain a motorcycle came putputting slowly down the road its headlight dimmed almost to extinction by a blackout slit cap with the lizards detectors even that could be dangerous but not so dangerous as driving a winding french road in pitch darkness the motorcycle driver spotted the panzers off under the trees he stopped throttled down and called anyone know where i can find colonel heinrich jager here i am jager said standing up was ist los i have here orders for you colonel the driver pulled them out of his tunic pocket jager unfolded the paper stooped down and held it in front of the motorcycle headlamp so he could read it scheisse he exclaimed ive been recalled they just put me back in frontline service and now ive been recalled yes sir the driver agreed i am ordered to take you back with me but why jager said it makes no sense here i am an experienced fighter for fuhrer and vaterland against the lizards but what good will i do in this hechingen place ive scarcely even heard of it but he had heard of it and fairly recently too where when he stiffened as memory came hechingen was where hitler had said he was sending the explosive metal without another word jager walked over to his panther got on the radio and turned command over to the regimental lieutenantcolonel then he slung his pack onto his shoulders went back to the motorcycle climbed on behind the driver and headed back toward germany ii ludmila gorbunova did not care for moscow she was from kiev and thought the soviet capital drab and dull her impression of it was not improved by the endless grilling shed had from the nkvd shed never imagined the mere sight of green collar tabs could reduce her to fearful incoherence but it did and she knew things could have been worse the chekists were treating her with kid gloves because shed flown comrade molotov second in the soviet union only to the great stalin and a man who loathed flying to germany and brought him home in one piece besides the rodinathe motherlandneeded combat pilots shed stayed alive through most of a year against the nazis and several months against the lizards that should have given her value above and beyond what she got for ferrying molotov around whether it did however remained to be seen a lot of very able seemingly very valuable people had disappeared over the past few years denounced as wreckers or traitors to the soviet union or sometimes just vanished with no explanation at all as if they had suddenly ceased to exist the door to the cramped little room cramped yes but infinitely preferable to a cell in the lefortovo prison in which she sat came open the nkvd man who came in wore three crimson oblongs on his collar tabs ludmila bounced to her feet comrade lieutenantcolonel she said saluting he returned the salute the first time that had happened since the nkvd started in on her comrade senior lieutenant he acknowledged i am boris lidov she blinked in surprise none of her questioners had bothered giving his name till now either lidov looked more like a schoolmaster than an nkvd man not that that meant anything but he surprised her again saying would you like some tea yes thank you very much comrade lieutenantcolonel she answeredquickly before he changed his mind the german attack had deranged the soviet distribution system that of the lizards all but destroyed it these days tea was rare and precious well she thought the nkvd will have it if anyone does and sure enough lidov stuck his head out the door and bawled a request within moments someone fetched him a tray with two gently steaming glasses he took it set it on the table in front of ludmila help yourself he said choose whichever you wish neither one is drugged i assure you he didnt need to assure her that he did so made her suspicious again but she took a glass and drank her tongue found nothing in it but tea and sugar she sipped again savoring the taste and the warmth thank you comrade lieutenantcolonel its very good she said lidov made an indolent gesture as if to say she didnt need to thank him for anything so small then he said idly as if making casual conversation you know i met your major jagerno youve said hes colonel jager now correct your colonel jager i should say after you brought him here to moscow last summer ah ludmila said that being the most noncommittal noise she could come up with she decided it was not enough comrade lieutenantcolonel as i have said before he is not my colonel by any means i do not necessarily condemn lidov said steepling his fingers the ideology of the fascist state is corrupt not the german people andhe coughed drylythe coming of the lizards has shown that progressive economic systems capitalist and socialist alike must band together lest we all fall under the oppression of the ancient system wherein the relationship is slave to master not worker to boss yes ludmila said eagerly the last thing she wanted to do was argue about the dialectic of history with an nkvd man especially when his interpretation seemed to her advantage lidov went on further your colonel jager helped perform a service for the people of the soviet union as he may have mentioned to you no im afraid he didnt im sorry comrade lieutenantcolonel but we talked very little about the war when we saw each other in germany we ludmila felt her face heat she knew what lidov had to be thinking unfortunatelyfrom her point of viewhe was right he looked down his long straight nose at her you like germans well dont you be said sniffily this jager in berchtesgaden and you attached his gunnerhe pulled out a scrap of paper checked a name on itgeorg schultz da to the ground crew at your airstrip he is a better mechanic than anyone else at the airstrip germans understand machinery better than we do i think but as far as i am concerned he is only a mechanic ludmila insisted he is a german they are both germans so much for lidovs words about the solidarity of peoples with progressive economic systems his flat hard tone made ludmila think of a trip to siberia on an unheated cattle car or of a bullet in the back of the neck the nkvd man went on it is likely that comrade molotov will dispense with the services of a pilot who forms such unsoviet attachments i am sorry to hear that comrade lieutenantcolonel ludmila said though she knew molotov would have been glad to dispense with the services of any pilot given his attitude about flying but she insisted i have no attachments to georg schultz save those of the struggle against the lizards and to colonel jager lidov said with the air of a man calling checkmate ludmila did not answer she knew she was checkmated the lieutenantcolonel spoke as if pronouncing sentence because of this conduct of yours you are to be returned to your former duties without promotion dismissed comrade senior lieutenant ludmila had been braced for ten years in the gulag and another five of internal exile she needed a moment to take in what shed just heard she jumped to her feet i serve the soviet state comrade lieutenantcolonel whether you believe me or not she added to herself prepare yourself for immediate departure for the airport lidov said as if her mere presence polluted moscow an nkvd flunky must have been listening outside the door or to a concealed microphone for in under half a minute a fellow in green collar tabs brought in a canvas bag full of her worldly goods before long a troika was taking her from the kremlin to the airport on the edge of moscow the sleighs runners and the hooves of the three horses that drew it kicked up snow gone from white to gray thanks to city soot only when her beloved little u biplane came into view on the runway did she realize shed been returned to this duty which she wanted more than any other as if it were a punishment she chewed on that a long time even after she was in the air im bloody lost david goldfarb said as he pedaled his raf bicycle through the countryside south of leicester the radarman came to an intersection he looked for signs to tell him where he wasand looked in vain because the signs taken down in to hinder a feared german invasion had never gone back up he was trying to get to the research and development test flying aerodrome at bruntingthorpe to which hed been ordered to report south from the village of peatling magna his directions read the only trouble was nobody had bothered to tell him for all he knew nobody was aware two roads ran south from peatling magna hed taken the righthand track and was beginning to regret it peatling magna hadnt looked magna enough to boast two roads when he rolled through it he wondered if there could possibly be a peatling minima and if so whether it was visible to the naked eye ten minutes of steady pedaling brought him into another village he looked around hopefully for anything resembling an aerodrome but nothing he saw matched that description a matronly woman in a scarf and a heavy wool coat was trudging down the street begging your pardon madam he called to her but is this bruntingthorpe the womans head whipped aroundhis london accent automatically made him out to be a stranger she relaxed a little when she saw he was in raf dark blue and thus had an excuse for poking his goodsized nose into a place where he didnt belong but even though she used the broader vowels of the east midlands her voice was sharp as she answered bruntingthorpe i should say not young man this is peatling parva bruntingthorpe lies down that road she pointed east thank you madam goldfarb said gravely he bent low over his bicycle rode away fast so she wouldnt hear him start to snicker not peatling minimapeatling parva the name fit it had looked a pretty parva excuse for a village now though he was on the right track andhe looked at his watchnear enough on time that he could blame his tardiness on the trains getting into leicester late which it had he hadnt gone far toward bruntingthorpe when he heard a screaming roar saw an airplane streak across the sky at what seemed an impossible speed alarm and fury coursed through himhad he come here just in time to see the lizards bomb and wreck the aerodrome then he played in his mind the film of the aircraft hed just seen after the lizards destroyed the radar station at dover hed been an aircraft spotter the oldfashioned way with binoculars and field telephone for a while he recognized the lizards fighters and fighterbombers this aircraft even if it flew on jets didnt match any of them either theyd come up with something new or the plane was english hope replaced anger where was he more likely to find english jet aircraft than at a research and development aerodrome he wondered why the powers that be wanted him there hed find out soon the village of bruntingthorpe was no more prepossessing than either of the peatlings not far away though a collection of tents corrugatediron nissen huts and macadamized runways marred the gently rolling fields that surrounded the hamlets a soldier with a tin hat and a sten gun demanded to see goldfarbs papers when he pedaled up to the barbedwire fence and gate around the raf facility he surrendered them but could not help remarking seems a fairish waste of time if anyone wants to know not bloody likely im a lizard in disguise is it never can tell chum the soldier answered besides you might be a jerry in disguise and were not dead keen on that even if the match there wont be played to a finish cant say i blame you goldfarbs parents had got out of russianruled poland to escape pogroms against the jews by all accounts the nazis pogroms after they conquered poland had been a hundred times worse bad enough for the jews there to make common cause with the lizards against the germans now from the reports that leaked out the lizards were beginning to make things tough on the jews goldfarb sighed being a jew wasnt easy anywhere the sentry opened the gate waved him through he rode over to the nearest nissen hut got off his bicycle pushed down the kickstand and went into the hut several raf men were gathered round a large table there studying some drawings by the light of a paraffin lamp hung overhead yes one of them said goldfarb stiffened to attention the casual questioner though just a couple of inches over five feet tall wore the four narrow stripes of a group captain saluting goldfarb gave his name specialization and service number then added reporting as ordered sir the officer returned the salute good to have you with us goldfarb weve had excellent reports of you and were confident youll make a valuable member of the team i am group captain fred hipple i shall be your commanding officer my speciality is jet propulsion here we have wing commander peary flight lieutenant kennan and flight officer roundbush the junior officers all towered over hipple but he dominated nonetheless he was a dapper little fellow who held himself very erect he had slickeddown wavy hair a closely trimmed mustache and heavy eyebrows he spoke with almost professional precision i am told that you have been flying patrols aboard a radarequipped lancaster bomber in an effort to detect lizard aircraft prior to their reaching our shores yes sir thats correct goldfarb said capital we shall make great use of your experience i assure you what we are engaged in here radarman is developing a jetpropelled fighter aeroplane to be similarly equipped with radar thus facilitating the acquisition and tracking of targets and it is to be hoped their destruction thatssplendid sir goldfarb had always thought of radar as a defensive weapon one to use to detect the enemy and send properly armed planes after him but to mount it on a fighter already formidably armed in its own right he smiled this was a project in which he would gladly take part flight officer roundbush shook his head he was as big and blond and blocky as hipple was spare and dark he said itd be a lot more splendid if we could make the bloody thing fit in the space we have for it which is at the moment essentially nil ripple said with a rueful nod the jet fighter you may have seen taking off a few moments ago that little gloster pioneer is not what one would call lavishly equipped with room it was in fact in the air more than a year before the lizards came bitterness creased his face as i had produced a working jet engine as far back as i find the delay unfortunate but no help for it now when the lizards descended the pioneer though intended only as an experimental aircraft was rushed into production to give us as much of an equalizer as was possible might as well be tanks roundbush murmured both the german invasion of france and the fighting in the north african desert had shown severe deficiencies in british armor but the same old obsolescent models kept getting made because they did work after a fashion and england had no time to tool up to build anything better group captain hipple shook his head its not as bad as that basil we have managed to get the meteor off the ground after all he turned back to goldfarb the meteor is more a proper fighter than the pioneer the latter carries a single jet engine placed in back of the cockpit whereas the former has two of an improved design mounted on the wings the improvement in performance is considerable we also have a considerable production program laid on for the meteor flight lieutenant kennan said with luck we should be able to put large numbers of jet fighters into the air by this time next year yes thats so maurice hipple agreed of all the great powers we and the japanese have proved most fortunate in that the lizards did not invade either island nation from the depths of space i suppose we seemed too small to be worth troubling over weve endured a worse blitz than the jerries gave us but life does go on despite a blitz you should know that eh goldfarb yes sir goldfarb said it got a bit lively at dover now and again but we came through though only a firstgeneration englishman he had a knack for understatement exactly hipples nod was vehement as if goldfarb had said something important the group captain went on as flight lieutenant kennan and i have noted our industrial capacity is still respectable and we shall be able to get considerable numbers of meteors airborne within a relatively short period what point to it however ifonce airborne they are shot down again in short order which is where you come in goldfarb wing commander peary said he was a slim fellow of medium height with sandy hair starting to go gray his startling bass voice seemed better suited to a man of twice his bulk exactly hipple said again julianthe wing commandermeans we need a chap with practical experience in airborne radar to help us plan its installation in meteors as quickly as possible our pilots must be able to detect the enemys presence at a distance comparable to that at which he can see us dyou follow i believe so sir goldfarb said from what you say i gather you intend the meteor to have a twoman cockpit pilot and radar observer with the sets we have sir a pilot would be hardpressed to tend to them and fly the aircraft at the same time the four raf officers exchanged glances goldfarb wondered if hed just stuck his foot in it that would be lovely a lowly radarman affronting all his superiors within five minutes of arriving at a new posting then julian peary rumbled this is a point which was much debated during the design of the aircraft you may be interested to know that the view you just expressed is the one which prevailed impleased to hear that sir goldfarb said with such transparent relief that basil roundbush who seemed not overburdened with military formality broke into a large toothy grin group captain hipple said having established your level of expertise with such dispatch radarman you give me hope you will also be able to assist us in reducing the size of the radar set to be carried the fuselage of the meteor is rather less spacious than the bomb bay of the lancaster where you were previously ensconced perhaps youll have a look at these drawings with us so you can get a notion of the volume involved goldfarb stepped up to the table with no more fanfare than that he found himself a part of the team he said i dont know the solution to one problem we faced in the lanc which is ripple asked of course the lizards guided rockets can knock down a plane at longer range than any guns that we have can hit back one of those rockets definitely seems to home in on our radar transmissionsprobably the same sort the lizards used to knock out our ground stations turning off the set made that particular rocket go wild but it also left us blindsomething i shouldnt fancy if i were in the midst of a dogfight indeed not ripple nodded vigorously even under ideal circumstances the meteor does not pull us level with the lizards it merely reduces our disadvantage we remain deficient in speed and as you say in armament as well to have to engage enemy aircraft without being able to detect them past the range of the pilots eye would be a dreadful handicap i do not pretend to be an expert in radar as i said engines are my speciality he turned to the other officers suggestions gentlemen basil roundbush said can your airborne radar set emit more than one frequency goldfarb if so perhaps switching between one and the next might ah confuse the rocket and cause it to miss without losing radar capacity that might work sir i honestly dont know goldfarb said we werent any too keen on experimenting not up above angels twenty if you know what i mean no quarrel there roundbush assured him wed have to try it on the ground first if a transmitter there survived by shifting frequencies the result might be worth testing in aircraft as well he paused to scribble some notes goldfarb was delighted research and development had not stopped because of wartime emergencies and even more delighted to be a part of the effort at bruntingthorpe but hed already promised himself that when the radarequipped meteors flew hed be in the rear seat of one of them having become part of an aircrew he knew hed never again be content to stay on the ground moishe russie was tired of staying underground the irony of his position hit him in the teeth like a rifle butt in the hands of an ss man when the lizards came to earth hed thought they were the literal answer to his prayers absent their arrival the nazis would have massacred the jews in the warsaw ghetto and in the others theyd set up throughout poland the jews had been looking for a miracle then when moishe declared that hed had one he gained enormous prestige in the ghetto before hed been just another medical student slowly starving to death along with everyone else hed urged the jews to rise to help throw the germans out and let the lizards in and so hed become one of the lizards favorite humans hed broadcast propaganda for them tellingtruthfullyof the horrors and atrocities the nazis had committed in poland the lizards came to think he would say anything for them theyd wanted him to praise their destruction of washington dc and say it was as just as the devastation that had fallen on berlin hed refused and so he found himself here hiding in a ghetto bunker that had been built with the nazis not the lizards in mind his wife rivka picked that moment to ask how long have we been down here too long their son reuven chimed in he was right moishe knew he was right reuven and rivka had been cooped up in the bunker longer than he had theyd gone into hiding so the lizards couldnt use threats against them to bend him to their will after that the lizards put a gun to his head to make him say what they wanted he did not think of himself as a brave man but hed defied them even so they hadnt killed him in a way what they did was worsethey killed his words broadcasting a twisted recording that made him seem to say what they wanted even when he hadnt russie had had his revenge hed made a recording in a tiny studio in the ghetto that detailed what the lizards had done to him and the jewish fighters had managed to smuggle it out of poland to embarrass the aliens after that hed had to disappear himself rivka said do you even know moishe whether its day or night up there no more than you do he admitted the bunker had a clock both he and rivka had been faithful about keeping it wound but the clock had only a twelvehour dial and after a while theyd lost track of which twelve hours they were in even by candlelight he could see the dial from where he stood it was a quarter past three but did that mean bustling afternoon or dead of night he had no idea all he knew was that at the moment everyone here was awake i dont know how much longer we can stand this rivka said its no fit life for a human being hiding down here in the darkness like a rat in its hole but if its the only way we can go on then go on we will moishe answered sharply life in wartime is never easydo you think youre in america even if we are underground were better off now than when the nazis ruled the ghetto are we i think so we have plenty of food their other child a daughter had died during the nazi occupation of dysentery aggravated by starvation moishe had known what he needed to do to save her but without food and medicine hed been helpless but now rivka said so what we could see our friends before share our troubles if the germans beat us on the streets it was just because we happened to be there if the lizards spy us theyll shoot us on sight since that was manifestly true moishe chose the only ploy left to him he changed the subject even now our people are better off under the lizards than they were under the germans yes and thats thanks in large part to you rivka retorted and what have you got for it your whole family buried alive so much anger and bitterness clogged her voice that reuven started to cry even as he comforted his son moishe blessed the little boy for shortcircuiting the argument after he and rivka got reuven calmed down again moishe said carefully if you feel you must i suppose you and reuven can go back above ground not that many people knew you by sight with gods help you might go a long time before you were betrayed anyone who wanted to curry favor with the lizards could gain it by turning me in or a pole might do it for no better reason than that he hates jews rivka sighed you know we wont do that we wont leave you and youre right you cant come up but if you think were well off here youre meshuggeh i never said we were well off russie answered after a brief pause to search his memory and make sure he really hadnt said anything so foolish i only said things could be worse and they could the nazis could have shipped the whole warsaw ghetto to treblinka or that other extermination camp they were just finishing when the lizards came the one they called auschwitz he didnt mention that to his wife some things even if true were too horrific to use as fuel in a quarrel the argument petered out reuven got sleepy so they put him to bed that meant they needed to go to bed themselves not much later they couldnt get much sleep when the boy was awake and bouncing off the walls of the cramped bunker noises woke rivka first then moishe reuven snored on even when his parents sat up noises in the cellar of the block of flats that concealed the bunker were always frightening at times jewish fighters whom mordechai anielewicz led came down with fresh supplies for the russies but moishe always wondered if the next appearance would be the one that brought the knock on the plasterboard panel hiding the doorway rap rap rap the sharp sound echoed through the bunker russie started violently beside him rivkas lips pulled back from her teeth her eyes widened and the skin all over her face tightened down onto the bones in a mask of fear rap rap rap russie had vowed he wouldnt go easily moving as quiet as he could he slid out of bed grabbed a long kitchen knife and blew out the last lamp plunging the bunker into darkness blacker than any aboveground midnight rap rap rap shoving and scraping noises as the plasterboard panel was dislodged and pushed aside the bunker door itself was barred from the inside moishe knew it wouldnt hold against anyone determined to break it down he raised the knife high the first one who came throughjewish traitor or lizardwould take as much steel as he could give that much he promised himself but instead of booted feet pounding on the door or a battering ram crashing against it an urgent yiddish voice called we know youre in there reb moishe open this verkakte door will you we have to get you away before the lizards come a trick a trap automatically moishe looked toward rivka the darkness hed made himself stymied him what to do he called softly open the door she answered but open the door rivka repeated nobody in the company of the lizards would have sworn at it that way it seemed a slim reed to snatch if it broke it would pierce more than his hand but how could he hold the invaders at bay all at once he realized they didnt have to come in after him suppose they just stood back and sprayed the bunker with machinegun bullets or started a fire and let him and his wife and child roast he let the kitchen knife clatter to the floor fumbled blindly for the bar lifted it out of its rest and pushed the door open one of the two jews in the cellar carried an oilburning lantern and a pistol the lantern wasnt very bright but dazzled moishe anyhow the fighter said took you long enough come on you have to hurry some mamzer talked where he shouldnt and the lizardsll be here soon belief took root in russie get reuven he called to his wife i have him she answered hes not quite awake but hell comewont you dear come where reuven asked blurrily out of the bunker rivka said that being all she knew it was plenty to galvanize the boy he let out a wild whoop and bounded out of bed wait rivka exclaimed you need your shoes in fact we all need our shoes we were asleep at half past eight in the morning the jew with the lantern said i wish i was after a moment though he added not down here though i have to admit moishe had forgotten he wore only socks as he pulled on shoes and tied the laces he asked do we have time to take anything with us the books on a high shelf had become more like siblings than friends but the other jew impatiently waiting outside the one with a german mauser slung on his back shook his head and answered reb moishe if you dont get moving you wont have time to take yourself even the lowceilinged cellar seemed spacious to moishe he started to pant on his way up the stairs hed had no exercise at all in the bunker the gray leaden light at the top of the stairwell made him blink and set his eyes to watering after so long with candles and oil lamps even a distant hint of daylight was overwhelming then he walked out onto the street thick clouds hid the sun dirty slushy snow lay in the gutters the air was hardly less thick and smoky than it had been in his underground hideaway all the same he wanted to throw his arms wide and dance like a chasid to let loose his delight reuven did caper coltlike with a childs compressed grasp of time he must have felt hed been entombed forever rivka walked steadily beside him but her pale face was alight with joy and wonder too palemoishe looked down at his own hands beneath dirt they were white and transparent as skimmed milk his wife and son were just as pale everyone grew pallid through a polish winter but if he and his family lost any more color theyd disappear whats the date he asked wondering how long hed been cooped up in the bunker twentysecond of february the jew with the lantern answered a month till spring he snorted spring seemed more likely a year away than mere weeks the first lizard moishe saw on the street made him want to run back to the bunker the alien though paid him no special attention lizards had as much trouble telling humans apart as people did with lizards moishe glanced over to reuven and rivka the aliens difficulties in that regard had helped the jews spirit the two of them away from right under their snouts in here the fighter with the pistol said the russies obediently went up a stairway and into another block of flats the halls smelled of cabbage and unwashed bodies and urine in an apartment at the back of the third floor more of anielewiczs warriors waited they whisked moishe and his family inside one of them grabbed moishe by the arm and hustled him over to a table set out with a bar of yellowtan soap an enameled basin a pair of shears and a straight razor the beard reb moishe has to come off he said without preamble moishe drew back in dismay a protective hand rose to cover his chin the ss had cut off the beardsand sometimes the ears and nosesof jews in the ghetto for sport im sorry the fellowbearded himselfsaid were going to move you were going to hide you look at yourself now he picked up a fragment of what might once have been a fulllength mirror thrust it in moishes face moishe perforce looked he sawhimself paler than usual his beard longer and fuzzier than usual because he hadnt bothered trimming it while in the bunker but otherwise the same rather horsefaced studiouslooking jew hed always been the fighter said now imagine yourself cleanshaven imagine a lizard with a photograph of you as you are now looking at youand walking on to look at someone else the closest moishe could come to seeing himself beardless was remembering what hed looked like before his whiskers sprouted he had trouble bringing the youth across the years and putting that face on the man hed become then rivka said theyre right moishe it will make you different and we need that please go ahead and shave he sighed deeply a token of surrender then he took the mirror from the fighter and leaned it on a shelf so he could see what he was doing he picked up the shears and rapidly clipped as short as he could the beard hed worn his whole adult life what he knew about shaving was all theoretical he splashed his face with water then lathered the strongsmelling soap and spread it over cheeks and chin and neck reuven snickered you look funny father i feel funny he picked up the razor the bone grip molded itself to his hand like the handle of a scalpel the comparison seemed even more apt a few minutes later he thought hed seen less blood flow at an appendectomy he nicked his ear the hollow under his cheekbone his chin his larynx and he made a good game try at slicing off his upper lip when he rinsed himself the water in the basin turned pink you look funny father reuven said again moishe peered into the scrap of mirror a stranger stared back at him he looked younger than he had with the beard but not really like his earlier self his features were sharperedged bonier more defined he looked tougher than hed expected the dried blood here and there on his face might have had something to do with that it gave him the air of a boxer whod just lost a tough match the fellow whod handed him the mirror patted him on the back and said dont worry reb moishe they say it gets easier with practice he wasnt speaking from experience his own graybrown beard reached halfway down his shirtfront russie started to nod then stopped and stared it hadnt occurred to him that hed have to do this more than once but of course the fighter was rightif he wanted to keep up his disguise hed have to go on shaving it struck him as a great waste of time even so after he rinsed and dried the razor he stuck it into a pocket of his long dark coat the man with the pistol whod plucked him from the bunker said all right i think we can get you out of here now without too many people recognizing you his own mother wouldnt have recognized him but she was dead like his daughter of intestinal disease aggravated by starvation he said if i stay in warsaw sooner or later ill be spotted of course the fighter said so you wont stay in warsaw it made sense it was like a kick in the belly just the same hed spent his whole life here till the lizards came hed been sure he would die here too where will iwhere will wego he asked quietly lodz the fellow answered the word tolled through the room like the deep chime of a funeral bell at a catholic church the germans had done their worst to the lodz ghetto second largest in poland after warsaws just before the lizards came many of the quarter million jews who had lived there were shipped to chelmno and treblinka never to come out again russies newly bared face must have shown his thoughts all too clearly the jewish fighter said i understand how you feel reb moishe but its the best place no one not even god willing a lizard would think to look for you there and if youre needed we can bring you back in a hurry he could not fault the logic but when he looked at rivka he saw the same sick dread in her eyes that he felt himself the jews of lodz had passed into the valley of the shadow of death going to live in a town where that shadow had fallen some of us still survive in lodz the fighter said wed not send you there otherwise you may be sure of that let it be so then russie said with a sigh the fighter with the pistol drove the horsedrawn wagon out of warsaw russie sat beside him feeling horribly visible and vulnerable rivka and reuven huddled in back along with several other women and children amid scraps and rags and oddshaped pieces of sheet metal the stock of a junkmans trade the lizards had a checkpoint on the highway just outside of town one of the males there carried a photograph of russie with his beard his heart thuttered in alarm but after a cursory glance the lizard turned to his comrade and said in his own language just another boring bunch of big uglies the comrade waved the wagon ahead after a couple of kilometers the fighter pulled over to the side of the road the women and children who had served to camouflage reuven and rivka got down and started walking back to warsaw the fighter flicked the reins clucked to the horse the wagon rattled down the road toward lodz liu han looked mistrustfully at the latest assortment of canned goods the little scaly devils had brought into her cell she wondered what was most likely to stay down this time the salty soup with noodles and bits of chicken perhaps and the canned fruit in syrup she knew she wouldnt touch the stew with the thick gravy shed already given that back twice she sighed being pregnant was hard enough anywhere it was even worse imprisoned here in this airplane that never came down not only was she alone in the little metal room except when the scaly devils brought bobby fiore to her but almost all her food was put up by foreign devils like him and not to her taste she ate what she could wishing she were back in her chinese village or even in the prison camp from which the little scaly devils had plucked her in either place she would have been among her own kind not caged all alone like a songbird for the amusement of her captors if she ever got out of here she vowed she would free every bird she could not that getting out seemed likely she shook her headno indeed her straight black hair tumbled over her face over her bare shouldersthe scaly devils who wore no clothes themselves allowed their human prisoners none and kept the cell too warm to make them comfortable anyhowand across her newly tender breasts her hair hadnt been long enough to do that when the little devils brought her up here it was now and growing toward her waist she belched uncomfortably and got ready to dash for the plumbing hole but what shed eaten decided to stay where it belonged she wasnt sure exactly how far gone she was not in here where the little scaly devils never turned off the light to let her reckon the passage of days but she wasnt throwing up as much as she had at first her belly hadnt started to swell though getting close to four months was the best guess she could make part of the floor instead of being metal like the rest was a raised mat covered with slick gray stuff that looked more like leather than anything else but didnt smell like it her body sweaty in the heat stuck to the mat when she lay down on it but it was still better for resting than anywhere else in the cell she closed her eyes tried to sleep shed been sleeping a lot lately partly because she was pregnant and partly because she had nothing better to do she was just dozing off when the door to her cell hissed open again she opened one eye sure it would be the little devil who came in to take away the cans after every meal sure enough in he skittered but several others came with him a couple of them had body paint more ornate than she was used to seeing one to her surprise spoke chinese after a fashion pointing to her he said you come with us she quickly got to her feet it shall be done superior sir she said using one of the phrases shed learned of the little devils language the devils fell in around her at more than arms length she was on the small side an inch or so above five feet but she towered over the scaly devils enough so to make them nervous around her she joined them eagerly enough any trip out of her cell was unusual enough to count as a treat and maybe better still they would take her to bobby fiore they didnt they led her in the opposite direction from his cell she wondered what they wanted with her wondering made her hopeful and anxious by turns they might do anything at all to her from setting her free to taking her away from bobby fiore and giving her to some new man who would rape and beat her she had no say she was just a prisoner what they did reached neither extreme they took her down an oddly curved stairway to another deck she felt lighter there than she should have her stomach didnt like it but much of her fear went away she knew theyd brought bobby fiore here and nothing too bad had happened to him the scaly devils escorted her into a chamber full of their incomprehensible gadgetry the devil sitting behind the desk surprised her by speaking fair chinese you are the female human liu han yes she answered who are you please her own language tasted sweet in her mouth even with bobby fiore she spoke a curious mixture of chinese english and the little devils tongue eked out with much gesture and dumb show i am called nossat the scaly devil answered i am ai do not know it your language has an exact word for iti am a male who studies how you humans think i am colleague to tessrek who spoke with your mate bobby fiore yes i understand liu han said that was the little scaly devil with whom bobby fiore had spoken down here what had he called the devil tessrek english had a name for what that devil didpsychologist that was it liu han relaxed talking could not be dangerous nossat said you are going to lay an egg in the time to come no your kind does not lay eggs you are going to give birth is that what you say give birth you will have a child i am going to have a child yes liu han agreed of themselves the fingers of her right hand spread fanlike over her belly she had long since resigned herself to being naked in front of the scaly devils but she remained automatically protective of the baby growing inside her the child is from matings between bobby fiore and you nossat said without waiting for her to reply he stuck one of his thin clawed fingers into a recess on the desk a screen as if for motion pictures lit up behind him the picture that moved upon it was of bobby fiore thrusting atop liu han she sighed she knew the little scaly devils took pictures of her while she made love as well as any other time they chose they had mating seasons like farm animals and were utterly uninterested in matters of the flesh at any other time the way people mated the whole year round seemed to fascinate and appall them yes she answered as the picture played on bobby fiore and i made love to start this baby before long it would begin to kick inside her hard enough to feel she remembered what a marvel that was from the boy shed borne her husband before the japanese killed him and the child nossat stuck his finger into a different recess liu han was not sorry to see the picture of her joined gasping to bobby fiore fade a different moving picture took its place this one of an immensely pregnant black woman giving birth to her baby liu han watched the woman with more interest than the birth process she knew about that but shed never before seen a black man or woman she hadnt known the palms of their hands and soles of their feet were so pale this is how your young are born nossat said as the babys head and then shoulders emerged from between the straining womans legs what else could it possibly be to liu han the little scaly devils were an incomprehensible blend of immense and terrifying powers on the one hand and childishly abysmal ignorance on the other this isdreadful nossat said the motion picture kept running the woman delivered the afterbirth it should have been over then but she kept on bleeding the blood was hard to see against her dark skin but it spread over and soaked into the ground where she lay the little scaly devil went on this female died after the young tosevite came out of her body many females in the land we hold have died bearing their young that does happen yes liu han said quietly it was not something she cared to think about not just bleeding but a baby trying to come out while in the wrong position or fever afterwards so many things could go wrong and so many babies never lived to see their second birthday their first outside their mother but its not right nossat exclaimed as if he held her personally responsible for the way people had their babies no other kind of intelligent creature we know puts its mothers in such danger just to carry on life liu han had never imagined any kind of intelligent creatures but human beings until the little scaly devils came even after she knew of the devils she hadnt thought there could be still more varieties of such creatures irritation in her voice she snapped well how do you have your babies then for all she knew the little devils might have been assembled in factories rather than born our females lay eggs of course nossat said so do those of the rabotevs and hallessi over whom we rule only you tosevites are different his weird eyes swiveled so that one watched the screen behind him while the other stayed accusingly on liu han she fought to keep from laughing fought and lost the idea of making a nestout of straw maybe like a chickensand then sitting on it till the brood hatched was absurd enough to tickle her fancy hens certainly didnt seem to have trouble laying eggs either it might be an easier way to do the job but it wasnt the way people did it nossat said your time to have the young come out of your body is now about a year away a year liu han stared at him didnt the little scaly devils know anything but the devil said nothis is my mistake for two years of the race more or less make one of yours i should sayshould have saidyou are half a year from your time half a year yes liu han said maybe not quite so long we have to decide what to do with you nossat told her we have no knowledge of how to help you when the young is born you are only a barbarous tosevite but we do not want you to die because we are ignorant you are our subject not our enemy fear blew through liu han a cold wind give birth here in this place of metal with only scaly devils beside her without a midwife to help her through her pangs if the least little thing went wrong she would die and the baby too i will need help she said as plaintively as she could please get some for me we are still planning nossat said which was neither yes nor no we will know what we do before your time comes what if the baby is early liu han said the little devils eyes both swung toward her this can happen of course it can liu han said but nothing was of course for the little scaly devils not when they knew so little about how mankindand evidently womankindfunctioned then suddenly liu han had an idea that felt so brilliant she hugged herself in delight superior sir would you let me go back down to my own people so a midwife could help me deliver the baby this had not been thought of nossat made a distressed hissing noise i see though from where you stand it may have merit you are not the only female specimen on this ship who will have young born we willhow do you say consider yes we will consider thank you very much superior sir liu han looked down at the floor as she had seen the scaly devils do when they meant to show respect hope sprang up in her like rice plants in spring or maybe nossat said maybe we bring up awhat word did you use a midwife yes maybe we bring up a midwife to this ship to help you here we will consider that too you go now the guards took liu han out of the psychologists office led her back to her cell she felt heavier with each step up the curiously curving stairway that returned her to her deckand also because the hope which had sprouted now began to wilt but it didnt quite die the little scaly devils hadnt said no a blankfaced nipponese guard shoved a bowl of rice between the bars of teerts cell teerts bowed to show he was grateful feeding prisoners at all was in nipponese eyes a mercy a proper warrior would die fighting rather than let himself be captured the nipponese were in any case sticklers for their own forms of courtesy anyone who flouted them was apt to be beatenor worse since the nipponese shot down his killercraft teerts had had enough beatingsand worsethat he never wanted another which didnt mean he wouldnt get one but he hated rice not only was it the food of his captivity it wasnt something any male of the race would eat by choice he wanted meat and could not remember the last time hed tasted it this bland glutinous vegetable matter kept him alive although he often wished it wouldnt no that was a falsehood if hed wanted to die he had only to starve himself to death he did not think the nipponese would force him to eat if anything he might gain their respect by perishing this way that he cared whether these barbarous big uglies respected him showed how low he had sunk he lacked the nerve to put an end to himself though the race did not commonly use suicide as a way out of trouble and so miserably he ate half wishing he never saw another grain of rice half wishing his bowl held more he finished just before the guard came back and took away the bowl he bowed again in gratitude for that service though the guard would also have taken it even if he hadnt finished after the guard left teerts resigned himself to another indefinitely long stretch of tedium so far as he knew he was the only prisoner of the race the nipponese held here at nagasaki no cells within speaking distance of him held even big ugly prisoners lest he somehow form a conspiracy with them and escape he let his mouth fall open in bitter laughter at the likelihood of that sixlegged tosevite pests scuttled across the concrete floor teerts let his eye turrets follow the creatures he had nothing in particular against them the real pests on tosev were the ones who walked upright he drilled away into a fantasy where his killercrafts turbofans hadnt tried to breathe bullets instead of air he could have been back at a comfortably heated barracks talking with his comrades or watching the screen or piping music through a button taped to a hearing diaphragm he could have been snapping bites off a chunk of dripping meat he could have been in his killercraft again helping to bring the pestilential big uglies under the races control though he heard footsteps coming down the corridor toward him he did not swing his eyes to see who was approaching that would have returned him to grim reality too abruptly to bear but then the maker of those footsteps stopped outside his cell teerts quickly put fantasy aside like a male saving a computer document so he can attend to something more urgent his bow was deeper than the one hed given the guard who fed him konichiwa major okamoto he said in the nipponese he was slowly acquiring good day to you as well okamoto answered in the language of the race he was more fluent in it than teerts was in nipponese learning a new tongue did not come naturally to males of the race the empire had had but one for untold thousands of years but tosev was a mosaic of dozens maybe hundreds of languages picking up one more was nothing out of the ordinary for a big ugly okamoto had been teerts interpreter and interrogator ever since he was captured the tosevite glanced down the hall teerts heard jingling keys as a warder drew near another round of questions then the pilot thought he bowed to the warder to show he was grateful for the boon of leaving the cell actually he wasnt as long as he stayed in here no one hurt him but the forms had to be observed a soldier with a rifle tramped right behind the warder he covered teerts as the other male used the key okamoto also drew his pistol and held it on teerts the pilot would have laughed except it wasnt really funny he only wished he were as dangerous as the big uglies thought he was the interrogation room was on an upper floor of the prison teerts had seen next to nothing of nagasaki he knew it lay by the sea hed come here by ship after being evacuated from the mainland when harbin fell to the race he didnt miss seeing the sea after that nightmare voyage of storms and sickness he hoped hed never seemuch less ride uponanother overgrown tosevite ocean again the guard opened the door teerts walked in bowed to the big uglies inside they wore white coats rather than uniforms like okamotos scientists not soldiers teerts thought hed come to realize the tosevites used clothing to indicate job and status as the race used body paint the big uglies however were much less systematic and consistent about ittypical of them he thought nonetheless he was glad not to face another panel of officers the military males had been much quicker than scientists to resort to the instruments of painful persuasion in the interrogation room one of the men in white addressed teerts in barking nipponese much too fast for him to follow he turned both eye turrets toward major okamoto who translated dr nakayama asks whether as has been reported all members of the race who have come to tosev are male hai teerts answered honto yes that was the truth nakayama a slim male on the small side for a tosevite asked another long question in his own tongue okamoto translated again he asks how you can hope to keep tosev with males alone we dont of course teerts answered we who are here make up the conquest fleet our task is to subjugate this world not to colonize it the colonization fleet will come it was being organized even as we set out and will arrive in this solar system about forty years from now so long a gap should have given the males of the conquest fleet plenty of time to get tosev into good running order for the colonists it would have done just that had the big uglies been the preindustrial savages the race thought they were teerts still thought they were savages but worse luck they were anything but preindustrial all three nipponese in white started talking volubly at one another finally one of them put a question to teerts dr higuchi wants to know whether you mean your years or ours ours teerts said would he waste his time learning tosevite measurements yours is longeri dont remember how much so then this colonization fleet as you call it will arrive on our planet in fewer than forty years time as we reckon it higuchi said yes superior sir teerts suppressed a sigh it should have been so easy smash the big uglies prepare the planet for full exploitation then settle down and wait till the colonists arrived and were thawed out when at last he smelled mating pheromones again teerts might even have sired a couple of clutches of eggs himself raising hatchlings of course was females work but he liked thinking of passing on his genes so he could contribute to the future of the race the way things looked now this world might still be troublesome when the colonization fleet got here and even if it wasnt his own chance of being around to join the colonys gene pool wasnt big enough to be visible to the naked eyehe couldnt see it at any rate he had a while to think of such things because the nipponese were chattering furiously among themselves again finally the male who hadnt addressed him before spoke through major okamoto dr tsuye wishes to know the size of the colonization fleet as opposed to that of the conquest fleet the colonization fleet is not opposed to the conquest fleet teerts said clearing up the idiom took a couple of minutes then he said the colonization fleet is larger superior sir it has to be it carries many more males and females as well as what they will need to establish themselves here on tosev his answer produced more sharp colloquy among the nipponese then the one named tsuye said this colonization fleetis it ah as heavily armed as your invasion fleet no of course not there would be no need teerts corrected himself there was thought to be no need for including many weapons with the colonization fleet it was assumed that you tosevites would already be thoroughly subdued by the time the colonists arrived here we hadnt counted on your resisting so ferociously i hadnt counted on being shot down the pilot added to himself his words seemed to please the nipponese they bared their flat square teeth in the facial gesture they used to show they were happy major okamoto said all tosevites are brave and we nipponese the bravest of the brave hai teerts said honto the interrogation broke up not long after that okamoto and the guard who had waited outside escorted teerts back to his cell that evening he found small chunks of meat mixed in with his rice that had only happened a couple of times before flattery he thought as he gratefully swallowed them down had got him something mutt daniels looked at his hand four clubs and the queen of hearts he discarded the queen gimme one he said one kevin donlan agreed here you go sarge the new card was a diamond none of the other soldiers in the game would have known it from mutts face hed played countless hours of poker on trains and bus rides as a minorleague and briefly majorleague catcher and as a longtime minorleague manager hed played in the trenches in france too in the last war he didnt care to risk a big roll of money when he gambled but he won more often than he lost every so often hed stolen a pot on a busted flush too not tonight though one of the privates in his squad a big hunkie named bela szabo who was universally called dracula had drawn three cards and raised big when it was his turn to bet mutt pegged him for at least three of a kind maybe better when the action came round to him he tossed in his cards cant win em all he said philosophically kevin donlan who couldnt possibly have been as young as he looked hadnt learned that yet calling szabo was okay if you had two little pair but raising back struck mutt as foolhardy sure as hell dracula was holding three kings he scooped up the folding money son you gotta watch what the other guys doin bettern that daniels said like i told you you aint gonna win em all if nothing else years of managing in the minors had pounded that home as a law of nature mutt chuckled the life hed lived beat the hell out of the one hed have had if he hadnt played ball likely hed still be watching a mules hind end on the mississippi farm where hed been born and raised like trains in the distance shells rumbled by overhead everybody looked up though the roof of the barn where they sheltered held the sky at bay szabo cocked his head gauging the sound southbound he said those are ours probably landing on the lizards in decatur right now kevin donlan agreed a moment later he added whats funny sarge i reckon ive said i was managing the decatur team in the threei league when the lizards came mutt answered matter of fact i was on the train from madison to decatur when we got strafed right outside o dixon upstate this heres the closest ive come to makin it to where i was goin since and most of a years gone by now this herethe barnwas on a farm just south of clinton illinois about halfway between bloomington and decatur the americans had taken bloomington in an armored blitz now it was slow tough work again trying to push the lizards farther back from chicago more shells hissed through the sky these from the south goddamn the lizards are quick with counterbattery fire donlan said theyre dead on too mutt said i hope our boys moved their guns before those little presents came down on em the poker game went on by lantern light shelling or no shelling mutt won a hand with two pair lost expensively to a straight when he was holding three nines didnt waste money betting on a couple of others another american battery opened up this one a lot closer the thunder of the big guns reminded mutt of bad weather back home hope they blow all the lizards in decatur straight to hell szabo said hope one of em lands on second base at fans field and blows the centerfield fence out to where it belongs daniels muttered it was down each foul line at the decatur ballpark a reasonable poke but dead center was only a pain in the era to every commodore pitcher who took the mound smallarms fire rattled only a few hundred yards away some mis and springfields some from the automatic rifles the lizards carried before mutt could say a word everybody in the latest hand grabbed his money from the pot stuffed it into a pocket and reached for his weapon someone blew out the lantern someone else pushed the barn door open one by one the men emerged you want to be careful mutt said quietly the lizards have those damn night sights let em see like cats in the dark dracula szabo laughed also softly thats why i got me this here browning automatic rifle sarge put out enough lead and some of itll hit somebody he wasnt much older than donlan young enough to be gutsure no bullet could possibly find him mutt knew better france had convinced him he wasnt immortal and several months fighting the lizards drove the lesson home again spread out spread out daniels called in an urgent whisper to his ear the men sounded like a herd of drunken rhinos several were new recruits by virtue of having lived through several encounters with the lizards mutt was reckoned suitable for showing others how to do likewise how many lizards you think there are sarge kevin donlan asked donlan wasnt eager any more hed been through enough of the tough defensive fighting outside chicago to be sure his number could come up the question came in a tone of intelligent professional concern daniels cocked his head listened to the firing damfino he said at last not a whole bunch but i wouldnt peg it tightern that those rifles o theirs shoot so fast just a couple can sound like a platoon off to one side lay the concrete ribbon of us a couple of soldiers charged straight down it daniels yelled at them but they kept going he wondered why they didnt paint big redandwhite bullseyes on their chests too he dodged from bush to upended tractor to hedgerow making himself as tough a target as he could that wasnt the only reason he fell behind most of the squad he had fiftyodd years and a pot belly under his belt though he was in better shape now than he had been before the lizards came even in his longgone playing days hed been a catcher so hed never moved what anybody would call fast he was panting and his heart thudded in his chest by the time he half jumped half fell into a shell hole at the edge of the american firing line somebody not far away was screaming for a medic and for his mother his voice was ebbing fast cautiously mutt raised his head and peered into the night to see if he could pick up muzzle flashes from the lizards rifles over there a yellowwhite flicker he raised his springfield to his shoulder squeezed off a round worked the bolt fired again then he threw himself flat again sure enough bullets cracked by just above the hole where he hid if he could pick up the lizards muzzle flashes they could find his as well and if he fired again from here he was willing to bet some turreteyed little scaly sharpshooter would punch his ticket for him the lizards werent human but they were pretty fair soldiers he scrambled out of the hole and crawled across cold ground over to something made of bricksa well he realized when he got behind it szabo was making a hell of a racket with that bar if he wasnt hitting the lizards he was sure making them keep their heads down even more warily than before daniels looked south again he saw a flash fired at it in the night it was the next closest thing to shooting blind no more flickers of light came from that spot but he never found out whether it was because hed scored a hit or the lizard moved to a new firing spot as hed done himself after fifteen or twenty minutes the firing faded the americans slowly moved forward to discover the lizards had pulled out just a recon patrol said another sergeant who like mutt was trying to round up his squad and not having much luck dont rightly recall the lizards doin a whole lot o that not at night and not on foot daniels said with a thoughtful frown aint been their style maybe theyre learning the other noncom answered you dont really know what the other fellows doing till you sneak around and see it with your own eyes yeah sure but the lizards they mostly fight one way mutt said dont know as how i like em learnin how to do their job better thatll mean they got more chance of shootin my personal private ass off the other sergeant laughed somethin to that pal i dont know what we can do about it though short of giving their patrols enough lumps to make em try something else instead yeah mutt said again he blew air out through his lips to make a whuffling noise this hadnt been too badjust a little skirmish as far as he could tell he didnt have anybody dead or even hurt but if the lizards were skirmishing outside of clinton it was liable to be a good long while yet before he saw decatur iii clipclop clipclop colonel leslie groves hated slowness hated delay with the restless passion of an engineer whod spent a busy lifetime fighting inefficiency wherever it reared its head and here he was coming into oswego new york in a horsedrawn wagon because the cargo he had in his charge was too important to risk putting it on an airplane and having the lizards shoot it down clipcop clipclop rationally he knew this slow safe trip didnt stall anything the met lab team traveling by the same archaic means he was using himself wasnt close to denver yet and couldnt work with the uranium or whatever it was that the british had fetched over to the united states from eastern europe clipclop clipcop riding alongside the wagon was a squadron of horse cavalry an antique arm groves had long wished would vanish from the army forever the horsemen were useless against the lizards as they had been for years against any earthly mechanized force but they did a firstclass job of overawing the brigands bandits and robbers who infested the roads in these chaotic times captain will we reach the coast guard station by sunset groves called to the commander of the cavalry unit captain rance auerbach glanced westward gauged the sun through curdled clouds yes sir i believe so only a couple more miles to the jake shore his texas drawl drew looks here in upstate new york groves thought he should be wearing confederate gray and maybe a plume in his hat too he was too flamboyant for olive drab that he called his horse jeb stuart did nothing to weaken that freewheeling image the wagon rolled past a wooden ballpark with a sign that read otis field home of the oswego netherlands canadianamerican league netherlands groves said with a snort hell of a name for a baseball team captain auerbach pointed to a billboard across the street in faded tattered letters it proclaimed the virtues of the netherland ice cream and milk company bet you anything you care to stake they ran the team sir he said no thank you captain groves said i wont touch that one otis field didnt look as if it had seen much use lately planks were missing from the outer fence theyd no doubt helped oswegians stay warm during the long miserable winter the gaps showed the rickety grandstand and the dugouts where in happierand warmertimes the opposing teams had sheltered stands and dugout roofs also had the missingtooth effect from vanished lumber if the netherlands ever returned to life theyd need somewhere new to play from long experience groves reckoned oswego a town of twenty or twentyfive thousand the few people out on the streets looked poor and cold and hungry most people looked that way these days the town didnt seem to have suffered directly in the war though the lizards were in buffalo and on the outskirts of rochester groves guessed oswego wasnt big enough for them to have bothered pulverizing it he hoped theyd pay for the omission on the east side of the oswego river stood the us military reservation with the earthworks of fort ontario the fort dated back even further than the french and indian war holding enemies at bay now unfortunately wasnt as simple as it had been a couple of centuries before the coast guard station was a twostory white frame building at the foot of east second street down by the cold choppy gray waters of lake ontario the cutter forward was tied up at a pier out in the lake a seaman policing up outside the station spied the wagon and its escort approaching he ducked into the building calling loudly the us cavalry just rode into town sir groves smiled at that in amusement and relief an officer came out of the station he wore a us navy uniform in time of war the coast guard was subsumed into the navy saluting he said colonel groves right here groves ponderously descended from the wagon even with wartime privation he carried well over two hundred pounds he returned the salute and said im afraid i wasnt given your namethe coast guardsman had two broad stripes on his cuffs and shoulder bladeslieutenant ah im jacob van alen sir the coast guardsman said well lieutenant van alen i gather the messenger got here ahead of us from what smitty yelled you mean yes sir he did van alen had an engaging grin he was a tall skinny fellow some where close to thirty very blond with an almost invisible little mustache he went on our orders are to give you whatever you want not to ask a whole lot of questions and never ever put your name on the radio im paraphrasing but thats what they boil down to it sounds right groves agreed youd be better off forgetting we even exist once were gone impress that on your sailors too if they start blabbing and any word of us gets out theyll be arrested and tried as traitors to the united states that comes straight from president roosevelt not from me make sure your people understand it yes sir van alens eyes sparkled if they hadnt told me to keep my big mouth shut id have at least a million questions for you youd best believe that lieutenant believe meyou dont want to know groves had seen the slagged ruin a single lizard bomb had made of washington dc if the lizards had that power the united states had to have it too to survive but the idea of a uranium bomb chilled him start throwing those things around and you were liable to end up with an abattoir instead of a world what you say has already been made very clear to me colonel van alen said suppose you tell me what it is you want me to do for you if the lizards werent in buffalo id have you sail me all the way to duluth groves answered as it is youre going to take me across to the canadian side so i can continue on the overland route to wherever youre going van alen raised a hand im not asking im just talking one thing i do need to know though whereabouts on the canadian side am i taking you its a biggish country you know i have heard rumors to that effect yes groves said dryly sail us across to oshawa they should be expecting me there if a messenger got through to you no reason to think one didnt make it to them youre right about that the lizards havent hit canada as hard as theyve hit us by all ive heard they dont care for cold weather now groves held up a broadpalmed hand i know i knowif they dont care for cold weather what are they doing in buffalo you beat me to it the coast guardsman said of course they did get there in summertime i hope they had themselves a hell of a surprise along around november i expect they did groves said now then lieutenant much as id like to stand around shooting the breezesomething he loathedi have a package to deliver shall we get moving yes sir van alen answered he glanced toward the wagon from which groves had got down you wont be bringing that aboard the forward will you or the horses what are we supposed to do for mounts without em captain auerbach demanded indignantly captain i want you to take a good look at that cutter jacob van alen said it carries me and a crew of sixteen now theres what maybe thirty of you folks okay we can squeeze you onto the forward especially just for one fast run across the lake but where the hell would we stow those animals even if we could get em on board groves looked from the forward to the cavalry detachment and back again as an engineer he was trained in using space efficiently he turned to auerbach rance im sorry but i think lieutenant van alen knows what hes talking about what is that lieutenant about an eightyfoot boat you have a good eye colonel shes a seventyeightfooter fortythree tons displacement groves grunted thirtyodd horses weighed maybe twenty tons all by themselves theyd have to stay behind no doubt about it he watched captain auerbach unhappily making the same calculation and coming up with the same result cheer up captain he said im sure the canadians will furnish us with new mounts they dont know what were carrying but they know how important it is auerbach reached out to stroke his mounts velvety muzzle he answered with a cavalrymans cri de coeur colonel if they took your wife away and issued you a replacement would you be satisfied with the exchange i might if they issued me rita hayworth groves let both hands rest on his protuberant belly trouble is she probably wouldnt be satisfied with me auerbach stared at him let out an amazingly horsey snort and spread his palms in surrender lieutenant van alen said okay no horses what about the wagon we dont need that either lieutenant groves walked over reached in and pulled out a saddlebag that had been fixed with straps so he could carry it on his back it was heavier than it looked both from the uranium or whatever it was the germans had stolen from the lizards and from the lead shielding thatgroves hopedkept the metals ionizing radiation from ionizing him i have everything required right here whatever you say sir what van alens eyes said was that the pack didnt look important enough to cause such a fuss groves stared stonily back at the coast guardsman here as often looks were deceiving regardless of what van alen might have thought he and his crew efficiently did what was required of them inside half an hour the forwards twin gasoline engines were thundering as the cutter pulled away from the dock and headed for the canadian shore as oswego receded groves strode up and down the forward curious as usual the first thing he noticed was the sound of his shoes on the deck he paused in surprise and rapped his knuckles against the cutter s superstructure that confirmed his first impression it s made out of wood he exclaimed as if inviting someone to contradict him but a passing crewman nodded thats us colonelwooden ships and iron men just like the old saying he grinned impudently hell leave me out in the rain and i rust get out of here groves said but when he thought about it it made sense a coast guard cutter wasnt built to fight other ships it didnt need an armored hull and wood was strong stuff apart from its use in shipbuilding the russians and england both still used it to build highly effective aircraft or so the mosquito and lagg were reckoned before the lizards came even so it had taken him aback here lake ontario had a light chop even groves hardly smooth on his feet effortlessly adjusted to it one of his cavalrymen though bent himself double over the port rail puking his guts out groves suspected the sailors ribbing would have been a lot more ribald had the luckless fellows friends not outnumbered them two to one and been more heavily armed to boot the forward boasted a onepounder mounted in front of the superstructure will that thing do any good if the lizards decide to strafe us groves asked the coast guardsman in charge of the weapon about as much as a mouse giving a hawk the finger when the hawk swoops down on it the sailor answered might make the mouse feel better for a second or two anyhow but the hawks not what youd call worried in spite of that coldblooded assessment the man stayed at his post the way the coast guardsmen handled their jobs impressed groves they knew what they needed to do and they did it without fuss without spit and polish but also without wasted motion lieutenant van alen hardly needed to give orders the trip across the lake was long and boring van alen invited groves to take off his pack and stow it in the cabin thank you lieutenant but no groves said my orders are not to let it out of my sight at any time and i intend to take them literally however you like sir the coast guardsman said he eyed groves speculatively that must be one mighty important cargo it is groves let it go at that he wished the heavy pack were invisible and weightless that might keep people from jumping to such accurate conclusions the more people wondered about what he was carrying the likelier word was to get to the lizards as if the thought of the aliens were enough to conjure them out of thin air he heard the distant scream of one of their jet planes his head spun this way and that trying to spot the aircraft through scattered clouds he saw the contrail thin as a thread off to the west out of rochester or maybe buffalo van alen said with admirable sangfroid do you think he saw us groves demanded likely he did the coast guardsman said weve been buzzed a couple times but never shot at just to stay on the safe side well crowd your men down below where they won t show and look as ordinary as we can for a while and if you wont leave that pack in the cabin maybe youll step in yourself for a bit it was as politely phrased an order as groves had ever heard he outranked van alen but the coast guardsman commanded the forward which meant authority rested with him groves went inside jammed his face against a porthole with luck he told himself the lizard pilot would go on about his business whatever that was without luck the throb of the engines was louder inside so groves needed longer to hear the shriek the lizard plane made that shriek grew hideously fast he waited for the onepounder on the foredeck to start banging away in a last futile gesture of defiance but it stayed silent the lizard plane screamed low overhead through the porthole groves saw van alen looking up and waving he wondered if the coast guard lieutenant had gone out of his mind but the jet roared away the scream of its engine fading and dopplering down into a deepthroated wail groves hadnt known he was holding his breath until he let it out in one long sigh when he couldnt hear the lizard plane any more he went out on deck again i thought we were in big trouble there he told van alen naah the coast guardsman shook his head i figured we were all right as long as they didnt notice all your men on deck theyve seen the forward out on the lake a good many times and weve never done anything that looks aggressive i hoped theyd just assume we were out on another cruise and i guess they did i admire your coolness lieutenant and im glad you didnt have to show coolness under fire groves said you cant possibly be half as glad as i am sir van alen answered the coast guard cutter sailed on toward the canadian shore in the midst of the treessome barebranched birches more dark pine and firthe icecovered lake appeared as suddenly as a rabbit out of a magicians hat by jove george bagnall exclaimed as the lancaster bomber ducked down below treetop height to make it harder for lizard radar to pick them up thats a nice bit of navigating alf all compliments gratefully accepted alf whyte replied assuming thats actually lake peipus we can follow it straight down to pskov from the pilots seat next to bagnall ken embry said and if its not we dont know where the bloody hell we are and well all be good and pskoved groans filled the earphones on bagnalls head the flight engineer studied the thicket of gauges in front of him it had better be pskov he told embry for we havent the petrol to go much farther oh petrol the pilot said airily weve done enough bizarre turns in this war that flying without petrol wouldnt be that extraordinary let me check my parachute first if you dont mind bagnall answered in fact though embry had a point the aircrew had been over cologne on the thousandbomber raid when lizard fighters started hacking british planes out of the sky by the score theyd made it back to england and gone on to bomb lizard positions in the south of francewhere they were hit embry had set the crippled bomber down on a deserted stretch of highway by night without smashing or flipping it if he could do that maybe he could fly without petrol after getting to paris and being repatriated with german help that still grated on bagnall theyd been assigned to a new lanc this one a testbed for airborne radar now the concept being deemed proved they were flying a set to russia so the reds would have a better chance of seeing the lizards coming ice ice close to a hundred miles of bluewhite ice with white snow drifted atop it from the bomb bay jerome jones the radarman said i looked up pskov before we took off the climate here is supposed to be mild the proof adduced is that the snow melts by the end of march and the ice on the lakes and rivers in april more groans from the aircrew bagnall exclaimed if thats what the bolshies make out to be a mild climate what must they reckon harsh im given to understand siberia has two seasons embry said third august and winter good job we have our flight suits on alf whyte said i dont think theres another item in the british inventory that would do in this weather below the lanc lake peipus narrowed to a neck of water then widened out again the navigator went on this southern bit is called lake pskov were getting close if its all one lake why has it got two names bagnall asked supply the answer and win the tin of chopped ham retail value ten shillings embry chanted like an announcer over the wireless send your postal card to the soviet embassy london winnersif there are any which strikes me as unlikelywill be selected in a drawing at random after another ten or fifteen minutes the lake abruptly ended a city full of towers appeared ahead some had the onion domes bagnall associated with russian architecture while others looked as if they were wearing witches hats the more modern buildings in town were scarcely worth noticing among such exotics rightheres pskov embry said wheres the bloody airfield down in the snowfilled streets people scattered like ants when the lancaster flew by through the bombers perspex windscreen bagnall spied little flashes of light theyre shooting at us he yelled stupid sods embry snarled dont they know were friendly now wheres that bleeding airfield away to the east a red flare rose into the sky the pilot swung the big heavy aircraft in that direction sure enough a landing strip appeared ahead hacked out of the surrounding forest its none too long bagnall observed its what weve got embry pushed forward on the stick the lancaster descended the pilot was one of the best he set the bomber down at the back edge of the landing strip and used up every inch braking to a stop the tree trunks ahead were looking very thick and very hard when the lancaster finally quit moving embry looked as if he needed to will himself to let go of the stick but his voice was relaxed as he said welcome to beautiful balmy pskov you have to be balmy to want to come here no sooner had the lancasters threebladed props spun to a stop than men in greatcoats and thick padded jackets dashed out of the trees to start draping it with camouflage netting groundcrews had done that back in england but never with such elan the outside world disappeared in a hurry bagnall could only hope the bomber disappeared from outside view as quickly did you see embry asked quietly as he disconnected his safety belt see what bagnall asked also freeing himself those werent all russians out there covering us up some of them were germans bloody hell bagnall muttered are we supposed to give them the airborne radar too that wasnt in our orders alf whyte stuck his head out from the little blackcurtained cubicle where he labored with map and ruler and compasses and protractor before the lizards came pskov was headquarters for army group north the lizards ran jerry out but then they left themselves when winter started its russian enough now for us to land here obviously but i expect there will be some leftover nazis as well isnt that wonderful by embrys tone it was anything but the cold hit like a blow in the face when the aircrew left the lanc they were an abbreviated lot pilot flight engineer bagnall doubled as radioman navigator and radarman no bombaimer on this run no bombardiers and no gunners in the turrets if a lizard jet attacked machine guns werent going to be able to reply to its cannon and rockets zdrastye ken embry said thereby exhausting his russian does anyone here speak english i do two men said one with a russian accent the other in germanic tones they looked suspiciously at each other some months of joint battle against a common foe had not eased the memory of what theyd been doing to each other before the lizards came bagnall had done some german before he left college to join the raf that was only three years ago but already most of it had vanished from his brain like most undergraduates taking german hed come upon mark twains the awful german language that he remembered especially the bit about sooner declining two beers than one german adjective and russian was worseeven the alphabet looked funny to bagnalls surprise jerome jones started speaking russianhalting russian but evidently good enough to be understood after a brief exchange he turned back to the air crew and said hesergei leonidovich morozkin there the chap who knows a bit of englishsays were to accompany him to the krom the local strongpoint i gather by all means let us accompany him then embry said i didnt know you had any russian jones the chaps who put this mission together had a better notion of what they were about than i credited them for i doubt that sir jones said unwilling to give raf higherups any credit for sense but he had reason on his side when i was at cambridge i was interested for a while in byzantine history and art and that led me to the russians i hadnt the time to do them properly but i did teach myself a bit of the language that wouldnt be in any of my papers though so no one would have known of it good thing its so all the same bagnall said wondering if jones was a bolshevik himself even if he was it didnt matter now my german is villainous but i was about to trot it out when you spoke up i wasnt what youd call keen on trying to speak with our soviet friends and allies in the language of a mutual foe the german who spoke english said against the eidechseni am sorry i do not know your word the russians call them yashcheritsiagainst the invaders from the sky no men are foes to one another against the lizards you mean bagnall and embry said together lizards both the german and morozkin the anglophone russian echoed the word to fix it in their minds it was one that would be used a good deal in days to come the german went on i am hauptmanncaptain auf englisch ja martin borcke as soon as the men of the aircrew had introduced themselves in turn morozkin said come to krom now get away from airplane but the radar jones said plaintively we do is in box da well yes but come morozkin said again at the far end of the airstripa long hard slog through cold and snowthreehorse sleighs waited to take the englishmen into pskov their bells jangled merrily as they set off as if in a happy winter song bagnall would have found the journey more enjoyable had his russian driver not had a rifle slung across his back and half a dozen german potatomasher grenades stuffed into his belt pskov had been built in rings where two rivers came together the sleigh slid past churches and fine houses in the center of town many bearing the scars of fighting when the germans had taken it from the soviets and when the lizards struck north closer to the joining of the two streams were a marketplace and another church in the market old women with scarves around their heads sold beets turnips cabbages steam rose from kettles of borscht people queued up to get what they needed not with the good spirits englishmen displayed on similar occasions but glumly resignedly as if they could expect nothing better from fate guards prowled the marketplace to make sure no one even thought of turning disorderly some were germans with rifles and coalscuttle helmets many still wearing fieldgray greatcoats others were russians carrying everything from shotguns to military rifles to submachine guns and dressed in a motley mixture of civilian clothes and khaki soviet uniform everyone thoughgermans russians even the old women behind their baskets of vegetableswore the same kind of thick felt boot the sleigh driver had on a pair too bagnall tapped the fellow on the shoulder pointed at the footgear what do you call those he got back only a smile and a shrug and regretfully tried german was sind sie comprehension lit the drivers face valenki he rattled off a couple of sentences in russian before he figured out bagnall couldnt follow his german was even slower and more halting than the flight engineers which gave bagnall a chance to understand it gutgegenkalt good against cold thanks uh danke ich verstehe they nodded to each other pleased at the rudimentary communication the valenki looked as if theyd be good against cold they were thick and supple like a blanket for the feet the sleigh went past a square with a monument to lenin and then diagonally across from it another oniondomed church bagnall wondered if the driver was conscious of the ironic juxtaposition if he was he didnt let on letting on that you noticed irony probably wasnt any safer in the soviet union than in hitlers germany bagnall shook his head the russians had become allies because they were hitlers enemies now the russians and germans were both allies because theyd stayed in the ring against the lizards they still werent comfortable company to keep the horses began to strain as they went uphill toward the towers that marked old pskov as the beasts labored and the sleigh slowed bagnall grasped why the fortress that was the towns beginning had been placed as it was the fortress ahead which he presumed to be the krom stood on a bluff protected by the rivers the driver took him past the tumbledown stone wall that warded the landward side of the fortress some of the tumbling down looked recent bagnall wondered whether germans or lizards were to blame the sleigh stopped bagnall climbed out the driver pointed him toward one of the towers its witcheshat roof had had a bite taken out of it a german sentry stood to one side of the doorway a russian to the other they threw the doors wide for bagnall as soon as he stepped over the threshold he felt as if hed been taken back through time guttering torches cast weird flickering shadows on the irregular stonework of the wall up above everything was lost in gloom in the torchlight the three furclad men who sat at a table waiting for him weapons in front of them seemed more like barbarian chieftains than twentiethcentury soldiers over the next couple of minutes the other englishmen came in by the way they peered all around they had the same feeling of dislocation as bagnall martin borcke pointed to one of the men at the table and said here is generalleutnant kurt chill commander of the nd infantry division and now head of the forces of the reich in and around pskov he named the raf men for his commander chill didnt look like bagnalls idea of a nazi lieutenant general no monocle no highpeaked cap no skinny hawknosed prussian face he was on the roundish side and badly needed a shave his eyes were brown not chilly gray they had an ironic glint in them as he said in fair english welcome to the blooming gardens of pskov gentlemen sergei morozkin nodded to the pair who sat to chills left are leaders of first and second partisan brigades nikolai ivanovich vasiliev and aleksandr maksimovich german ken embry whispered to bagnall theres a name id not fancy having in soviet russia these days lord no bagnall looked at german maybe it was the steelrimmed spectacles he wore but he had a schoolmasterly expression only partly counteracted by the fierce red mustache that sprouted above his upper lip vasiliev by contrast made the flight engineer think of a bearded boulder he was short and squat and looked immensely strong a pink scarmaybe a crease from a rifle bulletfurrowed one cheek and cut a track through the thick almost seallike pelt that grew there a couple of inches over and the partisan leader would not have been sitting in his chair he rumbled something in russian morozkin translated he bid you welcome to forest republic this we call land around pskov while germans rule city now with lizardsmorozkin pronounced the word with exaggerated carehere we make germansoviet councilgermansoviet soviet da bagnall thought the play on words came from the interpreter vasiliev even sans scar would not have seemed a man much given to mirth pleased to meet you all im sure ken embry said before morozkin could translate jerome jones turned his words into russian the partisan leaders beamed pleased at least one of the raf men could speak directly to them what is this thing you have brought for the soviet union from the people and workers of england german asked he leaned forward to wait for the answer not even noticing the ideological preconceptions with which hed freighted his question an airborne radar to help aircraft detect lizard planes at long range jones said both morozkin and borcke had trouble turning the critical word into their native languages jones explained what a radar set was and how it did what it did vasiliev simply listened german nodded several times as if what the radarman said made sense to him and kurt chill purred you have aber naturlich also brought one of these radar sets for the reich no sir embry said bagnall started to sweat though the room in this drafty old medieval tower was anything but warm the pilot went on our orders are to deliver this set and the manuals accompanying it to the soviet authorities at pskov that is what we intend to do general chill shook his head bagnall sweated harder no one had bothered to tell the raf crew that pskov wasnt entirely in soviet hands evidently the russians whod told the english where to fly the set hadnt thought there would be a problem but a problem there was if there is only one it shall go to the reich chill said as soon as sergei morozkin translated the germans english into russian vasiliev snatched up the submachine gun from the table in front of him and pointed it at chills chest nyet he said flatly bagnall needed no russian to follow that chill answered in german which vasiliev evidently under stood it also let bagnall understand some of what was going on the nazi had courage or at least bravado he said if you shoot me nikolai ivanovich colonel schindler takes commandand we are still stronger around pskov than you aleksandr german did not bother gesticulating with the pistol on the table he simply spoke in a dry rather pedantic voice that went well with his eyeglasses his words sounded like german but bagnall had even more trouble with them than he had in following kurt chill he guessed the partisan was actually speaking yiddish to stay up with that they should have kept david goldfarb as crew radarman captain borcke made sense of it he translated german says the wehrmacht is stronger around pskov than soviet forces yes he asks if it is also stronger than soviet and lizard forces combined chill spoke a single word bluff nyet vasiliev said again he put down his weapon and beamed at the other partisan leader hed found a threat the germans could not afford to ignore bagnall did not think it was a bluff either germany had not endeared itself to the people of any of the eastern lands it occupied before the lizards came the jews of polandled by among others a cousin of goldfarbshad risen against the nazis and for the lizards the russians might do the same if this chill pushed them hard enough he might too scowling at the two partisan brigadiers he said you may do this the lizards may win a victory through it but this i vow neither of you will live long enough to collaborate with them we will have that radar nyet this time aleksandr german said it he switched back to yiddish too fast and harsh for bagnall to follow captain borcke again did the honors he says this set was sent to the workers and people of the soviet union to aid them in their struggle against imperialist aggression and that surrendering it would be treason to the soviet state communist rhetoric aside bagnall thought the partisan was dead right but if lieutenant general chill didnt the flight engineers opinion counted for little and chill was going to be hardnosed about it bagnall could see that so could everyone else in the tower chamber captain borcke edged away from the raf air crew to one side sergei morozkin to the other both men slid a hand under their coats presumably to grab for pistols bagnall got ready to throw himself flat then instead he hissed at jerome jones you have the manuals and such for the radar am i right of course jones whispered back couldnt very well come without them not when the russians are going to start making them for themselves or they will if anyone comes out of this room alive which doesnt look like the best wager in the world how many sets have you got of the manuals and drawings you mean just the one jones said bugger that put a crimp in bagnalls scheme but only for a moment he spoke up in a loud voice gentlemen please if nothing else he succeeded in distracting the germans and partisans from the bead they were drawing on each other everyone stared at him instead he said i think i can find a way out of this dispute grim faces defied him to do it trouble was he realized suddenly the germans and russians really wanted to have a go at each other in english kurt chill said enlighten us then ill do my best bagnall answered theres only the one radar and no help for that if you hijack it word will get back to moscowand to london cooperation between germany and her former foes will be hampered and the lizards will likely gain more from that than the luftwaffe could from the radar is this so or not it may be chill said i do not think though there is much cooperation now when you give the russians and not us this set captain borcke nodded emphatically at that there was much truth in what the german general said bagnall was anything but happy about sharing secrets with the nazis and his attitude reflected that of british leaders from churchill on down but setting the wehrmacht and the red army back at each others throats wasnt what anyone had had in mind either the flight engineer said how is this then the radar itself and the manuals go on toward moscow as planned but before they dohe sighedyou make copies of the manuals and send them to berlin copies chill said by photograph if you have that kind of equipment here yes bagnall had been thinking of doing the job by hand pskov struck him as a burntout backwater town but who could say what sort of gear the division intelligence unit of the nd infantryor whatever other units were in the areahad available im not sure the higherups back home would approve but they didnt anticipate this situation ken embry murmured as for me id say youve managed to saw the baby in half king solomon would be proud i hope so bagnall said sergei morozkin was still translating his suggestion for the partisan leaders when he finished vasiliev turned to aleksandr german and said with heavy humor nu sasha it had to be more yiddishbagnall had heard that word from david goldfarb aleksandr german peered through his spectacles at chill the german having goldfarb in the aircrew for a while had made bagnall more aware of what the nazis had done to eastern european jews than he otherwise would have been he wondered what went on behind germans poker face how much hatred seethed there the partisan did not let on after a while he sighed and spoke one word da we shall do this then if chill was enthusiastic about bagnalls plan he hid it very well but it gave him most of what he wanted and kept alive the fragile truce around pskov as if to underline how important that was lizard jets streaked overhead when bombs began to fall bagnall felt something near panic a hit anywhere close by would bring all the stones of the krom down on his head through the fading wail of the lizards engines and the groundshaking crash of the bombs came the rattle of what sounded like every rifle and submachine gun in the world going off at once pskovs defenders nazis and communists alike did their best to knock down the lizards planes as usual their best was not good enough bagnall listened hopefully for the rending crash that would have meant a fighterbomber destroyed but it never came he also listened for the roar that would warn of a second wave of attackers that didnt come either anyone would think that flying more than a thousand miles would take us out of the bloody blitz alf whyte complained they called it a world war even before the lizards came embry said nikolai vasiliev shouted something at morozkin instead of translating it he hurried away to return a few minutes later with a tray full of bottles and glasses we drink to thishow you say agreement he said he was pouring mansized slugs of vodka for everyone when a partisan burst in shouting in russian uhoh jerome jones said i didnt catch all of that but i didnt care for what i understood morozkin turned to the raf air crew i havebad news thosehow you say lizards they bomb your plane is wreck and ruinis that what you say thats what we say embry answered dully nichevo tovarishchi morozkin said he didnt translate that maybe because it was so completely russian that doing so never occurred to him what did he say bagnall demanded of jerome jones it cant be helped comradessomething like that the radarman answered theres nothing to be done about it might be a better rendering bagnall didnt care a pin for fine points of translation were stuck here in bloody pskov and theres bloody nothing to be done about it he burst out his voice rising to a shout nichevo jones said science hall was a splendid structure a threestory red brick building on the northwest corner of the university of denver campus it housed the universitys chemistry and physics departments and would have made a fine home for the transplanted metallurgical laboratory from the university of chicago jens larssen admired the facility intensely there was only one problem he had no idea when the rest of the met lab team would show up all dressed up with no place to go he muttered to himself as he stalked down a thirdfloor corridor from the northfacing window at the end of that corridor he could see the platte river snaking its way south and east through town and beyond it the state capitol and other tall buildings of the civic center denver was a pretty place snow still on the ground here and there the air almost achingly clear jens delighted in it not at all everything had gone so perfectly he might as well have been riding the train in those dear vanished prelizard days he wasnt bombed he wasnt strafed he had a lower pullman berth more comfortable than any bed hed slept in for months he had heat on the train and electricity the only hint there was a war on was the blackout curtain on the window and a sign taped alongside it use it its neck an army major had met him when the train pulled into union station had taken him out to lowry field east of town had arranged a room for him at the bachelor officers quarters hed almost balked at thathe was no bachelor but barbara wasnt with him so hed gone along stupid he said aloud going along even once had got him tangled up again in the spiderweb of military routine hed had a taste of that in indiana under george patton the local commanders were less flamboyant than patton but no less inflexible im sorry dr larssen but that will not be permitted a bird colonel named hexham had said the colonel hadnt sounded sorry not one bit by that he meant larssens going out of town to find out where the rest of the met lab team was but why jens had howled pacing the colonels office like a newly caged wolf without the other people without the equipment they have with them im not much good to you by myself dr larssen you are a nuclear physicist working on a highly classified project colonel hexham had answered hed kept his voice low reasonable jens supposed hed got on the fellows nerves as well as the other way round we cannot let you go gallivanting off just as you please and if disaster befalls your colleagues who better than you to reconstruct the project larssen hadnt laughed in his face but hed come close reconstruct the work of several nobel laureatesby himself hed have to be superman able to leap tall buildings at a single bound but there was just enough truth in ithed been part of the project after allto keep him from taking off on his own everything is fine hexham had told him theyre heading this way we know that much were delighted youre here ahead of them that means you can help get things organized so theyll be able to hit the ground running when they arrive hed been a scientist at the met lab not an administrator administration had been a headache for other people now it was his he went back to his office wrote letters filled out forms tried the phone three or four times and actually got through once the lizards hadnt hit denver anywhere near the way theyd plastered chicago to a large degree it still functioned as a modern city when jens turned the switch on the gooseneck lamp on his desk the bulb lit up he worked a little longer then said the hell with it and went downstairs his bicycle waited there so did a glum unsmiling man in khaki with a rifle on his back he had a bike too evening oscar jens said dr larssen the bodyguard nodded politely oscar wasnt his real name but he answered to it jens thought it amused him but his face didnt show much oscar had been detailed to keep him safe in denverand to keep him from leaving town he was depressingly good at his job larssen rode north up university turned right toward lowry field oscar stuck to the physicist like a burr jens was in good shape his bodyguard he was convinced could have made the olympic team all the way back to boq he sang im only a bird in a gilded cage oscar joined in the choruses but in the next morning instead of biking back to the university of denver larssen oscar in his wake reported to colonel hexhams office the colonel looked anything but delighted to see him why arent you at work dr larssen he said in a tone that probably turned captains to jello jens however was a civilian and a fedup civilian at that sir the more i think about my working conditions here the more intolerable they look to me he said im on strike youre what hexham chewed toothpicks maybe in lieu of scarce cigarettes the one he had in his mouth jumped you cant do that oh yes i can and im going to stay on strike until you let me get in touch with my wife security hexham began up and down up and down went the toothpick stuff security jens had wanted to say thathed wanted to scream itfor months you wont let me go after the met lab okay i guess i can see that even if i think youre pushing it too far but you as much as told me the other day you know where the met lab wagon train is right what if i do the colonel rumbled he was still trying to intimidate larssen but larssen refused to be intimidated any more this if you do unless you let me send a letterjust an ordinary handwritten letterto barbara you get no more work out of me and thats that too risky hexham said suppose our courier is captured suppose he is jens retorted im not going to write about uranium for gods sake im going to let her know im alive and in one piece and that i love her and i miss her thats all i wont even sign my last name no said hexham no said larssen they glared at each other the toothpick twitched oscar escorted larssen back to boq he lay down on his cot he was ready to wait as long as it took the fat man in the black stetson paused in the ceremony first to spit a brown stream into the polished brass spittoon near his feet not a drop clung to his handlebar mustache and then to sneak another glance at the lizards who stood in one corner of his crowded office he half shrugged and resumed by the authority vested in me as justice of the peace of chugwater wyoming i now pronounce you man and wife kiss her boy sam yeager tilted barbara larssensbarbara yeagersface up to his the kiss was not the decorous one first postwedding kisses are supposed to be she molded herself against him he squeezed her tight everybody cheered enrico fermi who was serving as best man slapped yeager on the back his wife laura stood on tiptoe to kiss sams cheek seeing that the physicist made a latin production out of kissing barbara on the cheek everybody cheered again louder than ever just for a second yeagers eyes went to ullhass and ristin he wondered what they made of the ceremony from what they said they didnt mate permanentlyand to them human beings were barbarous aliens well to hell with what they think of human beings he thought as far as he was concerned having fermi as his best man was almostnot quiteas exciting as getting married to barbara hed been married once before unsuccessfully and hed sometimes thought about marrying again but never in all the hours hed spent reading science fiction on trains and buses between one minorleague game and the next had he thought hed really get to hobnob with scientists and having a nobel prize winner as your best man was about as hob a nob as you could find the justice of the peacethe sign on his door said he was joshua sumner but he seemed to go by hootreached into a drawer of the fancy old rolltop desk that adorned his office what he pulled out was most unjudicial a couple of shot glasses and a bottle about half full of dark amber fluid dont have as much here as we used to dont have as much here as wed like he said as he poured each glass full but weve still got enough for the groom to make a toast and the bride to drink it barbara eyed the full shot dubiously if i drink all that ill just go to sleep i doubt it the justice of the peace said which raised more whoops from the predominantly male crowd in his office barbara turned pink and shook her head in embarrassment but took the glass yeager took his too careful not to spill a drop he knew what he was going to say even though he hadnt expected to have to propose a toast one leaped into his mind the moment sumner said hed need it that didnt usually happen with him more often than not hed come up with snappy comebacks a week too late to use them not this time though he raised the shot glass waited for quiet when he got it he said life goes on and knocked back the shot the whiskey burned its way down his throat filled his middle with warmth oh thats good sam barbara said softly thats just right she lifted the shot glass to her lips she started to sip but at the last moment drank it all down at once as sam had her eyes opened very wide and started to water she turned much redder than she had when the justice of the peace flustered her what should have been her next breath became a sharp cough instead people laughed and clapped anyhow joshua sumner said dont do that every day you tell me he had the deadpan drollness that goes with many large men who are sparing of speech as the wedding party filed out of the justice of the peaces office ristin said what you do here sam you and barbara you makehe spoke a couple of hissing words in his own languageto mate all the time an agreement that would be in english yeager said he squeezed barbaras hand thats just what we did even if i am too old to mate all the time dont confuse him barbara said with a cluck in her voice they went outside chugwater was about fifty miles north of cheyenne off against the western horizon snowcloaked mountains loomed the town itself was a few houses a general store and the post office that also housed the sheriffs office and that of the justice of the peace hoot sumner was also postmaster and sheriff and probably none too busy even if he did wear three hats the sheriffs office fortunately from yeagers point of view boasted a single jail cell big enough to hold the two lizard pows that meant he and barbara got to spend their wedding night without ristin and ullhass in the next room not that the lizards were likely to pick that particular night to try to run away nor being what they were that they would make anything of the noises coming from the bridal bed nevertheless its the principle of the thing sam explained as he and the new mrs yeager accompanied by cheering wellwishers from the met lab and from chugwater made their way to the house where theyd spend their first night as man and wife he spoke a little louder a little more earnestly than he might have earlier in the day when they found they were going to host a wedding the townsfolk had pulled out a good many bottles of dark amber and other fluids youre right barbara said also emphatically her cheeks glowed brighter than could be accounted for by the chilly breeze alone she let out a squeak when sam picked her up and carried her over the threshold of the bedroom theyd use and then another one when she saw the bottle sticking out of a bucket on a stool by the bed the bucket was ordinary galvanized iron straight out of a hardware store but inside nestled in snowchampagne she exclaimed two wineglassesnot champagne flutes but close enoughrested alongside the bucket thats very nice yeager said he gently lifted the bottle out of the snow undid the foil wrap and the little wire cage worked the cork a littleand then let it fly out with a report like a rifle shot and ricochet off the ceiling he had a glass ready to catch the champagne that bubbled out then finished filling it the more conventional way with a flourish he handed the glass to barbara poured one for himself she stared down into hers i dont know if i ought to drink this she said if i have a whole lot more i will fall asleep on you that wouldnt be right wedding nights are supposed to be special any night with you is special he said which made her smile but then he went on more seriously we ought to drink it especially now that weve opened it nobody has enough of anything any more to let it go to waste youre right she said and sipped an eyebrow rose thats pretty good champagne i wonder how it got to the great metropolis of chugwater by god wyoming beats me yeager drank too he didnt know much about champagne he drank beer by choice and whiskey every so often but it did taste good the bubbles tickled the inside of his mouth he sat down on the bed not far from the stool with the bucket barbara sat down beside him her glass was already almost empty she ran a hand along his arm let it rest on his corporals chevrons you were in uniform so you looked fine for the wedding she made a face getting married in a gingham blouse and a pair of dungarees isnt what i had in mind he slid an arm around her waist then drained his glass of champagne and pulled the bottle from its bed of snow it held just enough to fill them both up again dont worry about it theres only one proper uniform for a bride on her wedding night he reached behind her undid the top button of her blouse thats the proper uniform for bride and groom both she said her fingers fumbled as she worked at one of his buttons she laughed seei told you i shouldnt have had that champagne now im having trouble getting you out of soldiers uniform and into bridegrooms no hurry not tonight he said one way or another well manage he drank some more then looked at the glass with respect that takes me to a happier place than i usually go when ive had a few or maybe its the company i like you sam barbara exclaimed for some reasonmaybe it was the champagne that made him feel better than if shed said i love you presently he asked do you want me to blow out the candles her eyebrows came together in thought for a moment then she said no let them burn unless youreally want it to be dark tonight he shook his head i like to look at you honey she wasnt a hollywood movie star or a vargas girl a little too thin a little too angular and if you looked at things objectively not pretty enough sam didnt give two whoops in hell about looking at things objectively she looked damn good to him he ran his hands over her breasts let one of them stray down her belly toward where her legs joined she stretched luxuriously and made a noise like a purring cat down deep in her throat his tongue teased a nipple she grabbed the back of his head pulled him against her after his mouth had followed his hand downward she rubbed at the soft flesh of her inner thighs i wish there were more razor blades around she said in mock complaint your face chafes me when you do that he touched her gently her breath sighed out she was wet i thought you liked it while it was going on he said grinning shall i get that rubber now wait she sat up bent over him and lowered her head it was the first time shed ever done that without being asked her hair spilled down and tickled his hipbones easy there he gasped a minute later you do much more and i wont need to bother with a rubber would you like that she asked looking up at him from under her bangs she still held him he could feel the warm little puffs of breath as she spoke he was tempted but shook his head not on our wedding night like you said it ought to be perfect and its for something else all right lets do something else she said agreeably and lay back on the bed he leaned over the side and pulled a rubber out of the back pocket of his chinos but before he could peel it open she grabbed his wrist and repeated wait he gave her a quizzical look she went on i know you dont like those all that much dont bother tonightif were going to make it perfect that will help it should be okay he tossed the rubber onto the floor he wasnt fond of them he wore them because she wanted him to and because he could see why she didnt want to get pregnant but if she felt like taking a chance he was eager to oblige it does feel better without overshoes he said he guided himself into her oh god does it their mouths met clung neither of them said anything then not with words i always said you were a gentleman sam barbara told him as he rolled off her you keep your weight on your elbows he snorted she said dont go away now i wasnt going anywhere not without you he put an arm around her drew her close she snuggled against him he liked that in some ways it seemed more intimate than making love you could make love with a stranger hed done it in a fair number of minorleague whorehouses in minorleague towns but to snuggle with somebody it had to be somebody who really mattered to you as if shed picked the thought out of his head barbara said i love you i love you too hon his arms tightened around her im glad were married that seemed just the right thing to say on a wedding night so am i barbara ran the palm of her hand along his cheek even if you are scratchy she added he tensed ready to grab her sometimes when she made jokes in bed shed poke him in the ribs not tonightshe turned serious instead you made exactly the right toast this afternoon life goes on it has to doesnt it thats what i think anyhow yeager wasnt sure whether she was asking him or trying to convince herself she still couldnt be easy in her mind about her first husband he had to be dead but still you have the right way of looking at things barbara said serious still life isnt always neat its not orderly you cant always plan it and make it come out the way you think its supposed to things happen that nobody would expect well sure yeager said the war made the whole world crazy and then the lizards on top of that those are the big things she broke in as you say they change the whole world but little things can turn your life in new directions too everybody reads chaucer in highschool english but when i did he just seemed the most fascinating writer id ever come across i started trying to learn more about his time and about other people who were writing then and so i ended up in graduate school at berkeley in medieval literature if i hadnt been there i never would have met jens i never would have come to chicago she leaned up and kissed him i never would have met you little things sam repeated ten eleven years ago i was playing for birmingham down in the southern association thats class a ball the second highest class in the minor leagues i was playing pretty well i wasnt that oldif things had broken right i might have made the big leagues things broke all right about halfway through the season i broke my ankle it cost me the rest of the year and i wasnt the same ballplayer afterwards i kept at itnever found anything id rather dobut i knew i wasnt going anywhere any more just one of those things thats just it she nodded against his chest little things things youd never expect to matter can turn up in the most surprising ways ill say yeager nodded too if i hadnt read science fiction i wouldnt have gotten chosen to take our lizard pows back to chicago or turned into their liaison manand i wouldnt have met you to his relief she didnt make any cracks about his choice of reading someone who dove into chaucer for fun was liable to think of it as the literary equivalent of picking your nose at the dinner table instead she said jens always had trouble seeing that the little things could makenot a big difference but a surprising difference do you see what im saying mmhmm yeager kept his answer to a grunt he didnt have anything against jens larssen but he didnt want his ghost coming between them on their wedding night either barbara went on jens wanted things just so and thought they always had to be that way maybe it was because his work was so mathematically precisei dont knowbut he thought the world operated that way too that sort of need for exactitude could be hard to live with sometimes mmhmm sam grunted again but something loosened in his chest even so he never remembered her criticizing jens before no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than she said i guess what im trying to tell you sam is that im glad im with you taking things as they come is easier than trying to fit everything that happens into some pattern youve worked out that calls for a kiss he said and bent his head down to hers she responded eagerly he felt himself stirring and knew a certain amount of pride if you couldnt wear yourself out on your wedding night when were you supposed to barbara felt him stirring too what have we here she said when the kiss finally broke she reached between them to find out yeagers lips trailed down her neck toward her breasts again her hand tightened on him his found the dampness between her legs after a while he rolled onto his back easier to stay hard for a second round that way especially if you werent in your twenties any more hed learned barbara didnt mind getting on top every so often oh yes he said softly as she straddled him he was glad she hadnt made him put on a rubber tonight you could feel so much more without one he ran his fingers lightly down the smooth curve of her back she shivered a little afterwards she didnt pull away but sprawled down on top of him he kissed her cheek and the very corner of her mouth nice she said her voice sleepy i just want to stay right here forever he put his arms around her thats what i want too hon oscar appeared in the doorway of jens larssens boq room colonel hexham wants to see you sir right away does he larssen had been sprawled out on the cot reading the newest issue of timenow getting on toward a year oldhe could find he got up in a hurry ill come he hadnt been sir to oscar since hed gone on strike not till now maybe that was a good sign he didnt think so when the guard escorted him back into the colonels office hexhams toothpick was going back and forth like a metronome his bulldog face pinched and sour so you wont do any work unless you write your miserable letter eh he ground out never opening his mouth wide enough for the toothpick to fall out thats right jens saidnot defiantly but more as if stating a law of nature then write it hexham looked more unhappy than ever he shoved a sheet of paper and a pencil across the desk at jens thank you sir larssen exclaimed taking them gladly as he started to write he asked what made you change your mind orders hexham bit the word off so youve been overruled have you jens thought as he let the pencil race joyously across the paper trying to get a little of his own back the colonel went on i will read that letter when youre done with it no last names no other breaches of security will be permitted thats fine sir ill go back to science hall the minute im done here larssen scrawled love jens and handed the paper back to colonel hexham he didnt bother waiting for hexham to read it but started out to keep his end of the bargain if you worked at it he thought you could make things go the way they were supposed to iv bobby fiore almost wished he was still on the lizards spaceship for one thing as far as he was concerned the food had been better up there for another all the human beings on the spaceship had been aliens guinea pigs plopped down in the middle of god only knew how many chinamen he was the alien in this refugee camp his lips quirked wryly im the only guinea here too he said out loud speaking english even to himself felt good he didnt get much chance to do it these days even less than hed had when he was up in space some of the lizards there had understood him here nobody did if the lizard camp guards spoke any human languagenot all of them didit was chinese only liu han knew any english at all his face set in a frown he hated depending on a woman it made him feel as if he were eight years old again and back in pittsburgh with his mama he couldnt help it though except for liu han nobody for miles around could speak with him he rubbed his chin he needed a shave the first thing hed done when the lizards dumped him here was get a razor and get rid of his beard not only did shaving make him stand out less from everybody else a razor was a handy thing to have in a fight hed seen enough barroom brawls to know that hed been in a few too the funny thing was how little notice he drew he wore wide legged pants and baggy shirts that reminded him of pajamas the same as the chinese even with them he was cold a lot of the timeand he wasnt used to that after the spaceship either which helped him fit in a lot of the locals were too busy to pay him any mind too they made stuff for the lizards out of straw and wicker and leather and scrap metal and god only knew what all else and they worked hard but what really surprised him was that his looks werent so far out of place sure he still had his big italian nose his eyes were too round and his hair was wavy but eyes and hair were dark a blond like sam yeager would have stood out like a sore thumb and his olive skin wasnt that different from the color of the people around him as long as he stayed clean shaven he wasnt that remarkable im even tall he said smiling again back in the states fiveeight was nothing even here he wasnt huge but for a change he was bigger than average sudden shouts not far awayeven when he didnt speak the language fiore knew fury and outrage when he heard them he turned toward the sudden racket being taller than most let him see over the crowd a man was running his way with a hen under each arm behind him screeching like a cat with its tail stuck in a door dashed a skinny woman the chicken thief gained ground with every stride fiore looked down to the dirt of the street a nicesized rock lay there just a couple of feet away he snatched it up took a couple of shuffling steps sideways to get a clear shot at the man and let fly when he was playing second base for the decatur commodores hed had to get off accurate throws to first with a runner bearing down on him with spikes high here he didnt even need to pivot he hadnt done any throwing since the lizards took him up into space but hed played pro ball for a lot of years the smooth motion was still there automatic as breathing the rock caught the fellow with the chickens right in the pit of the stomach fiore grinned he couldnt have placed it any better with a bullseye to aim at the wouldbe thief dropped the chickens and folded up like an accordion his face was comically amazed as he fellhe had no idea what had hit him the two chickens ran away squawking the screeching woman started kicking the fellow whod swiped them she might have been better advised to chase them but she seemed to put revenge ahead of poultry the chicken thief couldnt even fight back hed had the wind knocked out of him and had to lie there and take it one of the chickens darted past fiore it disappeared between two huts before he could decide to grab it for himself damn he said kicking at the dirt i shouldve brought that home for liu han somebody elsealmost certainly not its proper ownerwould enjoy it now too bad he muttered hed eaten some amazing things since the lizards stuck him here hed thought he knew what chinese food was all about after all hed stopped at enough chop suey joints on the endless road trips that punctuated his life you could fill yourself up for cheap and it was usually pretty good the only familiar thing here was plain rice no chop suey no crunchy noodles no little bowls of ketchup and spicy mustard no fried shrimp though that made sense because he didnt think the camp was anywhere near the ocean not even fried rice for gods sake he wondered if the guys who ran the chop suey places were really chinese at all the vegetables here looked strange and tasted stranger and liu han insisted on serving them while they were still crunchy which meant raw as far as he was concerned he wanted a string beannot that there were any string beansto keep quiet between his teeth not fight back his mama had cooked vegetables till they were soft which made it gospel to him but liu hans mama had had different ideas he wasnt about to cook for himself so he ate what liu han gave him if the vegetables were bad the meat was worse papa fiore had known hard times in italy every once in a while hed slip and call a cat a roof rabbit roof rabbit seemed downright tempting compared to some of the things for sale in the camp marketplace dog meat skinned rats elderly eggs bobby had quit asking about the bits and strips of flesh liu han served along with her halfraw vegetables better not to know that was one of the reasons he regretted not grabbing the chickenfor once he would have been sure of what he was eating the woman quit kicking the chicken thief and started after the bird that hadnt come near fiore that hen had sensibly decided to go elsewhere the woman stopped screeching and started wailing what with all the racket she made fiore decided he was on the chickens side that wouldnt help the bird if it stayed anywhere in camp it would end up in somebodys pot pretty damn quick fiore picked his way through the crowded narrow streets back toward his hut he was glad he had a good sense of direction without it he wouldnt have gone out past his own front door nobody here had ever heard of street signs and even if signs hung on every corner they wouldnt have been in a language he could read liu han was chattering away in chinese with a couple of other women when he walked in they turned and stared at him half in curiosity half in alarm he bowed which was good manners here hello good day he said in his halting chinese the women giggled furiously maybe at his accent maybe just at his face as far as they were concerned anybody who wasnt chinese might as well have been a nigger they spoke rapidly to each other he caught the phrase foreign devil which they applied to those not of their kind he wondered what they were saying about him they didnt stay long after goodbyes to liu han and bows to himhe had been polite even if he was a foreign devilthey headed back to wherever they lived he hugged liu han you still couldnt tell she was pregnant when she wore clothes but now he felt the beginning of a bulge to her belly when they embraced you okay he asked in english and added the lizards interrogative cough at the end okay she said and tacked on the emphatic cough for a while the lizards language had been the only one they had in common nobody but the two of them understood the mishmash they spoke these days she pointed to the teapot used the interrogative cough mgoithanks he said the pot was cheap and old the cups even cheaper and one of them cracked the lizards had given them the hut and everything in it fiore tried not to think about what might have happened to whoever was living there before he sipped the tea what he wouldnt have given for a big mug of coffee with sugar and lots of cream tea was okay once in a while but all the time every day forget it he started to laugh why funny liu han asked up theretheir shorthand for the spaceshipyou eat my kind food most of the canned goods the lizards fed them with came from the states or from europe fiore made a horrible face to remind her how well shed liked them now i eat your kind food he made the face again but this time he pointed to himself a mouse scuttled across the floor huddled against the bakedclay hearth to get warm liu han didnt carry on the way a lot of american women would have she just pointed at it fiore picked up a brass incense burner and flung it at the mouse his aim was still good he caught the rodent right in the ribs it lay there twitching liu han picked it up by the tail and threw it out she said youshe made a throwing gesturegood yeah he said with their three languages and a lot of dumb show he told her how hed nailed the chicken thief the arm still works hed tried explaining about baseball liu han didnt get it she made the throwing gesture good she repeated he nodded this wasnt the first mouse hed nailed the camp was full of vermin it had been a jolt especially after the metallic sterility of the spaceship it was also another reason not to want to know too much about what he ate hed never worried about what health departments back in the usa did but seeing what things were like without them gave him a new perspective should make money arm so good liu han said not do like here god knows thats so fiore answered responding to the second part of what shed said most chinamen he thought scornfully threw like girls shortarming it from the elbow next to them he looked like bob feller then he noticed the key word from the first part money he didnt need much not in camp he and liu han were still the lizards guinea pigs so they didnt pay rent for the hut and nobody dared haggle too hard in the marketplace but more cash never hurt anybody hed made a little doing the hard physical workhauling lumber and digging trencheshed started playing ball to avoid and he won more than he lost when he gambled still mountebanks did well here among people starved for any other entertainment jugglers clowns a fellow with a trained monkey that seemed smarter than a lot of people fiore knew all the baseball skills he hadthrowing catching hitting even slidingwere ones the people here didnt use hed never thought about turning baseball into a vaudeville act but you could do it he bent to kiss liu han she liked thatnot just that he did it but that he made a production of it she needed to know he kept caring for her baby youre brilliant he said then he had to stop and explain what brilliant meant but it was worth it ussmak was unenthusiastic about leaving the nice warm barracks at besancon the cold outside made his muzzle tingle he hurried toward his landcruiser whose crew compartment had a heater well kill all the stupid deutsch big uglies as far as the eye can see then come back here and relax some more shouldnt take long hessef said the landcruiser commander let the lid to his cupola fall with a clang thats the ginger talking ussmak thought hessef and tvenkel had both tasted just before they started this mission ginger was cheap and easy to come by here in france theyd both laughed at him for declininghed used even more than they had while sitting around waiting for something to happen but he still thought combat was different the big uglies were barbarous but he knew they could fight hed had landcruisers wrecked around him hed lost crewmales and the deutsche were supposed to be more dangerous than the russki had been that was plenty to make him want to go at them undrugged tvenkel had sneered dont worry about it the landcruiser just about fights itself do what you want ussmak had answered ill taste plenty when we get back i promise you that he missed the confidence and exuberance ginger gave him but he didnt think he really was smarter when he tastedhe only felt that way a lot of tasters failed to draw the distinction but he thought it was there at hessefs blithe order he started the landcruisers engine part of a long column the big heavy machine rumbled out of the fortress and through the narrow streets of besancon big uglies in their ridiculous clothes stared as it went past some of the big uglies yelled things ussmak hadnt learned any francais but the tone didnt sound friendly males of the race aided here and there by tosevites in low flattopped cylindrical hats held back local traffic until the column passed by most of the traffic was big uglies on foot or on the twowheeled contraptions that used their own body energy for propulsion others sat atop animaldrawn wagons that seemed to ussmak something straight out of an archaeology video one of the animals let a pile of droppings fall to the street none of the big uglies rushed to clean it up none of them seemed to notice it was there hessef spoke to ussmak from the landcruisers intercom filthy creatures arent they they deserve to be conquered and were going to do it an unnatural confidence filled his voice but for the landcruisers only a couple of motorized vehicles moved in besancon both of them had big metal cylinders rising from the rear like tumors what are those things ussmak asked their engines no tvenkel answered the gunner went on theyre built to burn petroleum byproducts like tosevite landcruisers but they cant get those byproducts any more the gadgets you see extract burnable gas from wood theyre ugly makeshifts like most of what the big uglies do but they work after a fashion oh up in the fortress that overlooked besancon ussmak had grown used to smells hed never smelled before now that he saw what produced some of those smells he wondered what they were doing to his lungs the operations order said the landcruisers were to proceed northeast from besancon through the town however they rumbled northwest ussmak wondered if that was right but didnt say anything about it all he was doing was following the male in front of him you couldnt possibly get in trouble if you did that the male in front of himand all the males in the column right up to the lead driver who had to make his own decisionsproved to know what they were doing they rattled across a bridge to the relief of ussmak who wasnt sure it would take his landcruisers weight past the earthworks of yet another fort and then out onto a road that led in the proper direction ussmak undogged his entry hatch and stuck out his head driving unbuttoned gave him the best view even if the breeze in his face was chilly shouldnt be dangerous here he thought nothing even slightly out of the ordinary had happened since he came to besancon hed become convinced the area was thoroughly pacified up ahead something went whump ussmak recognized that noise from the sssr somebody had driven over a land mine sure enough landcruisers started going off the road on either side to get around a disabled vehicle from the commanders cupola hessef said ah will you look at that its blown the track right off him the ground to either side of the paved road was soft and soggy not surprising ussmak supposed since the highway ran parallel to the river that flowed through besancon he didnt think anything of it until a landcruiser and then another one bogged down in the muck from the woods to the north of the road came another sound with which ussmak had become intimately familiar in the sssr a sharp fast harsh tactactac he slammed the hatch with a clang theyre shooting at us he screamed thats an eggaddled machine gun thats what that is bullets ricocheting from the landcruisers composite armor underscored his words in the turret hessef shouted in high excitement i see muzzle flashes by the emperor there he is tvenkel right over there bring the turret aroundthats the way give him some with the machine gun and then a round of high explosive well teach the big uglies to fool with us ussmak let out a slow hiss of wonder hessefs sloppy commands werent anything like the ones that had been drilled into the landcruiser crews in endless days of simulator training and exercises back on home ussmak realized he was listening to the ginger talking again an adjutant monitoring hessef would have swelled up as if he had the gray staggers however unorthodox the orders though they accomplished their purpose hydraulics whirred as the turret smoothly traversed the coaxial machine gun opened up heard from inside the landcruiser it wasnt loud at all fool with us will they tvenkel yelled ill teach them this world belongs to the race he fired a long long burst not being turned toward the big uglies with the machine gun ussmak at first had trouble judging how effective tvenkels shooting was but then more bullets pattered off the landcruisers like pebbles thrown at a metal roof they did no more damage than pebbles would have but showed the tosevite gunners were still in business give em the real thing hessef said again thick armor muffled the cannons roar though the landcruiser rocked slightly on its treads as it took up the recoil there thats done it tvenkel said with satisfaction we put enough rounds on that machine gun so the big uglies running it wont bother their betters again as if to underscore his words bullets stopped hitting the landcruiser ussmak peered through his forward vision slits some of the other vehicles in the column were already moving ahead a moment later hessef said forward it shall be done superior sir ussmak released the brake put the landcruiser into low gear it rumbled forward he steered very close to the machine that had thrown a track keeping one of his own on the paved road to make sure he didnt bog down as soon as he was past the crippled landcruiser he sped up to try to recapture some of the time everyone had lost shooting at the big uglies and their machine gun hessef said not bad at all the column commander reports only two wounds neither serious and we obliterated those tosevites the ginger was still talking through him ussmak thought landcruiser crews shouldnt have taken any casualties from a nuisance machine gun besides which hessef was ignoring the disabled fighting vehicle and the delay that sprang from the little firefight if youd tasted ginger a while before such setbacks were too small to be worth noticing had ussmak tasted along with the rest of the crew he wouldnt have noticed them either without a particle of the herb in him though they bulked large he wondered just how clever he really was after a good taste from behind and to the left bullets clattered off the landcruisers rear deck and the back of the turret the big uglies at their machine gun had lived through the firestorm around them after all halt hessef screeched ussmak obediently hit the brake five rounds high explosive this time the commander ordered do you hear me tvenkel i want those maniacal males blown to bloody bits so do i the gunner said he and his commander agreed perfectly just as training said members of a landcruiser crew should the only trouble was that the tactic on which they agreed struck ussmak as insane the landcruisers main armament boomed again and again and hessefs was not the only crew that had halted through his vision slits ussmak watched several other landcruisers stop so they could pour fire down on the tosevites who had had the temerity to annoy them the driver wondered if their commanders were tasting too when the barrage was done hessef said forward in tones of selfsatisfaction ussmak obeyed again not much later the landcruiser column came to an enormous hole blown in the highway the big uglies cant stop us with nonsense like that hessef declared and sure enough the armored fighting vehicles swung off the road one by one the machine just in front of ussmaks rolled over a mine and lost a track as soon as it slewed to a stop a concealed tosevite machine gun opened up the landcruisers again returned fire with cannon and machine guns the column was very late reaching its assigned destination heinrich jager paced through the cobblestoned streets of hechingen up on a spur of the schwabische alb stood burg hohenzollern its turrets seen mistily through fog made jager think of medieval epic of maidens with long golden tresses and of the dragons that coveted them for their own dragonish reasons the trouble these days however was lizards not dragons jager wished he were back at the front so he could do something useful about them instead he was stuck here with the best scientific minds of the reich he had nothing against them on the contrary they were far more likely to save germanyto save mankindthan he was but they thought they needed him to help them do it and in that as far as he could see they were badly mistaken hed watched soldiers make the same kind of mistake if a detachment from the quartermasters office brought a new model field telephone to the frontline soldiers they were automatically seen as experts on the gadget even if the only thing they knew about it was how to get it out of its crate so with him now hed helped steal the explosive metal from the lizards hed hauled it across the ukraine and poland therefore the presumption ran he had to know all about it like a lot of presumptions that one presumed too much coming up the street toward him munching on a chunk of black bread was werner heisenberg in spite of the bread heisenberg looked very much the academic he was tall and seriouslooking with bushy hair combed straight back fluffy eyebrows and an expression mostly as now abstracted herr doktor professor jager said touching the brim of his service cap no matter how bored he was he remained polite ah colonel jager good day i did not see you heisenberg chuckled uneasily being taken for the traditional absentminded professor had to embarrass him not least because he really wasnt that way up till now hed always seemed plenty sharpand not just brilliant which went without sayingto jager he went on i am glad to find you though i must thank you again for the material you have given us to work with to serve the reich is my pleasure and my duty jager answered politely still if heisenberg had ever seen combat he didnt show it he could thank jager for bringing the explosive metal but he didnt really know what that meant or how much blood had been spilled to get him his experimental material he proceeded to prove that saying a pity you could not have fetched us a bit more theoretical calculations indicate the amount we have is marginal for the production of a uranium explosive another three or four kilos would have been most beneficial that did it jagers boredom boiled away in fury dr diebner had the courtesy to be grateful for what was provided rather than to complain about it he also had the sense sirjager loaded the title with scornto remember how many lives were lost obtaining it hed hoped to make heisenberg ashamed instead he flicked him on his vanity diebner ha he has not even his habilitation he is if you ask me more tinkerer than physicist he knows what war entails which is more than you seem to and by all accounts he and his group are further along than yours in setting up the apparatus to produce more of this explosive metal for ourselves after we expend what we procured from the lizards by no means is his work theoretically sound heisenberg said as if he were accusing the other physicist of embezzlement i dont care about theory i care about results jager automatically reacted like a soldier without results theory is irrelevant without theory results are impossible heisenberg retorted the two men glared at each other jager wished he hadnt bothered to greet the physicist by the expression on his face heisenberg wished the same thing jager shouted the metal is more real to you than the men who fell getting it he wanted to clout heisenberg down from his cloud make him glimpse however distantly the world beyond equations he also wanted to kick him in the teeth i tried to express to you a civil good day colonel jager heisenberg said in tones of ice that youreturn it to me with such such recriminations i can take only as the mark of an unbalanced mind believe me colonel i shall trouble you no further the physicist stalked off still steaming jager stalked too in the opposite direction he jumped and almost grabbed for his sidearm when someone said well colonel what was that in aid of dr diebner jager said you startled me he took his hand away from the flap of his holster i shall try not to do that again kurt diebner said i can see it might not be healthy for me where heisenberg looked like a professor diebner at first glance seemed more likely to be a farmer he was in his thirties with a broad fleshy face and a receding hairline which he emphasized by slicking down his dark hair with grease and combing it straight back he wore his baggy suit as if hed been out walking the fields in it only the thick glasses that showed how nearsighted he was argued for a different interpretation of his character jager said i had adisagreement with your colleague i saw that yes behind the glasses amusement glinted in diebners eyes i dont believe i have ever seen dr heisenberg so provoked he normally cultivates an olympian imperturbability i came round the corner only for the tail end of thedisagreement you said and was wondering what touched it off the panzer colonel hesitated since his compliments for diebner had helped set heisenberg off at last he said i was concerned that professor heisenberg did not ah fully realize the difficulties in getting this metal to you nuclear physicists so you could exploit it ah diebner turned his head peered this way and that unlike jager and heisenberg he was careful about who heard him speak his big thick spectacles and their dark rims gave him the air of a curious owl sometimes colonel jager he said when he was sure the coast was clear from the top of the ivory tower it is hard to see the men struggling down in the mud this may be so jager studied diebner and yetforgive me herr doktor professorit seems to me a colonel of panzers admittedly ignorant of all matter pertaining to nuclear physics that you too dwell in this ivory tower oh i do without a doubt diebner laughed his plump cheeks shook but i do not dwell on the topmost floor before the war before uranium and its behavior became so important to us all professor heisenberg concerned himself almost exclusively with the mathematical analysis of matter and its behavior you have perhaps heard of the uncertainty principle which bears his name im sorry but no jager said ah well diebner shrugged put me in charge of a panzer and i would be quickly killed we all have our areas of expertise my gift is in physics too but in experimenting to see what the properties of matter actually are then the theoreticians of whom professor heisenberg is among the best use these data to develop their abstruse conclusions over what it all means thank you you have clarified that for me jager meant itnow he understood why heisenberg had sneeringly called diebner a tinkerer the difference was something like the one between himself and a colonel of the general staff jager knew he didnt have the broad strategic vision hed need to succeed as a man with the lampassenthe broad red stripes that marked a general staff officeron his trousers on the other hand a general staff officer wasnt likely to have acquired the nutsandbolts knowledge often in the literal sense of the words to run a panzer regiment diebner said do try to bear with us colonel the difficulties we face are formidable not least because we are under such desperate pressure of time and strategy i follow jager said i wish i were back with my unit so i could use what i have learned to help hold the lizards out of the reich and let you complete your work i am badly out of place here if you advance our building of the uranium bomb you will have done more for the reich than you could possibly accomplish in the field believe me when i say this now diebner looked earnest like a farmer solemnly explaining how excellent his beets were if jager remained unconvinced that he could do anything useful here at hechingen he was about as valuable as oars on a bicycle he came up with a plan though one that made him smile diebner smiled back he seemed a very decent fellow jager felt a little guilty at going against him but only a little when he got back to his quarters he drafted a request to be returned to active duty on the space in the form that asked his reason for seeking the transfer he wrote i am of no use to the physicists here if confirmation is required please inquire of professor heisenberg he sent the request off with a messenger and awaited results they were not long in comingthe application got approved faster than he had thought possible diebner and a couple of the other physicists expressed regret that he was leaving professor heisenberg said not a word hed no doubt had his say to the office whod called or telegraphed about jager maybe he thought hed had his revenge as far as jager was concerned the distinguished professor had done him a favor yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil for thou art with me lodz constantly put moishe russie in mind of the twentythird psalm and of that valley lodz though had only walked into the valley not through it the shadow of death still lay over the town in warsaw thousands in the ghetto had died of starvation and disease before the lizards came starvation and disease had walked the streets of lodz too but the nazis hadnt let them work alone here theyd started shipping jews off to their murder factories maybe the memory of those death transports was what made lodz still seem caught in the grip of a nightmare russie walked southeast down zgierska street toward the balut market square to buy some potatoes for his family up the street toward him came a jewish policeman of the order service his redandwhite armband bore a sixpointed black star with a white circle in the center marking him as an underofficer he had a truncheon on his belt and a rifle across his back he looked like a tough customer but when russie tugged at the brim of his hat in salute the order service man returned the gesture and kept on walking emboldened russie turned and called after him how are the potatoes today the policeman stopped theyre not wonderful but ive seen worse he answered pausing to spit in the gutter he added we all saw worse last year isnt that the sad and sorry truth russie said he headed on down to the market while the order service man resumed his beat more policemen roamed the balut market square to keep down thievery maintain orderand cadge what they could like the underofficer they still wore the emblems of rank theyd got from the nazis that helped make lodz feel haunted to russie in warsaw the judenratthe jewish council that had administered the ghetto under german authoritycollapsed even before the lizards drove out the nazis its police force had fallen with it jewish fighters not the hated and discredited police kept order there now the same held true in most polish towns not in lodz here the walls of the buildings that fronted the market square were plastered with posters of balding whitehaired mordechai chaim rumkowski rumkowski had been eldestpuppet rulerof lodzs jews under the nazis somehow he was still eldest of the jews under the lizards russie wondered how hed managed that he must have jumped from the departing train to the arriving one at just the right instant in warsaw there were stories that hed collaborated with the nazis russie had asked no questions of that sort since he got into lodz he didnt want to draw rumkowskis attention toward him and his family for all he knew the eldest would turn him over to zolraag the local lizard governor he got into line for potatoes the lines moved fast the order service men saw to that they were fierce and fussy at the same time a manner they must have learned from the germans some of them still wore germanstyle jackboots too as with the ghetto stars on their armbands the boots raised russies hackles when he reached the front of the line such worries fell away food was more important he held out a burlap bag and said ten kilos of potatoes please the man behind the table took the bag filled it from a bin plopped it onto a scale hed had endless practice it weighed ten kilos on the dot he didnt hand it back to russie instead he asked how are you going to pay lizard coupons marks zlotys rumkies rumkies russie pulled a wad of them out of his pocket the fighter whod driven him into lodz had given him what seemed like enough to stuff a mattress hed imagined himself rich until he discovered that the lodz ghetto currency was almost worthless the potato seller made a sour face if its rumkies you owe me the potatoes would have cost only a third as many polish zlotys the next weakest currency russie started peeling off dark blue twentymark notes and bluegreen tens each printed with a star of david in the upper lefthand corner and a crosshatching of background lines that spiderwebbed the bills with more magen davids each note bore rumkowskis signature which gave the money its sardonic nickname the potato seller made his own count after moishe gave him the bills even though it came out right he still looked unhappy next time you come bring real money he advised i dont think were going to take rumkies a whole lot longer but russie waved to the ubiquitous portraits of the jewish eldest he can do what he wants in here the potato seller said but he cant make anybody outside think rumkies are good for anything but wiping your behind the merchants shrug was eloquent russie started back to his flat with the potatoes it was on the corner of zgierska and lekarska just a couple of blocks from the barbed wire that had sealed off the ghetto of lodzlitzmannstad the nazis had renamed it when they annexed western poland to the reichfrom the rest of the city much of the barbed wire remained in place though paths had been cut through it here and there in warsaw lizard bombs had knocked down the wall the germans made of course that barrier had looked like a fortification and most of this one didnt but something else went on here too the potato seller had said that rumkowski could do what he wanted inside the ghetto hed meant it scornfully but moishe thought his words held a truth he hadnt intended he had the feeling rumkowski liked being a big fish no matter how small his pond was at least there were enough potatoes to go around these days the lodz ghetto had been as hungry as warsaws maybe hungrier the jews inside remained gaunt and ragged especially compared to the poles and germans who made up the rest of the townsfolk they werent actively starving any more though from where theyd been a year before that wasnt just progress it felt like a miracle a horsedrawn wagon clattered up behind russie he stepped aside to let it pass it was piled high with curiouslooking objects woven out of straw what are those things anyway russie called to the driver you must be new in town the fellow pulled back on the reins slowed his team to an amble so he could talk for a while theyre boots so the lizards wont freeze their little chicken feet every time they go out in the snow chicken feeti like that russie said the driver grinned every time i see two or three lizards together i think of the front window of a butchers shop i want to go down the street yelling soup get your soup fixings here he sobered we were making straw boots for the nazis before the lizards came all we had to do was make em smaller and change the shape wouldnt it be fine to make what we wanted just for ourselves not for one set of masters or another russie said wistfully his hands remembered the motions theyd made sewing seams on fieldgray trousers fine yes should you hold your breath no the drive coughed wetly tuberculosis said the medical student russie had once been the driver went on itll probably happen about the time the messiah comes these days stranger ill take small thingsmy wifes not embroidering little eagles for luftwaffe men a kholereye on them to wear on their shoulders you ask me thats fine it is fine russie agreed but it shouldnt be enough if god had asked me when he was making the world im sure i could have done much better for his people unfortunately he seems to have been otherwise engaged coughing again the driver flicked the reins and sent the wagon rattling on down the street now at least he could go outside the ghetto more posters of rumkowski were plastered on the front of russies block of flats under his lined face was one wordworkin yiddish polish and german his hope had been to make the industrious jews of lodz so valuable to the nazis that they would not want to ship them to extermination camps it hadnt worked the germans were running trains to chelmno and other camps until the day the lizards drove them away russie wondered how much rumkowski had known about that he also wondered why rumkowski fawned so on the lizards when only horror had come from his efforts at accommodating the nazis maybe he didnt want to lose the shadowy power he enjoyed as jewish eldest or maybe he just didnt know any other way to deal with overlords so much mightier than he for the eldests sake russie hoped the latter was true shlepping the potatoes up three flights of stairs as he walked down the hallway to his flat years of bad nutrition and weeks of being cooped up inside the cramped bunker had taken their toll on his wind and on his strength generally he tried the door it was locked he rapped on it rivka let him in a small tornado in a cloth cap tackled him just above the knees father father reuven squealed youre back ever since theyd come out of the bunkerwhere theyd been together every moment awake and asleepreuven had been nervous about his going away for any reason he was however starting to get over that for he asked did you bring me anything sorry son not this time i just went out for food moishe said reuven groaned in disappointment his father pulled his cap down over his eyes he thought that was funny enough to make up for the lack of trinkets people sold toys in the market square how many of them though used to belong to children whod died in the ghetto or been taken away to chelmno or some other camp when even something that should have been joyous like buying a toy saddened and frightened you because you wondered why it was for sale you began to feel in your belly what the nazis had done to the jews of poland rivka took the sack of potatoes what did you have to pay she asked four hundred and fifty rumkies he answered she stopped in dismay this is only ten kilos right last week ten kilos only cost me didnt you haggle when he shook his head she rolled her eyes toward the heavens men see if i let you go shopping again the rumkies worth less every day he said defensively in fact its almost worthless period as if she were explaining a lesson to reuven she said last week the potato sellers first price for me was rumkies i just laughed at him you should have done the same i suppose so he admitted it didnt seem to matter not when we have so many rumkies they wont last forever rivka said sharply do you want us to have to go to work in the lizards factories to make enough to keep from starving god forbid he answered remembering the wagon full of straw boots making things for the germans had been bad enough making boots and coats for the aliens who aimed to conquer all mankind had to be worse although the wagon driver hadnt seemed to think so rivka laughed at him its all right i got us some nice onions from mrs jakubowicz downstairs for next to nothing that should cancel out your foolishness how does mrs jakubowicz come by onions i didnt ask one doesnt these days but she had enough of them that she didnt gouge me good do we have any of that cheese left moishe asked yesplenty for today with some left over for tomorrow too thats very good moishe said food came first the ghetto had taught him that he sometimes thought that if he ever got rich not likely and if the war ever ended which seemed even less likely hed buy himself a huge house live in half of it and fill the other half with meat and butter in separate rooms of course and pastries and all manner of wonderful things to eat maybe hed open a delicatessen even in wartime people who sold food didnt go as hungry as those who had to buy it the part of him that had studied human nutrition said cheese and potatoes and onions could keep body and soul together a long time protein fat vitamins he wished for something green but that would have been hard to come by in poland in late winter even before the war minerals unexciting food yes but food rivka carried the sack of potatoes into the kitchen moishe trailed after her the apartment was scantily furnishedjust the leftovers of the people who had lived and probably died here before his family came one thing it did boast though was a hot plate and lodz unlike warsaw even now had reliable electricity rivka peeled and chopped up a couple of onions moishe drew back a few paces even so the onions were strong enough to make tears start in his eyes the onions went into the stew pot so did half a dozen potatoes rivka didnt peel them she glanced over to her husband nutrients she said seriously nutrients he agreed potatoes in their jackets had more than potatoes without when potatoes were most of what you ate you didnt want to waste anything supper ina while rivka said the hot plate was feeble it would take a long time to boil water even after it did the potatoes would take a while to cook when your stomach was none too full waiting came hard without warning a huge bang rattled the windows reuven started crying as rivka rushed to comfort him sirens began to wail moishe followed his wife out to the front room it frightened me reuven said it frightened me too his father answered hed tried to forget how terrifying an explosion out of the blue could be hearing just one took him back to the summer before when the lizards had forced the germans out of warsaw and to when the nazis had pounded a city that couldnt fight back i didnt think the germans could hurt us any more rivka said i didnt either they must have gotten lucky moishe spoke as much to reassure himself as to hearten his wife believing they were safe from the nazis was as vital to them as to every other jew in poland bang this one was louder and closer the whole block of flats shook glass tinkled down on the floor as two windows blew in faint in the distance moishe heard screams the rising bay of the sirens soon drowned them out lucky rivka asked bitterly moishe shrugged with as much nonchalance as he could find if it wasnt just luckhe didnt want to think about that the deutsche got lucky kirel said they launched their missiles when our antimissile system was down for periodic maintenance the warheads did only relatively minor damage to our facilities atvar glowered at the shiplord though it was only natural that he try to put the best face on things our facilities may not be badly damaged but what of our prestige the fleetlord snapped shall we give the big uglies the impression they can lob these things at us whenever it strikes their fancy exalted fleetlord the situation is not so bad as that kirel said no eh atvar was not ready to be appeased how not they fired three more at our installations the next days and we knocked all of those down kirel said this is less wonderful than it might be atvar said i presume we expended three antimissile missiles in the process four actually kirel said one went wild and had to be destroyed in flight which leaves us how many such missiles in our inventory exalted fleetlord i would have to run a computer check to give you the precise number kirel said atvar had run that computer check the precise number shiplord is with them we can reasonably expect to shoot down something over three hundred of the big uglies missiles after that we become as vulnerable to them as they are to us not really kirel protested the guidance systems on their missiles are laughable they can strike militarily significant targets only by accident the missiles themselves are junk atvar finished for him i know this he poked a claw into a computer control on his desk the holographic image of a wrecked tosevite missile sprang into being above the projector off to one side junk he repeated sheetmetal body glasswool insulation no electronics worthy of the name it scarcely makes a pretense of being accurate kirel said i understand that atvar said and to knock it out of the sky we have to use weapons full of sophisticated electronics we cannot hope to replace on this world even at one for one the exchange is scarcely fair we cannot show the big uglies how to manufacture integrated circuits kirel said their technology is too primitive to let them produce such sophisticated components for us and even if it werent i would hesitate to acquaint them with such an art lest we find ourselves on the receiving end of it in a years time always a question of considerable import on tosev atvar said i thank the forethoughtful spirits of emperors pasthe cast his eyes down to the floor as did kirelthat we stocked any antimissiles at all we did not expect to have to deal with technologically advanced opponents the same applies to our ground armor and many other armaments kirel agreed without them our difficulties would be greater still i understand this atvar said what galls me still more is that despite our air of superiority we have not been able to shut down the big uglies industrial capacity their weapons are primitive but continue to be produced he had once more the uneasy vision of a new tosevite landcruiser rumbling around a pile of ruins just after the races last one had been lost in battle or maybe it would be a new missile flying off its launcher with a trail of fire and no hope of knocking it down before it hit kirel said our strategy of targeting the tosevites petroleum facilities has not yet yielded the full range of desired results i am painfully aware of this atvar replied the big uglies are better at effecting makeshift repairs than any rational being could have imagined and while their vehicles and aircraft are petroleumfueled the same is not true of a large proportion of their heavy manufacturing capacity this also makes matters more difficult we are beginning to get significant amounts of smallarms ammunition from tosevite factories in the areas under our control kirel said resolutely looking at the bright side of things the level of sabotage in production is acceptably low thats something anyhow up till now these tosevite facilities have produced nothing but frustration for us atvar said the munitions they turn out are good enough to damage us but not of sufficient quality or precision to be useful to us in and of themselves we cannot merely match them bullet for bullet or shell for shell as they have more of each ours then must have the greater effect indeed so exalted fleetlord kirel said to that end we have recently converted a munitions factory we captured from the francais to producing artillery ammunition in our calibers the tosevites manufacture the casings and the explosive charges our only contribution to the process is the electronics for terminal guidance something atvar said again but when our supply of seeker heads runs out in his mind that ugly smokebelching landcruiser came out from behind the pile of ruins again such stocks are still fairly large kirel said again we now have factories in italia france and captured areas of the u s a and the sssr beginning to turn out brakes and other mechanical parts for our vehicles this is progress atvar admitted whether it proves sufficient progress remains to be seen the big uglies unfortunately also progress worse still they progress qualitatively where we are lucky to be able to hold our ground i still worry about what the colonization fleet will find here when it arrives surely the conquest will be complete by then kirel exclaimed will it the more atvar looked ahead the less he liked what he saw try as we will shiplord i fear we shall not be able to prevent the big uglies from acquiring nuclear weapons and if they do i fear for tosev vyacheslav molotov detested flying that gave him a personal reason for hating the lizards to go along with reasons of patriotism and ideology ideology came first of course he hated the lizards for their imperialism for the efforts to cast all of mankindand the soviet union in particularback into the ancient economic system with the aliens taking the role of masters and reducing mankind to slaves but beneath the imperatives of the marxistleninist dialectic molotov also despised the lizards for making him fly here to london this trip wasnt as ghastly as his last one when he had flown in the open cockpit of a biplane from just outside moscow to berchtesgaden to beard hitler in his den hed been in a closed cabin all the waybut hed been no less nervous true the pe fighterbomber that had brought him across the north sea was more comfortable than the little u hed used before but it was also more vulnerable the u seemed too small for the lizards to notice not so the machine hed flown in yesterday if hed gone down into the cold choppy gray water below he knew he wouldnt have lasted long but here he was at the heart of the british empire for the five major powers still resisting the lizardsthe five major powers which before the lizards came had been at war with one anotherlondon remained the most accessible common ground large parts of the soviet union the united states and germany and its european conquests lay under the aliens thumb while japan though like england free of invaders was next to impossible for british german and soviet representatives to reach winston churchill strode into the foreign office conference room he nodded first to cordell hull the american secretary of state then to molotov and then to joachim von ribbentrop and shigenori togo as former enemies they stood lower on his scale of approval than did the nations that had banded together against fascism but churchills greeting included all impartially i welcome you gentlemen in the cause of freedom and in the name of his majesty the king molotovs interpreter murmured the russian translation for him big five conferences got along on three languages america and britain shared english while ribbentrop a former german ambassador to the court of st jamess was also fluent in that tongue that left molotov and togo linguistically isolated but molotov at least was used to isolationserving as foreign commissar for the only marxistleninist state in a capitalist world was good pariah training the envoys delivered their replies when molotovs turn came he said the peasants and workers of the soviet union express through me their solidarity with the peasants and workers of worldwide humanity against our common foe ribbentrop gave him a dirty look getting the nazis goat though was no great accomplishment molotov thought of him as nothing more than a champagne salesman jumped up beyond his position and his abilities churchills round pink face on the contrary remained utterly imperturbable for the british prime minister molotov had a grudging respect no doubt he was a class enemy but he was an able and resolute man without him england might have yielded to the nazis in and he had unhesitatingly gone to the support of the soviet union when the germans invaded a year later had he thrown his weight behind hitler then in the crusade against bolshevism hed once preached the ussr might have fallen cordell hull said its a good idea that we get together when we can so we can plan together the best way of ridding ourselves of the damned lizards as he had been at previous meetings molotovs interpreter was a little slower in translating for hull than he had been for churchill the americans dialect differed from the british english hed learned ridding ourselves of the lizards now is not our only concern shigenori togo said what could possibly be of greater concern to us ribbentrop demanded he might have been a posturing popeyed fool but for once molotov could not disagree with his question but togo said we also have now a future concern surely you all hold captives from among the lizards have you not observed they are all males of what other gender could warriors properly be churchill said molotov lacked the englishmans victorian preconceptions on that score female pilots and snipers had gone into battleand done wellagainst both the germans and the lizards but even molotov reckoned that a tactic of desperation what are you implying he asked of the japanese foreign minister under interrogation a captive lizard pilot has informed us that this enormous invasion force is but the precursor to a still larger fleet now traveling toward our planet togo replied the second fleet is termed if we understand correctly the colonization fleet the lizards intend not merely conquest but also occupation he could have created no greater consternation if hed thrown a live grenade onto the gleaming mahogany surface of the table in front of him ribbentrop shouted in german cordell hull slammed the palm of his hand down onto the tabletop and shook his head so that the fringe of hair he combed over his bald crown flailed wildly churchill choked on his cigar and coughed harshly only molotov still sat unmoved and unmoving he waited for the hubbub to die down around him then said why should we allow this to surprise us comrades he used the last word deliberately both to remind the other dignitaries that they were in the struggle together and to irk them on account of their capitalist ideology speaking through an interpreter had its advantages among them was getting the chance to think while the interpreter performed his office ribbentrop started off in german again a mark of indiscipline to molotovs mind then switched to spluttering english but how are we to defeat these creatures if they throw at us endless waves of attack this is a question you germans should have asked yourselves before you invaded the soviet union molotov said hull raised a hand enough of that he said sharply recriminations have no place at this table else i would not be sitting here with minister togo molotov dipped his head slightly acknowledging the secretary of states point he enjoyed twitting the nazi but enjoyment and diplomacy were two separate things the depths of space between the stars are vaster than any man can comfortably imagine and traveling them even near the speed of light takes time or so the astronomers have led me to believe churchill said he turned to togo how long have we before the second wave falls on us the japanese foreign minister answered the prisoner states that this colonization fleet will reach earth in something under forty of his kinds years that is less than forty of our years but by how much he does not know the interpreter leaned close to molotov i am given to understand that two of the lizards years are more or less equal to one of ours he murmured in russian tell them molotov said after a moments hesitation revealing information of any sort went against his grain but joint planning required this when the interpreter finished speaking ribbentrop beamed so we have twenty years or so then he said this is not so bad molotov was dismayed to see hull nod at that to them he concluded twenty years hence was so far distant that it might as well not exist the soviet unions five year plans forced a concentration on the future as did continued study of the ineluctable dynamics of the historical dialectic as far as molotov was concerned a state that did not think about where it would be twenty years from now did not deserve to be anywhere he saw intense concentration on churchills face the englishman had no dialectic to guide himhow could he when he represented a class destined for the ashheap of history but was himself a student of history of the reactionary sort and thus used to contemplating broad sweeps of time he could look ahead twenty years without being dizzied at the distance i shall tell you what this means gentlemen churchill said it means that even after we have defeated the lizards even now encroaching on the green hills of earth we shall have to remain comrades in armseven if not comrades in commissar molotov s senseand ready ourselves and our world for another great battle i agree molotov said he was willing to let churchill twit him without mercy if that advanced the coalition against the lizards next to them even a fossilized conservative like churchill was reminted in shiny progressive metal ribbentrop said i agree also i must say however that certain countries now preaching the gospel of cooperation would do well to practice it germany has noted several instances of new developments transmitted to us incompletely or only with reluctance while others at this table have shared more equally and openhandedly churchills bland face remained bland molotov did not change expression eitherbut then he rarely did he knew ribbentrop was talking about the soviet union but declined to feel the least bit guilty he was still sorry that germany had succeeded in smuggling even half his share of explosive metal back to his homeland that hadnt been part of the soviet plan and churchill couldnt be enthusiastic about sharing british secrets with the power that had all but brought britain to her knees minister ribbentrop i want to remind you that this notion of sending new ideas runs both ways cordell hull said you havent shared your fancy longrange rockets with the rest of us i notice nor the improved sights i hear tell about in your new tanks i will investigate this ribbentrop said we shall not be less forthcoming than our neighbors while you are investigating you ought to look into the techniques involved in your polish death camps molotov said of course the lizards have publicized them so well that i doubt many secrets are left any more the reich denies these vicious fabrications advanced by aliens and jews ribbentrop said sending molotov an angry glare that made him want to smilehed hurt the german foreign minister where it mattered and germany could deny all she pleased no one believed her then ribbentrop went on and in any case herr molotov i doubt whether stalin needs any instruction in the art of murder molotov bared his teeth he hadnt expected the normally fatuous german to have such an effective comeback ready stalin though killed people because they opposed him or might be dangerous to him the two categories over the years had grown closer together until they were nearly identical not merely because of the group from which they sprang the distinction however was too subtle for him to set it forth for the others around the mahogany table shigenori togo said we need to remember that while we were enemies we now find ourselves on the same side things which detract from this should be left by the wayside as inessential perhaps one day we shall find the time to pick them up once more and reexamine them but that day is not yet the japanese foreign minister was the appropriate man to speak to both molotov and ribbentrop as his country had been allied with germany and neutral to the soviet union before the lizards came a sensible suggestion hull said his agreement with togo meant something for the united states and japan had the same reasons for hatred as russians and germans molotov said as best we can then we shall maintain our progressive coalition and continue the struggle against the imperialist invaders at the same time seeking ways to share the fruits of technical progress among ourselves as best we can yes churchill said everyone else around the table nodded molotov knew the qualification would weaken their combined effort but he also knew that without it the big five might have balked at sharing anything at all an agreement with an acknowledged flaw was to his mind better than one that could blow up without warning they were keeping the fight alive past that little mattered now v the airraid siren at bruntingthorpe began to howl david goldfarb sprinted for the nearest slit trench above the siren came the roar of the lizards jets it seemed to grow impossibly fast bombs started falling about the time goldfarb dove headlong into the trench the ground shook as if it were writhing in pain antiaircraft guns hammered the lizard planes screamed past at just above treetop height their cannon were pounding too through everything the siren wailed on the jets streaked away the aa around bruntingthorpe sent a last few futile rounds after them shell fragments pattered down from the sky like jagged metal hail stunned half deafened filthy his heart pounding madly goldfarb climbed to his feet he glanced down at his watch bloody hell he muttered and then because that didnt have enough kick gevalt hardly more than a minute had gone by since the air raid warning began in that minute bruntingthorpe had been turned upside down craters pocked the runway one of the bombs had struck an airplane in spite of the camouflaged revetment in which it huddled a column of greasy black smoke rose into the cloudy sky goldfarb looked around oh bloody fucking hell he said the nissen hut where hed been studying how to fit a radar into the meteor jet fighter was just a piece of rubble part of the curved roof of corrugated galvanized iron had been blown fifty feet away the radarman scrambled out of the trench and dashed toward the nissen hut which was beginning to burn group captain hipple he shouted and then called in turn the names of the other men with whom hed been working a dreadful fear that he would hear no reply rose in him then one by one the heads of the raf officers popped up out of the trench close by the hut only the top of hipples cap was visible be really was very short that you goldfarb he called are you all right yes sir goldfarb said are you quite thanks hipple answered scrambling out spryly he looked around at the hut shook his head theres a good deal of work up in smoke im glad we salvaged what we did as the other officers got out he waved goldfarb over to see what he meant the bottom of the slit trench was covered with manila folders and the papers that had spilled out of them goldfarb stared from them to hipple and back again youall of youstopped to grab papers when the air raid alarm went off well the work upon which we are engaged here is of considerable importance dont you think hipple murmured as if he hadnt imagined doing anything but what hed done he probably hadnt had goldfarb been in the nissen hut with the others the only thing he would have thought about was getting to cover as fast as he could groundcrew men had already emerged from their shelters they swept and pushed chunks of tarmac off onto the winterbrown grass to either side of the newly hit runways or else tossed them into the craters the bombs had made others started dragging up lengths of pierced steel planking material to put over the holes until they could make more permanent repairs flight lieutenant kennan pointed toward the burning aircraft i do hope thats not one of our pioneers not in that revetment sir flight officer roundbush shook his head its only a hurricane only a hurricane kennan looked scandalized hed flown one during the battle of britain basil if it werent for hurricanes youd have had to trim that mustache of yours down to a toothbrush and start learning german the spitfires grabbed the glorythey look like such thoroughbreds after allbut hurricanes did more of the work roundbushs hand went protectively to the bushy blond growth on his upper lip i beg your pardon sir had i realized the hurricane stood between my mustache and wars desolation i should have spoken of it with more respecteven if it is as obsolete as a sopwith camel these days if possible kennan looked even more affronted not least because roundbush was in essence right indeed against the lizards a sopwith camel might have been of more use than a hurricane simply because it contained very little metal and so was hard for radar to pick up before kennan could return to the verbal charge group captain hipple said maurice basil thats quite enough they shuffled their feet like a couple of abashed schoolboys wing commander peary jumped back down into the trench started rummaging through file folders oh capital he said a minute later we didnt lose the drawings for the installation of the multifrequency radar in the meteor fuselage at the same time as goldfarb breathed a silent sigh of relief basil roundbush said i had to save those david would have smote me hip and thigh if id left them behind heh goldfarb said he wondered if roundbush was using that pseudobiblical language to mock his jewishness probably not he decided roundbush made fun of everything on general principles shall we gather up our goods and see who will give us a temporary home hipple said we shant have a hut of our own for a while now planes were taking off and landing on the damaged runways by that afternoon by then goldfarb and the raf officers were back at work in a borrowed corner of the meteorological crews nissen hut the inside of one of the temporary buildings was so much like that of another that for a few minutes at a time goldfarb was able to forget he wasnt where he had been the telephone rang one of the weathermen picked it up then held it out to hipple call for you group captain thank you the jet engine specialist took the phone said hipple here he listened for a couple of minutes then said oh thats firstrate yes well be looking forward to receiving it tomorrow morning some time you say yes that will do splendidly thanks so much for calling goodbye what was that in aid of wing commander peary asked there may be some justice in the world after all julian hipple answered one of the lizard jets which strafed this base was later brought down by antiaircraft fire north of leicester the aircraft did not burn upon impact and damage was less extensive than in most other cases where we have been fortunate enough to strike a blow against the lizards an engine and the radar will be sent here for our examination thats wonderful goldfarb exclaimed his words were partly drowned by similar ones from the other members of his team and from the meteorologists as well what happened to the pilot basil roundbush asked adding nothing good i hope i was told he used one of the lizards exploding seats to get free of the aircraft but he has been captured by home guards hipple answered perhaps it might be wise for me to seek to have him placed here so we can draw on his knowledge of the parts of his aircraft once he gains some command of english ive heard the lizards sing like birds once they get to the point where they can talk roundbush said theyre supposed to be even worse than the italians for that its odd if you ask me maurice kennan walked into the trap whys that because they all come with stiff upper lips of course roundbush grinned youre one of the brightest britain has to offer kennan said groaning god save us all goldfarb groaned toobasil roundbush would have been disappointed if he hadntbut he was also smiling hed seen this kind of chaffing at the radar station in dover at the height of the battle of britain and then again with the lancaster crew testing airborne radar it made men work better together lessened their friction against one another some like group captain hipple didnt need such social lubrication but most mere mortals did they labored on until well past eight trying to make up for time lost to the lizard raid they didnt catch up goldfarb spent most of his time looking for the papers he needed and didnt always find them the other four men being more concerned with engines than radar had grabbed those file folders first and his as an afterthought when fred hipple yawned and stood up from his stool that was a signal for everyone else to knock off too if hed had enough they didnt need to be ashamed to show they were worn goldfarb felt it in the shoulders and in the small of the back hipple a man of uncommon rectitude headed for the refectory and then presumably for his cotsuch at least was his usual habit goldfarb though had had a bellyfulin both the literal and figurative senses of the wordof the food the raf kitchens turned out after a while stewed meat when there was meat soya links stewed potatoes and cabbage dumplings the size shape and consistency of billiard balls and stewed prunes got to be too much he climbed onto his bicycle and headed for nearby bruntingthorpe nor was he surprised to hear the rattling squeak of another bicycles imperfectly oiled chain right behind him looking back over his shoulder in the darkness would have been an invitation to go straight over the handlebars instead he called a friend in need basil roundbushs chuckle came ahead to him the flight officer finished the catch phrase is a friend indeed a few minutes later they both pulled up in front of a friend in need the only pub bruntingthorpe boasted without the raf aerodrome just outside the hamlet the place would not have had enough customers to stay open as things were it flourished so did the fishandchips shop next door though goldfarb fought shy of that one because of the big tins of lard that showed up in its refuse bins he was not nearly so rigid in his orthodox faith as his parents but eating chips fried in pigs fat was more than he could stomach two pints of bitter roundbush called the publican poured them from his pitcher passed them across the bar in exchange for silver roundbush raised his pint pot in salute to goldfarb confusion to the lizards they both drained their pints the beer was not what it had been before the war after the first or second pint though you stopped noticing following immemorial custom goldfarb bought the second round no confusion to us tomorrow when they fetch the damaged goods he declared he said no more not off the base ill drink to that by god roundbush said and proved it the more we can learn about how they do what they do the better our chance of keeping them from doing it the innkeeper leaned across the waxed oak surface of the bar ive still got half a roasted capon in the back room lads he said in a confidential voice four and six if youre interested the slap of coins on the bar gave his sentence its end punctuation light meat or dark goldfarb asked when the bird appeared as an officer roundbush had the right to choose i fancy breasts more than legs roundbush answered and added after the perfect tiny pause and i like light meat better too so did goldfarb but he ate the dark without complaint it was vastly better than anything they made back at the aerodrome the two raf men each bought another round then regretfully they rode back to the base keeping bicycles on a steady course seemed complicated after four pints of even bad bitter the headache goldfarb had the next morning told him he probably shouldnt have drunk the last one basil roundbush looked disgustingly fresh goldfarb did his best to keep group captain hipple from noticing he was hung over he thought he succeeded and got help because no one was working at his best not only because of yesterdays raid but also because everyone was looking forward to examining the wreckage from the lizard plane said wreckage did not arrive until nearly eleven which put everyone even the patient mildmannered hipple on edge when it finally happened though the arrival was a portent the fragments came to bruntingthorpe aboard a pair of x gmc trucks the big rumbling american machines seemed to goldfarb almost as great a prodigy as the cargo they bore next to them the british lorries he was used to were awkward makeshifts timid and underpowered if the lizards hadnt come thousands of these broadshouldered bruisers would have been hauling men and equipment all around england as it was only the earliest handful of arrivals were working here the yanks had more urgent use for the rest on their own side of the atlantic that a couple of the precious american lorries had been entrusted with their present cargo spoke volumes about how important the raf reckoned it the lorries also boasted winches which helped get the pieces out of the cargo compartments radar and engine especially the latter were too heavy for convenient manhandling we have to get these under cover as quickly as we can hipple said we dont want lizard reconnaissance aircraft noting that were trying to learn their secrets even as he spoke men from the groundcrew were draping camouflage netting over the wreckage before long it looked pretty much like meadow from above goldfarb said theyll expect us to rebuild the nissen hut they wrecked yesterday when we do it might be worthwhile to move this gear into it that way the lizards wont be able to tell we have it very good suggestion david hipple said beaming i expect well do that as soon as we have the opportunity yet no matter how quickly they can run up a nissen hut we shant wait for them i want to attack these beasts as rapidly as possible as im certain you do also there hipple was right even though it was gloomy under the netting goldfarb got to work right away the lizard plane must have come down on its belly rather than nose first a happy accident that had indeed kept it from being too badly smashed up part of the streamlined nose assembly remained in place in front of the parabolic radar antenna the antenna itself had escaped crumpling it was smaller than goldfarb had expected for that matter the whole unit was smaller than hed expected the lizards had mounted it in front of their pilotthat was obvious it was good design goldfarb wished the set that would go into the meteor was small enough to imitate it some of the sheet metal around the radar had torn peering through a gap goldfarb saw bundles of wires with brightcolored insulation coded somehow he thought wishing he knew which color meant what even wrecked the finish of the lizard aircraft was very fine welds were smooth and flat rivets countersunk so their heads lay flush with the metal skin even tugging with pliers at a tear in the metal to widen it so he could reach inside felt like tampering to goldfarb behind the radar antenna lay the magnetron he recognized the curved shape of its housing it was the last piece of apparatus he did recognize things that looked like screws held it to the rest of the unit they did not however have conventional heads instead of openings for a flatblade or phillipshead screwdriver they had square cavities sunk into the centers of the heads goldfarb rummaged through the tools on his belt till he found a flatblade screwdriver whose blade fit across the diagonal of one of the lizard screws he turned it nothing happened he gave the screw a hard look that quickly turned speculative and tried to turn it the other way it began to come out bad language was coming from the raf men working on the engine suspecting he knew why goldfarb called the screws are backwards to ours anticlockwise tightens clockwise loosens he heard a couple of seconds silence then a grunt of satisfaction fred hipple said thank you david lord only knows how long that would have taken to occur to us one can sometimes become too wedded to the obvious goldfarb fairly burst with pride this from the man who had designed and patented the jet engine almost ten years before the war began praise indeed he thought the bad language from the engine crew faded away as the officers got the casing off and started looking at the guts they use firtree roots to secure the turbine blades sir julian peary said indignantly pity you had so much trouble convincing the powers that be it was a good notion the lizards have had this technology in place rather longer than we have wing commander hipple answered despite long thwarting by raf indifference and even hostility he showed no bitterness and look basil roundbush said the blades have a slight twist to them how long ago did you suggest that sir two years three whatever hipples answer was goldfarb didnt hear it hed loosened enough screws himself to get off a panel of the radars case he had a good notion of what hed find inside since physical laws had to be the same all through the universe he figured the lizard set would closely resemble the ones he was used to oh it would be smaller and lighter and better engineered than raf models but still essentially similar valves after all remained valvesunless you went to the united states where they turned into tubes but the second he got a good look at the radar the flush of pride hed felt a little while before evaporated hipple and his team could make some sense of what they saw inside the jet engine the parts of the radar set remained a complete mystery to goldfarb the only thing of which he could be certain was that it had no valves or even tubes what took their place was sheets of grayishbrown material with silvery lines etched onto them some had little lumpy things of various shapes and colors affixed form said nothing about function at least not to goldfarb basil roundbush chose that moment to inquire how goes it with you david im afraid it doesnt go at all goldfarb knew he sounded like a bad translation from the french he didnt care hed found the simplest way to tell the truth pity roundbush said well i dont suppose we need every single answer this morning one or two of them may possibly wait until tonight goldfarbs answering laugh had a distinctly hollow ring mutt daniels drew the cloth patch through the barrel of his tommy gun you got to keep your weapon clean he told the men in his squad tellingeven orderingaccomplished only so much leading by example worked better kevin donlan obediently started in on his rifle he obeyed daniels like a father or maybe mutt thought uneasily like a grandfatherhe was old enough to be the kids grandfather if he and his hypothetical child had started early other than that though he had a soldiers ingrained suspicion of anyone of higher rank than his ownwhich in his case meant just about the whole army he asked sarge what are we doing in mount pulaski anyways daniels paused in his cleaning to consider that he wished he had a chaw working the wad of tobacco in his mouth always helped him think he hadnt come across one in a long time though he said near as i can see somebody looked at a map saw mount and figured this here was high ground hell of a mountain aint it the men laughed mount pulaski was on higher ground than the surrounding hamletsby twenty thirty sometimes even fifty or sixty feet it hardly seemed worth having spent lives to take the place even if it did also sit at the junction of state roads and bela szabo said they finally figured out we werent about to take decatur so they figured theyd move us someplace new and see how many casualties we can take here szabo wasnt much older than kevin donlan but had a couple of extra lifetimes worth of cynicism under his belt but mutt shook his head nash that aint it dracula what theyre really after is seein how many fancy oldtime buildings they can blow to hell theyre gettin right good at it too the mount pulaski courthouse was his case in point here almost a hundred years old it was a twostory greek revival building of redbrown brick with a plain classical pediment or rather it had been after a couple of artillery hits more of it was rubble than building but enough still stood to show it would have been worth saving you boys hungry a woman called ive got some ducks and some fried trout here if you are she held up a big wicker picnic basket yes maam mutt said enthusiastically beats the shpants off what the army feeds uswhen they feed us quartermaster arrangements had gone to hell what with the lizards hitting supply lines whenever they could if it hadnt been for the kindness of locals daniels and his men would have gone hungry a lot more than they did the woman came up to the front porch of the wrecked house where the squad was sitting none of the young soldiers paid her any particular mindshe was a year or two past forty with a tired face and mousebrown hair streaked with gray their attention was on the basket she carried springfields and ms still came with bayonets even if nobody was likely to use them in combat any more they turned out to make firstrate duck carvers though the roast ducks were greasy and gamy mutt still ate duck in preference to trout the only fish he cared for was catfish mighty fine maam kevin donlan said licking his fingers whered you come by all this good stuff anyhow up in lincoln lakes six seven miles north of here she answered they arent real lakes just gravel pits filled with water but they re stocked with fish and i can use a shotgun found that out mutt said his teeth had stumbled on birdshot a couple of times you could break one that way if you werent lucky he tossed aside a leg bone gnawed bare then went on mighty kind of you to go to so much trouble for us uhhis eyes flicked to her left hand to see if she wore a ringmiss im lucille potter she answered whats your name pleased to meet you miss lucille he said im muh pete daniels he thought of himself as mutt these days he had for years but that didnt seem the right way to introduce yourself to a woman youd just met the kids might ignore herthey were younger than most of the players hed managedbut she didnt look half bad to him only trouble was the kids wouldnt let him get away with being pete some of them started rolling in the dirt even kevin donlan snorted lucille looked from one of them to the next whats so funny she asked resignedly daniels said my names pete but they usually call me mutt is that what youd rather be called she asked when he nodded she went on why didnt you say so then theres nothing wrong with that her brisk tones made a couple of the soldiers look abashed but more of them didnt care what she said even if she had brought them food the matteroffact common sense in her words made him eye her speculatively you a schoolteacher maam she smiled that made some of her tiredness fall away and let him see what shed looked like when she was twentyfive or so no she wasnt bad at all she said pretty good guess but you didnt notice my shoes they were whitean awfully dirty white nowwith thick rubbery soles youre a nurse mutt said lucille potter nodded i sure am ive been doing a doctors work since the lizards came though mount pulaski only had doc hanrahan and somebodys bombgod knows whoselanded in his front yard just when he was coming out the door he never knew what hit him anyhow lord i wish we could take you with us maam kevin donlan said the medics we got they aint everything they oughta be course what is these days that purely is a fact daniels agreed the army tried hard the same as it did with supplies as with supplies wars disruption was too great to permit hurt men proper care he suspected his grandfathers in the war between the states hadnt risked much worse medical treatment doctors knew a lot more nowadays but so what all the knowledge in the world didnt matter if you couldnt get your hands on the medicines and instruments you needed to use it lucille potter said why the hell not mutt gaped at her startled twicefirst at the casual way she swore and then by how she fell in with donlans suggestion which had been more wistful than serious mutt said but maam youre a woman he thought that explained everything so lucille saidevidently she didnt would you care if i was digging a bullet out of your leg or do you think your boys here are going to gangrape me the second your back is turned butbut mutt spluttered like a man who cant swim floundering out of a creek he felt his face turn red his men were staring at lucille potter with their mouths open rape wasnt a word you said around a woman let alone a word you expected to hear from one she went on maybe i should bring my shotgun along you think that might make em behave y all mean it he said surprised again this time into a southernism he seldom used of course i mean it she said get to know me for a while and youll find out i hardly ever say things i dont mean people in town were stupid too till they started coming down sick and breaking bones and having babies then they found out what i could dobecause they had to you cant afford to wait around like that can you if you give me five minutes ill go home and get my black bag orshe shruggedyou can do without mutt thought hard whatever the trouble she brought with her could it be worse than the hurts theyd take that would go bad without a doctor he didnt think so but he also wanted to find out why she was volunteering so he asked how come you want to leave this town if youre the only thing even halfway close to a doctor here when the lizards held this part of the state i had to stay herei was the only one around who could do anything lucille answered but now that proper human beings are back in charge itll be easier to bring a real doctor around and an awful lot of what ive been doing lately is patching up hurt soldiers i hate to put it so plain mutt but i think you people are liable to need me worse than mount pulaski does that makes sense mutt said glancing at lucille potter he got the feeling she would make sense a lot of the time he rubbed his chin tell you what miss lucille lets take you over to captain maczek see what he thinks about the idea if its all right with him i like it he looked over to the men in his squad they were all nodding mutt suddenly grinned herebring some of this duck along with you thatll help put him in the right kind of mood maczek was around the corner eating with another squad from the company he was maybe half mutts age but not altogether lacking in sense mutt grinned again to see him digging a spoon in what looked like a can of baked beans he held up the duck leg got something bettern that for you siran heres the lady who shot the bird the captain stared in delight at the duck then turned to lucille maam my hats off to you he took himself literally doffing his netcovered helmet the sweaty blond hair underneath it stuck up in all directions pleased to meet you captain lucille potter gave her name shook maczeks hand with a decisive pump then the captain took the drumstick and thigh from daniels and bit into it grease ran down his chin his expression turned ecstatic you know what else sir mutt said he told maczek what else is that a fact maczek said yes sir it is lucille said im not a proper doctor and i dont claim to be one but ive learned a hell of a lot these past few months and im a lot better than nothing maczek absently took another bite of duck as mutt had he eyed the men around him theyd all been listening with eager curiosity you couldnt run an army by asking what everybody thought all the time but you didnt ignore what people thought either not if you were smart maczek wasnt stupid anyhow he said ill clear it with the colonel later but i dont think hell say no its irregular as all get out but this whole stinking war is irregular ill go get my tools lucille said and strode off to do just that captain maczek watched her nononsense walk for a few seconds before he turned back to daniels you know sergeant if youd come along to me with some little chippy youd found id have been very angry at you but this onei think she may do if ive ever seen a female who can take care of herself shes it reckon youre right sir mutt pointed to the bones maczek was still holding and we already know she can handle a shotgun thats true by god maczek laughed besides shes old enough to be a mother for most of the men you have anybody in your squad with an oedipus complex you think with a what sir mutt frownedjust because maczek had been to college he didnt need to show off and besidesshes not badlookin i dont think captain maczek opened his mouth to say something by the glint in his eye it would have been lewd or rude or both but he didnt say ithe was too smart an officer to make fun of his noncoms especially in front of a bunch of listening soldiers what he did finally say was however you like mutt but remember shes going to be medic for the whole company maybe the battalion not just your squad yeah sure captain i know that daniels said to himself he added i saw her first though the u droned through the night just above the treetops the cold slipstream buffeted ludmila gorbunovas face it was not the only reason her teeth chattered she was deep inside lizardheld territory if anything went wrong she wouldnt make it back to her dirt airstrip and the cramped little space she shared with the other female pilots she forced such thoughts from her mind concentrated on the mission at hand that was the only way to get through them shed learned keep your mind firmly fixed on what you had to do now then what you had to do next and so on look ahead or off to one side and you were in trouble that had been true against the nazis it was doubly so against the lizards what i have to do now she said aloud letting the slipstream fling her words away behind her is find the partisan battalion easier said than done in what looked like endless stretches of forest and plain she thought her navigation was good but when you were flying by compass and wristwatch little errors always crept in she thought about gaining altitude so she could see farther but rejected the idea it would also have made it easier for the lizards to spot her she worked the pedals and the stick swung the u into a wide slow spiral to search the terrain below the little woodandfabric biplane responded beautifully to the controls probably better than it had when it was new georg schultz her german mechanic might bewasa nazi but he was also a genius at keeping the aircraft not only flying but flying well in spite of an almost complete lack of spare parts there down belowwas that a light it was and a moment later she spotted the other two with it shed been told to look for an equilateral triangle of lights here they were she buzzed slowly overhead hoping the partisans had all their instructions straight they did as goon as they heard the sewingmachine whine of the us little shvetsov engine they set out two more lights little ones that were supposed to mark out the beginning of a stretch of ground where she could land safely her mouth went dry as it did every time she had to land at night on a strip or a field shed never seen before the kukuruznik was a rugged machine but a mistake could still kill her she lined up on the landing lights lost altitude killed her airspeednot that the u had much to lose at the last moment the lights disappeared they must have had collars to keep them from being seen at ground level losing them made her heart thump fearfully but then she was down the biplane bounced along over the field ludmila hit the brakes hard every meter she traveled was one more meter in which a wheel might go into a hole and flip the u over fortunately it did not need many meters in which to stop mendark shapes in darker nightcame running up and got to the kukuruznik while the prop was still spinning you have presents for us comrade one of them called i have presents ludmila agreed she heard the mutters when they heard her voicevariations on the theme of a woman she was used to that shed been dealing with it ever since she joined the red air force but there were fewer such murmurs among the partisans than there had been at some air force bases to which shed flown a fair number of partisans were women and most male partisans understood that women could fight she climbed down from the front cockpit set a foot in the metal stirrup on the left side of the fuselage that gave access to the rear one she didnt go up into it but started handing out boxes here we are comrades presents she said rifleswith ammunition submachine gunswith ammunition the weapons are good but we already have most of the weapons we need a man said but next time you come comrade pilot bring us lots more bullets its the ammunition were short ofwe use a lot of it wolflike chuckles rose from the partisans throats from back in the crowd of fighters someone called comrade did you fetch us any mm ammunition we have a lot of german rifles and machine guns we could use more if we had bullets for them ludmila hauled out a canvas bag that clinked metallically the partisans murmurs turned appreciative a couple of them clapped gloved hands together in delight ludmila said i am told to tell you you cannot expect this bounty on every resupply run we have to scavenge german cartridgeswe dont manufacture them the way things are we have a hard enough time manufacturing our own calibers too bad said the man who had asked about german ammunition the mauser is not a great rifleaccurate da but a slow clumsy boltbut the nazis make a very fine machine gun maybe we can work a trade the fellow whod first greeted ludmila said theres a mostly german band of fighters back around konotop and they use our weapons just as we use theirs they might swap some of their caliber for some of ours those couple of sentences spoke volumes about the anguish of the soviet union konotop a hundred fifty kilometers east of ludmilas native kiev had been in german hands now it belonged to the lizards when would the soviet workers and people be able to reclaim the rodina the motherland ludmila started handing out cardboard tubes and pots of paste here you are comrades because wars are not won only by bullets i bring also the latest posters by efrimov and the kukryniksi group that drew pleased exclamations from the partisans newspapers hereabouts had been forced to echo the nazi line now they slavishly reproduced lizard propaganda radios especially those able to pick up signals from land still under human control were few and far between posters gave one way of striking back they could go up on a wall in seconds and show hundreds the truth for days what do the men of kukryniksi do this time a woman asked its one of their better ones i think ludmila said which was no small praise for the team of kupryanov krylov and sokolov probably turned out the best soviet poster art she went on this one shows a lizard in pharaohs headdress lashing soviet peasants the caption reads a return to slavery that is a good one the partisan leader agreed it will make the people think and make them less likely to collaborate with the lizards we will post it widely in towns and villages and at collective farms how much collaboration goes on with the lizards ludmila asked this is something of which our authorities need to be aware its not as bad as what went on with the germans at first the man answered ludmila nodded little could be as bad as that large segments of the soviet populace had welcomed the nazis as liberators in the early days of their invasion if theyd played on that instead of working to prove they could be even more savage and brutal than the nkvd they might have toppled the soviet regime the partisan went on we do have collaboration though many people passively accept whatever power they find above them while others welcome the rather indifferent rule of the lizards as superior to the hostility they had known before hostility from the fascists you mean ludmila said of course comrade pilot the partisan leaders voice was innocence personified no one could safely speak of hostility to the people from the soviet government though that shadow lay across the whole of the rodina you called the lizards rule indifferent ludmila said explain that more fully please intelligence is worth more than many rifles they take crops and livestock for themselves in the towns they try to set up manufacturers that might be useful to them forges and chemical works and such but they care nothing for what we do as people the partisan said they do not forbid worship but they do not promote it either they do not even forbid the party which would be only elementary prudence on their part it is as if we are beneath their notice unless we take up arms against them then they hit hard that much ludmila already knew the other perplexed her by the sound of his voice it perplexed the partisan too they were used to a regime that minutely regulated every aspect of its citizens livesand disposed of them without mercy when they didnt meet its expectations or sometimes even if they did simple indifference seemed very alien by contrast she hoped her superiors would have a better idea of what to make of it does anyone have letters for me she asked ill be glad to take them along though with the post as disrupted as it is they may be months on the way the partisans queued up to hand her their notes to the outside world none of them had envelopes those had been in short supply before the lizards came the papers were folded into triangles to show they came from soldiers the soviet mail system carried such letters albeit slowly without a postage fee when she had the last letter ludmila climbed back into the front cockpit and said would you please swing my aircraft around nose for tail if i landed safely on this strip id like to take off down the same ground the little u was easy to haul around by hand it weighed less than a thousand kilos ludmila had to explain to someone how to turn the prop as always on these missions she had an anxious moment wondering whether the engine would startno mechanical starter here if it didnt but it was still warm from the flight in and kicked over almost at once she released the brake pushed the stick forward the kukuruznik jounced over the rough field a few partisans ran alongside waving they soon fell behind the takeoff run was longer than the one shed needed to land that meant she was going over some new terrain to say nothing of the holes she might have missed while she was landing but after a last couple of jolts the biplane made an ungainly leap into the air she swung the u north and west back toward the base from which shed set out finding it again would take the same kind of search shed needed to locate the partisans makeshift airstrip a base that advertised its presence soon drew the attention of the lizards once that happened the base was unlikely to remain present for long not that she had any guarantees of getting back safely anyhow us were detected and destroyed less often than any other soviet aircraft ludmilas best guess was that they were too small and light and flimsy to be noticed most of the time but kukuruzniks did not always come home either off in the distance she saw flashes like heat lightning on a summer evening someones artillery probably the lizards she glanced at her watch and compass made the best position estimate she could when she landed shed report it to colonel karpov maybe one day before too long the partisans would fire a rack of katyusha rockets that way stars twinkled through gaps in the clouds a couple of times she spotted brief twinkles of light on the ground too muzzle flashes they made the stars seem less safe and friendly watching the compass and her watch she flew on toward the base when she thought she was overhead she looked down and sawnothing that failed to surprise her finding it on the first try by dead reckoning was no likelier than plunging your hand into a haystack and bringing out a needle between thumb and forefinger she began another search spiral now she watched her fuel gauge too if she was lost and had to set down in a field she wanted to do it while she still had power not dead stick just when she was beginning to worry she might have to do exactly that she spied the lights shed been looking for she gratefully made for them knowing where you were made you feel ever so much more in control of things the airstrip had supposedly been leveled as a matter of fact it was no smoother than the one the partisans had marked off for her ludmilas teeth clicked together at every jolt until the u stopped she told herself the roughness made the runway harder to spot was that consolation enough for the bruises shed have wherever her safety harness touched her maybe she unbuckled the harness got out of the plane while the prop was still spinning the groundcrew ran up hauled the kukuruznik away to its betweenmissions home in a camouflaged revetment wheres colonel karpov she asked he went to bed an hour ago somebody answered it is close to three in the morning you have anything so important it wont keep till dawn i suppose not she said the lizard artillery wasnt something he had to know about right now she followed the kukuruznik toward its shelter ludmila would have bet as much money as she had that shed find georg schultz waiting at the revetment sure enough there he was alles khorosho he asked in his usual mixture of german and russian gut da she answered mixing the languages the same way he scrambled up into the cockpit no lantern was lighted not even beneath the camouflage netting the lizards had gadgets that could pick up the tiniest gleam that didnt stop schultz from starting to work on ludmilas biplane he tested the pedals and other controls leaned out to say left aileron cable not goodfeels a little loose come light i fix thank you georgi mikhailovich ludmila answered she hadnt noticed anything wrong with the cable but if schultz said it needed tightening she was willing to believe him his understanding for machinery was to her way of thinking all but uncanny she flew the aircraft georg schultz projected himself into it as if he were part plane himself nothing else bad he said but hereyou leave on floor he handed her a folded triangle of paper thank you she said again our post is unreliable enough without me losing a letter before it ever gets into the mail she wasnt sure how much of that he understood but found herself yawning enormously she was too tired to try to dredge up german to make things clear for him if colonel karpov was asleep she saw no reason she shouldnt grab a couple of hours for herself too she shrugged out of her parachute harnessnot that shed have much chance to use a chute if she got hit while she was hedgehopping the way she usually didand stowed it in the cockpit then started out of the revetment toward her sleeping quarters as she passed georg schultz he patted her on the backside ludmila took a skittering half step half jump she whirled around in fury this wasnt the first time such things had happened to her since shed joined the red air force but somehow shed thought schultz too kulturny to try them dont you ever do that again she blazed in russian then switched to german to drive it home nie wieder verstehst du it was the du of insult not intimacy she added what would your colonel jager think if he found out what you just did schultz had been the gunner in the tank jager commanded he thought highly of his former leader ludmila hoped reminding him of that would bring him to his senses but he just laughed quietly and said he would think i wasnt doing anything he hadnt done himself a short deadly silence followed ludmila broke it in tones of ice that is none of your business if it will not make you keep your hands where they belong maybe this will remember you are the only nazi on a base full of red air force men they leave you alone because you work well but they do not love you verstehst du dos he drew himself to stiff attention did his best to click his heels in soft felt valenki shot out his arm in a defiant hitlerite salute i remember very well and i do understand he stomped away ludmila wanted to kick him why couldnt he have just said he was sorry and gone on about his business instead of getting angry as if she had somehow wronged him instead of the other way round now what was she supposed to do if he was that angry with her did she still want him working on her aircraft but if he didnt who would the answer to that formed in her mind with the question some quartertrained russian peasant who hardly knew the difference between a screwdriver and a pair of pliers she could do some work herself but not all and she knew she didnt have schultzs artists touch with an engine her show of temper was liable to end up getting her killed but what should she have done let him treat her like a whore she shook her head violently maybe she should have responded with a joke instead of a blast though too late to worry about it now slowly tiredly she walked over to the building that sheltered the women pilots it wasnt much of a shelter the walls were dirtfilled sandbags and bales of hay like the revetments that protected the aircraft the roof camouflage netting over straw over unchinked boards it leaked and let in the cold but no one here colonel karpov included had quarters any better the door to the improvised barracks had no hinges and had to be pushed aside inside was a blackout curtain ludmila pulled the door closed before she went through the curtain let no light leak out was a rule she took as much for granted as take off into the wind the barracks held little light to leak anyhow a couple of candles and an oil lamp were enough to keep you from stumbling over blanketwrapped women snoring on straw pallets but that was about all yawning ludmila stumbled toward her own place a white rectangle lay on top of her folded blankets it hadnt been there when she went out on her mission a few hours earlier a letter she said happilyand from a civilian too or it would have been folded differently hope flared in her painfully intense she hadnt heard from anyone in her family since the lizards came maybe they were safe after all when shed almost given up on them in the dim light she had to pick up the letter to realize it was in an envelope she turned it over bent her head close to it to look at the address she needed a moment to notice part of it was written in the roman alphabet and the cyrillic characters were printed with a slow precision that said the person who used them wasnt used to them then her eyes fixed on the stamp had anyone told her a year before that shed have been glad to see a picture of adolf hitler shed either have thought him mad or been mortally insultedprobably both heinrich she breathed doing her best to pronounce the h at the beginning of the name which was not a sound the russian language had she tore the envelope open eased out the letter to her relief she saw jager had considerately printed she found german handwriting next to indecipherable she read my dear ludmila i hope this finds you safe and well in fact i have to hope it finds you at all in her minds eye she could see one corner of his mouth quirking upwards as he set his small joke down on paper the perfection and intensity of the image told her how much she missed him i was on duty in a town i cannot name lest the censor reach for his razor he went on i will be leaving in the next day or two though and going back to a panzer outfit i also cannot name i wish i were returning to you instead or you to me so much easier to travel long distance by plane than by horse or even by panzer she remembered some of his stories of crossing lizard occupied poland on horseback that made anything shed done in her u seem tame by comparison in the letter he went on i wish we could be together more even at best we have so little time on this world and with the war we do not have the best yet without it we would not have met you and i so i suppose i cannot say it is altogether a bad thing no it isnt she whispered having an affair with an enemy might be stupid a feeling jager no doubt shared with her but she couldnt make herself believe it was a bad thing the letter continued i thank you for looking out for my comrade georg schultz your country is so vast that only great luck could have brought him to your base as you said when we were last together greet him for me i hope he is well ludmila didnt know whether to laugh or cry when she read that schultz was well all right and she had looked out for him and all he wanted was to get her pants down she wondered whether he had enough sense of shame to be embarrassed if she showed him jagers letter she didnt have to decide now she wanted to finish the letter and get a little sleep everything else could wait she read if fate is kind we will meet again soon in a world at peace if it is less kind we will meet again though the war goes on it would have to be very cruel to keep us from meeting again at all with love and the hope you stay safeheinrich ludmila folded the letter small and stuck it in a pocket of her flying suit then she took off her leather helmet and goggles but none of the rest of the outfit not even her valenki the inside of the barracks was cold she lay down on the straw pulled the blanket up over her head and fell asleep almost at once when she woke the next morning she found one hand in the pocket where shed put the letter that made her smile and resolved her to answer it right away then she had to figure out whether to show it to schultz she decided she would but not this minute time enough when they were calmer not actively angry at each other meanwhile she still had to make her report to colonel karpov the nipponese guard handed teerts his bowl of food he bowed polite thanks turned one eye toward it to see what hed got he almost hissed with pleasure along with the rice the bowl was full of chunks of some kind of flesh the big uglies had been feeding him better lately by the time he finished the meal he was almost content he wondered what they were up to captivity had taught him they were not in the habit of doing gratuitous favors for anybody up till now captivity had taught him they werent in the habit of doing any favors whatever the change made him suspicious sure enough major okamoto and the usual stonefaced rifletoting guard marched up to the cell door not long after the bowl was taken away as the door swung open okamoto spoke in the language of the race you will come with me it shall be done superior sir teerts agreed he left the cell with no small relief his step seemed lighter than it had in a long time going upstairs to the interrogation chamber of the nagasaki prison felt like good exercise not a wearing burden amazing what something close to proper food can do he thought again the nipponese inside the chamber wore the white robes of scientists the big ugly in the center chair spoke major okamoto translated dr nishina wishes to discuss today the nature of the bombs with which the race destroyed the cities of berlin and washington why not teerts answered agreeably these bombs were made from uranium in case you do not know what uranium is it is the ninetysecond element in the periodic table he let his mouth fall slightly open in amusement the big uglies were so barbarous they would surely have not the slightest notion of what he was talking about after okamoto relayed his answer to the nipponese scientists he and they talked back and forth for some time then he returned his attention to teerts saying i do not have the technical terms i need to ask these questions in proper detail give them to me as we speak please and do your best to understand even without them it shall be done superior sir teerts said agreeable still good okamoto paused to think his rubbery big ugly features made the process easy to watch at length he said dr nishina wishes to know which process the race uses to separate the lighter explosive kind of uranium from the more common heavy kind teerts bit down on that as if it were an unsuspected bone in his meat not in his wildest nightmaresand hed had some dreadful ones since his capturehad he imagined that the big uglies had the slightest clue about atomic energy or even that theyd heard of uranium if they didhe abruptly realized they might be dangerous to the race not just the horrid nuisances theyd already proved themselves to major okamoto he said tell the learned dr nishina that i do not know which processes he means he had to work not to turn an eye turret toward the instruments of torture in the interrogation chamber okamoto fixed him with a stare hed come to identify as hostile but passed his words on to nishina without comment nishina spoke volubly in reply ticking off points on his fingers as if he were a male of the race when he was through okamoto translated he says theory shows several ways which might accomplish this among them are successive barriers to a uraniumcontaining gas heating the gas so that part of it which has the lighter kind of uranium rises more than the other using a strong electromagneta word that took a good deal of backing and filling to get acrossand using rapid spinning to concentrate the lighter kind of uranium which of these does the race find most efficient teerts stared at him he was even more appalled than he had been when his killercraft got shot down that had affected only his own fate now he had to worry about whether the race had any idea what the tosevites were up to they might be barbariansby everything teerts had seen they were barbariansbut they were also alarmingly knowledgeable which meant it behooved teerts to be more than cautious in his answers hed have to do his best to avoid giving away any information at all he took so long figuring that out that okamoto snapped dont waste time dreaming up lies answer dr nishina i beg your pardon superior sir teerts said and added gomen nasaiso sorry from his limited stock of nipponese part of the problem is my not having enough words to give a proper answer and another part is my own ignorance for which i again beg pardon you must remember that i ami wasa pilot i had nothing at all to do with uranium you certainly were glib enough talking about it a little while ago okamoto said you do not want to make me disbelieve you some of the tools back there are very sharp others can be made hot and still others can be hot and sharp at the same time do you want to learn which is which no superior sir teerts gasped with utmost sincerity but i truly am ignorant of the knowledge you seek i am only a pilot not a nuclear physicist what i know of flying i have freely told you i am not an expert in the matter of atomic weapons what little i know of nuclear energy i learned in school as i was growing from hatchlinghood it is no more and no less than any other ordinary male of the race would know this is difficult to believe okamoto said you spoke quite a lot about uranium just a little while ago that was before i realized how much you knew about it teerts thought he wondered how he was going to escape with his integument intact he knew he couldnt lie to the nipponese he didnt know how much they knew and the only way to find outgetting caughtwould involve the painful penetration of that integument he said i do know that atomic weapons do not necessarily use uranium alone some involve i am not sure how hydrogen as wellthe very first element let the japanese chew on that paradox for a while he thought how could a weapon involve the lightest and heaviest elements at the same time after okamoto interpreted the team of big ugly scientists chattered for a while among themselves then nisbina who seemed to be their spokesman put a question to okamoto the major translated for teerts the uranium explosion then is hot enough to make hydrogen act as it does in the sun and convert large amounts of matter to energy horror filled teerts every time he tried to escape from this hideous mess in which he found himself he sank deeper instead the big uglies knew about fusion to teerts the product of a civilization that grew and changed at a glacial pace knowing about something was essentially the same as being able to do it and if the tosevites could make fusion bombs major okamoto knocked him out of his appalled reverie by snapping answer the learned dr nishina i beg your pardon superior sir teerts said yes everything the learned doctor says is true there hed done it any day now he feared the nipponese would start using nuclear weapons against the race on the mainlandwhich still struck teerts as nothing more than a big island he was used to water surrounded by land not the other way around he heard okamoto say honto confirming his answer to the nipponese scientists question the cold of the interrogation room sank deeply into his spirit the nipponese hardly seemed to need him by their questions they had all the answers already just waiting to be put into practice then nishina spoke again we return to the question of getting the lighter uranium the kind which is explosive out of the other more common type this as yet we have not succeeded in doing indeed we have only just begun the attempt that is why we will learn from you how the race solves this problem teerts needed a moment to understand that the race had been shocked when they reached tosev to discover how advanced the big uglies were before teerts was captured pilots had talked endlessly about that theyd expected no opposition and here the tosevites were shooting backnot very well and from inadequate aircraft but shooting back how could they have learned to build combat aircraft in the eight hundred local years since the races probe examined them now for the first time teerts got a glimmering of the answer the race made change deliberately slow when something new was discovered extrapolationists performed elaborate calculations to learn in advance how it would affect a longstable society and how best to minimize those effects while gradually acquiring the benefits of the new device or principle with the big uglies the tongue was on the other side of the mouth when they found something new they seized it with both hands and squeezed until they got all the juice out they didnt care what the consequences five generationsor even five yearshence would be they wanted advantages now and worried about later trouble later if at all eventually theyd probably end up destroying themselves with that attitude at the moment it made them far more deadly opponents than they would have been otherwise do not waste time thinking up lies i warned you before major okamoto said tell dr nishina the truth at once by what i know superior sir the truth is that we do not use any of these methods teerts said okamoto drew back his hand for a slap afraid that would be the start of a torture session worse than any hed yet known teerts went on rapidly instead we use the heavier form of uranium isotope is the term we use how do you do this okamoto demanded after a brief colloquy with the nipponese scientists dr nishina says the heavier isotope cannot explode there is another element number ninetyfour which does not occur in nature but which we make from the heavier nonexplosivedr nishina is rightisotope of uranium this other element is explosive we use it in our bombs i think you are lying you will pay the penalty for it i promise you that okamoto said nevertheless he translated teerts words for the big uglies in the white coats they started talking excitedly among themselves nishina who looked to be the senior male sorted things out and relayed an answer to okamoto he said to teerts i may have been wrong dr nishina tells me the americans have found this new element as well they have given it the name plutonium you will help us produce it past what i have already said i know little teerts warned despair threatened to consume him every time hed revealed something new to the nipponese it had been with the hope that the technical difficulties of the new revelation would force them off the road that led toward nuclear weapons instead everything he told them seemed to push them further down that road he wished a plutonium bomb would fall on nagasaki but what were the odds of that vi welcome to chugwater population the sign said colonel leslie groves shook his head as he read it chugwater he echoed wonder why they call it that captain rance auerbach read the other half of the sign population he said sounds like jerkwaterd be a better name for it groves looked ahead the cavalry officer had a point it didnt look like much of a town but cattle roamed the fields around it this late in winter they were on the scrawny side but they were still out there grazing that meant chugwater had enough to eat anyhow people came out to look at the spectacle of a cavalry company going through town but they didnt act as impressed as townsfolk had in montana and farther north in wyoming one boy in ragged blue jeans said to a man in overalls who looked just like him i liked the parade a couple of weeks ago better dad you had a parade through here a couple of weeks ago groves called to a heavyset man whose black coat white shirt and string tie argued that he was a person of some local importance sure as hell did the pearshaped man spat a stream of tobacco juice into the street groves envied him for having tobacco in any form he went on only thing missing then was a brass band had us a whole slew o wagons and soldiers and foreigners who talked funny and even a couple of lizardssillylookin little things to cause all the trouble they do arent they yes now that you mention it excitement coursed through groves that sounded very much like the met lab crew if he was only a couple of weeks behind them theyd be into colorado by now not too far from denver he might even catch them before they got there whether he did or not the leadlined saddlebag in his wagon would push their work forward once they got themselves settled trying to make his hope a certainty he asked did they say what they were up to the heavyset man shook his head nope they were right closemouthed as a matter of fact friendly enough people though his chest inflated although not enough to stick out over his belly i married off a couple of em one of the other men on the sidewalk a stringy leathery fellow who looked like a real cowboy not the hollywood variety said yeah go on hoot tell him how you laid the bride too you go to hell fritzie the pearshaped manhootsaid a cowboy named fritzie groves thought before he had time to do more than marvel hoot turned back to him not that i wouldve minded pretty little thing a widow i think she was but i do believe the corporal she married would have kicked my ass around the block if id even looked at her sideways youdve deserved it too fritzie said with a most uncowboylike giggle oh shut up hoot told him again he returned to groves so i dont know what they were doing colonel only that there were a lot of em heading south toward denver i think not cheyenne but dont make me swear to that thank you very much that helps groves said if they werent talking about the crew from the university of chicago hed eat his hat hed made better time coming across canada and then down through montana and wyoming than they had traveling straight west across the great plains of course his party had only the one wagon in it and that lightly loaded while theirs was limited to the speed of their slowest conveyance and theyd have been doing a lot more scrounging for fodder than his tight band if you couldnt think in terms of logistics you didnt deserve to be an army engineer you folks going to put up here for the night hoot asked well kill the fatted calf for you like the good book says sides theres nothin between here and cheyenne but miles and miles of miles and miles groves looked at auerbach auerbach looked back as if to say youre the boss groves said i know things are tight mister uh im joshua sumner but you may as well call me hoot everybody else does we got plenty at least for now feed you a nice thick steak and feed you beets by god well feed you beets till your eyeballs turn purplewe had a bumper crop of em got a ukrainian family up the road a couple miles they showed us how to cook up what they call borschtbeets and sour cream and i dont know what all else they taste a sight better that way than what we were doing with em before i tell you for a fact groves was unenthusiastic about beets with or without sour cream but he didnt think hed get anything better farther south on us thanks uh hoot well lay over then if its all right with you people nobody in earshot made any noises to say it wasnt captain auerbach raised his hand the cavalry company reined in groves reflected that a couple of the oldtimers on the street had probably seen cavalry go through town before back before the turn of the century the idea left him unhappy it was as if the lizards were forcing the united statesand the worldaway from the twentieth century such worries receded after he got himself outside of a great slab of fatrich steak cooked mediumrare over a wood fire he ate a bowl of borscht too not least because the person who pressed it on him was a smiling blonde of about eighteen it wasnt what he would have chosen for himself but it wasnt as bad as hed thought it would be either and somebody in chugwater made homebrew beer better than just about anything that came out of a big milwaukee brewery hoot sumner turned out to be sheriff justice of the peace and postmaster all rolled into one he gravitated to groves maybe because they were the leaders of their respective camps maybe just because they were about the same shape so what brings you through town he asked im afraid i cant answer that groves said the less i say the less chance the lizards have of finding out as if im gonna tell em sumner said indignantly mr sumner i have no way of knowing whom youd tell or whom theyd tell or whom theyd tell groves said what i do know is that i have orders directly from president roosevelt that i tell no one i intend to obey those orders sumners eyes got big straight from the president you say must be something important then he cocked his head studied groves from under the brim of his stetson groves looked back at him his face expressionless after close to a minute of that tableau sumner scowled in frustration goddamn colonel im glad i dont play poker against you or id be walking home in my long johns i think hoot if i cant tell you anything that means i really cant tell you anything groves said thing is though a small town like this one here runs on gossip if we cant get any well just shrivel up and die sumner said the folks who came through a couple weeks ago were just as tightlipped as you people arethey wouldntve said shit if they had a mouthful if you know what i mean all this stuff going through us and we dont even get to find out what the hell it is mr sumner its altogether possible that you and chugwater dont want to know groves said his face did twist then in annoyance at himself he shouldnt have said anything at all how many mugs of that good home brew had he drunk he consoled himself with the thought that hed learned something from sumner if the previous set of travelers had been as secretive as he was the odds were even better than good that they came from the metallurgical laboratory the justice of the peace said hellfire man those people even had an eyetalian with em and aint eyetalians supposed to be the talkingest people on the face of the earth brother not this one nice enough feller but he wouldnt give you the time of day what kind of an eyetalian is that a smart one groves thought it sounded like enrico fermi to him which just about nailed things down only time he unbent atall sumner went on was when he did best man duty at the wedding i told you aboutkissed the bride right pert he did even though his own wifenot a bad looker herselfwas standing right there beside him now that sounds like an eyetalian to me maybe so groves wondered where sumner got his ideas about how italians were supposed to act not in the great metropolis of chugwater wyomingor at least groves hadnt seen any here most likely from chico marx he thought wherever he got those ideas though sumner was no fool in matters directly under his own eye nodding to groves he said stands to reason your business whatever it isand i wont ask any moreis somehow connected with that other crowd we hadnt seen hardly anybody from the outside world since things went to hell last year and then two big bunches both goin the same direction almost one on top of the other you gonna tell me its a coincidence mr sumner im not saying yes and im not saying no i am saying wed all be better offyou and me and the country tooif you didnt ask questions like that groves was a career army man to him security was as natural as breathing but civilians didnt wouldnt think that way sumner set a finger alongside his nose and winked as if groves had told him what he wanted to know gloomily groves sipped more homemade beer he was afraid hed done just that ah the vernal equinox ken embry exclaimed harbinger of mild weather songbirds flowers oh shut your bleeding gob george bagnall said with heartfelt sincerity breath came from both englishmen in great icy clouds vernal equinox or not winter still held pskov in an iron grip the oncoming dawn was just beginning to turn the eastern horizon gray above the black pine forests that seemed to stretch away forever venus blazed low in the east with saturn far dimmer and yellower not far above her in the west the full moon was descending toward the land looking that way bagnall was painfully reminded of the britain he might never see again embry sighed which turned the air around him even foggier he said im not what youd call dead keen on being demoted to the infantry nor i bagnall agreed thats what we get for being supernumeraries you dont see them handing jones a rifle and having him give his all for king and country hes useful here so they have him teaching everything he can about his pet radar but without the lanc were just bodies for commissar and country pleaseremember where we are embry said me id sooner they tried training us up on red air force planes we are veteran aircrew after all id hoped for that myself bagnall said only difficulty with the notion is that as far as i can see the red air force whatever may be left of it hasnt got any planes within god knows how far from pskov if theres damn all here they can hardly train us up on it too true embry tugged at his shlemsort of a balaclava that didnt cover his nose or mouthso it did a better job of keeping his neck warm and i dont like the tin hat theyve kitted me out with either then dont wear it i dont fancy mine now that you mention it along with mauser rifles both englishmen had received german helmets wearing that coal scuttle with its painted swastika set bagnalls teeth on edge to say nothing of worrying him lest he be mistaken for a nazi by some russian more eager for revenge against the germans than to attack the lizards dont like to leave it off either embry said puts me too much in mind of the last war when they went for a year and a half with no tin hats at all that is a poser bagnall admitted thinking about the infinite slaughter of world war i was bad enough anyhow thinking how bad it had been before helmets was enough to make your stomach turn over alf whyte came walking toward them he had his helmet on which made his silhouette unnervingly germanic he said you chaps ready to find out about the way our fathers fought sod our fathers bagnall muttered he stamped his feet up and down russian felt boots kept them warm boots were the one part of his flying suit hed willingly exchanged for their local equivalents other small groups of men gathered in pskovs market square chatting softly among themselves in russian or german it was a more informal muster than any bagnall had imagined the occasional female voice among the deeper rumbles only made the scene seem stranger the women fighters were as heavily bundled against the cold as their male counterparts pointing to a couple of them embry said they dont precisely put one in mind of jane do they ah jane bagnall said he and alf whyte both sighed the daily mirrors marvelous comicstrip blonde dressed in one of two ways very little and even less bagnall went on even jane would dress warmly here and the russians even dressed like jane wouldnt much stir me the ones ive seen are most of them lady dockwallopers or lorry drivers too right whyte said this is a bloody place all three englishmen nodded glumly a couple of minutes later officersor at least leadersmoved the fighters out bagnalls rifle was heavy it made him feel lopsided and banged his shoulder at every step he took at first it drove him to distraction then it became only a minor nuisance by the time hed gone a mile or so he stopped noticing it he did expect to see some difference in the way the russians and germans went off to war german precision and efficiency were notorious while the red army although it had a reputation for great courage was not long on spit and polish he soon found what such cliches were worth he couldnt even tell the two groups apart by their gear many russian partisans bore captured german equipment while about an equal number of hitlers finest eked out their own supplies with soviet stocks they even marched the same way in loose widespread groups that got looser and more spread out as the sun rose we might do well to emulate them bagnall said they have more experience at this kind of thing than we do i suppose its to keep too many from going down at once if theyre caught out in the open by aircraft ken embry said if were caught out in the open you mean alf whyte corrected him as if with one accord the three raf men spread out a little farther before long they entered the forest south of pskov to bagnall used to neat welltrimmed english woods it was like stepping into another world these trees had never been harvested he would have bet money that many of them had never been seen by mortal man till this moment pine and fir and spruce held invaders at bay with their darkneedled branches as if the only thing they wanted in all the world was for the men to go away the occasional pale gray birch trunks among them startled bagnall each time he went past one they reminded him of naked women he thought again of jane scattered among matrons properly dressed for the cold off in the distance something howled a wolf bagnall said and grabbed for his rifle before he realized there was no immediate need wolves had been hunted out of england for more than four hundred years but he reacted to the sound by instinct printed on his flesh by four hundred times four hundred generations were rather a long way from home arent we whyte said with a nervous chuckle hed started at the wolf call too too bloody far bagnall said thinking about england brought him only pain he tried to do it as little as he could even battered and hungry from war it felt infinitely more welcoming than wrecked pskov tensely divided between bolsheviks and nazis or than this forbidding primeval wood in amongst the trees the almost eternal ravening wind was gone that let bagnall grow as nearly warm as hed been since his lancaster landed outside pskov and jerome jones had said the city was known for its mild climate trudging through snow as spring began gave the lie to that at least if you were a londoner bagnall wondered if spring ever truly began here alf whyte said what precisely is our mission anyhow i was talking with a jerry last night bagnall paused and not just to take another breath he had a little german and no russian so he naturally found it easier to talk with the wehrmacht men than with pskovs rightful owners that bothered him he was so used to thinking of the germans as enemies that dealing with them in any way felt treasonous even if they loved the lizards no better than he and what did the jerry say pray tell whyte asked when he didnt go on right away thus prompted bagnall answered theres a lizard i dont know what exactlyforward observation post little garrison somethingabout twentyfive kilometers south of pskov were supposed to put paid to it twentyfive kilometers as a navigator whyte was used to going back and forth between metric and imperial measures were to hike fifteen miles through the snow and then fight itll be nightfall by the time we get there i gather thats pare of the plan bagnall said whytes scandalized tone showed what an easy time england had had in the war the germans and from what bagnall could gather the russians took the hike for granted just one more thing they had to do theyd done worse marches to get at each other the winter before he munched cold black bread as he shuffled along while he paused to spend a penny against the trunk of a birch tree a lizard jet wailed by far overhead he froze wondering if the enemy could have spotted the advancing human foes the trees gave good cover and most of the fighters wore white smocks over the rest of their clothes even his own helmet had whitewash splashed across it the leaders of the combat group or so his german of the night before had called it took no chances they hurried the fighters along and urged them to scatter even more widely than before bagnall obeyed but worried hed thought nothing could be worse than fighting in these grim woods but suppose he got lost in them instead the shiver that brought had nothing to do with cold on and on and on he felt as if hed marched a hundred miles already how was he to fight after a slog like this the germans and russians seemed to think nothing of it a british tommy might have felt the same but the raf let machines carry warriors to combat in a lanc bagnall could do things no infantry could match now quite literally he found the shoe on the other foot the sun swung through the sky shadows lengthened deepened somehow bagnall kept up with everyone else as shadows gave way to twilight he saw the men ahead of him going down on their bellies so he did too he slithered forward through breaks in the forest he saw a few houseshuts reallyplopped down in the middle of a clearing thats it he whispered how the devil should i know ken embry whispered back somehow though i dont think weve been invited here for high tea bagnall didnt think the village had ever heard of high tea by its look he wondered if it had heard of the passing of the tsars the wooden buildings with carved walls and thatched roofs looked like something out of a novel by tolstoy the only hint of the twentieth century was razor wire strung around a couple of houses no one human or lizard was in sight it cant be as easy as it looks bagnall said id like it if it were embry answered and who says it cant we off in the distance a small pop interrupted him bagnall had been involved in dropping countless tons of bombs and had been on the receiving end of more antiaircraft fire than he cared to think about but this was the first time hed done his fighting on the ground the mortar tired again and again fast as its crewbagnall didnt know whether they were russians or germanscould serve it with bombs snow and dirt fountained upward as the mortar rounds hit home one of the wooden houses caught fire and began to burn merrily men in white burst from the trees and dashed across the clearing bagnall wondered if the village really was a lizard outpost after all he fired the mauser worked the bolt fired again hed trained on a leeenfield and vastly preferred it to the weapon he was holding instead of angling down to where it was easy to reach the mausers bolt stuck straight out which made quick firing difficult and the german rifles magazine held only five rounds not ten other rifles started hammering and a couple of machine guns too still no response came from the village bagnall began to feel almost sure they were attacking a place empty of the enemy relief and rage fought in himrelief that he wasnt in danger after all rage that hed made that long miserable march in the snow then one of the whitecloaked figures flew through the air torn almost in two by the land mine hed stepped on and then muzzle flashes began winking from a couple of the village buildings as the lizards returned fire the charging yelling humans began to go down as if scythed bullets kicked up snow between bagnall and embry whacked into the trees behind which they hid bagnall hugged the frozen earth like a lover shooting back was the last thing on his mind this was he decided in an instant a much uglier business than war in the air in the lanc you dropped your bombs on people thousands of feet below they shot back yes but at your aircraft not at your precious and irreplaceable self even fighter aircraft didnt go after you personallytheir object was to wreck your plane and your gunners were trying to do the same to them and even if your aircraft got shot down you might bail out and survive it wasnt machine against machine here the lizards were doing their best to blow large holes in his body so hed scream and bleed and die their best seemed appallingly good too every one of however many lizards there were in the village had an automatic weapon that spat as much lead as one of the raiders machine guns and many times as much as a boltaction rifle like his mauser he felt like kiplings fuzzywuzzy charging a british square but you couldnt charge here not if you felt like living the russians and germans whod tried it were most of them down some chewed to bits by a hail of bullets others shredded like the first luckless fellow by stepping on a mine the few still on their feet could not go forward they fled for the shelter of the woods bagnall turned to embry shouted i think we just stuck our tools in the meat grinder whatever gave you that idea dearie even in the middle of battle the pilot managed to come up with a high shrill falsetto in the gathering gloom one of the houses in the village began to move at first bagnall rubbed his eyes wondering if they were playing tricks on him then after mussorgsky he thought of the baba yaga the witchs hut that ran on chickens legs but as the wooden walls fell away he saw that this house moved on tracks tank he screamed its a bleeding tank the russians were yelling the same thing save with a broad a rather than his sharp one the germans screamed panzer instead bagnall understood that too he also understood that a tankno two tanks now he sawmeant big trouble their turrets swiveled toward the heaviest firing machine guns opened up on them as they did so streams of bullets struck sparks from their armor but theyd been made to withstand heavier artillery than most merely earthly tanks commandedthe machine guns might as well have been firing feathers their own machine guns started shooting muzzle flashes winking like fireflies one of the raiders machine gunsa new german one with such a high cyclic rate that it sounded like a giant ripping an enormous canvas sail when it opened upabruptly fell silent it started up again a few seconds later bagnall admired the spirit of the men who had taken over for its surely fallen crew then the main armament of one of the tanks spoke or rather bellowed from less than half a mile away it sounded to bagnall like the end of the world while the tongue of flame it spat put him in mind of hellmouth opening the machine gun stopped firing once more and this time did not open up again the other tanks cannon fired too then slowed so it pointed more nearly in bagnalls direction he scrambled deeper into the woods anything to put more distance between himself and that hideous gun ken embry was right with him how the devil do you say run like bloody hell in russian he asked not a phrase ive learned im afraid but i dont believe the partisans need our advice in that regard bagnall answered russians and germans alike were in full retreat the tanks hastening on their wayand hastening too many of them into the world to comewith more cannon rounds shell splinters and real splinters blown off trees hissed through the air with deadly effect someones reconnaissance slipped up badly embry said this was supposed to be an infantry outpost no one said a word about going up against armor bagnall only grunted what embry had said was selfevidently true men were dying because of it his main hope at present was not being one who did through the crash of the cannon he heard another noise one he didnt recognize a quick deep thutter that seemed to come out of the air whats that he said beside him embry shrugged the russians were running faster than ever crying vertolyet and avtozhir neither word unfortunately meant anything to bagnall fire came out of the sky from just above treetop height streaks of flame as if from a katyusha launcher taken aloft and mounted on a flying machine instead of a truck the woods exploded into flame as the rocket warheads detonated bagnall shrieked like a lost soul but couldnt even hear himself whatever had fired the rockets it wasnt an ordinary airplane it hung in the sky hovering like a mosquito the size of a young whale as it loosed another salvo of rockets on the humans who had presumed to attack a lizard position more deadly shrapnel flew buffeted half stunned by the blast bagnall lay flat on the ground as he might have during a great earthquake and prayed the pounding would end but another helicopter came whickering up from the south and poured two more salvos of rockets into the raiders ranks both machines hovered overhead and raked the forest with machinegun fire the tanks came crashing closer too smashing down everything that stood in their way but the bigger trees somebody booted bagnall in the backside hard get up and run you bloody twit the words were in english bagnall turned his head it was ken embry his foot drawn back for another kick im all right bagnall said and proved it by getting up as soon as he was on his pins again adrenaline made him run like a deer he fled northor at any rate away from the tanks and the helicopters killing ground embry matched him stride for desperate stride somewhere in their mad dash bagnall gasped out wheres alf he bought his plot back there im afraid embry answered that hit bagnall likelike a machinegun round from one of the deathships up there he thought watching russians and germans he didnt know getting shot or blown to bits was one thing losing someone from his own crew was ten times worseas if a flak burst had torn through the side of his lancaster and slaughtered a bombardier and since whyte washad beenone of the three other men in pskov with whom he could speak freely he felt the loss all the more bullets still slashed the woods most of them though behind the fleeing englishmen now the lizards tanks did not press the pursuit as aggressively as they might have maybe theyre afraid of taking a molotov cocktail from someone up a tree whom they dont spy till too late embry suggested when bagnall said that out loud maybe they are the flight engineer said im damned sure im afraid of them the gunfire and rockets and cannon rounds had left his ears as dazed as any other part of him dimly as if from far away he heard screams of terror and the even more appalling shrieks of the wounded one of the helicopters flew away then after a last hosing of the woods with bullets the other one bagnall looked down at his wrist the glowing hands of his watch said only twenty minutes had gone by since the first shots were fired those twenty minutes of hell had stretched for an eternity though not ordinarily a religious man bagnall wondered how long a real eternity of hell would seem to last then his thoughts snapped back to the present for he almost stumbled over a wounded russian lying in a pool of blood that looked black against the snow at night bozhemoi the russian moaned bozhemoi my god bagnall gasped unconsciously translating ken come over here and help me its a woman i hear the pilot and bagnall stooped beside the wounded partisan she pressed a hand against her side trying to stanch the flow of blood as gently as he could bagnall undid her quilted coat and tunic so he could see the wound he had to force her hand away before he could bandage it with gauze from his aid kit she groaned and thrashed and weakly tried to fight him off nemtsi she wailed she thinks were jerries embry said here give her this too he pressed a morphia syrette into bagnalls hand even as he made the injection bagnall thought it a waste of precious drug she wasnt going to live her blood had already soaked the bandage maybe a hospital could have saved her but here in the middle of a frozen nowhere artzt he yelled in german gibt es artzt hier is there a doctor here no one answered he and embry and the wounded woman might have been alone in the woods she sighed as the morphia bit into her pain took a couple of easy breaths and died she went out peacefully anyhow embry said bagnall realized the pilot hadnt thought shed make it either hed done her the last favor he could by freeing her death from agony bagnall said now we have to think about staying alive ourselves in the middle of the cold woods after a crushing defeat that showed only too clearly how the lizards had seized and held great stretches of territory from the mightiest military machines the world had known that seemed to require considerable thought liu han called come and see the foreign devil do amazing things with stick and ball and glove come and see come and see mountebanks of all sorts could be sure of an audience in the chinese refugee camp behind her bobby fiore tossed into the air the leathercovered ball hed had made instead of catching it in his hands he tapped it lightly with his special sticka bat he called it the ball went a couple of feet into the air came straight down he tapped it up again and again and again all the while he whistled a merry tune see liu han pointed to him the foreign devil juggles without using his hands a spattering of applause came from the crowd three or four people tossed coins into the bowl that lay by liu hans feet some others set rice cakes and vegetables on the mat next to the bowl everyone understood that entertainers had to eat or they wouldnt be able to entertain when no donations came for a minute or so bobby fiore tapped the ball up one last time caught it in his free hand and glanced toward liu han she looked out into the crowd and said who will play a game where if he wins the foreign devil will look ridiculous who will try this simple game several men shouted and stepped toward her nothing delighted chinese more than making a european or american into an object of ridicule liu han pointed toward the bowl and the mat if they wanted to play they had to pay a couple of them made their offerings without a word but one asked belligerently what is this game bobby fiore handed her the ball she held it up in one hand bent to pick up a flat canvas bag stuffed with rags which she displayed in the other then she put the bag back on the ground gave the ball to the belligerent man a simple game an easy game she said the foreign devil will stand well back and then run toward the bag all you have to do is stand in front of it and touch him with the ball before he reaches it win and you get back your stake and twice as much besides that is easy the man with the ball puffed out his chest and tossed a silver trade dollar into the bowl it rang sweetly i will put the ball on him no matter what he does liu han turned to the crowd clear a path please clear a path so the foreign devil can run chattering among themselves the people moved aside to form a narrow lane bobby fiore walked down it when he was almost a hundred feet from the man with the ball he turned and bowed to him the arrogant fellow did not return his courtesy a couple of people clucked reproachfully at that but most didnt think a foreign devil deserved much courtesy bobby fiore bowed again then ran straight at the man with the ball the chinese man clutched it in both hands as if it were a rock he set himself for a collision as fiore bore down on him but the collision never came at the last instant fiore threw himself to the ground on his hip and thigh and hooked around the clumsy lunge the man made with the ball his foot came down on the stuffed bag safe he yelled in his own language liu han didnt quite know what safe meant but she knew it meant hed won whos next she called taking the ball from the disgruntled chinese man wait he said angrily then turned and played to the crowd you all saw that the foreign devil cheated me fear coursed through liu han she called bobby fiore yang kweitseforeign devilherself but only to identify him in the angry mans mouth it was a cry to turn an audience into a mob before she could answer fiore spoke for himself in clumsy chinese not cheat not say let win he quick he win he slooow he stretched the last word out in a way no native chinese would have used but one insultingly effective hes right wuyou missed him by a li someone yelled from the crowd the miss hadnt really been a third of a mile but it hadnt been close either here give me the ball now someone else said ill put it on the foreign devil he said yang kweitse the same way liu han did to name bobby fiore not to revile him liu han pointed to the bowl as wu stamped away the next player tossed in some paper money from manchukuo it wasnt worth as much as silver and liu han did not like it because of what manchukuos japanese puppet masters had done to chinaand to her own family just before the lizards came but the japanese were still fighting hard against the lizards which gave them prestige they hadnt had before she let the bills lay handed the man the ball bobby fiore brushed dirt off his pants shooed the spectators back so he could take his running start the chinese man stood in front of the bag holding the ball in his left hand and leaning left as if to make sure fiore wouldnt use on him the trick that had fooled the first player bobby fiore ran down the aisle of chattering chinese as before when he got within a couple of strides of the waiting chinese he took a small step in the direction the fellow was leaning ha the man cried in triumph and brought the ball down but bobby fiore was not there to be tagged after that small step made the man commit himself fiore took a long hard stride on his other leg changing directions as nimbly as any acrobat liu han had ever seen the man tagged to the left bobby fiore slid to the right safe he yelled again the man with the ball ruefully flipped it to liu han his sheepish grin said he knew hed been outsmarted lets see if this fellow can put the ball on the foreign devil he said now using the label almost in admiration if i couldnt ill make a side bet he cant either another man set down a meaty slab of pork ribs to pay for the privilege of trying to tag bobby fiore the fellow making side bets did a brisk business now that fiore had gone one way and then the other what tricks could he have left he promptly demonstrated a new one instead of going right or left he dove straight toward the bag on his belly snaked a hand through his opponents legs and grabbed the bag before the ball touched his back safe now a couple of people in the crowd raised the victory cry with him he kept running and sliding as long as men were willing to pay to try to put the ball on him sometimes hed hook one way sometimes the other and once in a while hed dive straight in a couple of people did manage to guess right and tag him but liu han watched the bowl fill with money and the mat with food they were doing well when the sport began to seem routine rather than novel liu han called who wants revenge she tossed the ball up and down in her hand you can throw at the foreign devil now he will not dodge but if you hit him anywhere but his two hands you win three times what you wager who will try while she warmed up the crowd bobby fiore put on the padded leather glove hed had made along with the ball he stood in front of the wall of a shack then made a fist with his other hand and pounded it into the glove as if confident no one would be able to touch him from how close do we get to throw asked the man whod been making side bets liu han paced off about forty feet bobby fiore grinned at her do you want to try she asked the man yes ill fling at him he answered dropping more money into the bowl ill put it right between his ugly round eyes you see if i dont he tossed the ball into the air once or twice as if to get the feel of it in his hand and then as hed said threw it right at bobby fiores head whack the noise it made striking that peculiar leather glove was like a gunshot it startled liu han and startled the people in the crowd even more a couple of them let out frightened squawks bobby fiore rolled the ball back to liu han she stooped to pick it up before long that wouldnt be easy not with her belly growing whos next she asked whoever it is he can wager with me that he misses too said the fellow who liked to make side bets ill pay five to one if he hits if he couldnt beat bobby fiore he was convinced nobody could the next gambler paid liu han and let fly wham that wasnt ball hitting glove that was ball banging against the side of the shackthe man had thrown too wildly for bobby fiore to catch his offering fiore picked up the ball and tossed it gently back to him you try again he said hed practiced the phrase with liu han before the fellow could take another throw at him the old woman who lived in the shack came out and screamed at liu han what are you doing are you trying to frighten me out of my wits stop hitting my poor house with a club i thought a bomb landed on it no bomb grandmother liu han said politely we are only playing a gambling game the old woman kept on screaming until liu han gave her three trade dollars then she disappeared back into her shack obviously not caring what happened to it after that the fellow who hadnt thrown straight took another shot at bobby fiore this time he was on target but fiore caught the ball the man squalled curses like a scalded cat if the old woman had thought that first ball was like a bomb landing she must have figured the lizards had singled out her house for bombardment practice by the time the next hour had passed one of the things liu han discovered about her countrymen during that time was that they didnt throw very well a couple of them missed the shack altogether that sent boys chasing wildly after the runaway ball and meant liu han had to pay small bribes to get it back when no one else felt like trying to hit the quickhanded foreign devil liu han said who has a bottle or clay pot he doesnt mind losing a tall man took a last swig from a bottle of plum brandy then handed it to her now i do he said thickly breathing plummy fumes into her face she gave the bottle to bobby fiore who set it on an upsidedown bucket in front of the wall he walked back farther than the spot from which the chinese had taken aim at him the foreign devil will show you how to throw properly liu han said this last stunt made her nervous the bottle looked very small bobby fiore could easily miss and if he did hed lose face his features were set and tighthe knew he could miss too his arm went back then snapped forward in a motion longer and smoother than the chinese had used the ball flew almost invisibly fast the bottle shattered green glass flew every which way chatter from the crowd rose to an impressed peak several people clapped their hands bobby fiore bowed as if he were chinese himself thats all for today liu han said we will present our show again in a day or two i hope you enjoyed it she picked up all the food the show had earned them bobby fiore carried the money he also hung onto ball and bat and glove that made him different from all the chinese men liu han had known they would have added to her burden without a second thought shed already seen up in the plane that never came down that he had the strange ways ascribed to foreign devils some of them such as his taste in food annoyed her this one she found endearing show good he asked tacking on the lizards interrogative cough the show was very good liu han used the emphatic cough to underline that adding you were very good too there especially at the endyou took a chance with the bottle but it worked so all the better of necessity she spoke mostly in chinese which meant she had to repeat herself several times and go back to use simpler words when fiore understood he grinned and slipped an arm around her thickening waist she dropped an onion so she could break away to pick it up showing affection in public was one foreign devil way she wished he would forget in a hurry it not only embarrassed her but lowered her status in the eyes of everyone who saw her as they approached the hut they shared she stopped fretting over such relatively trivial concerns several little scaly devils stood outside two with fancy body paint and the rest with guns their unnerving turreted eyes swung toward liu han and bobby fiore one of the little devils with fancy paint spoke in hissing but decent chinese you are the human beings who live in this house the human beings brought down from the ship th emperor fessoj the last three words were in his own language yes superior sir liu han said by his perplexed look bobby fiore hadnt understood the question even though the scaly devil used words that were individually intelligible she had trouble following him too imagine calling the airplane that never came down a ship which of you is carrying the growing thing that will become a human being in her belly the devil with the fancy paint asked i am superior sir not for the first time liu han felt a flash of contempt for the little scaly devils they not only couldnt tell people apart they couldnt even tell the sexes apart and bobby fiore with his tall nose and round eyes was unique in this camp yet the little devils didnt recognize him as a foreign devil one of the guncarrying little devils pointed at liu han and hissed something to a companion the other devils mouth fell open in a devilish laugh they found people preposterous too the little devil who spoke chinese said go in this little house the two of you we have things to say to you things to ask of you liu han and bobby fiore went into the hut so did the two little devils with elaborate paint on their scaly hides and so did one of the more drably marked guards the two higherranking little devils skittered past liu han so they could sit on the hearth that also supported the huts bedding they sank down on the warm clay with rapturous sighsliu han had seen they didnt like cold weather the guard who liked it no better had to stand where he could keep his eyes on the obviously vicious and dangerous humans i am ttomalss the scaly devil who spoke chinese saida stutter at the front of his name and a hiss at the end first i ask you what you were doing with these strange things he turned his eye turrets toward the ball and bat and glove bobby fiore held and pointed at them as well do you speak english fiore asked in that language when liu han had put the question into their peculiar jargon when neither little scaly devil answered he muttered shit and turned back to her saying you better answer they wont follow me any more than i follow them superior sir liu han began bowing to ttomalss as if he were her village headman back in the days was it really less than a year before when shed had a headman or a village we use these things to put on a show to entertain people here in this camp and earn money and food for ourselves ttomalss hissed to translate that to his companion who might not have known any human language the other scaly devil hissed back ttomalss turned his words into chinese why do you need these things we give you this house we give you enough to get food you need why do you want more do you not have enough liu han thought about that it was a question that went straight to the heart of the tao the way a person should live having too muchor caring in excess about having too muchwas reckoned bad though shed noticed that few people who had a lot were inclined to give up any of it cautiously she answered superior sir we seek to save what we can so we will not be at want if hunger comes to this camp and we want money for the same reason and to make our lives more comfortable can this be wrong the scaly devil did not reply directly instead he said what sort of show is this it had better not be one that endangers the hatchling growing inside you it does not superior sir she assured him she would have been happier for his concern had it meant he cared for her and the baby as persons she knew it didnt the only value she the baby and bobby fiore had to the little devils was as parts of their experiment that worried her too what would they do when shed had the child snatch it away from her as theyd snatched her away from her village force her to find out how fast she could get pregnant again the unpleasant possibilities were countless what do you do then ttomalss demanded suspiciously mostly i speak for bobby fiore who does not speak chinese well she said i tell the audience how he will hit and catch and throw the ball this is an art he brings with him from his own country and not one with which we chinese are familiar things that are new and strange entertain us help us pass the time this is foolishness the little devil said the old the familiar should be what entertains the new and strangehow could they be interesting you will not bewhat is the word familiar with them is this not frightening to you he was even more conservative than a chinese liu han realized that rocked her the little scaly devils had torn up her life to say nothing of turning china and the whole world on their ear moreover the little devils had their vast array of astonishing machines everything from the cameras that took pictures in three dimensions to the dragonfly planes that could hover in the sky shed thought of them as flighty gadgeteers as if they were americans or other foreign devils with scales and body paint but it wasnt so bobby fiore had almost burst with excitement at the idea of bringing something new into the prison camp and making a profit from it shed liked the notion too to the scaly devil it seemed as alien and menacing as the devil did to her her woolgathering irritated ttomalss answer me he snapped im sorry superior sir she said quickly she didnt want to get the little devils annoyed at her they might cast her and bobby fiore out of this home they might take her back to the plane that never came down and turn her into a whore again they might take her baby away as soon as it was born or they might do any number of appalling things she couldnt imagine now she went on i was just thinking that human beings like new things i know that ttomalss did not approve of it his blunt little stump of a tail switched back and forth like an angry cats it is the great curse of you big uglies the last two words were in his own language liu han had heard the little scaly devils use them often enough to know what they meant ttomalss resumed were it not for the mad curiosity of your kind the race would have brought your world under our sway long ago i am sorry but i do not follow you superior sir liu han said what does this have to do with preferring new entertainments to old when we see the same old thing over and over we grow bored how getting bored at old shows was tied to the devils not conquering the world was beyond her the race also has this thing you call growing bored ttomalss admitted but with us it comes on more slowly and over a long long time we are more content with what we already have than is true of your kind so are the other two races we know you big uglies break the pattern liu han did not worry about breaking patterns she did wonder if shed understood the scaly devil aright were there other kinds of weird creatures besides his own she found it hard to believe but she wouldnt have believed in the scaly devils a year earlier ttomalss stepped forward squeezed at her left breast with his clawed fingers hey bobby fiore said and started to get to his feet the scaly devil with a gun turned it his way its all right liu han said quickly hes not hurting me that was true his touch was gentle although his claws penetrated her cotton tunic and pricked against her skin they did not break it you will give the hatchling liquid from your body out of these for it to eat ttomalss asked his chinese becoming awkward as he spoke of matters and bodily functions unfamiliar to his kind milk yes liu han said giving him the word he lacked milk the scaly devil repeated the word to fix it in his memory just as liu han did when she picked up something in english ttomalss continued when you mate this malehe pointed at bobby fiorechews there too does he get milk as well no no liu han had all she could do not to laugh then why do this ttomalss demanded what is itsfunction is that the proper word that is the proper word yes superior sir liu han sighed the little devils talked so openly about mating that her own sense of shame and reticence had eroded but he does not draw milk from them he does it to give me pleasure and to arouse himself ttomalss gave a oneword verdict disgusting he spoke in his own language to the other little devil with fancy paint that one and the guard both swung their eyes from liu han to bobby fiore and back again whats going on fiore demanded honey they asking filthy questions again though he liked publicly showing affection in a way in which no chinese would have felt easy he was and had stayed far more reticent than liu han in speaking of intimate matters yes she answered resignedly the scaly devil with fancy paint who didnt speak chinese sent several excited sentences at ttomalss who turned to liu han you use the keekreek this is our speech not yours i am sorry superior sir but i do not know what the keekreek is liu han said the ttomalss made the little devils interrogative cough do you understand now yes superior sir liu han said now i understand bobby fiore is a foreign devil from a country far away his words and my words are not the same when we were up in the plane that never came down the what ttomalss interrupted when liu han explained the little devil said oh you mean the ship liu han still wondered how it could be a ship if it never touched water but the little devil seemed insistent about the point so she said when we were up in the ship then superior sir we had to learn each others words since we both knew some of yours we used those too and we still do ttomalss translated for the other little scaly devil who spoke volubly in reply starrafttomalss finally named the other devilsays you could do without all this moving back and forth between languages if you spoke only one as we do when your world is all ours all you big uglies who survive will use our language just as the rabotevs and halessi the other races in the empire do now liu han could see that having everyone speak the same language would be simpler even other dialects of chinese were beyond her easy comprehension but the unspoken assumptions in the scaly devils words chilled her ttomalss seemed very sure his kind would conquer the world and also that they would be able to do as they pleased with its people or as many of them as were left when the conquest was complete starraf spoke again and ttomalss translated you have shown and we have seen at other places that you big uglies are not too stupid to learn the tongue of the race maybe we should begin to teach it in this camp and others so that you can begin to be joined to the empire now what bobby fiore asked they want to teach everyone how to talk the way we do liu han answered shed known the scaly devils were overwhelmingly powerful from the moment they first descended on her village somehow though shed never thought much about what they were doing to the rest of the world she was only a villager after all and didnt worry about the wider world unless some part of it impinged on her life all at once she realized the little devils didnt just want to conquer mankind they aimed to make people as much like themselves as they could she hated that even more than she hated anything else about the little scaly devils but she hadnt the slightest idea how to stop it mordechai anielewicz stood at attention in zolraags office as the lizard governor of poland chewed him out the situation in warsaw grows more unsatisfactory with each passing day zolraag said in pretty good german the cooperation between you jews and the race which formerly existed seems to have disappeared anielewicz scowled after what the nazis had done to the warsaw ghetto hearing the word jews in german was plenty to set his teeth on edge all by itself and zolraag used it with arrogance of a sort not far removed from that of the germans the only difference anielewicz could see was that the lizards thought of all humans not just jews as untermenschen whose fault is that he demanded not wanting zolraag to know he was concerned we welcomed you as liberators we shed our blood to help you take this city if youremember superior sir and what thanks do we get to be treated almost as badly under your thumb as we were under the nazis that is not true zolraag said we have given you enough guns to make your fighters the equal of the armija krajowa the polish home army where you were below them we set you above how do you say we treat you badly i say it because you care nothing for our freedom the jewish fighting leader answered you use us for your own purposes and to help make slaves of other people we have been slaves ourselves we didnt like it we dont see any reason to think other people like it either the race will rule this world and all its people zolraag said as confidently as if hed remarked the sun will come up tomorrow those who work with us will have higher place than those who do not before the war anielewicz had been a largely secularized jew hed gone to a polish gymnasium and university and studied latin he knew what the latin equivalent of work together was too collaborate he also knew what hed thought of the estonian latvian and ukrainian jackals who helped the german wolves patrol the warsaw ghettoand what hed thought of the jewish police who betrayed their own people for a crust of bread superior sir he said earnestly with the guns we have from you we can protect ourselves from the poles and that is very good but most of us would rather die than help you in the way you mean this i have seen and this i do not understand zolraag said why would you forgo such advantage because of what we would have to do to get it anielewicz answered poor moishe russie wouldnt speak your lies so you had to play tricks with his words to make them come out the way you wanted them no wonder he disappeared after that and no wonder he made you out to be liars the first chance he got zolraags eye turrets swung toward him that slow deliberate motion held as much menace as if theyd contained centimeter battleship guns rather than organs of vision we are still seeking to learn more of these events ourselves he said herr russie was an associate even a friend of yours we wonder how and if you helped him you questioned me under your truth drug anielewicz reminded him we have not learned as much with it as we hoped from early tests zolraag said some early experimental subjects may have deceived us as to their reactions you tosevites have a gift for being difficult in unusual ways thank you anielewicz said grinning i did not mean it as a compliment zolraag snapped anielewicz knew that since hed been up to his eyebrows in getting russie away and in making the recording in which russie blasted the lizards he was less than delighted to learn the lizards had found their drug was worthless zolraag resumed i did not summon you here herr anielewicz to listen to your tosevite foolishness i summoned you here to warn you that the uncooperative attitude of you jews must stop if it does not we will disarm you and put you back in the place where you were when we came to tosev anielewicz gave the lizard a long slow measuring stare it comes to that does it he said at last it does you will not disarm us without a fight anielewicz said flatly we beat the germans do you think we cannot beat you i am sure you can anielewicz said superior sir we will fight anyhow now that we have guns we will not give them up you will beat us but one way or another we will manage to hurt you you will probably set off the poles too if you take our guns away theyll fear youll take theirs too zolraag didnt answer right away anielewicz hoped hed managed to distress the lizard the race was good at war or at least had machines of almost invincible power when it came to diplomacy though they were as children they had no feel for the likely effects of their actions the lizard governor said you do not seem to understand herr anielewicz we can hold your people hostage to make sure you turn in your rifles and other weapons superior sir you are the one who does not understand anielewicz answered whatever you want to do to us we went through worse before you came we will fight to keep that from happening again will you start up auschwitz and treblinka and chelmno and the rest again do not make disgusting suggestions the german death camps had revolted all the lizards zolraag included theyd gotten good propaganda mileage out of them there russie and anielewicz and other jews had felt no compunctions about helping the lizards tell the world the story well then in that case we have nothing to lose by fighting anielewicz said we were getting ready to fight the nazis even though we had next to nothing now we have guns if you are going to treat us the way the nazis did do you think wed not fight you what would we have to lose your lives zolraag said anielewicz spat on the floor of the governors office he didnt know whether zolraag knew how much scorn the gesture showed but he hoped so he said what good are our lives if you push us back into the ghetto and starve us once more no one will do that to us again superior sir no one do what you like with me the next jew you pick as puppet leader will tell you the sameor his own people will deal with him you are serious in this matter zolraag said in tones of wonder of course i am anielewicz answered have you talked with general borkomorowski about taking guns away from the home army he did not seem pleased with the idea but he did not reject it in the way you have zolraag said hes politer than i am anielewicz said adding the alter kacker to himself aloud he went on that doesnt mean youll get any real cooperation from him we get no real cooperation from any tosevites zolraag said mournfully we thought you jews were an exception but i see it is not so we owed you a lot for throwing out the nazis and saving us from the death camps anielewicz said if youd treated us as free people who deserved respect we would have worked with you but you just want to be another set of masters and treat everyone on earth the way the nazis treated us we would not kill the way the germans did zolraag protested no but you would enslave when you were through not a human being on this world would be free i do not see that this matters zolraag said i know you dont anielewicz saidsadly for zolraag was given the limits of his position a decent enough being some of the germans had been that way too not all by any means enjoyed exterminating jews for the sake of extermination but enjoy it or not theyd done it as zolraag resented freedom now that ate at anielewiczs nineteen hundred years before tacitus had remarked with pride that good menthe one in particular he had in mind was his fatherinlawcould serve a bad roman emperor but when a bad ruler required good men to do monstrous things how could they obey and remain good hed asked himself the question more times than he could count but never yet found an answer zolraag said you claim we cannot make you obey by force i do not believe this but you say it let us think does this language have a word for thinking of something so as to examine it assume is the word you want anielewicz said assume thank you let us assume then that what you say is true how in this case are we to rule you jews and have you obey our requirements i wish you would have asked that before events drove a wedge between you and us anielewicz answered the best way i think is not to force us to do anything that would damage the rest of mankind even the germans zolraag asked the jewish fighting leaders lips curled in what was not a smile zolraag knew his business sure enough what the nazis had done to the jews in polandall over europecried out for vengeance but if the jews collaborated with the lizards against the germans how could they say no to collaborating with them against other peoples as well that dilemma had sent moishe russie first into hiding and then into flight dont use us as your propaganda front anielewicz knew he wasnt answering directly but he could not force himself to say yes or no whether you win your war or lose it you make the rest of the world hate us by doing that why should we care zolraag asked the trouble was he sounded curious not vindictive sighing anielewicz replied because that would give you your best chance of ruling here quietly if you make other people hate us youll also make us hate you we gave you privileges early on because you did help us against the germans zolraag said by our way of thinking you abused them issuing threats will not make us want to give you more you may go herr anielewicz as you say superior sir anielewicz answered woodenly trouble coming he thought as he left the lizard governors office hed managed to get zolraag to hold off on trying to disarm the jews or at least he thought he had but that wasnt concession enough he sighed hed found a hiding place for russie now he was liable to need one himself vii i wish we were in denver barbara said well so do i sam yeager answered as he helped her out of the wagon the weather cant be helped though lateseason snowstorms had held them up as they made their way into colorado fort collins is a pretty enough little place lincoln park in which several met lab wagons were drawn up was a study in contrasts in the center of the square stood a log cabin the first building that had gone up on the poudre river the big gray sandstone mass of the carnegie public library showed how far the area had come in just over eighty years but barbara said thats not what i mean she took his arm and steered him away from the wagon he looked back toward ulhass and ristin decided the lizard pows werent going anywhere and let her guide him she led him over to a tree stump out of earshot of anybody else whats up he asked checking the lizards again they hadnt poked their heads out of the wagon they were staying down in the straw where it was warmer he was as sure as sure could be that they wouldnt pick this moment to make a break but ingrained duty made him keep an eye on them anyhow then barbara asked him something that sounded as if it came out of the blue remember our wedding night huh im not likely to forget it as sam remembered a broad smile spread over his face barbara didnt smile back remember what we didnt do on our wedding night she persisted there wasnt a whole lot we didnt do on our wedding night we yeager stopped when he took a close look at barbaras halfworried halfsmiling expression a light went on inside his head slowly he said we didnt use a rubber thats right she said i thought it would be safe enough and even if it wasnt her smile grew broader but still had a twist in it my time of the month should have started a week ago it didnt and ive always been very steady so i think im expecting a baby sam had it been a normal marriage in a normal time he would have shouted thats wonderful the time was anything but normal the marriage very new yeager knew barbara hadnt wanted to get pregnant he set down his rifle took her in his arms they clung to each other for a couple of minutes itll work out he said at last one way or another well take care of it and itll be okay im scared she said not many doctors or equipment and us in the middle of the war denvers supposed to be better off than most places he said itll be all right honey please god make it all right he thought something that would have been closer to a real prayer if god had given any signs lately of listening after another few seconds he went on i hope its a girl you do why because shed probably look just like you her eyes widened she stood up on tiptoe to give him a quick kiss youre sweet sam it wasnt what i expected but she kicked at the dirty snow and at the mud that showed through it what can you do for a career minor leaguer what can you do was an article of faith that ranked right alongside the commandments moses had brought down from the mountain actually yeager knew there was something you could do if you wanted to but finding an abortionist wouldnt be easy and the procedure was liable to be more dangerous than having the baby if barbara brought it up hed think about it then otherwise hed keep his mouth shut she said well just do the best we can thats all right sure honey sam said like i said well manage the idea kind of grows on me you know what i mean yes i do barbara nodded i didnt want this to happen but now that it has im scared as i said but im excited too something of ours to go on after were gonethats something special and something wonderful yeah yeager saw himself tying a little girls shoes or maybe playing catch with a boy and teaching him to hit well enough to get all the way to the top in pro ball what the father might have done the son would he would anyhow if the lizards were beaten and there ever was pro ball again sam should have been in spring training getting ready for yet another season on the road hoping to move up as better players got drafted still with a ghostly chance at a bigleague slot and glory as it was someone shouted back to the wagons everybody theyre going to billet us at the college on the south edge of town yeager hadnt thought fort collins big enough to boast a college you never can tell he muttered which would have been a good handle for the whole past year hand in hand he and barbara walked back toward ullhass and ristin careful getting up there he warned as she scrambled in she made a face at him for gods sake sam im not made out of cut glass if you start treating me as if i were going to fall to pieces any minute now well have trouble sorry he said ive never had to worry about anybody expecting before the wagon drivers head whipped around you gonna have a baby thats great congratulations thanks she said as the wagon rattled forward she shook her head wryly yeager knew she wasnt as delighted as she might have been he wasnt either he couldnt imagine a worse time to try to raise a kid but all they could do now was give it their best shot sure enough the colorado state college of agriculture and the mechanic arts sat on the southern border of fort collins its red and gray brick buildings clustered along an oval drive that ran through the heart of the campus the cafeteria wasnt far from the south end of the drive women in surprisingly clean white dished out fried chicken and biscuits that was good but the burntgrain brew they called coffee tried to bite off yeagers tongue where do we sleep tonight he asked as he walked out of the cafeteria girls dormitory a soldier answered pointing northward grinning he went on jeez i dreamed for years of getting into one o those but it just aint the same this way the only rooms in the dorm with doors that locked from the outside were the rest moms fortunately it had three so sam didnt feel guilty about commandeering one for the lizard prisoners to use during the night he and barbara had a twocoed room for themselves looking at the steelframed cots he said i think id sooner have been quartered with some nice friendly people back in town itll be all right for one night she said its easier for them to keep track of us if were together here instead of scattered around fort collins i suppose so he said unenthusiastic still but then as he set his rifle down be exclaimed im going to be a father how about that how about that barbara echoed only one candle lit the room her face was hard to read electricity had taken the mystery out of night turned it bright and certain as day now mystery was back with a vengeance yeager studied the shifting shadows well do the best we can thats all he said as he had when she first gave him the news i know she answered what else can we do and she added if anyone can take care of me and help me take care of a baby i know its you sam i do love you you know that yeah i love you too hon she sat down on one of the cots smiled over at him how shall we celebrate the news no booze around no firecrackers i guess well just have to make our own fireworks how does that sound it sounds good to me barbara took off her shoes then stood up for a moment so she could slide out of her slacks and panties when she sat down again she made a face and bounced back to her feet that wool blanket scratches wait a second let me turn down the sheet some happy time later sam asked do you want me to put on a rubber in case youre wrong dont bother she said im regular as clockwork even getting sick doesnt throw me off and i havent been sick the only thing that could make me this late is a bun in the oven and since theres one in there we dont need to worry about keeping the oven door closed okay sam poised himself over her she tilted her hips up to ease his way locked her legs and arms around him afterwards he rubbed at his back shed clawed him pretty hard maybe you should get knocked up more often he said barbara snorted and poked him in the ribs which almost made him fall off the narrow cot then she leaned over and kissed him on the tip of his nose i love you youre crazy im happy is what i am he squeezed her against him tight enough to make her squeak she was all the woman hed ever wanted and then some pretty bright sensible and as hed just delightedly found out again a handful and a half in bed and now she was going to have his baby he stroked her hair i dont know how i could be any happier thats a sweet thing to say im happy with you too she took his hand set it on her belly thats ours in there i wasnt expecting it i wasnt quite ready for it butshe shruggedits here i know youll make a good father a father i dont feel like a father right now he let his hand slide lower through her little nest of hair to the softness it concealed his fingertip traced small slow circles what do you feel like she whispered the candle burned out about then they didnt need it the next morning yeager woke still a little worn feels like i played a doubleheader yesterday he grinned i did the cot squeaked when he sat up the noise woke barbara her cot squeaked too he wondered how much racket theyd made the night before at the time he hadnt noticed barbara rubbed her eyes yawned stretched looked over at him and started to laugh whats so funny he asked he didnt sound as grumpy as he would have a few months before hed finally got usedor resignedto facing the day without coffee she said you have a large male leer pasted all over your face thats whats funny oh now that he thought about it that was funny okay he put his corporals uniform back on the last time it had been washed was in cheyenne hed got usedor resignedto dirty clothes too just about everybodys clothes were dirty these days it wasnt as if corporal sam yeager stood out as a special slob he slung his rifle over his shoulder and said im going downstairs to turn ristin and ullhass loose theyll be glad to see the light of day i expect probably it seems mean to keep them locked up all night long barbara laughed again this time at herself ive been with them so long now that i think of them as people not as lizards i know what you mean i do the same thing myself yeager considered then said come on you get dressed too then we can go over to the cafeteria with them and well have breakfast breakfast was bacon and eggs the bacon came in great thick slices and was obviously homecured it took yeager back to the smokehouse on the nebraska farm where hed grown up the stuff that came in packages of cardboard and waxed paper just didnt have the same flavor the lizard pows wouldnt touch eggs maybe because they were hatched themselves but they loved bacon ristin ran his long lizardy tongue around the edges of his mouth to get rid of grease that is so good he said adding the emphatic cough it reminds me of aasson back on home not salty enough for aasson ullhass said he reached for the salt shaker poured some onto the bacon took another bite ahbetter ristin held out his hand for the salt shaker he too hissed with pleasure after hed sprinkled the bacon sam and barbara exchanged glances the bacon had salt enough for any human palate in the manner of an astounding reader yeager tried to figure out why the lizards wanted it with even more theyd said home was hotter than earth and its seas smaller maybe that meant they were saltier too the way salt lake was when he got to denver hed have to ask somebody about that back to the wagons ullhass and ristin scrambled aboard theirs then all but disappeared under the straw and blankets they used to fight the cold yeager was about to help barbara upno matter what she said he wanted to make sure she took extra care of herselfwhen a fellow on horseback came trotting up the oval drive toward them he was dressed in olive drab and wore a helmet instead of a cavalrymans hat but he put yeager in mind of the old west just the same most of the met lab wagons were untenanted some didnt even have their teams hitched to them yet a lot of people were still eating breakfast the rider reined in when he saw yeager and barbara he called to her maam you wouldnt by any chance know where to find barbara larssen would you i ami wasi am barbara larssen she said what do you want right the first time the cavalryman exclaimed happily talk about your luck he swung down from his horse walked over to barbara maybe its his boots that make him look that way yeager thought they were tall and black and shiny and looked as if theyd hurt like hell if he had to walk more than a few feet in them he reached inside his coat pulled out an envelope handed it to barbara and said this here is for you maam then he stumped back to his horse remounted and rode off trappings jingling without a backward glance yeager watched him go before he turned back to barbara what do you suppose thats all about he said she didnt answer right away she was staring down at the envelope sam took a look at it too it didnt have a stamp or a return address just barbaras name scrawled hastily across it her face was dead pale when she lifted it to him thats jens handwriting she whispered for a couple of seconds it didnt mean anything to yeager then it did oh jesus he muttered he felt as if a lizard shell had just landed next to where he was standing through stunned numbness he heard himself say youd better open it barbara nodded jerkily she almost tore the letter along with the envelope her hands shook as she unfolded the sheet of paper the note inside was in the same handwriting as her name had been yeager read over her shoulder dear barbara i had to twist arms to get them to let me write this and send it to you but i finally managed to do it as youll gather im already in the town youre going toward i had some interesting times getting back to the town from which we both left but came through them all right i hope youre ok too im so glad youll be here sooni miss you more than i can say with all the love there is jens there was a row of xs under the signature barbara looked at the letter then at yeager then at the letter again she held it in her right hand her left hand which didnt seem to know what her right was doing pressed at her belly through the ratty wool sweater she was wearing oh my god she said maybe to herself maybe to yeager and maybe to god what am i supposed to do now what are we supposed to do now yeager echoed she stared at him as if consciously reminded of his presence for the first time then she noticed her hand fingers spread fanfashion stretched over her belly she jerked it away he flinched as if shed hit him her face twisted when she saw that oh sam im sorry she exclaimed i didnt mean she started to cry i dont know what i meant everythings just turned upside down yeah he said laconically he startled himself by laughing barbara glared through tears what could possibly be funny about this this she gave up in the middle of the sentence yeager didnt blame her no words were strong enough to fit the mess theyd just landed in he said last night i found out i was going to be a father and now i dont even know if im a husband any more if that isnt funny what is he wondered if it would be too risque for hollywood to touch probably too bad he could all but see katharine hepburn and cary grant and somebody elserobert young maybeto play the guy who didnt get her all of them going through their antics bigger than life up on the screen it would be a great way to kill a couple of hours and youd come out of the theater holding your sides but it wasnt the same when it really happened to you not when you were wondering whether you had the cary grant part or the robert young one and when you were afraid you knew the answer barbaras small smile was the sun coming out from behind rain clouds that is funny like something out of a silly movie i just thought the very same thing he said eagerly any sign that they were on the same wavelength felt doubly welcome the clouds covered the sun again barbara said somebodys going to get hurt sam im going to have to hurt somebody i love thats the last thing in the world i want but i dont see how i can help it i dont either yeager said he did his best not to show his worry his fear it wouldnt help any more than it would have at the tryout for his first pro team half a lifetime ago would he make it or wouldnt he show them or not the worry and fear were there how could barbara pick him shed been married to jens for years and years while shed only known him a matter of months and they hadnt even been lovers for most of that time and besides with a choice between a nuclear physicist and a minor league outfielder with an ankle that told him when it was gonna rain whom would she take but she was carrying his kid that had to count for something didnt it lord if this was any kind of normal time lawyers would be coming out of the woodwork like cockroaches maybe cops too bigamy adultery maybe the chaos the lizard invasion had brought wasnt such a bad thing after all he sucked in a deep breath honey what is it barbara asked warily shed been reading the letter again he couldnt blame her for that either but just the same he wished she hadnt been he took her hands in his she let him do it but she didnt grab hold of him back the way she usually did the edge of the sheet of paper scraped against the side of his palm he made himself ignore it concentrated on what he had to do as if he were trying to pick up the spin of a curveball right out of the pitchers hand honey he said again and then paused to feel for the perfect words even though barbara knew a thousand times more about words than hed learn if he lived to be a hundred he went on one tough phrase at a time honey the most important thing in the whole world for meis for you to be happy so yougo ahead and dowhatever it is youve got to doand thatll be all right with me because i love you andlike i saidi want you to be happy she started crying again hard this time and buried her head in the hollow of his shoulder what am i supposed to do sam she said between sobs her voice so small and broken he could hardly understand her i love you too and jens and the baby he kept his arms around her he wasnt more than an inch from breaking down and blubbering himself either enrico fermi picked that precise moment to walk up hand in hand with his wife laura is something wrong he asked concern in his accented voice you might say so sir yeager answered then he remembered the physicist needed to know jens larssen was alive too he patted barbara on the back and said honey youd better show dr fermi the letter she handed it to fermi the physicist put on reading glasses peered owlishly through them at the sheet of paper but this is wonderful news he exclaimed his face lighting up in a smile he spoke rapidly in italian to his wife she answered more hesitantly fermis smile went out oh he said it is ah complicated he nodded to himself pleased at finding the right word si complicated it sure is yeager said bleakly its more than just complicated barbara added im going to have a baby oh fermi said again this time echoed by laura he tried again oh my he was completely at home in abstruse realms of thought which sam yeager knew he could never enter but when it came to merely human ways of messing up your life the nobel laureate was just as lost as anybody else somehow that heartened sam we like to say congratulations laura fermis accent was thicker than her husbands she spread her hands helplessly but yeah yeager said but fermi handed the letter back to barbara he said you are good people one way or another i am sure you will work this out in the fashion that is best for all of you he touched a hand to the brim of his hat and walked on with his wife at first yeager was touched at the physicists compliment then he realized fermi had just said its not my problem jack he started to get angry but what was the point of that the man was right one way or another he and barbara and jens would work it out the only trouble was he had no idea what that way might be they made about thirteen miles that day almost all of them in silence barbara seemed lost in her own thoughts and sam didnt want to break in he had plenty on his mind too maybe she also avoided intruding on him ullhass and ristin oblivious to what was going on around them chattered with each other but whenever they ventured into english the answers they got were so monosyllabic they soon gave up the st louis hotel on st louis avenue in loveland had seen better days the food wasnt up to college cafeteria standards and the room sam and barbara got wasnt much bigger than the one at the college dorm it wasnt very clean either it had a double bed at first sam was glad to see that sleeping with barbara warm and soft beside him was one of the joys of his life doing other things on a roomy mattress was wonderful too or it had been anyhow barbara looked at the bed at him back again he could see the same set of thoughts going through her mind as were in his he didnt say anything it wasnt really up to him barbara quickly scanned the rest of the room other than the bed it held only a night table a couple of rickety chairs and a chamber potthe plumbing didnt work then she shook her head im not going to put you on the floor sam she said that wouldnt be right thank you hon hed slept hard while he was out in the field against the lizards he knew he could do it but doing it with his wife in the room would have been unbearably lonely this is even more complicated than i thought it was going to be barbara said she managed a shaky laugh they said it couldnt be done yeahtell me about it sam sat down on one of the chairs pulled off his shoes and let them fall to the threadbare carpet with two loud clunks barbara peeled back the bedspread the blankets underneath were the best thing about the room there were lots of them and they were nice and thick she clucked approvingly opened her suitcase and took out a long cotton flannel nightgown we wont have to sleep in all our clothes tonight she said she reached up to her neck to pull off her sweater then froze her eyes on sam do you want me to turn my back he asked though every word hurt he watched her think about it that hurt too but finally she shook her head no never mind dont be silly she said i mean were married after allkind of married anyway kind of married indeed yeager thought and had another vision of swarming lawyers he got out of his shirt and chinos while she was taking off the sweater and slacks the flannel nightgown rustled as it slid down over her smooth skin he liked to sleep with as few clothes as the weather would allow tonight with all those heavy blankets that meant socks and boxer shorts and undershirt he dove under the covers in a hurry the room itself was cold barbara slipped in beside him she blew out the candle on the night table darkness enfolded them with the blinds closed and the curtains drawn it was almost absolute good night honey he said and without thinking leaned over for a kiss he got it but her lips didnt welcome his the way they had before he got back to his own side of the bed in a hurry they lay together on the same mattress but a maginot line might have sprung up between them he sighed and wondered if hed ever go to sleep he tossed and turned and turned and tossed and felt barbara doing the same but they were both careful not to bump into each other after some time that seemed forever but probably was before midnight he drifted off he woke in the wee small hours needing to use the chamber pot regardless of how he and barbara had kept apart from each other awake theyd come together in sleep maybe for warmth maybe for no real reason at all her nightgown had ridden up a lot her bare thigh sprawled across his legs he cherished the feeling wondering if hed ever know it again wondering if he was just sticking pins in himself for staying with her now when he didnt think shed end up picking him but what the hell hed played umpteen seasons of ball stubbornly hoping hed catch a break why be different here and he did have to use the pot he slid away as gently as he could hoping not to wake her but he did the mattress shifted as her head came off the pillow sorry hon he whispered i need to get up for a second its okay she whispered back i have to do the same thing go ahead and go first she rolled over to her own side but not this time as if she thought shed get leprosy from touching him he groped around by the bed found the chamber pot did what he had to do and handed the pot to her the flannel nightgown rustled again as she hiked it up she used the pot too then slid it out of the way and got back into bed yeager did too good night again he said good night sam to his surprise and delight barbara slid across to his side of the bed and gave him a hug his arms slid around her squeezed her to him she was good to hang on to in the middle of the night too soon though she slipped away and he knew that if he tried to hold her there he was liable to lose her forever he tossed and turned for another long while before he went back to sleep he wondered what that hug meant for his future trying to read it the same way hed tried to gauge managers oracular pronouncements in years gone by to see whether he was liable to get promoted or shipped down as with a lot of those pronouncements he couldnt figure out exactly what the hug foretold he just knew he was gladder with it than he would have been without it he also knew this mess wouldnt unravel quickly no matter what more than the other that thought calmed him and helped him fall asleep at last heinrich jager set a hand on the stowage compartment that rode atop the track assembly of his panther the steel was warm against his palmspring came to france more quickly than to germany and far more quickly than to the soviet union where hed waited out last winter the panzer crews stood by their machines waiting for him to speak sunlight dappled down through trees in new leaf with their black coveralls the tankers looked like splotches of shadow their panzers were painted in what the camouflage experts called ambush patternredbrown and green splotches over ocher and then smaller ocher patches over the redbrown and green it was the best scheme the wehrmacht had come up with for making its vehicles invisible from the air whether it was good enoughthey were about to find out fuel pump aside jager said giving his panther an affectionate thwack this is the best humanmade panzer in the world the crewmen of the tigers attached to his unit glared at him as hed known they would they liked their massive beasts mm gun better than the panthers even if the panther was more maneuverable and had its armor properly sloped but jager went on and let the word hang in the air if you try to fight the lizards straight up with your machines the only thing youll do is get yourselves killed the fatherland cant afford that remember it think of yourselves as going up against ts in a panzer ii that got their attention in the way he wanted next to one of the tough soviet machines a panzer ii with its mm cannon and cardboardthin protection was a crews worth of sad duty to inform you letters waiting to happen and yet despite technical shortcomings the wehrmacht had advanced deep into russia well try to hit them from ambush then jager said well lure them put some of our panzers where we can get a shot at them from flank or rear you all know how to do that youve most of you done it on the eastern front he was glad he had picked crews here sending new fish against the lizards would have been an invitation to slaughter casualties would be bad enough as things were their equipment will be better than ours he emphasized their tactics and doctrine wont from what i saw in the ukraine last year theyre even more stereotyped than the bolsheviks but their equipment is so good theyll hurt you if you make any mistakes at all in fact theyll hurt you even if you dont make any mistakes as tankers theyre nothing much but if i had a chance to capture one of their panzers id give up a lot to do it questions will we have any air support one of the tiger crewmen asked i wouldnt hold my breath jager answered dryly anything we put up they knock down he thought about ludmila gorbunova in her little flying sewing machine he hadnt had any reply to the latest letter hed posted with the state of the mails these days that meant nothing but he worried all the same going into the air against the lizards was more nearly suicidal than fighting them in panzers the same tanker asked well see their helicopters though wont we if you already know the answer why ask the question jager said yes we probably will if you hear one and it hasnt spied you get under tree cover as fast as you can if a panzer in your squad blows up and you dont think youre in contact with the enemy youd better do the same anything else no lets go then heil hitler heil hitler the panzer crews chorused they piled into their machines jager tried to gauge their attitude they werent confident of victory any more the way they had been before the blows against the poles or the french or the russians they all knew what the lizards could do but no one hung hack or hesitated better to hold the lizards as far from the fatherland as possible they all knew that without much hope and without fear theyd try to accomplish it jager climbed up onto the turret of his panther slid down inside through the open cupola beneath and behind him the big maybach engine thundered into life he wished it were a diesel like the ones the russians used a petrol power plant didnt just burn when it got hitit exploded down the road southwest he told the driver over the intercom were looking for good defensive positions remember we want to be in ambush before we run into the lizards nosing north from besancon as seemed their habit since the blitzkrieg that followed their arrival on earth the lizards were moving on belfort slowly and methodicallywith luck even more slowly than theyd planned because they had a way of overreacting to harassment fire from german infantry and french guerrillas with more luck jagers panzer regimentpanzer combat group was a better name for it given the mixed and mixedup nature of his commandwould slow them further with a whole lot more luck he might even stop them the panther had a much smoother ride than the panzer iii in which hed advanced into russia the interleaved road wheels had a lot to do with that not feeling as if his kidneys were shaking loose was a pleasant novelty now if the damned fuel pump wouldnt keep breaking down in spite of the engines rumble and the rattle and squeak and grind of the treads riding with his head and shoulders out of the cupola was pleasant on a bright spring day new grass sprouted in meadows and in cracks in the macadam of the road in a normal year traffic would have smashed that latter hopeful growth flat but the column of german panzers might have been the first motorized traffic the road had known in months here and there in the grass wildflowers made bright splashes of red and yellow and blue the air itself smelled green and growing to jagers right klaus meinecke sneezed sharply once twice three times the gunner pulled a handkerchief from the breast pocket of his tunic and let out a long mournful honk i hate springtime he mumbled his eyes were puffy and tracked with red miserable hay fever kills me every year nothing makes everybody happy jager thought they ran through montbeliard where the big peugeot works stood idle for want of fuel and raw materials then followed the road that paralleled the doubs river southwest toward besanconand toward the lizards surely on the way up toward belfort jagers head swiveled up and down back and forth watching every moment for the airplane or helicopter that could turn his panzer into a funeral pyre meinecke chuckled youve got the deutsche blick all right colonel he said the german glance jager echoed puzzled whats that they recruited me for panthers out of the afrika korps not the russian war the gunner explained it was a joke we made there a takeoff on the deutsche gruss the german salute we were always on the lookout for aircraft first british then from the lizards spot one and it was time to find a hole in the ground before the lizards came jager had envied the tankers who fought in north africa the war against the british there was clean gentlemanlywar as it should be he thought both sides in russia had fought as viciously as they could jager thought of the massacres of jews at babi yar and other places a miracle the polish jews hadnt killed him on his way back to germany he didnt care to brood on that too long it made him wonder about what his country had been doing in the lands it had conquered instead he said so what was it like in the desert after the lizards came bad meinecke answered wed been beating the british they were brave but their panzers didnt match up to ours and their tactics were pretty bad if wed had proper supplies wed have mopped them up but everything kept going to the eastern front we never had enough either jager put in maybe not colonel but a lot even of what was supposed to go to us ended up on the bottom of the mediterranean but you asked about the lizards they mopped up the tommies and us both they liked the desert and we couldnt hide from their planes there talk about the deutsche blickgott in himmel the tommies had it too misery loves company jager said then still looking around he suddenly called halt to the panthers driver the big battle tank slowed stopped jager stood tall in the cupola waving the column to a halt behind him he studied the little ridge that rose off to one side of the road it was covered with old brush and saplings and its crest could have been more than four hundred meters from the roadway hed have to scout out what lay behind check his line of retreatthe one thing you couldnt do was stand toetotoe with the lizards or before long you wouldnt have any toes left he ordered the panther up the rise to the crest the longer he looked at the setup the better he liked it he didnt think hed come across a better defensive position anyhow at his command most of the german panzers deployed hull down on the reverse slope of the ridge line he sent three or four panzer ivs and a tiger forward to meet the lizards ahead of his main position and with luck bring them back all unsuspecting into the ambush hed set up that left nothing to do but wait and stay alert in back of the ridge lay a pond fed by a small stream a fish leaped out of the water after a fly fell back with a splash somewhere in his gear jager had a couple of hooks and a length of light line panfried trout or pike sounded a lot better to him than the miserable rations hed been eating a frenchman in civilian clothes came out of the bushes on the far side of the pond jager wasnt surprised to see he had a rifle on his back he waved to the frenchman who returned the gesture before stepping back into the undergrowth before the lizards came the french underground had nipped at the germans who occupied their country now they worked together against the new invaders in french eyes the germans were the lesser of two evils thats something anyhow jager thought in poland the lizards had seemed the lesser of two evils to the jews from what hed learned he couldnt blame them for feeling that way a couple of times hed tried talking with officers he trusted about what germany had done in the east it hadnt worked hed been met by a refusal to listen that almost amounted to saying i dont want to know he hadnt brought up the subject now for some time away in the distance he heard the harsh abrupt bark of a panzer cannon at the same time a shout sounded in his earphones engaging lead element of enemy panzer column will attempt to carry out plan as outlined will the transmission cut off abruptly jager feared he knew why more booms from the panzer ivs mm guns heavier deeper ones from the tigers and sharp as thunderclaps from the lizards cannon then another sort of roar lower and more diffuse with smaller blasts and cheery poppops all mixed in with it that was the sound of a panzer brewing up armorpiercing jager said quietly the loader slammed a blacknosed shell into the breech of the cannon out of sight down the road another panzer exploded jager bit his lip those were men comradesinarms dying nastily and the officer part of him whispered if all my panzers get killed before any make it back here what good is my ambush he was inured to sacrificing men throwing them away was something else again he stood up in the cupola made a hand sign be ready panzer commanders passed it down the line he didnt want to use radio not now the lizards were too good at picking up their foes signals as if from very far away he felt his heart thudding in his chest his bowels loosening that was what fear did to your body it didnt have to rule you if you didnt let it up the road motor going flat out men inside probably shaken to blood pudding raced a panzer iv it sounded like an explosion in a smithy roaring and clattering and clanking as if it were about to fall to pieces behind it almost silent by comparison glided a lizard panzer then another and another and another jager knew they were toying with the panzer iv they had a way of stabilizing their guns so they shot accurately even on the move but they were enjoying the chase for a while before they ended it lets see how they enjoy this he thought and yelled fire because his head was outside the cupola the bellow of the cannon half stunned him flame and smoke spurted from the guns muzzle hit he cried in delight it was a solid hit too right at the join between the turret and body of the lizard panzer the turret tilted almost torn out of its ring jager wouldnt have wanted to be inside when that kilo round came knocking but the lizards made their panzers tough that shell would have torn the turret right off a british tank or a soviet t and turned either of them into an inferno on the instant not only did this one not catch fire its driver threw it into reverse and did his best to escape the trap in which he found himself hit him again jager shouted his gunner required no urgingthe second shot punctuated jagers sentence all the rest of the hulldown german panzers along the ridge line opened up too the lizards offered them a target tankers dream about the less heavily armored flanks and engine compartments of their vehicles one of those vehicles brewed up in a flash of orange and blue flamesomebodys round had penetrated to something vital jager wondered if that had been a panthers kill or a tigers the heavier panzers fired a correspondingly more massive shell but the panthers gun had a higher muzzle velocity and would pierce just as much armor maybe more the lizards did not react well to being taken in flank jager had counted on that they were even more vulnerable to the unexpected than soviet troops for a crucial few seconds they either tried to back out of trouble like the panzer jager had hit or traversed their turrets toward the concealed german armor without shifting the tanks themselves that let the germans keep pounding away at their more vulnerable sides and rears another lizard panzer turned into a fireball then another but the lizards did not stay stupid forever one by one they turned toward the germans fire no german panzer gun could beat their front glacis plates jagers gunner tried his shell buried itself almost to the drive bands but did no damage anyone could find then the aliens started shooting back they had only small targets at which to aim but they didnt need anything big their firecontrol arrangements were even better than the ones the new panthers boasted and while a panther shell couldnt quite shift one of their turrets the lizards projectiles smashed german panzer turrets as if they were anvils dropping on cockroaches two tanks down from jager a panzer iv was abruptly beheaded shells cooking off inside its turret smashed down the rear slope of the ridge and skidded into the pond the hull exploded in flames too and started a fire in the brush then a tiger got hit its turret flew off too which rocked jager hed hoped the mm of armor there might be proof against anything the lizards could throw at it no such luck though now he got on the radio fall back he ordered keep things moving keep them confused that was how you got whatever chance you had against the lizards in a setpiece battle you were dead as if he were back on the other side of the rise jager saw what the lizard panzer commander would be thinking it they came straight up the slope and charged after the retreating germans theyd keep presenting their invulnerable frontal armor to his comrades and him then they could destroy the panzer force at their convenience and press on up the road toward belfort he got on the command frequency again peel off to either side as youretreat well want to get some decent shots at their flanks when they come after us his panther backed through the little stream that fed the pond water sprayed up on either side sure enough just as hed guessed a couple of lizard panzers breasted the rise and advanced on the germans they were too confident of their own invincibility had he been an instructor on a training ground he would have lowered their mark the proper tactical solution was to stay hull down on the reverse slope and pound the germans while exposing as little of themselves as possible he remembered his first big fight with the lizard panzers in the ukraine theyd made the same mistake then and hed killed one of their tanks with a panzer iiihe was one of a bare handful of german tankers who could say that this time though he didnt get a chance to put a shell into the enemys belly where his armor was thinnest one of the lizards fired a panzer iv went up in gouts of flame but the germans were hitting back too and their highvelocity armorpiercing shells could hurt the lizards when they hit the right spot one of the lizard panzers slewed to a halt road wheels wrecked by a shell that made the machine only marginally less dangerous its main armament still worked and its turret swung toward a panther it took the german panzer out with one shell straight through the sloped front plate that was supposed to deflect enemy fire more rounds slammed into the disabled lizard panzer hatches popped open in the turret and at the drivers position in the front of the hull lizards jumped out machine guns chattered the lizards went down jager felt some sympathy for themtheyd fought bravely if not with a lot of brains that didnt keep him from yelling like a wildwest indian when they fell a moment after the last lizard bailed out and was shot down the disabled panzer brewed up a smoke ring perfect as any an old man with a cigar in his mouth might make but twenty times as big blew out of the commanders open cupola then all the ammunition stowed in there must have cooked off at once for the panzer went up in a fireball that sent blazing debris flying for a hundred meters a lizard helicopter fluttered over the ridge just then rockets stabbing out from it like knives of fire machine gunners opened up on it but it was armed against their fire but a panzer iv traversing its cannon toward the second lizard tank happened to line up on the flying machine jager never knew whether the commander gave the order or the gunner acted on his own initiative either way the mm shell tore through the helicopters belly and swatted it out of the air in flames jager screamed with delight the commander of the other lizard panzer that had come over the ridge should have pulled back then the panzers turret swung back and forth as if the lizards inside couldnt make up their minds on a target the germans had no such hesitationand panthers and tigers though far from a match for the lizard machine could hurt it when they got a chance like this one even the new panzer ivs though hideously vulnerable to return fire had in their long s main armament little inferior to what the panthers carried when the lizard did decide to go back it was too late smoke and almost transparent blue flames boiled from the enemy panzers engine compartment that crew bailed out too jager didnt know if they all perished the smoke was too thick for him to be sure if they didnt though it wasnt for lack of effort forward the panthers he ordered tigers and ivs lay back to support how many panthers are still running klaus meinecke asked jager blinked the gunners question hadnt occurred to him but it was a damn good one it would be a hell of a thing to go swarming over the ridge to confront the lizards alone but no at least two other machines rumbled past the flaming hulks of friends and foes to renew the fight against the lizards on the belfort road the smartest thing the lizards could have done was to keep right on moving toward belfort make the germans react to them with their rotten fuel pumps the panthers would surely have broken down if pushed hard and the lizard panzers were faster than the ones jager commanded anyhow guderian and manstein had invented the drill first force your opening then worry about what happens next but the lizards in this column didnt have a guderian leading them jager stuck his head and torso out of the cupola to see what they were about they still waited on the road faceon toward the ridge line halt hull down he called to his comrades he also ordered his own panzer to halt no sense in exposing more of it to enemy fire than he had to for the moment standoff jager saw no point in firing from his present position hed just waste ammunition and announce to the lizards where he was about the only way he could hurt them from here would be to put one right down a cannon barrel he laughed at that and muttered if i want a miracle ill ask for it in church the lizards werent eager to swarm up the ridge any more though not when the two that had tried it didnt come back they werent used to armor fights where their foes had a decent chance of doing them in jager didnt think they were afraid hed stopped underestimating enemies after his first couple of weeks in russia he did think hed made the lizards thoughtful he was about to order his reserves to try a flanking maneuver using the ridge for cover when a shell slammed into the side of the northernmost lizard panzer another followed a few seconds later and set the armored vehicle ablaze jager was still trying to figure out who was doing the shooting when the lizard crew bailed out of their panzer and ran for the brush machinegun fire cut them down jager whooped its that panzer iv he yelled they should have chased it down and killed it but they got busy with us and forgot all about it hed forgotten all about it too but he didnt have to admit that even to himself the lizards certainly had left it out of their plans its unexpected return to action did the same thing to them that the unexpected in combat often did to the russians it panicked them and sent them into a retreat they didnt have to make jager fired a couple of rounds at them from the ridge line just to remind them he was there but didnt pursuecoming out into the open against them was asking to get shot up klaus meinecke looked up from his gunsight a grin stretched wide across his face by god colonel theyre as sensitive about their flanks as any virgin i ever tried to lay he exclaimed so they are jager laughed too but under the coarse joke lay a grain of truth he had seen the same thing fighting the red army come straight at them and theyd die in place by thousands sooner than yielding a meter of ground flank them outor even threaten to flank them outand they were liable to run like rabbits half to himself he said they arent quick to adapt not even a little no sir the gunner agreed and theyve paid for being slow that they have youre right jager sounded wondering even to himself his men had killed at least five lizard panzersto say nothing of a helicopterin this fight theyd lost more than thattigers panthers panzer ivsbut theyd done the enemy some real damage he wondered how long it had taken the wehrmachts armor to kill five lizard panzers last year weeks probably maybe months panzer iis panzer iiis czech machines impressed into action panzer ivs with the stubby mm guns for infantry supportthey were all toys set against the lizards tanks he must have said that aloud for meinecke answered that was last year this is now and who knows what theyll come up with next maybe a tiger with sloped armor and a really longbarreled thatd make the lizards sit up and think it made jager sit up and think too he liked the idea then he looked around again now he didnt see smoke and flame and shattered flesh and metal he saw that his comrades were still here and the lizards had fled we held the position he exclaimed we did by god the gunner sounded as surprisedalmost dazedas jager felt im not used to that nor i jager said ive been part of a partisan raid that stung them but every time i went up against them in regular combat i always ended up retreating till now he started thinking about what needed to happen next now we can bring some infantry forward send em down the road to screen for us infantry meinecke spoke the word with a tankers ingrained scorn whats infantry going to do against panzers give us warning when theyre on the move if nothing else jager answered snipers may pick off a commander or two the lizards come out of their cupolas when they think its safe same as we do maybe even an unbuttoned driver and i hear theyre going to get some sort of antipanzer rocket the americans have passed on to us thatd be something if it works the gunner said the lizards have hurt us plenty with rockets i know theyve hurt us with their panzers too a lot worse than they did today jager scratched his head his hair was matted with greasy sweat i havent seen them foolish that way beforethose couple that charged straight at us they should have known better i wonder why they didnt dontknow that sir meinecke said but i m not going to complain about it you no jager said ussmak desperately wanted a taste of ginger he needed to feel strong and bright and in control of things even if he knew he wasnt back in the turret of the landcruiser hessef and tvenkel were undoubtedly dipping their tongues into the supply of the drug theyd brought along undoubtedly too it made them see the fight from which theyd just retreated as a small thing hardly more than some cracked pavement on the path to the races inevitable victory ussmak wished he could feel the same way but no matter how much he craved ginger he didnt trust it any more ginger could make you do stupid things things stupid enough to get you killed two landcruisers had swarmed over that rise after the deutsche neither one had come back everything had seemed so easy when he started out on the plains of the sssr easier even than the training simulators for those had assumed an opposition of a quality to match his own and the soviets machines didnt come close while their tactics werent anything special either when hed got into besancon the males had warned him the deutsche were better at armored warfare now he knew what theyd meant nobodyd paid any attention to that rise until the deutsche started shooting from it theyd lured the races landcruisers right into an ambush he realized they were just big ugliesthey shouldnt have been able to trick males of the race like that and their landcruisers werent just inflammable targets any more these were a lot bigger and heavier than the soviet tanks hed faced in the sssr let alone the little deutsch models their guns could hurt too hessefs voice came over the audio button taped to ussmaks hearing diaphragm come on back here weve got enough herb to share with you even if you didnt bring any of your own ill be there soon superior sir ussmak answered just blind luck he thought that hessef hadnt gone charging after the big uglies himself and gotten his landcruiserand ussmak with itblown to bits he wanted to pop the hatch above his reclining seat and get a little fresh if chilly air but he knew that wasnt a good idea the side of the road closer to the river offered no cover for big uglies with guns but any number of tosevite raiders might be lurking in the woods that led up onto the mountain slopes to the west just waiting for a male to show himself even for a moment as with landcruisers the big uglies personal weapons were less effective than those of the race most of their individual firearms could shoot only one bullet at a time while their machine guns were too heavy and clumsy to be easily portable as with the landcruisers again though you didnt want to make a mistake or youd find that one of those inferior weapons was plenty good enough to kill you ussmak crawled back through the fighting compartment then and stuck his head up through the opening in the bottom of the turret here you are just another shell to be expended tvenkel exclaimed well as long as you are here you might as well have a taste before ussmak could say no as hed intended his tongue shot out and licked the little mound of ginger from the palm of the gunners hand he opened and closed his jaws several times gulped the powder down his throat thats good he exclaimed with the herb buzzing through him he felt like a brandnew male all his worries all his fears ebbed away i wish we had the big uglies in our sights again part of him knew that was just the ginger talking but none of him cared so do i tvenkel said fiercely if they think id miss em again at that range i tell you theyre wrong so tvenkel had missed when he should have hit had he under the influence of the ginger ussmak felt almost as much contempt for him as he did for the big uglies the bungling incompetent couldnt hit a city if he was in the middle of it he thought hessef said we didnt do as well as we should have his voice held melancholy uncertainty the drug was wearing off leaving crushing sadness and emptiness behind he also sounded more thoughtful than usual as he continued maybe ussmak is right maybe we should go into combat without tasting first i think that would be a good idea superior sir ussmak said at the moment he would have thought any ideas good that agreed with his own he went on we may think we do well when we taste the herb but in fact we dont the contrast between belief and reality hit him with stunning force almost as if his own words came not from his mouth but from one of the great departed emperors of the past it may be so hessef agreed mournfully he was sliding down from his peak of omnipotent euphoria sure enough nonsense superior sir tvenkel must have had another taste just before he gave one to ussmak for he still sounded gingercertain about things just bad luck thats all cant hit everything all the timeand these big uglies had the advantage of position on us yes and how did they get it ussmak answered his own question they got it because we rushed ahead without taking proper notice of our surroundings and we did that because too many of us were tasting his mouth fell open here he was complaining about tasting while he had a head full of ginger the irony struck him as deliciously funny we should smash them anyhow tvenkel declared when we first landed we would have i think hessef said now we face tougher landcruisers and ours remain the same still better by far than anything the big uglies have tvenkel said with an angry hiss the herb was making him confident to the point of being combative even these new machines are slow and weak next to ours thats so hessef said but theyre not as slow or as weak as the ones we met before and who can say what the tosevites will build next he shivered a little just as tvenkel was arrogant under the influence of ginger and ignored real problems hessef saw those problems magnified in the depression that came when the drug wore off if we conquer them they wont build anything next tvenkel said ussmak liked that idea since he was riding his taste of ginger up to the heights he felt as tvenkel did that the race could accomplish whatever it desired and that nothing would be allowed to stand in its way but he had learned that what he felt when he tasted was not to be relied upon which was something few other ginger tasters seemed to have realized he tried to stand outside himself to look at what the ginger did to him as if it were happening to someone else he said we had better conquer them soon or they will build their new machines and every one they do build makes them that much harder to overcome retreating from their landcruisers isnt going to make conquering them any easier hessef said almost moaning but losing five machines in battle against them doesnt get the job done either the emperor only knows what theyre saying about that back in besancon he cast down his eyes at the mention of the races sovereign and didnt raise them again right away sure enough afterginger depression held him in its claws superior sir what you need is another taste tvenkel said he took out a vial of ginger poured some into his hand offered it to hessef the landcruiser commanders tongue flicked out the powdered drug disappeared ah thats better hessef said as the ginger began to take hold of him once more why is it better ussmak wondered aloud the world is still the same as it was before you tasted so how have things really changed theyve changed because now i have this lovely powder inside of me no matter how ugly the big uglies outside the landcruiser are i dont have to worry about it all i have to do is sit here in my seat and not think about a thing and if some tosevite chooses this moment to sneak up on us with a satchel charge were all liable to die because youre not thinking ussmak held that to himself despite all hed been through despite the herb coursing through him the subordination drilled into him since his hatchling days remained strong in any case he didnt think the big uglies had pursued the races retreating landcruisers why should they have theyd kept the race from pushing north which was what theyd had in mind they didnt have to conquer they just had to resist for how long ussmak wondered the answer slammed into him like a cannon shell till we have no equipment left five landcruisers gone today in this engagement alone hessef was right they would be gnashing their teeth in besancon over that news ussmak wondered how many landcruisers the race had left all over tosev in the first heady days of the invasion it hadnt seemed to matter they advanced as they would and swept all before them they didnt sweep any more they had to fight and when they fought they got hurt oh so did the tosevites though his ginger euphoria was starting to ebb ussmak still acknowledged that even in the botched engagement from which the races landcruisers had just retreated theyd killed many more enemy vehicles than theyd lost themselves when transcribing his afteraction report onto disk the unit commander would probably be able to present the engagement as a victory but it wasnt a victory the clarity of thought the drug brought to ussmak let him see that only too well the big uglies were losing landcruisers at a prodigal rate yes but they were still making them too and making them better than they had before ussmak wondered how many landcruisers remained aboard the freighters that had fetched them from home even more than that he wondered what the race would do when no more landcruisers were left on those freighters when he said that aloud hessef answered thats why wed better conquer quickly if we dont well have nothing left to do the job with even the landcruiser commanders new taste of ginger didnt keep him from seeing as much for himself well beat them its our destinywe are the race tvenkel said the herb left him confident still he gave his guns autoloader an affectionate slap thus reminded of the device hessef said we ought to perform maintenance on that gadget we expended a lot of rounds today it goes out of adjustment easily and then were left with main armament that wont shoot itll be all right superior sir tvenkel said if it hasnt gone wrong odds are it wont ussmak expected hessef to come down angrily on the gunner for that maintenance was as much a part of a landcruiser crews routine as eating but hessef kept quietthe ginger made him more confident than he should have been too ussmak didnt like that if the autoloader wouldnt feed shells into the cannon what good was the landcruiser good for getting him killed that was all though the gunner outranked him ussmak said i think you ought to service the autoloader too its working fine i tell you tvenkel said angrily all we need is to top up on ammunition and well be ready to go out and fight some more as if on cue a couple of ammunition carriers rolled up to the landcruisers one was a purposebuilt vehicle made by the race but the other sounded like a tosevite rattletrap ussmak went back to the drivers position undogged the hatch and peered out sure enough it was a petroleumburning truck its acrid exhaust made him cough when the drivera male of the racegot out ussmak saw he had wooden blocks taped to the bottoms of his feet to let him reach the pedals from a seat designed for bigger beings tvenkel climbed out through the turret hurried over to the ammunition carriers so did the gunners from the rest of the landcruisers in the unit after a lowvoiced comment from one of the resupply drivers one of them shouted what do you mean only twenty rounds per vehicle thatll leave me less than half full and me tvenkel said the rest of the gunners echoed him loudly and emphatically sorry my friends but it cant be helped the male driving the tosevite truck said his foot blocks made him tower over the angry gunners but instead of dominating them he just became the chief target of their wrath he went on were a little short all over the planet right now well share what we have evenly and itll come out well in the end no it wont tvenkel shouted were facing real landcruisers here dont you see that with better guns and tougher armor than anybody else has to worry about we need more ammunition to make sure we take them out i cant give you what i dont have the truck driver answered orders were to bring up twenty rounds per landcruiser and thats what we brought no more no less the race didnt need to run out of landcruisers to find itself in trouble against the big uglies ussmak realized running out of supplies for the landcruisers it had was less dramatic but would do the job just fine viii after darkness light after winter spring as jens larssen peered north from the third floor of science hall he thought that light and spring had overtaken denver all at once a week before the ground had been white with snow now the sun blazed down from a bright blue sky men bustled across the university of denver campus in shirtsleeves and without hats and the first new leaves and grass were beginning to show their bright green faces winter might come again but no one paid the possibility any mindleast of all jens spring sang in his heart not because of the warm weather not for the new growth on lawns and trees not even because of early arriving birds warbling in those trees what fired joy in him was at first sight much more prosaic a long stream of horsedrawn wagons making their slow way down university boulevard toward the campus he could wait up here no longer he dashed down the stairs his army guard oscar right behind him when he got to the bottom his heart pounded in his chest and his breath came short with exercise and anticipation jens started over to his bicycle oscar said why dont you just wait for them to get here sir dammit my wife is in one of those wagons and i havent seen her since last summer jens said angrily maybe oscar didnt breathe hard even in bed i understand that sir oscar said patiently but you dont know which one shes in for that matter you dont even know if shes in any of the ones coming in today isnt the convoy broken into several units to keep the lizards from paying too much attention to it the right way the wrong way and the army way jens thought this once the army way seemed to have something going for it okay he said stopping maybe youre smarter than i am oscar shook his head no sir but my wife isnt on one of those wagons so i can still think straight hmm aware hed lost the exchange larssen turned toward the wagons the first of which had turned off university onto east evans and was now approaching science hall ill have the best excuse in the world for getting out of boq now he thought he didnt recognize the only man aboard the lead wagon just a driver wearing olive drab oscar had had a point he reluctantly admitted to himself a lot of these wagons would just be carrying equipment and the only people aboard them would be soldiers hed have felt a proper fool if hed pedaled up and down the whole length of the wagon train without setting eyes on barbara then he saw leo szilard sitting up alongside another driver he waved like a man possessed szilard returned the gesture in a more restrained way so restrained in fact that jens wondered a little the hungarian physicist was usually as open and forthright a man as anyone ever born larssen shrugged if he was going to read that much into a wave maybe he should have chosen psychiatry instead of physics a couple of more wagons pulled up in front of science hall before he saw more people he knew enrico and laura fermi looking incongruous on a tarpcovered hay wagon dr fermi he called have you seen barbara is she all right fermi and his wife exchanged glances finally he said she is not that far behind us soon you will see her for yourself now what the devil was that supposed to mean is she all right larssen repeated is she hurt is she sick the fermis looked at each other again she is neither injured nor ill enrico fermi answered and then shut up jens scratched his head something was going on but he didnt know what well if barbara was just a few wagons behind the fermis hed find out pretty soon he walked up the stream of incoming wagons then stopped dead in his tracks ice ran up his spinewhat were two lizards doing here attached to the met lab crew he relaxed a bit when he saw the rifletoting corporal in the wagon with the lizards prisoners might be useful the lizards certainly knew how to get energy out of the atomic nucleus then all such merely practical thoughts blew out of his head sitting next to the corporal was barbara he yelled and sprinted toward the wagon oscar the guard followed more sedately barbara waved and smiled but she didnt jump down and run to him he noticed that but didnt think much of it just seeing her again after so long made the fine spring day ten degrees warmer when he fell into step beside the wagon she did get out hi babe i love you he said and took her in his arms squeezing her kissing her made him forget about everything else jens wait she said when lack of oxygen forced him to take his mouth away from hers for a moment the only thing i want to wait for is to get us alone he said and kissed her again she didnt respond quite the way she had the first time that distracted him enough to let him notice the corporal saying ullhass ristin you two just go on along ill catch up with you later and then getting down from the wagon himself his army boots clumped on the pavement as he walked back toward jens and barbara jens broke off the second kiss in annoyance that headed rapidly toward anger oscar had enough sense to keep his distance and let a man properly greet his wife why couldnt this clodhopper do the same barbara said jens this is someone you have to know his name is sam yeager sam this is jens larssen not my husband jens larssen jens wondered but trapped in the rituals of politeness he grudgingly stuck out a hand pleased to meet you yeager said though a dark blond eyebrow quirked up as he spoke he was a handful of years older than larssen but considerably more weathered as if hed always spent a lot of time outdoors gary cooper type jens thought not that the corporal was anywhere near so goodlooking pleased to meet you too pal he said now if youll excuse us he started to steer barbara away wait she said again he stared at her startled she was looking down at the ground when she raised her eyes she looked not to him but to this yeager character which not only startled jens but made him mad the corporal nodded now barbara turned toward jens in a low voice she went on theres something you have to know you and sam havesomething in common huh jens gave yeager another look the soldier was human male white and by the way he talked might well have sprung from the midwest past that larssen couldnt see any resemblance between them what is it he asked barbara me at first he didnt understand that lasted only a heartbeat maybe two the way she said it didnt leave much room to doubt what she meant numbness filled him to be replaced in an instant by allconsuming rage he almost threw himself blindly at sam yeager hed always been a peaceable man but he wasnt afraid of a fight after attacking a lizard tank when pattons troops drove the aliens back from chicago the idea of taking on somebody carrying a rifle didnt faze him then he took another look at yeagers face the corporal wasnt toting that rifle just for show somewhere or other hed done some work with it the way his eyes narrowed as he watched jens said that louder than words jens hesitated it wasnt the way it sounds barbara said i thought you were dead i was sure you had to be dead if i hadnt been i never would have neither would i yeager put in theres names for people who do stuff like that i dont like em but you did jens said we did it the right way or the best way we knew how yeagers mouth twisted those werent the same not here he went on up in wyoming a little while back we got married oh lord larssens eyes went to barbara as if begging her to tell him it was all some dreadful joke but she bit her lip and nodded something new washed over jens then fear she wasnt just telling him shed made a mistake with this miserable twostriper she really had a thing for him theres more yeager said grimly how could there be more jens demanded barbara held up a hand sam she began yeager cut her off hon hes gotta know the sooner all the cards are on the table the sooner we can start figuring out what the hand looks like are you gonna tell him or shall i ill do it barbara said which surprised jens not at all shed always been one to take care of her own business still she had to gather herself before she brought out a blurted whisper im going to have a baby jens he started to say oh lord again but that wasnt strong enough the only things that were he didnt want to say in front of barbara he thought hed been afraid before nowhow could barbara possibly want to come back to him if she was carrying this other guys child she was the best thing hed ever known most of the reason hed kept going across lizardheld ohio and indiana and now this he wished theyd started their family before the lizards came theyd talked about it but he kept reaching for the rubbers in the nightstand drawerand times he hadnt there were some nothing happened maybe he was shooting blanks yeager sure as hell wasnt jens also wished suddenly savagely that hed screwed the ears off the brassy blond waitress named sal when the lizards held them and a bunch of other people in that church in fiat indiana shed done everything but send up a flare to let him know she was interested hed stayed aloof figuring hed be back with barbara soon but when he finally got back to chicago she was already gone and now that hed finally caught up with hershe was pregnant by somebody else wasnt that a kick in the nuts it sure was and hed gone and wasted his chance jensprofessor larssen i guess i meanwhat are we gonna do about this sam yeager asked he was being as decent as he could somehow that made things worse not better worse or better though hed sure found the sixtyfourdollar question i dont know jens muttered with a helplessness hed never felt while confronting the abstruse equations of quantum mechanics barbara said jens i guess youve been here a while she waited for him to nod before she went on do you have some place where we could talk for a while just the two of us yeah he pointed back toward science hall ive got an office on the third floor there okay lets go he wished shed headed off with him without a backwards glance but she didnt she turned back to sam yeager and said ill see you later yeager looked as unhappy about her going with jens as jens felt about her looking back at the corporal which oddly made him feel a little better but yeager shruggedwhat else could he do okay hon he said youll probably find me riding herd on the lizards he mooched after the wagon that had held him and barbara and the aliens come on jens said to barbara she fell into step beside him their strides matching as automatically as they always did now though as he watched her legs move all he could think of was them locked around sam yeagers back that scene played over and over in his mind in vivid technicolorand brought pain just as vivid neither of them said much as they walked back to science hall nor as they climbed the stairs jens sat down behind his cluttered desk waved barbara to a chair the minute he did that he knew it was a mistake it felt more as if he was having a conference with a colleague than talking with his wife but getting up and coming back around the desk would have made him look foolish so he stayed where he was so how did this happen he asked barbara looked at her hands her hair tumbled over her face and down past her shoulders he wasnt used to it so long and straight it made her look different well a lot of things had suddenly turned different i thought you were dead she said quietly you went off across country you never wrote you never telegraphed you never callednot that the phones or anything else worked very well i tried and tried not to believe it but in the endwhat was i supposed to think jens they wouldnt let me get hold of you his voice shook with fury ready to burst free like a u nucleus waiting for a neutron first off general patton wouldnt let me send a message into chicago because he was afraid it would foul up his attack on the lizards then they wouldnt let me do anything to draw attention to the met lab i went along i thought it made sense if we dont make ourselves an atomic bomb our goose is probably cooked but jesus i know she said she still would not look at him what about yeager he demanded more rage came out in his voice another mistake now barbara did look up angrily if he attacked the bum she was going to defend him why shouldnt she larssen asked himself bitterly if she hadnt had a feel for him she wouldnt have married him god wouldnt have let him get her pregnant god oh god after youwent away i got a job typing for a psychology professor at the university barbara said he was studying lizard prisoners trying to figure out what makes them tick sam would bring them aroundhe helped capture them and hes sort of their keeper i guess youd say hes very good with them so you got friendly jens said so we got friendly barbara agreed how did you getmore than friendly with an effort larssen kept his voice steady neutral she looked down at her hands again a lizard plane strafed the ship that was taking us out of chicago she gulped a sailor got killedhorribly killedright in front of us i guess we were both so glad just to be alive thatthatone thing led to another jens nodded heavily things like that could happen why do they have to happen to me god he asked and got no answer as if twisting the knife in his own flesh he asked and when did you get married to him not even three weeks ago up in wyoming barbara answered i needed to be as sure as i could that that was something i really wanted to do i figured out i was expecting the evening we got into fort collins her face twisted a soldier on horseback brought your letter the next morning oh for christs sake jens groaned whats the matter barbara asked worry in her voice nothing anybody can help now he said though he wanted to twist a knife not in his own flesh but in colonel hexhams if the miserable blunderbrained brassbound regulation and securitycrazy son of a bitch had let him write a letter when he first asked most of this mess never would have happened yeah she and yeager still would have had their fling but he could deal with thatshed thought he was dead and so had yeager she wouldnt have married the guy or got pregnant by him life would have been a hell of a lot simpler jens asked himself a new and unsettling question how would things go between barbara and him if she decided to give yeager the brush and come back to him forever how would he handle her giving birth to the other mans kid and then raising it it wouldnt be easy he could see that much he sighed so did barbara at almost the same moment she smiled jens stayed stonyfaced he asked have the two of you been sleeping together since you found out in the same bed you mean she said of course we have we traveled all the way across the great plains like thatand it still gets cold at night though he habitually worked with abstractions he wasnt deaf to what people said and he sure as hell knew evasion when he heard it thats not what i meant he told her do youreally want to know her chin went up defiantly pushing her made her angry all right hed been afraid it would and he was right before he could answer what might have been a rhetorical question she went on as a matter of fact we did night before last and so jens didnt know and so everything hed looked forward toeverything except work anyhowhad crumbled to pieces inside the last half hour he didnt know whether he wanted to pick up those pieces and try to put them together again but if he didnt what did he have left the answer to that was painfully obvious nothing barbara was still waiting for her answer he said i wish to god it had been me instead i know she said which was not the same as i wish it had too but somethingmaybe the naked longing in his voiceseemed to soften her she continued its not that i dont love you jensdont ever think that but when i thought you were gone forever i told myself life went on and i had to go on with it i cant turn off what i feel about sam as if it were a light switch obviously he said which made her angry again im sorry he added quickly though he wasnt sure he meant it the whole thing is just fubar fubar whats that barbaras eyes lit up she lived for words when she found one she didnt know she pounced i picked it up from the army guys i was with for a while he answered it stands for fouledbut thats not what they usually sayup beyond all recognition oh like snafu she said neatly cataloging it after that silence stretched between them jens wanted to ask the one question he hadnt put to herwill you come back to mebut he didnt part of him was afraid shed say no a different part was just as much afraid shed say yes when he didnt say anything barbara said what are we going to do i dont know he answered which was honest enough to make her nod soberly he went on in the end its more or less up to you isnt it not altogether her left hand spread over her belly he wondered if she knew it had moved for instance do you want me backunder the circumstances since hed been asking himself the same thing he couldnt exclaim yes the way he probably should have when a couple of seconds passed without his saying anything barbara looked away that frightened him he didnt want to throw her out either he said im sorry dear too much landing on me all at once isnt that the sad and sorry truth she shook her head wearily then got to her feet id better get downstairs and help with the work jens ive sort of turned into assistant lizard liaison person wait he had work too a load that was going to quadruple now that the met lab was finally here but that didnt have to start at this precise instant he got up too hurried around the desk and took her in his arms she held him tight her body molded itself to his it felt so familiar so right he wished hed had the sense to lock his office door he might have tried to drag her down to the floor then and there it had been so long he remembered the last time theyd made love on the floor with lizard bombs falling all over chicago she tilted her face up kissed him with more warmth than shed shown down on east evans but before he could try dragging her down to the floor even with the door unlocked she pulled away and said i really should go where will you stay tonight he asked there that brought it out in the open if she said shed stay with him he didnt know what hed donot go back to the boq that was for sure but she just shook her head and answered dont ask me that yet please right now i dont even know which end is up all right he said reluctantly hed been up when they held each other barbara walked out of the office he listened to her footsteps receding down the hallway and then in the stairwell he went back to his desk looked out the window behind it there she came out of science hall and there she went over to sam yeager no doubt who he was even from three floors up plenty of men in army uniforms standing around but only one of them stayed by the two lizard prisoners jens felt like a peeping tom as he watched his wife hug and kiss the tall soldier but he couldnt make himself tear his eyes away when he compared the way she held yeager to how shed embraced him a cold inescapable conclusion formed in his mind wherever she slept tonight it wouldnt be with him at last barbara broke free of the other man but her hand lingered affectionately at his waist for an extra few seconds jens made himself turn away from the window and look at his desk no matter what happens to the rest of my life theres still a war on and i have a ton of work to do he told himself he could make himself lean forward in the chair he could make himself pull a report from the varnished pine in basket and set it on the blotter in front of him but try as he would he couldnt make the words mean anything misery and rage strangled his brains if that was bad pedaling back to the boq with a silent oscar right behind him felt ten times worse i wont take it he whispered again and again not wanting the guard to hear i wont normal life moishe russie had almost forgotten such a thing could exist certainly hed known nothing of the sort for the past three and a half years since the stukas and broadwinged heinkel s and other planes of the nazi war machine began dropping death on warsaw first the bombardment then the ghetto insane crowding disease starvation overworkdeath for tens of thousands served up a centimeter at a time then another spasm of war as the lizards drove the germans from warsaw and then that strange time as the lizards mouthpiece hed thought that was close to normal at least he and his family had had food on the table but the lizards were as eager to put shackles on his spirit as the nazis had been to squeeze work out of his body and then let it die or to ship him away and just kill him regardless of how much work was left in him then god only knew how long underground in a dark sardine tin and then the flight to lodz none of that had been even remotely normal but now here he was with rivka and reuven in a flat with water and electricity most of the time at least and with no sign the lizards knew where hed gone it wasnt paradisebut what was it was a chance to live like a human being instead of a starving draft horse or a hunted rabbit this by now is my definition of normal russie asked himself as he strode down zgierska street to see what the market had to offer he shook his head not normal he insisted aloud as if someone had disagreed with him normal would have meant going back to medical school where the worst he would hate had to endure was hostility from the polish students he itched to be able to start learning again and to start practicing what hed learned instead here he came ambling along down a street in a town not his own cleanshaven doing his best to act like a man whod never had a thought in his life this was safer than the way hed been living but normal no as usual the balut market square was packed some new posters had gone up on the dirty brick walls of the buildings surrounding the square bigger than life mordechai chaim rumkowski looked down on the ragged men and women gathered there his arms and hands outstretched in exhortation work means freedom the poster cried in yiddish polish and german arbeit macht frei a shiver ran down russies back when he saw that in german the nazis had put the same legend above the gates of their extermination camp at auschwitz he wondered if rumkowski knew he got in line to buy cabbage more of rumkowskis posters stood behind the peddlers cart so did other smaller ones with big red letters that announced wanted for the rape and murder of a little girl in the three most widely spoken languages of lizardheld poland who could be such a monster russie thought his eyes drawn by those screaming red letters looked to the picture on the poster it was one of the fancy photographs the lizards took in full color and giving the effect of three dimensions moishe noticed that before he realized with horror that he recognized the face on the poster it was his own the poster didnt call him by his proper namethat would have given the game away instead it styled him israel gottlieb it said hed committed his ghastly crimes in warsaw and was being sought all over poland and it offered a large reward for his capture his head whipped wildly back and forth were people staring at him at the poster getting ready to shout at him or grab him and drag him to the cobblestones hed never imagined the lizards would come up with such a devilish way of trying to bring him back into their hands he felt as if theyd set the mark of cain on his forehead but none of the men in hats or caps none of the women in head scarves acted as if the mark were visible few even glanced at the poster of those who did none looked from it to russie his eyes went to it once more on that second examination he began to understand the lizards photo showed him as he had been when he was speaking on the radio for zolraag in other words bearded and in a dark homburg rather than cleanshaven and with a flat gray cloth cap of the sort he wore these days to him the difference seemed minuscule it was after all his own face but nobody else seemed to have the faintest suspicion he was the alleged monster whose visage would undoubtedly be used to frighten children bristles rasped under his fingers as he rubbed his chin he needed a shave from here on out hed shave every day no matter what putting it off till tomorrow was liable to make him resemble himself too much he finally reached the head of the line bought a couple of cabbages and asked the price of some green onions the peddler had in a little wicker basket on his cart when the fellow told him he clapped a hand to his forehead and exclaimed ganef you should grow like an onionwith your head in the ground an onion should grow from your pippuk the vegetable seller retorted answering one yiddish execration with another then it would be cheaper they haggled for a while but russie couldnt beat the man down to a price that wouldnt leave rivka furious at him so he gave up and left carrying his cabbages in a canvas bag he thought about stopping to buy a cup of tea from a fellow with a battered tin samovar but decided that would be tempting fate the sooner he got out of the square the fewer eyes would have a chance to light on him going out though was swimming against the tide the balut market square had filled even fuller when he stood in line then abruptly the swarm of people coming in slowed russie looked up just in time to keep from being run over by chaim rumkowskis coach the horse that drew the fourwheeled carriage snorted in annoyance as the driver a hardfaced man in a gray greatcoat and quasimilitary cap hauled back on the reins to stop it the driver looked annoyed too russie touched the brim of his own cap and mumbled sorry sir hed had plenty of practice fawning on the germans but doing it for one of his own people grated even harder on him mollified the driver dipped his head but from behind him came the querulous voice of an elderly man you up therecome here heart sinking russie obeyed as he walked back toward rumkowski he saw that the drivers bench still sported a neat sign left over from the days of german domination wagen des aeltesten der juden coach of the eldest of the jews with the same in smaller letters in yiddish below he wondered if the eldest still wore a yellow star of david on his right breast as the nazis had required the ghetto jews to do no he found to his relief although he could still see where the star had been sewn onto rumkowskis herringbone tweed overcoat then moishe stopped worrying about small things for sitting beside rumkowski almost hidden by his bulk was a lizard russie didnt think he had ever seen this particular alien but he couldnt be sure he felt as if all the posters with his picture on them were growing hands and pointing straight at him rumkowski pointed straight at him too with a stubby forefinger you should be careful you were almost badly hurt yes eldest im sorry eldest russie looked down at the ground both to show humility and to keep rumkowski and the lizard from getting a good look at him the aliens had as much trouble telling people apart as people did with their kind but he did not want to find himself an exception to the rule the lizard leaned forward to see him without being blocked by rumkowskis body its eye turrets swiveled in a way russie knew well in fair german it asked him what do you have in that bag only a couple of cabbages russie had the presence of mind not to add superior sir as he had learned to do back in warsaw that would just let the lizard know he was familiar with the usages of its kind how much did you pay for these cabbages rumkowski asked ten zlotys eldest moishe said rumkowski turned to the lizard and said you see bunim how we have flourished under your rule a few months ago these cabbages would have been many times as dear we are always grateful for your aid and will do whatever we can to continue deserving your favor yes of course bunim said had he been a human russie would have thought his voice full of contempt how could one not feel contemptuous of such an abject thing as rumkowski had become yet the lizards even more than the germans assumed themselves to be the herrenvolk the master race perhaps bunim accepted sycophancy from the eldest simply as his due rumkowski pointed to his own propaganda posters on the walls of the market square we know our debt bunim and we work hard to repay it bunim swung one eye toward the posters while keeping the other on russie moishe made ready to fling the cabbages at his scaly face and flee but the lizard just said continue on this course and all will be well it shall be done superior sir rumkowski said in the hissing language of the race moishe had all he could do to keep his face blank and stupid if he was just an ordinary shlemiel on the street he had no business understanding the lizards speech the eldest seemed to remember he was there take your food home to your family he said dropping back into yiddish we may not be so hungry as we once were but i know the memory lingers youre right about that russie touched the brim of his cap thank you eldest he scuttled away from the carriage as fast as he could without seeming to be running for ms life acrid sweat dripped from his armpits and down his back along with the fear came anger rumkowski had chutzpah and to spare if he thought to impress anyone by talking about how hungry we had been his fleshy frame didnt look to have missed many meals under german control of the ghetto and hed earned his food with the sweat and the blood of his fellow jews but that dreadful as it was was also by the way for now the only thing that truly mattered to russie was that hed got away with the toughest test his flimsy disguise was ever likely to face he wasnt surprised the lizard had failed to recognize him the lizard might not have known who he was even if hed still had his beard but chaim rumkowski rumkowski was a lizard puppet as moishe had been a puppet it wouldnt have been too surprising if hed seen moishes face in a lizard photograph or in one of the propaganda films zolraag and his sons had taken back when he and russie got along but if he had he didnt associate it with a shabby jew carrying cabbages home to his wife and a good thing too moishe said when he got back to his block of flats he waved to reuven who was kicking a ball around with a couple of other boys and dodging in and out amongst passersby on the street that game would have been impossibly dangerous before the war when whizzing motorcars killed children every week these days even the eldest of the lodz ghetto rode in a carriage like a nineteenthcentury physician on his rounds the only motor vehicle in the ghetto that moishe knew about was the fire engine people got about on bicycles or in carts hauled by their fellow men or most often afoot and so sport got safer for little boys even the worst wind blows in a little good with it russie thought he carried the cabbages upstairs to his apartment rivka pounced on them she did no more than raise an eyebrow when he told her how much hed paid from which he concluded he hadnt done too badly what else did they have down there she asked tzibelesgreen onionsbut i couldnt get a decent price for them so i didnt buy any he said rivka positively beamed by her expression shed expected him to spend all their money for one driedup little onion he went on thats not all and told her about the posters thats terrible she said before he even had a chance to let her know what they claimed hed done when he did she clenched her fists and ground out its worse than terribleits filthy so it is moishe answered but the pictures show me the way i used to be and i look different now i proved it after i got these cabbages oh how because the eldest of the jews and the lizard he had in the carriage with him both spoke to me and neither one of them had the least idea who i was even though my picture was plastered all over the market square russie spoke as if hed been through something that happened every day hoping not to alarm rivka he alarmed himself instead all the fright hed felt came back in a rush and he frightened his wife thats it she said in a voice that brooked no argument from now on you dont go out of the flat unless its a matter of life or deathany time you do go out it turns into a matter of life or death he could not disagree with that he did say i had been thinking of going to the hospital and offering my services there lodzand especially its jewsstill has far too much sickness and not enough people trained in medicine if you were only putting your own neck in the noose that would be one thing rivka said but if they catch you moishe they catch reuven and me too they wont be very happy with us either remember we disappeared right under their snouts when we went into hiding i know he answered heavily but after being cooped up so long under warsaw the idea of having to stay here leaves me sick better you should be left sick than left dead rivka said to which he had no good reply she went on im a better shopper than you anyhow and you know it well save money with you at home he knew that too had he gone straight from the warsaw bunker to close confinement in this flat he could have borne it easily enough but a taste of freedom left him hungry for more it had been the same in warsaw if the lizards had treated its jews the same way the germans had people there might well have accepted it simply because it was what theyd grown used to after a spell of mild rule though tough strictures would have been hard to reimpose hed certainly rebelled when the lizards tried to make him into nothing but their mouthpiece rivka inspected the cabbages peeled off a couple of wilted outer leaves and threw them away that was a measure of how far theyd come in the days when the nazis ruled the ghetto wilted cabbage leaves would have been something to fight over their being just garbage again showed that the family wasnt in the last stages of starving to death any more the rest of the cabbage chopped went into the soup pot with potatoes and a big white onion from a vegetable basket by the counter moishe wished for a roasted pullet or barley and beef soup with bones full of marrow cabbage and potatoes though you could live a long time on that even without meat it certainly seems like a long time anyhow he muttered whats that rivka asked nothing he answered loyally thinking of all the vitamins and other nutrients in potatoes and cabbages and onions but man did not live by nutrients alone and the soup however nourishing the medical part of him knew it to be remained uninspiring despite rivkas best efforts she put a lid on the soup pot the hot plate would eventually bring it to a boil moishe had given up on quickly cooked foodnot that soup cooked quickly any which way rivka said i wonder how long reuven will play outside hmm moishe sent her a speculative look she smiled back just for a moment the tip of her tongue appeared between her teeth he did his best to sound severe i think youre just trying to butter me up he listened to himself severe he sounded eager as a bridegroom as a matter of fact he was eager as a bridegroom he took a couple of quick steps across the kitchen rivkas arms went around him at the same time his went around her after a few seconds she said for this i may even like you better cleanshaven your mustaches used to tickle my nose when we kissed if you like it so well he said and resumed his hand cupped her breast through the wool of her dress she made a small noise deep in her throat and pressed herself tighter against him the door opened moishe and rivka jumped away from each other as if they had springs in their shoes from the doorway reuven called is there anything to eat im hungry theres a heel of bread in here you can have and im making soup rivka answered your father brought home a couple of lovely cabbages her shrug to moishe was full of humorous frustration he understood the feeling because he shared it in the insanely overcrowded warsaw ghetto concerns about privacy had fallen to pieces because so little was to be had people did what they did and the other people crammed into a flat with them no matter how young pretended not to notice but decorum had returned to the family as soon as they were out of that desperate overcrowding reuven wolfed down the bread his mother gave him then sat on the kitchen floor to stare expectantly at the soup pot above him rivka said tonight to moishe he nodded his son let out an indignant squawk the soup wont be ready till tonight no i was talking about something else with your father rivka said partway appeased reuven resumed his pot watching the idea of privacy had come back after they were no longer stuffed into a flat like sardines but food they all still worried about food even though they werent starving any more if they hadnt moishe wouldnt have noticed rivka throwing out the wilted cabbage leaves wouldnt have counted that as a sign of their relative affluence do you know he said out of the blue i think i understand rumkowski better nu rivka said tell me how he could go on dealing with the lizards and with the nazis before them she shivered moishe explained his thoughts about the cabbage leaves then went on i think rumkowskis the same way only about power not food however he thought of it when this was a nazis ghetto he cant change his mind now hesfixated thats the word it came out in german yiddish didnt have a term for the precise psychological concept moishe was trying to get across rivka nodded to show she followed reuven said you threw out some cabbage leaves mama he got up and went over to the garbage can may i eat them no just leave them there rivka said and then again louder leave them there i told you youre not going to starve to death before the soup is done she stopped with a bemused look on her face progress moishe thought he shook his head to such had he been reduced that he measured progress by the existence of garbage rasputitsathe time of mud ludmila gorbunova squelched across the airstrip her boots making disgusting sucking and plopping noises at every step each time she lifted one more mud clung to it until she thought she was carrying half a kolkhozs worth on each foot the mud came to russia and the ukraine twice a year in the fall the rains brought it the fall rasputitsa could be heavy or light depending on how much rain fell for how long before it turned to snow and froze the ground the spring rasputitsa was different when the spring sun melted the snow and ice that had accumulated since last fall millions of square kilometers turned into a bog that included roads none of which was paved outside the big cities for several weeks the only ways to get around were by panje wagons which were almost boatshaped and had wheels high enough to get down through the glop to solid ground and by widetracked t tanks that also meant most aviation came to a halt during the rasputitsa the red air force flew off dirt strips and all the dirt was liquid for the time being taxiing for takeoffs and landings wasnt practical just keeping aircraft from sinking into the swamp wasnt easy as usual one model proved the exception the u with skis of the same sort the little biplane used to operate in heavy snow it could skid along the surface of the mud until it gained enough speed to take off and could also land in muck provided the pilot set it down as gently as if eggs were under the skis otherwise it dug its nose into the ground and sometimes flipped with unfortunate results for all concerned the mud in the revetment that housed ludmilas u was heavily strewn with straw which meant she didnt even sink to her ankles let alone to midcalf as she had outside she didnt squelch as much either georg schultz was adjusting one of the struts that joined the us upper and lower wings when she came into the revetment guten tag he said cautiously good day she returned also in german also cautiously he hadnt made any unwelcome advances since shed rounded on him for trying it and he had kept on maintaining her kukuruznik with his usual fanatic attention to detail they still werent easy around each other shed caught him watching her when he didnt think shed notice while he had to be nervous shed speak to her fellow russians about what hed done a thoroughgoing fascist he was tolerated only for his mechanical skills if the russians found a reason not to tolerate him he wouldnt last long he stuck a screwdriver into a pocket of his coveralls came to attention so stiff it mocked the respect it was supposed to convey the aircraft is ready for flight comrade pilot he reported thank you ludmila answered she did not call him comrade mechanic in return not because it sounded unnatural to her in german but because schultz used for sarcasm what should have been a term of egalitarian respect she wondered how hed survived in hitlerite germany in the soviet union that attitude would surely have seen him purged she checked the fuel level and the ammunition loads herself no such thing as being too careful when she was satisfied she stepped out of the revetment and waved for groundcrew men she they and schultz manhandled the kukuruznik out onto the runway it stayed on top of the mud more easily than they did when schultz yanked at the prop the little shvetsov five cylinder radial began to buzz almost at once the engines exhaust fumes made ludmila cough but she nodded approvingly at its note nazi and lecher though he was georg schultz knew his work ludmila released the brake applied the throttle the u slid down the airstrip mud splattering in its wake when she d built up the speed she needed not much she eased back on the stick and the biplane abandoned the boggy earth for the freedom of the sky with the rasputitsa below her ludmila could savor the beginnings of spring the slipstream that slid over the windscreen no longer turned her nose and cheeks to lumps of ice the sun shone cheerily out of a blue sky with only a few plump white clouds and would not disappear below the horizon when later afternoon came the air smelled of growing things not of the mud in which they grew she wished she could fly higher to see more this was a day when flying was a joy not a duty but just when for a moment she was on the verge of forgetting why she flew she skimmed low over the rusting hulks of two ts one with its turret lying upside down fifteen meters away from the hull she wondered whether the germans or lizards had killed the soviet tanks either way the melancholy sight reminded her someone would kill her too if she failed to remember she was in the middle of a war with every second lizardheld territory drew closer after so many missions flying into country the alien imperialist invaders controlled had begun to approach the routine shed dropped small bombs on them and shot at them smuggled in weapons and propaganda for the partisans todays mission was different you are to pick up a man colonel karpov had told her his name is nikifor sholudenko he has information valuable to the soviet union what this information is i do not know only its importance i understand comrade colonel ludmila had answered the more one knew the more one could be encouraged to tell if captured an apple orchard halfway between konotop and romni thats what hed said at any rate it would have been easy if shed been able to fly straight over konotop on a course for romni well it would have been easier anyhow but the lizards held konotop in their little clawed hands flying over it would have resulted in the untimely demise shed so far managed to forestall and so as usual she flew a track that reminded her of what shed learned in biology of the twists of the intestines within the abdominal cavity all performed less than fifty meters off the ground if everything went perfectly the last jink would put her right at the orchard if things went as they usually didwell she told herself ill manage somehow off to her left she watched a lizard tank struggling to pull three or four trucks from the morass into which theyd blundered the tank wasnt having a much easier time moving than the trucks ludmilas lips skinned back from her teeth in a predators grin if she hadnt been under orders she could have shot up the convoy but deviating from the mission assigned would have caused her more grief than it was worth another change of course andif everything had gone rightthe apple orchard should have been a couple of kilometers dead ahead it wasnt of course she began a search spiral not something she was happy to do in broad daylight too much chance of flying past lizards who werent so preoccupied as that last bunch had been there barebranched trees beginning to go green with here and there the first white blossoms that before long would make the orchard look as if snow had fallen on it though all the rest of the world was verdant with spring a man waited in amongst the trees ludmila looked around for the best place to land her plane one stretch of boggy ground seemed no different from another shed hoped the partisans would have marked off a strip but no such luck after a moment she realized no one had told her this sholudenko was connected with the partisans shed assumed as much but what were assumptions worth not a kopeck as close to the orchard as i can she said making the decision aloud shed landed on airfields which were just thatfieldsso often that she took one more such landing for granted down she came killing her airspeed and peering ahead to make sure she wasnt about to go into a hole or anything of the sort she was down and sliding along before she saw the old gnarled roots sticking out of the ground she realized then too late that the orchard had once been bigger than it was now she couldnt wrench back on the stick and take off again she wasnt going fast enough the kukuruznik didnt need much room to land god willing a thought that welled up unbidden through her marxistleninist education and training everything would be all right she almost made it but just when she started to believe she would the tip of her left ski caught under a root as thick as her arm the u tried to spin back around the way it had come a wing dug into the ground she heard a spar snap the prop smacked the ground and snapped one wooden blade whined past her head then the kukuruznik flipped over onto its back leaving ludmila hanging upside down in the open pilots cabin bozhemoimy god she said shakily no the dialectic somehow didnt spring to mind when shed just done her best to kill herself squelch squelch squelch someone presumably the fellow whod been standing in the apple orchard was coming up to what had been her aircraft and was now just so much junk in a dry voice he said ive seen that done better so have i ludmila admitted comrade sholudenko the same he said they didnt tell me you would be a woman are you all right do you need help getting out ludmila took mental inventory shed bitten her lip shed be bruised but she didnt think shed broken anything but her aircraft and her pride im not hurt she muttered as for the other she released the catches of her safety harness came down to earth with a wet splat and filthy crawled out from under the u here i am here you are he agreed his russian like hers had a ukrainian accent he looked like a ukrainian peasant with a wide highcheekboned face blue eyes and blond hair that looked as if it had been cut under a bowl he didnt talk like a peasant though not only did he sound educated he sounded cynical and worldlywise he went on how do you propose to take me where i must go will another aircraft come to pick up both of us it was a good question one for which ludmila lacked a good answer slowly she said if they do it wont be soon im not due back for some hours and my aircraft has no radio no u that she knew of had one poor communications were the bane of all soviet forces ground and air alike and when you do not land at your airstrip they are more likely to think the lizards shot you down than that you did it to yourself sholudenko said you must be a good pilot or you would have been dead a long time ago till a few minutes ago i thought so ludmila answered ruefully but yes you have a point how important is this information of yours i think it has weight sholudenko said someone in authority must have agreed with me or they would not have sent you to do tumbling routines for my amusement how large my news bulks in the world at large who can say ludmila slapped at the mud on her flying suit which spread it around without getting much of it off tumbling routines she wanted to hit him for that but he had influence or he wouldnt have been able to get a plane sent after him she contented herself with saying i dont think we should linger here the lizards are very good at spotting wreckage from the air and coming round to shoot it up a distinct point sholudenko admitted without a backwards glance at the u he started north across the fields ludmila glumly tramped after him she asked do you have access to a radio yourself can you transmit the information that way some at need not all he patted the pack on his back the rest is photographs he paused the first sign of uncertainty hed shown wondering whether to tell me anything ludmila realized at length he said does the name stepan bandera mean anything to you the ukrainian collaborator and nationalist yes but nothing good during the throes of the soviet revolution the ukraine had briefly been independent of moscow and leningrad bandera wanted to bring back those days he was one of the ukrainians whod greeted the nazis with open arms only to have them throw him in jail a few months later no one loves a traitor ludmila thought you may use him if that proves convenient but no one loves him i know of nothing good to hear sholudenko said when the lizards came the nazis set him free to promote solidarity between the workers and peasants of the occupied ukraine and their german masters he paid them back for their treatment of him but not in a way to gladden our hearts ludmila needed a few seconds to work through the implications of that he is collaborating with the lizards he and most of the banderists sholudenko spat on the ground to show what he thought of that they have a committee of ukrainian liberation that has given our patriotic partisan bands a good deal of grief lately what is the rodina the motherland coming to ludmila said plaintively first we had to deal with those who would sooner have seen the germans enslave our people than live under our soviet government and now the banderists prefer the imperialist aliens to the soviet union and the germans something must be dreadfully wrong to make the people hate government so no sooner were the words out of her mouth than she wished she had them back again she did not know this nikifor sholudenko from a hole in the ground yes he dressed like a peasant but for all she knew he might be nkvd in fact he probably was nkvd if he had pictures of banderists in his knapsack and shed just criticized the soviet government in front of him had she been so foolish in shed likely have disappeared off the face of the earth even in the best of times shed have worried about a show trial or no trial and a stretch of years in the gulag she suspected the soviet prison camp system still functioned at undiminished efficiency most of it was in the far north where lizard control did not reach sholudenko murmured you do like to live dangerously dont you with almost immeasurable relief ludmila realized the world wasnt going to fall in on her at least not right away i guess i do she mumbled and resolved to watch her tongue more closely in the future in the abstract i could even agree with you sholudenko said as things are he spread his hands that meant that as far as he was concerned this conversation was not taking place and that he would deny anything she attributed to him if the matter came to the attention of an interrogator may i speakabstractlytoo she asked of course he said the constitution of guarantees free expression to all citizens of the soviet union as any schoolgirl knows he spoke without apparent irony yet his hypothetical schoolgirl had to know also that anyone trying to exercise her free speech or any of the other rights guaranteedor entombedin the constitution would discover shed picked a short trip into big trouble somehow though she did not think sholudenko for all his cynicism would betray her after giving her leave to speak maybe that was naive on her part but shed already said enough to let him ruin her if that was what he had in mind and so she said its terrible that our own soviet government has earned the hatred of so many of its people any ruling class will have those who work to betray it but so many terrible yes sholudenko said surprising no he ticked off points on his fingers like an academician or a political commissar consider comrade pilot a hundred years ago russia was entirely mired in the feudal means of production even at the time of the october revolution capitalism was far less entrenched here than in germany or england is this not so it is so ludmila said very well then consider also the significance of that fact suddenly the revolution had occurredin a world that hated it a world that would crush it if it could you are too young to remember the british the americans the japanese who invaded us but you wilt have learned of them yes but sholudenko held up a forefinger let me finish please comrade stalin saw we would be destroyed if we could not match our enemies in the quantity of goods we turn out anything and anyone standing in the way of that had to go thus the pact with the hitlerites not only did it buy us almost two years time but also land from the finns on the baltic and from the poles and rumanians to serve as a shield when the fascist murderers did attack us all that shield had been lost within a few weeks of the nazi invasion most of the people in the lands the soviet union had annexed joined the hitlerites in casting out the communist party which spoke volumes on how much theyd loved falling under soviet control but did that matter sholudenko had a point without ruthless preparation the revolution of the workers and peasants would surely have been crushed by reactionary forces either during the civil war or at german hands unquestionably the soviet state has the right and duty to survive ludmila said sholudenko nodded approvingly but the pilot went on but does the state have a right to survive in such a way as to make so many of its people prefer the vicious germans to its own representatives if she hadnt still been shaky from flipping her airplane she wouldnt have said anything so foolish to a probable nkvd man even abstractly she looked around the fields through which they were slogging no one was in sight if sholudenko tried to place her under arrest well she carried a mm tokarev pistol in a holster on her belt the comrade might have a tragic accident if he did shed do her best to get his precious pictures back to the proper authorities if he contemplated arresting her he gave no sign of it instead he said you are to be congratulated comrade pilot this is a question most would not think to pose it was a question most would not dare to pose but that was another matter sholudenko went on the answer is yes surely you have been trained in the historical use of the dialectic of course ludmila said indignantly historical progress comes through the conflict of two opposing theses and their resulting synthesis which eventually generates its own antithesis and causes the struggle to recur congratulations againyou are well instructed we stand in the historical process at the step before true communism do you doubt that marxs ideal will be fulfilled in our childrens time or our grandchildrens at the latest if we survive i do not doubt it ludmila said there is that sholudenko agreed dry as usual i believe we should have beaten the hitlerites in the end the lizards are another matter party dialecticians still labor to put them into proper perspective comrade stalin has yet to speak definitively on the subject but that is beside the pointyou might have asked the same question had the lizards never come da yes ludmila admitted wishing shed never asked the question at all sholudenko said if we abandon the hope of our descendants living under true communism the historical synthesis will show that reactionary forces were stronger than those of progress and revolution whatever we do to prevent that is justified no matter how hard it may be for some at present by everything shed learned in school his logic was airtight however much it went against the grain she knew she ought to shut up hed already shown more patience with her than she had any right to expect but she said what if in seeking to move the balance our way we are so harsh that we tilt it against us this too is a risk which must be considered he said are you a party member comrade pilot you argue most astutely no ludmila answered then having come so far she took one step further and you comradecould you be from the peoples commissariat for the interior yes i could be from the nkvd sholudenko answered evenly i could be any number of things but that one will do he studied her you needed courage to ask such a question of me that last step had almost been one step too far he meant picking her words with care ludmila said everything thats happened over the past year and a halfit makes one think about true meanings this i cannot deny sholudenko said butto get back to matters more important than my individual casethe dialectic makes me believe our cause will triumph in the end even against the lizards faith in the future had kept the soviets fighting even when things looked blackest when moscow seemed about to fall late in but against the lizardswe need more than the dialectic ludmila said we need more guns and planes and tanks and rockets and better ones too this is also true sholudenko said yet we also need the half of imperialist invaders whether from germany or the depths of space the dialectic predicts that on the whole we shall have their support instead of answering ludmila stooped by the edge of a little pond that lay alongside the field through which she and sholudenko were walking she cupped her hands scooped up water and scrubbed mud from her face she pulled up dead grass and did her best to scrape her leather flying suit clean too but that was a bigger job eventually the mud there would dry and she could knock most of it off till then shed just have to put up with it plenty of foot soldiers had gone through worse she straightened up pointed to the pack on nikifor sholudenkos back and for those who choose to ignore the teaching of the dialectic da comrade pilot for those folk we have people like me sholudenko smiled broadly his teeth were small and white and even they reminded ludmila of a wolfs fangs just the same ix mutt daniels crouched in a foxhole on the edge of randolph illinois hoping and praying the lizard bombardment would ease up before it smeared him across the smalltown landscape he felt naked with just a hole in the ground for cover back in france during the great war hed been able to dive into a deep dugout when german shells came calling if you were unlucky of course a shell would come right in after you but most of the time a dugout was pretty safe no dugouts here no proper trench lines either not really this war unlike the last one moved too fast to let people build elaborate field fortifications plenty of foxholes though matt muttered the local landscape looked like pictures of craters on the moon the lizards had taken randolph last summer in their drive on chicago pattons men had taken it back in the pincers movement that brought them into bloomington six or eight miles north now the lizards were moving again if randolph fell theyd be well positioned to drive back into bloomington yet another shell crashed into the ground close enough to lift daniels into the air and fling him back to earth as if bodyslammed by a wrestler dirt pattered down on him his lungs ached from the blast when he drew in a shaky breath might as well be between washington and richmond the way were goin back and forth here daniels said both his grandfathers had fought for the south in the war between the states as a small boy hed listened avidly to the tales they told tales that grew taller with each passing year no matter how tall the tales got though france and now this convinced him his grandfathers hadnt had it as tough as theyd thought more shells whistled overhead these southbound from bloomington mutt hoped they were registered on the lizard guns but they probably werent the lizards outranged american artillery giving lizard infantry a taste of what he was going through wasnt the worst thing in the world either a flight of propdriven fighters screamed by at treetop height mutt touched his helmet in salute to courage pilots who flew against the lizards didnt last long once the planes zipped out of sight he didnt spot them again he hoped that meant they were returning to base by a different route instead of getting knocked down no way to find out for sure he said he abruptly stopped being interested too because lizard shelling picked up again he embraced the ground like a lover pressed his face against her cool damp neck some of the blasts that shook him where he lay were explosions of the same sort hed known in france others had a sound hed first met retreating toward chicago a smaller bang followed by a pattering as of hail yall want to look sharp he called to the scattered members of his squad theyre throwin out them goddamn little mines again he hated those little baseballsized blue explosives once a regular shell went off at least it was gone but the lizards fancy ammo scattered potential mutilation over what seemed like half an acre and left it sitting there waiting to happen instant goddamn mine field mutt said resentfully after a while the barrage let up daniels grabbed his tommy gun and took a cautious peek out of the foxhole if the boches had been doing that shelling theyd follow up with an infantry attack just as sure as you were supposed to hit the cutoff man but the lizards didnt always play by the book mutt knew sometimes they fooled him on account of that more often he thought they hurt themselves so here if they wanted to drive the americans out of randolph theyd never have a better chance than now while the shelling had stunned and disorganized their human foes but they stayed back in their own lines south of town the only sign of action from them was a single plane high overhead its path through the sky marked by a silvery streak of condensation mutt gave the aircraft a onefinger salute gonna see how bad you beat on us before you send in the groundpounders are you he growled misable cheap bastards what was infantry for after all if not to pay the butchers bill his battered eardrums made the quiet that followed the barrage seem even more intense than it was the short sharp bang that punctuated it wouldnt have seemed worth noticing save for the shriek right after oh shit mutt exclaimed somebody went and did somethin dumb goddamn it to hell why dont nobody never listen to me hed thought minorleague ballplayers were bad at paying attention to what a manager told them well they were but they looked like einsteins when you set em next to a bunch of soldiers he scrambled out of the foxhole his body was skinnier and sprier than it had been while he was wearing his decatur commodores uniform but hed have cheerfully gone back to fat and flab if anybody offered him the choice no one did of course he crawled over battered ground and through ruined buildings toward where that shriek had come from memory wasnt his only guide a low moaning kept him on course kevin donlan lay just outside a shell hole clutching his left ankle below it everything was red ruin mutts stomach did a slow lurch jesus christ kid what did you do he said though the answer to that was all too obvious sarge donlans voice was light and clear as if his body hadnt really told him yet how bad he was hurt sarge i just got out to take a leak i didnt want to piss in my hole you know and next to what he had swimming a river of piss was nothing no point telling him that though not now miss lucille mutt bawled while he waited for her he got a wound bandage and a packet of sulfa powder out of a pouch on donlans belt he dusted the powder onto the wound he wondered if he ought to get the remains of donlans shoe off his foot before he started bandaging it but when he tried the kid started screaming again so he said the hell with it and wrapped the bandage over foot shoe and all lucille potter scrambled up a minute later maybe less in dirty fatigues and a helmet she looked like a man except that she didnt need a shave the helmet bore a red cross on a white circle the lizards had learned what that mark meant and werent any worse than people about respecting it she looked at the way blood was soaking through the bandage clicked her tongue between her teeth weve got to get a tourniquet on that wound sergeant mutt looked down at donlan the kids eyes had rolled up in his head mutt said you do that miss lucille hes gonna lose the foot i know she said but if we dont do it hes going to bleed to death and hed lose the foot anyhow no way to save it with a wound like that her sharp stare dared him to argue he couldnt hed seen enough wounds in france and illinois to know she was right she cut donlans torn trousers took out a length of bandage and a stick and set the tourniquet hell of a thing daniels said to himself and her both another young soldier on crutches for the rest of his life its hard i know lucille potter answered but would you rather have him dead ten years from now if this war ever ends would he rather wed let him die i reckon not daniels said in his younger days in mississippi a lot of the older white men hed known were shy an arm or a leg or a foot from the states war they werent glad of it naturally but they got on better than youd expect when you got right down to it people were pretty tough critters he sent a runner over to captain maczek where the captain was the company field telephone would be too after that there was nothing to do but wait donlan seemed pretty shocky when mutt remarked on it lucille potter said its probably a blessing in disguisehe wont feel that foot as much the forward aid station wasnt much more than a quarter of a mile back of the line a fourman litter team got to donlan in less than fifteen minutes the boss of the team a corporal looked at the youngsters ruined foot and shook his head nothing much well be able to do about that he said theyll have to take him back into bloomington and i expect theyll chop it off there youre almost certainly right lucille said all the litter bearers stared when she spoke she stared right back daring them to make something out of it none of them did she went on the sooner he goes back the sooner they can treat him the team got donlan onto the stretcher and carried him away too stinkin bad mutt said hes a good kid aint this war a he stopped inhibited in his language by a womans presence after a sigh he resumed lord i wish i had me a cigarette or even a chaw filthy habits both of them lucille potter said her voice so sharp he turned to give her an irritated look then with a wry chuckle she added i wish i had a smoke too i ran out of tobacco months ago and i miss it like anything might be some back in bloomington mutt said we ever get a real lull could be id send szabo back there to see how the foraging is you want to liberate somethin from where it rightly belongs ol draculas the man for the job hes certainly good at coming up with home brew and moonshine lucille said but people make those around here illinois isnt tobacco country so we cant get hold of bootleg cigars cant get hold of much of anything these days mutt said im skinniern ive been for close to thirty years its good for you she answered which made him give her another resentful glance she was on the lean side and looked to have always been that way not an ounce of excess flesh anywhere what did she know about what felt comfortable and what didnt he wasnt in a mood to argue though so he said i just hope donlans gonna make out okay hes a good kid hell of a thing to be crippled so young better than dying i thought we already settled that lucille potter answered im just glad the field telephone was working and the litter crew was on the ball if they hadnt gotten here inside of about another ten minutes i was going to take his foot off myself she tapped her little black bag ive got some ether in here he wouldnt have felt anything you know how daniels asked battlefield wounds were one thing but cutting into a man on purpose he shook his head he was sure he couldnt do it lucille said i havent had to do an amputation yet but ive read up on the technique i i know that mutt broke in every time i see you you got a doctors book in your hand i have to nurses dont operate and i wasnt even a scrub nurse to watch doctors work but a combat medic had better be able to do as much as she can because were not always going to have a lull like this one to get our casualties back to the aid station does that make sense to you yeah daniels said you usually do off to the left small arms began to chatter on both sides of the line mutt interrupted himself to scramble into the shell hole from which unlucky kevin donlan had emerged to relieve himself lucille potter jumped in beside him her only combat experience was what shed had in the past few weeks but take cover was a lesson you learned in a hurry at least if you wanted to keep on living then the artillery started up again the lizards firing steadily the americans in bursts of a few rounds here a few rounds there a few somewhere else theyd learned the hard way that if their pieces stayed in one place for more than a short salvo the lizards would zero in on them and knock them out the ground began tossing like the stormy sea though mutt had never been in a natural storm that made such a godawful racket he pushed lucille down flat on her belly then lay on top of her to protect her from splinters as best he could he didnt know whether he did it because she was a woman or because she was the medic either way he figured she needed to stay as safe as possible as suddenly as it had begun the barrage stopped mutt stuck his head up right away sure as hell lizard ground troops were scurrying forward he squeezed off a long burst with his tommy gun the lizards flattened out on the ground he didnt know whether hed hit any of them the tommy gun wasnt accurate out past a couple of hundred yards he wished he had one of the automatic weapons the lizards carried their effective range was something like double that of his submachine gun and their cartridges packed a bigger kick too hed heard of dogfaces who toted captured specimens but keeping them in the right ammo was a bitch and a half most of the weapons the lizards lost went straight back to the highforehead boys in g with luck the americans would get toys just as good one of these days that train of thought abruptly got derailed he moaned down deep in his throat the lizards had a tank with them now he understood what the poor damned germans had felt like in france in when those monsters came clanking their way and they couldnt stop them or even do much to slow them down the tank and the lizard infantry screening it slowly advanced together the aliens had learned something since the winter before theyd lost a lot of tanks then for lack of infantry support not any more lucille potter peered over the forward lip of the foxhole beside mutt thats trouble she said he nodded it was big trouble if he ran the tanks machine gun or the lizard foot soldiers would pick him off if he stayed the tank would penetrate the position and then the lizard infantry would get him off to the right somebody fired one of those new bazooka rockets at the lizard tank the rocket hit the tank right in the turret but it didnt penetrate damn fool mutt ground out doctrine said you were supposed to shoot a bazooka only at the rear or sides of a lizard tank the frontal armor on the aliens machines was just too thick for you to kill one with a straighton shot being too eager cost the fellow whod fired at the tank it turned toward him and his buddies and opened up first with its machine gun and then its main armament for good measure the lizard infantry moved in on the bazooka man tootheir job was to make sure nobody got a good shot at the armored fighting vehicle by the time they were done there probably wasnt enough of the american and his buddies left to bury which meant they forgot about mutt for a second he didnt think that would do him any good if the line was overrun he would be too in short order ever so cautiously he raised his head again there sat the tank maybe a hundred feet away ass end on to him still pouring fire at a target more necessary to destroy than he was he ducked back down turned to lucille potter gimme that ether he snapped what why she took a protective grip on the black bag thestuffll burn wont it his pas hard hand on his backside and across his face had taught him never to swear where a woman could hear but he almost slipped that time now gimme it lucilles eyes widened she opened the bag handed him the glass jar it was about half full of a clear oilylooking liquid he hefted it thoughtfully yeah it would throw just fine his bat had kept him from having a decent bigleague career nobodyd ever complained about his arm hed been a good man with a grenade in france too it wasnt even as if he had to throw all of a sudden as he would have with a runner breaking for second he could take a few moments think through what he was going to do see every step of it in his mind before it actually happened doing that took longer than the throw itself he popped up as if exploding out of his crouch behind a batter fired the jar for all he was worth and ducked back down again nobody who wasnt looking right at him would have known hed appeared did you hit it lucille demanded miss lucille i tell you for a fact i didnt stay up long enough to find out i tried to smash it off the back of the turret so itd drip down into that nice hot engine compartment mutts shoulder twinged he hadnt put that much into a snap throw in years it had felt straight but you never could tell a little long a little short and he might as well not have bothered then he heard hoarse yells from the americans in other scattered foxholes that encouraged him to take another cautious peek when he did he yelled himself in sheer delight flames danced all over the engine compartment and were licking up the back of the turret as he watched an escape hatch popped open and a lizard jumped onto the ground mutt ducked down for his tommy gun miss lucille that there is one lizard tank thats out stealing she pounded him on the back as any other soldier would have he wouldnt have tried to kiss another soldier though she let him do it but she didnt do much in the way of kissing back he didnt worry about that he popped up out of the foxhole and started blazing away at the fleeing lizard tank crew and the foot soldiers who were much less terrifying without armor to back them up the lizards fell back the tank kept burning a sherman would have brewed up a hell of a lot faster than it did but eventually its ammunition and its fuel tank went up in a spectacular blast mutt felt as if hed been hit over the head with a sledgehammer lord he exclaimed you couldnt make a fancier explosion in the movies no probably not lucille potter agreed nor one that did more for us well hold randolph a while longer now i expect that was a wonderful throw ive never seen a better one you must have been a very fine baseball player you dont make the majors unless youre pretty fair he said shrugging you dont stick there unless youre bettern that and i wasnt he brushed a hand across the front of his shirt as if hed been a pitcher shaking off a sign rather than a catcher baseball wasnt what he wanted to talk about at the moment after a couple of tentative coughs he said miss lucille i hope you dont think i was too forward there when you kissed me you mean i didnt mind she said but not in a way that encouraged him to try it again by her tone once had been okay but twice wouldnt be he kicked at the churnedup dirt inside the foxhole lucille added im not interested mutt not that way its not youyoure a good man but im just not okay he said he was too old to let his pecker do his thinking for him but that didnt mean hed forgotten he had one he pushed up his helmet so he could scratch his head above one ear if you like me why he broke off there if she didnt want to talk about it that was her business for the first time since hed met her he found her at a loss for words she frowned obviously not caring for that herself slowly she said mutt its not something i can easily explain or care to i easily or not she didnt get the chance to explain following a cry of miss lucille a soldier from another squad in the platoon came scrambling over to the foxhole and gasped out miss lucille weve got two men down one hit in the shoulder the other in the chest petersthe guy with the chest woundhes in bad shape im coming she said briskly and climbed out of the hole shed shared with mutt as she hurried away he scratched his head again even in these times david goldfarb had expected things to be handled with more ceremony the prime minister after all did not visit the bruntingthorpe research and development test flying aerodrome every day but there was no line of raf men in blue serge standing to attention for winston churchill to inspect no flyby of a squadron of pioneers or meteors to impress him with what fred hipple and his team had accomplished in jet propulsion in fact up until an hour before churchill got to bruntingthorpe no one knew he was coming group captain hipple brought the news back from the administrative sections nissen hut it produced a brief startled silence from his subordinates who were laboring mightily to pull secrets from the wreckage of the lizard fighterbomber that had been brought down not far from the aerodrome typically flight officer basil roundbush was first to break that silence generous of him to give us notice enough to make sure our flies are closed i cant tell you how delighted i am to be confident yours is dear boy hipple returned roundbush covered his face with his hands acknowledging the hit the group captain might have been shorter than his subordinates but gave away nothing in wit he continued i gather no one knew until moments ago quite a lot of security laid on for reasons which should be plain enough wouldnt do for the lizards to pay us a visit just now would it sir goldfarb said yes that would proveembarrassing hipple said an understatement roundbush might have coveted and so just as goldfarb had the prime minister came down from leicester by bicycle pedaling along on an elderly model like a grandfather out for a constitutional he dismounted outside the meteorology hut where hipple and his team still labored after the latest lizard bombing raid when goldfarb saw the round pink face and the familiar cigar through the window he gulped hed never expected to meet the leader of the british empire wing commander julian pearys reaction was more prosaic in the big deep voice that went so oddly with his slight physique he said i do hope hes not damaged any of the beets it was only half a joke like everyone else at bruntingthorpelike everyone else in britain or so it seemedhipples team cultivated a garden the british isles held more people than they could easily feed and shipments from america were down not so much because the lizards bombed them they still took much less notice of ships than of air or rail or road transport as because the yanks beset at home had little to spare so gardens beets potatoes peas beans turnips parsnips cabbages maize whatever the climate would permit people grewand sometimes guarded with cricket bats savage dogs or shotguns against twolegged thieves too big to be frightened by scarecrows everyone did come to attention when the prime minister accompanied by a bodyguard who looked as if he never smiled walked into the nissen hut as you were gentlemen please churchill said after all officially i am not here but speaking over the bbc in london because i am in the habit of speaking live i can occasionally use the subterfuge of sound recordings to let myself be in two places at once he let out a conspiratorial chuckle i hope you wont give me away automatically goldfarb shook his head hearing churchills voice without the static and distortion of a wireless set was to him even more intimate than seeing the prime minister in the tubby flesh rather than through photographs pictures captured his image more accurately than the airwaves did his voice churchill strode over to fred hipple who was standing beside a wooden table on which lay pieces of the turbine from the crashed lizard fighters jet engine pointing to them the prime minister asked how long before we shall be able to duplicate that engine group captain duplicate it sir hipple said it wont be soon the lizards are far ahead of us in control mechanisms for the engine in machining techniques and in the materials they employ they do things with titanium and ceramics weve never dreamt of much less attempted but in determining how and why they make things as they do we learn how to do better ourselves i see churchill said thoughtfully so even though you have the book in front of youhe pointed to the disassembled chunks of turbine againyou cannot simply read off what is on its pages but must decode it as if it were written in a cipher thats a good analogy sir hipple said the facts of the engine are relatively straightforward even if we cant yet produce one identical to it ourselves when it comes to the radar from the same downed aircraft i fear we are still missing a great many code groups so to speak so i have been given to understand churchill said although i do not fully grasp where the difficulty lies let me take you over to radarman goldfarb then sir hipple said he joined the team to help emplace a radar set in production meteors and has labored valiantly to unlock the secrets of the lizard unit that fell into our hands as the group captain brought the prime minister over to his workbench goldfarb thought not for the first time that fred hipple was a good man to work for a lot of superior officers would have done all the explaining to the brass themselves and pretended their subordinates didnt exist but hipple introduced goldfarb to churchill then stood back and let him speak for himself he didnt find it easy at first when he stammered the prime minister shifted the subject away from radar goldfarb he said musingly was i not told you are the lad with a family connection to mr russie the former lizard spokesman from poland yes thats true sir goldfarb answered were cousins when my father came to england before the great war he urged his sister and her husband to come with him and he kept urging them to get out until the second war started in they wouldnt listen to him though moishe russie is their son so your family kept up the connection then till the war cut us off yes sir after that i didnt know what had happened to any of my relatives until moishe began speaking on the wireless he didnt tell churchill most of his kinsfolk had died in the ghetto the prime minister presumably knew that already besides goldfarb couldnt think about their fate without filling up with a terrible anger that made him wish england were still at war with the nazis rather than the lizards churchill said i shant forget this link it may yet prove useful for us before goldfarb could work up the nerve to ask him how he swung back to radar suppose you explain to me how and why this set is so different from ours and so baffling ill try sir goldfarb said one of our radars like a wireless set depends on valvesvacuum tubes the americans would sayfor its operation the lizards dont use valves instead they have these things he pointed to the boards with little lumps and silvery spiderwebs of metal set across them and so churchill said why should a mere substitution pose a problem because we dont know how the bloody things work goldfarb blurted wishing the ground would open up and swallow him he tried to make amends that is we have no theory to explain how these little lumps of siliconwhich is what they are sircan perform the function of valves and because theyre nothing like what were used to were having to find out what each one does by cut and try so to speak we run power into it and see what happens we dont know how much power to use either churchill fortunately took his strong language in stride and what have you learnt from your experiments that the lizards know more about radar than we do sir goldfarb answered thats the long and short of it im afraid we cant begin to make parts to match these a chemical engineer with whom ive spoken says our best silicon isnt pure enough and some of the little lumps when you look at them under a microscope are so finely etched that we cant imagine how let alone why its been done how and why are for those with the luxury of time which we have not got churchill said we need to know what the device does whether we can match it and how to make it less useful to the foe yes sir goldfarb said admiringly churchill was no boffin but he had a firm grip on priorities no one yet fully understood the theory of the magnetron or how and why the narrow channels connecting its eight outer holes to the larger central one exponentially boosted the strength of the signal that the device operated so however was undeniable fact and had given the raf a great lead over german radaralthough not worse luck over what the lizards used group captain hipple said what have we learnt which is exploitable goldfarb sorry sir i should have realized at once that was what the prime minister needed to know we can copy the design of the lizards magnetron that at least we recognize it gives a signal of shorter wavelength and hence more precise direction than any weve made ourselves and the nose dish that receives returning pulses is a very fine bit of engineering which shouldnt be impossible to incorporate into later marks of the meteor very good radarman goldfarb churchill said i shant keep you from your work any longer with the aid of men like you and your comrades in this hut we shall triumph over this adversity as we have over all others and you radarman you may yet have a role to play even more important than your work here the prime minister looked uncommonly cherubic three years in the raf had taught goldfarb that rankers who wore that expression had more up their sleeves than their arms theyd also taught him he couldnt do anything about it so he said what he had to say ill be happy to serve in any way i can sir churchill nodded genially then went back to hipple and his colleagues for more talk about jet engines after another few minutes he put his hat back on tipped it to hipple and left the nissen hut basil roundbush grinned at goldfarb i say old man after winnie makes you an mp do remember the little people who knew you before you grew rich and famous an mp goldfarb shook his head in mock dismay lord i hope thats not what he had in mind he said he had something important instead of this that sally met with general approval one of the meteorologists said good job you didnt tell him youre a labour supporter goldfarb it doesnt matter not now goldfarb had backed labour yes as offering more to the working man than the tories could and as was true of a lot of jewish immigrants and their progeny his own politics had a slant to the left but he also knew no one but churchill could have rallied britain against hitler and no one else could have kept her in the fight against the lizards thinking of the nazis and the lizards together made goldfarb think of the invasion so many had feared in the germans hadnt been able to bring it off not least because radar kept them from driving the raf from the skies if the lizards came no one could offer any such guarantee of success ironically the germans holding northern france served as englands shield against invasion by the aliens but the shield was not perfect the lizards had control of the air when they chose to use it they could leapfrog over northern france and the channel both just because they hadnt done it didnt mean they wouldnt or couldnt goldfarb snorted the only thing he could do about that was try to make british radar more effective which would in turn make the lizards pay more if they decided to invade it wasnt as much as hed have wanted to do in an ideal world but it was more than most people could say so be supposed it would do and hed not only met winston churchill but talked business with him that wasnt something everyone could say he couldnt write home to his family that the prime minister had been herethe censors would never pass itbut he could tell them if he ever got down to london hed almost given up on the notion of leave fred hipple said churchills full of good ideas the only difficulty is hes also full of bad ones and sometimes telling the one from the others not easy till after the fact what he said about tackling the lizards radar circuitry was firstrate goldfarb said what is more important for us now than how or why we can use what we learn without knowing why it works just as some stupid clot can drive a motorcar without cluttering his head with the theory of internal combustion ah but someone must understand the theory or your stupid clot would have no motorcar to drive basil roundbush said thats true only to a limited degree hipple said even now theory takes you only so far in aircraft design eventually you just have to go out and see how the beast flies that was much more the case during the great war when practically everything from what the older engineers have told me was cut and try yet the aircraft they manufactured did fly most of the time roundbush said darkly im bloody glad i never had to go up in them goldfarb ignored that roundbush made wisecracks the same way other men fiddled with rosaries or cracked their knuckles or tugged at one particular lock of hair it was a nervous tic nothing more clucking softly to himself goldfarb fixed a power source to one side of a lizard circuit element and an ohmmeter to the other hed measure voltage and amperage next with these strange components you couldnt tell what they were supposed to do to a current that ran through them except by experiment he turned on the power the ohmmeter swung the component did resist the currents flow goldfarb grunted in satisfaction hed thought it would it looked like others that had he noted down the reading as well as where the circuit element sat on its board and what it looked like then he turned off the power and hooked up the voltage meter one tiny piece at a time he added to the jigsaw puzzle as vyacheslav molotov turned the knob that led him into the antechamber in front of stalins night office he felt and suppressed a familiar nervousness elsewhere in the soviet union his word went unchallenged in negotiating with the capitalist states that hated the soviet revolution even in discussions with the lizards he was the unyielding representative of his nation he knew he had a reputation for being inflexible and did everything he could to play it up not here though anyone who was unyielding and inflexible with stalin would soon know the stiffness of death then molotov had no more time for such reflections for stalins orderlyoh the fellow had a fancy title but that was what he wasnodded to him and said go on in he expects you vyacheslav mikhailovich molotov nodded and entered stalins sanctum this was not where the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union was photographed with diplomats or soldiers he had a fancy office upstairs for that he worked here at hours that suited him it was onethirty in the morning stalin would be at it for at least another couple of hours those who dealt with him had to adjust themselves accordingly stalin looked up from the desk with the gooseneck lamp good morning vyacheslav mikhailovich he said with his throaty georgian accent his voice held no irony morning it was as far as he was concerned good morning iosef vissarionovich molotov replied whatever his feelings about the matter were he had schooled himself not to reveal them he found that important at any time doubly so around the ruler of the soviet union stalin waved molotov to a chair then stood up himself though wellproportioned he was short and did not like other men looming over him what he did not like did not occur he filled his pipe from a leather tobacco pouch lit a match and got the pipe going the harsh smell of makhorka cheap russian tobacco made molotovs nose twitch in spite of himself under the irongray mustache stalins lip curled i know its vile but its all i can find these days what shipping we get has no room aboard for luxuries that said as much as anything about the plight in which mankind found itself when the leader of one of the three greatest nations on the planet could not get decent tobacco even for himself the lizards were the ones with the upper hand well if he understood what was in stalins mind this meeting was to be about how to tilt the balance back the other way stalin sucked in more smoke paced back and forth at length he said so the americans and germans are pressing ahead with their programs to make bombs of this explosive metal so i have been given to understand iosef vissarionovich molotov answered i am also told by our intelligence services that they had these programs in place before the lizards began their invasion of the earth we also had such a program in place stalin answered placidly that relieved molotov who had heard of no such program he wondered how far along soviet scientists had been compared to those in the decadent capitalist and fascist countries faith in the strength of marxistleninist precepts made him hope they might have been ahead concern over how far the soviet union had had to come since the revolution made him fear they might have been behind with hope and fear so commingled he dared not ask stalin which was the true state of affairs stalin went on we now have an advantage over both the united states and the hitlerites in that raid against the lizards last fall we obtained a considerable supply of the explosive metal as you know i had hoped the german taking the metal back to the hitlerites would be waylaid in poland and his share lost stalin looked unhappy so did molotov who said this much i did know and how he had to give up half his share though not all to the polish jews who then passed it on to the americans yes stalin said hitler is a fool do you know that you have said it many times iosef vissarionovich molotov answered that was true but it had not kept stalin from making his nonaggression pact with germany in or from living up to it for almost the next two years or from being so confident hitler would also live up to it that hed ignored warnings of an impending nazi attack ignored them so completely that the soviet state had almost crashed in ruins because of it since molotov had supported stalin in those choices he could hardly bring them up now if he hadnt supported him then he would be in no position to bring them up now stalin drew on his pipe again his cheeks pitted from a boyhood bout of smallpox twitched with distaste not even from so close as turkey can i get decent tobacco but do you know why i say hitler is a fool for wantonly attacking the peaceloving people of the soviet union who had done nothing to deserve it molotov gave the obvious answer and a true one but it left him unhappy stalin was looking for something else sure enough he shook his head but to molotovs relief he was only amused not angry that is not what was in my mind vyacheslav mikhailovich i say he was a fool because when his scientists discovered the uranium atom could be split they published their findings for all the world to see stalin chuckled rheumily had we made that finding here can you imagine such an article appearing in the proceedings of the akademia nauk the soviet academy of sciences hardly molotov said and he chuckled too he was normally the most mirthless of men but when stalin laughed you laughed with him besides this was the sort of thing he did find funny stalin was dead right heresoviet secrecy would have kept such an important secret from leaking out where prying eyes could fasten on it i will tell you something else that will amuse you stalin said it takes a certain amount of explosive metal to explode our scientists tell me below this amount it will not go off no matter what you do do you understand oh it is a lovely joke stalin laughed again molotov also laughed but uncertainly this time he did not see the joke stalin must have sensed that his uncanny skill at scenting weakness in his subordinates was not least among the talents that had kept him in power for twenty years still in that jovial mood he said never fear vyacheslav mikhailovich i shall explain i would far sooner the germans and americans had no explosive metal but because the polish jews divided it between them neither has enough for a bomb now do you see no molotov confessed but he reversed course a moment later wait yes perhaps i do do you mean that we with an undivided share have enough to make one of these bombs for ourselves that is exactly what i mean stalin said see you are a clever fellow after all the germans and the americans will still have to do all the research they would have required anyhow but wewe shall soon be ready to fight the lizards fire against fire so to speak just contemplating that felt good to molotov like stalin like everyone he had lived in dread of the day when moscow like berlin and washington might suddenly cease to exist to be able to retaliate in kind against the lizards brought a glow of anticipation to his sallow features but his joy was not undiluted he said iosef vissarionovich we shall have the one bomb with no immediate prospect for producing more is that right once we have used the weapon in our hands what is to keep the lizards from dropping a great many such weapons on us stalin scowled he did not care for anyone going against anything he said even in the slightest way nevertheless he thought seriously before he answered molotovs question was to the point at last he said first of all our scientists will go on working to produce explosive metal for us they will be strongly encouraged to succeed stalins smile reminded molotov of that of a lion resting against a zebra carcass from which it had just finished feeding molotov had no trouble visualizing the sort of encouragement the soviet nuclear physicists would get dachas cars women if they wanted them for success and the gulag or a bullet in the back of the neck if they failed probably a couple of them would be purged just to focus the minds of the others on what they were doing stalins methods were ugly but they got results how long before the physicists can do this for us molotov said they babble about three or four years as if this were not an emergency stalin said dismissively i have given them eighteen months they shall do as the party requires of them or else suffer the consequences molotov chose his words with care it might be better if they did not undergo the supreme penalty iosef vissarionovich men of their technical training would be difficult to replace adequately yes yes stalin sounded impatient always a danger sign but they are the servants of the peasants and workers of the soviet union not their masters we must not let them get ideas above their station or the virus of the bourgeoisie will infect us once again no that cannot be permitted molotov agreed let us say that they do all they have promised how do we protect the soviet union in the time between our using the bomb we have made from the lizards explosive metal and that in which we begin to manufacture it for ourselves for one thing we do not use that one bomb immediately stalin answered we cannot use it immediately for it is not yet made but even if it were i would wait to pick the proper moment and besides vyacheslav mikhailovichstalin looked smughow will the lizards be certain we have only the one bomb once we use it they shall have to assume we can do it again not so unless they assume we used their explosive metal for the first one molotov said he wished hed kept his mouth shut stalin didnt shout or bluster at him that he would have withstood with ease instead the general secretary fixed him with a glare as cold and dark and silent as midwinter at murmansk that was stalins sign of ultimate displeasure he ordered generals and commissars shot with just such an expression here though molotovs point was too manifestly true for stalin to ignore the glare softened as winters grip did at last even in murmansk stalin said this is another good argument for carefully choosing the time and place we use the bomb but you also must remember if we face defeat without it we shall surely use it against the invaders no matter what they do to us in return they are more dangerous than the germans and must be fought with whatever means come to hand true enough molotov said the soviet union had people throw twenty or thirty million on the fire or even more and it remained a going concern just getting rid of the kulaks and bringing in collectivized agriculture had killed millions through deliberate famine if more deaths were what building socialism in the ussr required more deaths there would be i am glad you agreed vyacheslav mikhailovich stalin said silkily under the silk lay jagged steel had molotov persisted in disagreeing something most disagreeable would have happened to him the foreign commissar of the soviet union was fearless before the leaders of the decadent capitalist states he had even confronted atvar who led the lizards before stalin molotov quailed stalin genuinely terrified him as he did every other soviet citizen back in revolutionary days the little mustachioed georgian had not been so much but since oh but since nevertheless molotov owed allegiance not just to stalin but to the soviet union as a whole if he was to serve the ussr properly he needed information getting it without angering his master was the trick carefully he said the lizards have taken a heavy toll on our bombing planes will we be able to deliver the bomb once we have it i am told the device will be too heavy and bulky to fit in any of our bombers stalin said molotov admired the courage of the man who had toldhad had to tellthat to stalin but the soviet leader did not seem nearly so angry as molotov would have guessed instead his face assumed an expression of genial deviousness that made molotov want to make sure he still had his wallet and watch he went on if we can dispose of trotsky in mexico city i expect we can find a way to put a bomb where we want it no doubt you are right iosef vissarionovich molotov said trotsky had thought he was safe enough to keep plotting against the soviet union but several inches of tempered steel in his brain proved that a delusion no doubt i am stalin agreed complacently as undisputed master of the soviet union he had developed ways not altogether different from those of other undisputed masters molotov had once or twice thought of saying as much but it remained just thata thought he did ask how soon can the germans and americans begin producing their own explosive metal the americans didnt much worry him they were far away and had worries closer to home the germans hitler had talked about using the new bombs against the lizards in poland the soviet union was an older enemy and almost as close we are working to learn this i expect we shall be informed well in advance whatever the answer proves to be stalin answered complacent still soviet espionage in capitalist countries continued to function well many there devoted themselves to furthering the cause of the socialist revolution molotov cast about for other questions he might safely ask before he could come up with any stalin bent over the papers on his desk a sure sign of dismissal thank you for your time iosef vissarionovich molotov said as he stood to go stalin grunted his politeness was minimal but then so was molotovs with anyone but him when molotov closed the door behind him he permitted himself the luxury of a small sigh hed survived another audience for getting his consignment of uranium or whatever it was safely from boston to denver leslie groves had been promoted to brigadier general he hadnt yet bothered replacing his eagles with stars he had more important things to worry about his pay was accumulating at the new rate not that that meant much what with prices going straight through the roof at the moment what galled him worse than inflation was the lack of gratitude he was getting from the metallurgical laboratory scientists enrico fermi looked at him with sorrowful mediterranean eyes and said valuable as this sample may be it does not constitute a critical mass im sorry thats not a term i know groves said he knew nuclear energy could be released but nobody had done much publishing on matters nuclear since hahn and strassmann split the uranium atom and to complicate things further the met lab crew had developed a jargon all their own it means you have not brought us enough with which to make a bomb leo szilard said bluntly he and the other physicists round the table glared at groves as if he were deliberately holding back another fifty kilos of priceless metal since he wasnt he glared too my escort and i risked our lives across a couple of thousand miles to get that package to you he growled if youre telling me we wasted our time smiling when you say it isnt going to help even relatively lean as the journey had left him he was the biggest man at the conference table and used to using his physical presence to get what he wanted no no this is not what we mean fermi said quickly you could not have known exactly what you had and we could not either until you delivered it we did not even know that you had it until you delivered it szilard said securitypah he muttered something under his breath in what might have been magyar whatever it was it sounded pungent groves had seen his dossier his politics had some radical leanings but he was too brilliant for that to count against him fermi added the material you brought will be invaluable in research and in combining with what we eventually produce ourselves but by itself it is not sufficient all right youll have to do here what you were going to do at chicago groves said hows that coming he turned to the one man from the met lab crew hed met before dr larssen what is the status of getting the project up and running again here in denver we were building the graphite pile under stagg field at the university of chicago jens larssen answered now were reassembling it under the football stadium here the work goeswell enough he shrugged groves gave larssen a searching onceover he didnt seem to have the driving energy hed shown in white sulphur springs west virginia the summer before then hed passionately urged the federal governmentinhiding to do all it could to hold chicago against the lizards but the met lab had had to move even though chicago was held and nowwell it just didnt seem as if larssen gave a damn that kind of attitude wouldnt do not when the work at hand was so urgent the meeting with the physicists went on for another half hour over lesser but still vital issues like keeping electricity coming into denver and into the university of denver in particular so the men could do their jobs people in the united states had taken electricity for granted until the lizards came now over too much of the country it was a vanished luxury but if it vanished in denver the met lab would have to find somewhere else to go and groves didnt think the countryor the worldcould afford the delay unlike nuclear physics electricity was something with which by god he was intimately familiar well keep it going for you he promised and hoped he could make good on the vow if the lizards got the idea humans were experimenting with nuclear energy here theyd have something to say about the matter keeping them from finding out then was going to be a sizable part of keeping the lights on when the meeting broke up groves fell into step with larssen and ignored the physicists efforts to break away we need to talk dr larssen he said no we dont colonelsorry generalgroves larssen said loading the title with all the scorn he could the armys already done enough to screw up my life thanks very much i dont need any more help from you he turned his back and started to stamp off groves shot out a big meaty hand and caught him by the arm from the way larssen whirled around groves thought he was going to swing on him decking a physicist wasnt part of his own job description but if that was what it took that was what hed do maybe larssen saw that in his eyes for he didnt throw the punch groves said look your life is your business but when it makes you have trouble with your job well your particular job is too important to let that happen so whats eating you and how come you think its the armys fault you want to know youreally want to know larssen didnt wait for an answer from groves but plowed ahead well why the hell shouldnt i tell you somebody else will if i dont after i saw you last year i managed to get all the way to western indiana on my own thats when i ran into general patton who wouldnt let me send my wife a message so shed know i was alive and okay security groves began yeah security so i couldnt get her a message then and by the time i got to chicago it was too latethe met lab team had already taken off and i couldnt get a message to barbara after thatsecurity again so she figured i was dead what was she supposed to think oh groves said im sorry that must have been a shock when she came into denver but ill bet you had quite a reunion it was great larssen said his voice deadly cold she thought i was dead so she fell for this corporal who rides herd on lizard pows she married him up in wyoming i was already in denver but colonel hexham god bless him still wouldnt let me write security one more time now shes gonna have the guys baby so as far as im concerned general groves sir the us army can go fuck itself and if you dont like it throw me in the brig groves opened his mouth closed it again hed been through chugwater just after that wedding in wyoming hed known something was eating larssen but not what no wonder the poor bastard was in a blue funk mahatma gandhi wouldnt have stayed cool calm and collected with this landing on him maybe shell come back to you he said at last it sounded lame even in his own ears larssen laughed scornfully doesnt look that way shes still going to bed with sam stinking yeager thats for sure women he clapped a hand to his forehead you cant live without em and they wont live with you groves hadnt seen his own wife in months either or sent her a note or anything else he didnt worry about her running around though he just worried about her being all right maybe that just meant he was older and more settled than larssen and his wife maybe it meant his marriage was in better shape or maybe unsettling thought it meant he didnt know what to worry about he fell back on his own training dr larssen you cannot let it get you down to the point where it affects your work you cannot more than just you and your wife depends on what you do here more even than your country i am not exaggerating when i say the fate of humanity rests on your shoulders i know that larssen said but its hard to give a damn about the fate of humanity when the one human being who really matters to you goes and does something like this there groves could not argue with him nor did he try he said youre not the only one in that boat it happens all the timemaybe more in war than in peace because things are more broken up nowadaysbut all the time you have to pick up the pieces and keep going you think i dont know that larssen said i tell myself the same thing twenty times a day but its damned hard when i keep seeing her there with that other guy it hurts too much to stand groves thought about shipping out the other guyyeager larssen had said his name was with the war on keeping a physicist happy counted for more than the feelings of a lizard liaison man but even if he did that he had no guarantee it would bring barbara back into jens arms not if she was carrying yeagers baby and she and yeager wouldnt have got married if they hadnt thought larssen was dead theyd tried to make things right the best way they knew how it hadnt worked but they hadnt had all the data they needed and humans couldnt be engineered like electrons anyhow just the same groves wished he could order barbara to go to bed with jens for the good of the country it would have made things a lot simpler but while a medieval baron might have gotten away with an order like that a twentiethcentury woman would spit in his eye if he tried it that was what freedom was about he believed in freedom no matter how inconvenient it was at the moment professor larssen youve got yourself a mess he said heavily yeah now tell me one i havent heard when larssen broke away this time groves didnt try to stop him he just stood and watched till the physicist turned a corner and disappeared then he shook his head thats trouble waiting to happen he muttered and started slowly down the hall himself atvar turned one eye turret to the left side of the audience chamber the other to the right the assembled shiplords stared back at him he tried to gauge their temper theyd been struggling for close to two years almost one of tosev s slow revolutions around its star to bring the miserable world into the empire by all theyd known when they left from home the conquest should have been over in a matter of dayswhich only proved they hadnt known much my fellow males let us consider the status of our enterprise he said it shall be done exalted fleetlord the shiplords chorused in a show of the perfect obedience the race so esteemed no virtue was more fundamental than obedience so atvar had been taught since he came from his egg so hed believed till he came to tosev he still believed it but not as he had back on home tosev corroded every assumption the race made about how life should be lived the only thing the big uglies knew about obedience was that they werent very good at it theyd even overthrown and murdered emperors to atvar whose ruling dynasty had held the throne for tens of thousands of years a crime almost incomprehensibly heinous he said we do continue to make progress in our campaigns our counterattacks south of the tosevite city known as chicago on the smaller continental mass have pushed back the enemy and straha shiplord of the th emperor yower raised a hand atvar wished he could ignore the male unfortunately straha was next most senior shiplord after kirel who commanded the bannership itself even more unfortunately from atvars point of view straha headed a loud and vocal faction of males whose principal amusement seemed to be carping about the way the war against the tosevites was going having been reluctantly recognized straha said may it please the exalted fleetlord i would respectfully note that the campaign continues to have obvious shortcomings i hope i shall not try his patience if i elucidate proceed atvar said maybe he thought hopefully straha will say something really unforgivable and give me the excuse ive been looking for to sack him it hadnt happened yet worse luck straha stood a little straighter the better to display his elaborate punctiliously applied body paint he had his own agenda atvar knew if he could persuade enough males that the fleetlord was botching his leadership of the war he might become fleetlord himself it would be irregular but everything about the conquestthe attempted conquestof tosev was irregular if straha succeeded where atvar had failed the emperor would turn his eye turrets away from the irregularity the fractious shiplord said first and most important is the increased punishment our armor is taking at the hands of the big uglies loss rates are up significantly from last years fighting to this such a toll cannot continue indefinitely there atvar try as he would could not disagree with straha he made his voice sharp though as he answered i cannot produce landcruisers out of thin air nor can the big uglies under our control manufacture any that meet our needs meanwhile those out of our control continue to improve their models and to introduce new weapons such as antilandcruiser rockets thus our losses are higher of late the tosevites out of our control always seem capable of more than those we have conquered straha said acidly with an effort the fleetlord ignored the sarcasm and replied to the literal sense of strahas words this is not surprising shiplord the most technologically advanced regions of this inhomogeneous planet are precisely the ones most capable of extended resistance and i suppose of innovation he spoke the last word with a certain amount of distaste in the empire innovation came seldom and its effects were tightly controlled on tosev it ran wild fueled by the endless squabbling among the big uglies tiny empires atvar thought such quick change surely malignant for the longterm health of a civilization but the tosevites cared nothing for the long term and in the short term quick change made them more dangerous not less let that be as you say exalted fleetlord straha answered atvar gave him a suspicious look hed yielded too easily sure enough he went on some of our losses however may be better explained by causes other than tosevite technical progress i speak in reference to the continued and growing use among our fighting males of the herb termed ginger i concede the problem shiplord atvar said he could hardly do otherwise what with some of the afteraction reports hed seen from the landcruiser combats in france had things gone as planned the race would have been pushing into deutschland instead theyd taken a pounding almost as costly as the one that had held them out of chicago and without the excuse of winter atvar continued surely though you cannot hold me responsible for the effects of an unanticipated alien herb we are making every effort to diminish its consequences on our operations if you have any concrete suggestions in that regard i would gratefully receive them hed hoped that would shut straha up it didnt nothing seemed to but it did make the shiplord change the subject exalted fleetlord what have we learned of the big uglies efforts to produce their own nuclear weapons where straha had been playing to his own faction before now he seized the attention of all the assembled males if the tosevites got their clawless hands on nuclear weapons the campaign stopped being a war of conquest and turned into a war of survival and what would the onrushing colonization fleet do if between them the big uglies and the race rendered tosev uninhabitable hating straha atvar answered though they did steal nuclear material from us we have found no sign that they can yet produce a weapon with it the fleetlord had expected that question to arise if not from straha then from someone else he touched a recessed button on the podium a holograph of one of the races power plants appeared seeing the familiar eggshaped protective dome over the reactor made him long bitterly for home forcing down the emotion he went on we have also detected no indications of any structures like this one which would be required for them to utilize their own radioactive materials most of the shiplords relaxed when they heard that even straha said so they wont be able to use nuclear weapons against us for the next few years eh well theres something anyhow if that wasnt praise it wasnt carping criticism either atvar gratefully accepted it loyal steadfast kirel raised a hand atvar was delighted to recognize him then kirel said excuse me exalted fleetlord but the big uglies are good at camouflage and besides some of their primitive structures look very little like those of ours which perform equivalent functions are we truly as certain as we would like to be that their nuclear weapons programs are not progressing under our very snouts to emerge as unexpectedly as some of their other weapons aside from the difficulty of proving a negative atvar had no answer prepared for that the meeting did not dissolve on the note for which hed hoped x teerts was coming to look forward to mealtimes for one thing the nipponese had been feeding him better lately with many more bits of meat and fish mixed in with the rice that made up the greater part of his diet for another theyd also taken to spicing his food instead of leaving it bland and boring his tongue tingled pleasantly when he ate now the spices werent the same as the ones cooks back on home would have used but they livened up meals in a similar way and for a third food these days gave him a lift that carried him altogether out of the depression that had gripped him since his killercraft went down near harbin for a while after he ate he felt bright and strong and ever so wise the feeling never lasted as long as he wished it would but having it even for a little while was welcome the nipponese seemed to notice his changed attitude too theyd developed the habit of interrogating him right after he ate he didnt mind food made him seem so omniscient that he dealt with their questions with effortless ease he heard a squeak and a rattle down the hall the food cart he sprang to his feet waited eagerly by the bars of his cell for the cart to arrive one guard unlocked the cell another stood watch with a knifetipped rifle the fellow who actually served the food handed teerts his bowl thank you superior sir he said in nipponese bowing as he did so the guard locked the cell door again the cart clattered away out of necessity teerts had become adept with the little paired sticks the nipponese used to manipulate food he brought a chunk of fish to his mouth twisted his tongue around it it didnt taste the way it had for a good many meals it wasnt bad though theyve changed the herbs theyre using he thought and gulped it down he got to the bottom of the bowl in a hurry although the nipponese were feeding him better than they had he wasnt any great threat to get fat as he ran his tongue over his hard outer mouthparts to clean them he waited for the wonderful feeling of wellbeing that had come to accompany each meal he didnt get it not this time hed been more than unusually gloomy when the feeling passed away after a meal now failing to find it at all he felt desperate betrayed the iron bars of his cell seemed to be closing in around him he paced restlessly back and forth his tailstump jerking like a metronome he hadnt realized how much hed depended on that mealtime burst of euphoria till it was denied him he opened his mouth displaying his full set of small sharp teeth if major okamoto came by hed gnaw a chunk off him that would give him a good feeling by the emperor not much later major okamoto did come down the hallway he stopped in front of teerts cell the captured killercraft pilots dreams of vengeance turned to fear at the sight of the big ugly as they always did good day okamoto said in the language of the race hed become quite fluent much more so than teerts was in nipponese how are you feeling today superior sir i am not so well as i would like teerts answered among the race that question was taken literally okamotos rubbery face twisted into what teerts had come to recognize as an expression of amusement that worried the male okamotos amusement often came at his expense but the big uglys words were mild enough i may know what is troubling you and may even have a medicine to cure your trouble honto really teerts asked suspiciously from all hed seen of what the big uglies called medicine hed sooner have taken his chances on being sick hai honto okamoto answered also falling back into nipponese from a pocket of his uniform he pulled out a small waxedpaper bag he poured a little of the brown powder it held into the palm of his hand then held the hand out to teerts through the bars here put your tongue on this teerts sniffed first the powder had a pungent spicy odor that seemed familiar though he could not place it at once he reflected that the tosevites could kill him any time they chose they did not need to put on an elaborate charade if they wanted him dead therefore he flicked out his tongue and licked up the powder as soon as he tasted it he knew what it was the flavor that had been missing from his latest bowl of food a moment later he realized the nipponese must have been feeding it to him in tiny doses till now he didnt just feel good he felt as if the sacred emperor were some sort of lowly cousin of his ruling the race would have been too small a job for him keeping track of all the planets in all the galaxies seemed about right through the omnipotence that blazed in him he saw okamotos face contort again you like that neh the big ugly asked all but the last word in teerts tongue yes teerts said as if from very far away he wished okamoto were very far away so he would not pester him at this transcendent moment but the interrogator and interpreter did not pester him the big ugly just leaned back against the bars of the empty cell across from teerts and waited for a while teerts ignored him as being beneath notice let alone contempt the glorious feeling from the powder hed licked up though didnt last as long as hed hoped it would and when it was gone when it was gone teerts crashed into depths deeper than the heights he had scaled the weight of all the worlds hed so blithely imagined he could oversee came down on his narrow shoulders and crushed him now he ignored okamoto because the big ugly was outside his sphere of intensely personal misery nothing the nipponese did to him could be worse than what his own body and brain were doing he huddled in a corner of the cell and wished he could die okamotos voice pursued him not so good want another taste the big ugly held out his broad fleshy hand a small mound of powder in the middle of the palm even before his conscious mind willed him to action teerts was on his feet and bounding toward the bars between which that hand so temptingly protruded but before his tongue could touch that precious powder okamoto jerked the hand back teerts almost slammed his muzzle against the cold unyielding iron that caged him careless of his own safety he cursed okamoto as vilely as he knew how the tosevite threw back his head and let out several of the loud barking noises his kind used for laughter so you want more ginger do you i thought you might we have learned males of the race arehow do you say it very fond of this herb ginger now teerts had a name for what be craved for some reason that only made him crave it more his fury collapsed into depression once again instead of hissing at okamoto he pleaded with him give it to me i beg how can you hold it away from me if you know how badly i need it okamoto laughed again one who lets himself be captured does not deserve to have anything given to him when it came to prisoners of war the nipponese knew only scorn okamoto went on maybe though just maybe you can earn more ginger for yourself do you understand teerts understood too miserably well the traps teeth were sharp sharp his captors had given him a taste for ginger in his food withheld it shown him exactly what he craved and now were withholding it again they expected that would make him submit they were he admitted to himself dead right hating the cringing whine he heard in his own voice he said what do you want me to do superior sir more exact answers to the questions we have been putting to you on explosive metals might make us more pleased with you okamoto said teerts knew that was a lie because hed let himself be taken prisoner the nipponese would never be happy with him no matter what he did but they might find him more useful hed already seen how his treatment varied with their perception of his value if he satisfied them they would give him ginger the thought tolled in his head like the reverberations from a big bass drum despite it he had to say i have already given you the best and truest answers i can so you claim now okamoto answered we shall see how youreply when you want ginger more than you can imagine now maybe then you will remember better than you do today the teeth of the trap were not only sharp they were jagged as well the nipponese didnt just want teerts to be their prisoner they wanted him to be their slave slavery had vanished from the culture of the race long before home was unified but the rabotevs or was it the hallessi teerts had always dozed through history lessons practiced it whenever their world whichever it was came into the empire they returned the concept if not the institution to the notice of the race teerts feared it wasnt just a concept on tosev he also feared that if he went without ginger he would go mad the craving ate at him like acid dripping on his scaly skin please let me taste it now he begged some of his nipponese captors had been wantonly cruel and exulted in their cruelty in the exact proportion that they enjoyed power over his helplessness they would have refused merely to experience the pleasure they took from watching him suffer okamoto to give him his limited due did not daub on that pattern of body paint having shown teerts he was indeed trapped the big ugly let him sample the bait once more the feeling of power and wisdom flooded through teerts again while he reached that ecstatic exalted peak he did his best to come up with a way to escape the prison where the nipponese held him for an all but omnipotent genius it should have been easy but no brilliant ideas came maybe the ginger did sharpen his analytical faculty a little he swiftly concluded the feeling of brilliance it gave him was just that a feeling and nothing more had the powder not been coursing through his veins he would have been bitterly disappointed as things were he noted the problem then dismissed it tosevites were impetuous hotblooded always doing things the races virtues were study patience careful planning so teerts had been indoctrinated and little he had seen inclined him to doubt what his killercraft squadrons briefing officers had said but now out in the hallway okamoto stood quietly and waited as patiently as any male of the race and teerts as the joy from the ginger ebbed in him leaving only a memory of sensation teerts became a veritable parody of a big ugly grabbing at the bars of his cell shouting curses reaching uselessly for okamoto in a foredoomed effort to get more ginger onto his tongue in short he acted blindly without the slightest concern for consequences he should have been ashamed of himself he was ashamed of himselfbut not enough to stop okamoto waited until his blustering had died away swallowed in the crushing depression that followed ginger euphoria then at just the right instant the nipponese said tell me everything you know about the process that transforms element to element the special word for this in our language is transmutes teerts said it takes place in several steps first he wondered how much okamoto would make him talk before he got another taste bobby fiore threw an easy peg to the young chinese man who stood waiting to catch the ball the fellow actually did catch it too it slapped into the leather glove a duplicate of fiores he wore and he covered it with his bare hand good job fiore said using tone and expression and dumb show to get across what he still had trouble saying in chinese now throw it back again gesture showed what he wanted the chinese whose name was lo threw high fiore sprang and caught the ball he landed lightly ready to throw again himself after so many years on so many infields he could probably do that in his sleep drop a ball anywhere near him and hed be on it like a cat dont throw like a girl he told lo this once it was just as well that his pupil didnt understand exactly what he had to say he demonstrated exaggerating the fromtheelbow style the chinese had used and shaking his head violently to show it wasnt the best way to do the job then he showed the fullarm motion american kids picked up on farmyards parks and vacant lots lo didnt seem to think one better than the other instead of using his handmade expensive baseball to prove the point bobby fiore bent down to get an eggsized rock he and lo were not far from the razorwire fence around the lizards camp he turned and threw the rock as far as he could into the green fields beyond the perimeter he found another rock tossed it underhand to lo lets see you top that throwing like you do he said again gestures eked out meaning lo nodded and let fly grunting with effort his rock flew barely half as far as fiores had he looked at the american nodded thoughtfully and tried the fullarm motion fiore clapped his hands thats the idea the truth was he couldnt antagonize a cash customer he and liu flan still put on their baseball show but it didnt pull in as much as it had when it was new a few chinese had been interested enough to pay to learn more so he was teaching them to hit and catch and throw had the camp had enough open space they could have put on a real game he didnt care to kowtow to chinamen but hed grown used to the little luxuries spare cash allowed him to buy and it wasnt as if he was selling something they had to have if he got em mad at him theyd just leave so he did his best to stay on good behavior come on try it with the ball he said and tossed it to lo the chinese threw it back still not too straight but with a better motion thats the way to do it fiore said clapping his hands in encouragement after several more throws that showed he was starting to get the idea lo picked up another rock and flung it out over the razor wire into the field throwing with his whole arm he made it go a good deal farther than hed managed before but still not as far as fiore had flung it the ballplayer puffed out his chest thinking no chink was going to get the better of him maybe lo thought the same thing for he bowed to fiore and spoke several sharp sentences almost in spite of himself fiore was starting to understand chinese he didnt follow all of this but got the idea that lo was praising his arm and wanted to bring by some friends who would also be interested in the way he threw yeah sure thatd be fine fiore answered in english and then did his best to turn it into chinese evidently lo got the idea because he bowed again and nodded then gave the glove back to fiore and went on his way well enough pleased with how the afternoon had gone fiore headed back toward the house he shared with liu han he started whistling begin the beguine to himself as he walked along but had to cut it out when the chinese he walked past stared at him as far as he was concerned chinese music sounded as if it were made by stepping on cats tailsoutoftune cats at that the locals returned the sentiment when he made melodies he liked since there were lots of them and one of him he shut up when he opened the door to the hut the lizards had given him and liu han his nostrils twitched appreciatively something tasty was cooking even if the vegetables that went with it would be strange and underdone for his taste smells good he said and added the lizards emphatic cough liu han looked up from the pan in which she was cooking it was to fiores way of thinking a funny kind of pan being shaped like the wide conical hats a lot of chinese wore it had a funny name too she called it a walk whenever he heard that he pictured the pan tossing away its bat and trotting down to first base liu han tilted the walk on its stand so he could see the bitesized pieces of chicken in it cooked with five spices she said he nodded smiling he didnt know what all five spices were but they made for mighty tasty cooking after supper he gave her the trade dollars lo had paid him for learning the art of throwing straight he has other people he may want me to teach too he said if they all pay as well as he did that should keep us in groceries a good long while he said it first in english then added chinese and lizard words till he was sure shed got the idea when she talked to him she used a chinese frame padded with english and lizard as time passed they gained more and more words in common she said if they pay silver like this lo i be fat even without baby she was starting to show now her belly pressing against the cotton tunic that had been loose babe you still look good to me he said which made her smile he got the idea she was surprised he kept wanting her even though she was pregnant he hadnt been sure he would either but the growing mound of her belly didnt bother him it meant he couldnt just climb on top all the time but doing it other ways was broadening his horizons thinking about it made him want to do it one nice thing about the way liu han cooked was that it didnt leave him feeling as if hed swallowed an anvil the way pasta did sometimes if you got too full you had trouble staying interested in other things as it was before he could get up and head for the blankets on the kang somebody knocked on the door he made a sour face liu han giggled she must have known what was on his mind whoever it is ill get rid of him in a hurry he said climbing to his feet but when he opened the door there stood lo with several other men behind him business fiore thought he waved them in business counted too and liu han would still be there after theyd gone now shed be hostess and interpreter she offered the newcomers tea fiore still missed his coffee thick with cream and sugar but tea hed decided would do in a pinch the last of the newcomers shut the door behind him lo and his friendssix men in allcrowded the hut they sat quietly and seemed polite but the longer fiore looked at them the more he wished he hadnt let them all in at once they were all young and on the hard side and with their silence more disciplined than the usually voluble chinese of the camp he carefully didnt glance over to the corner where hed leaned his bat against the wall but he didnt let them get between him and it he knew about shakedowns his uncle giuseppe a baker had paid protection money for a while for the privilege of going to work every day without getting his arms broken he wasnt going to let that happen to him not from a bunch of chinamen they could do their stuff on him tonight but hed have the lizards on them tomorrow then he realized the only one whose name he knew was lo and even lo was only half a name the restwould he recognize them again maybe maybe not he grabbed the bull by the horns asking what can i do for you guys youre interested in learning to throw the right way yeah he made a proper fullarm throwing motion without any ball we are interested in throwing yes lo answered through liu han then he asked a question of his own are you and your woman lackeys and running dogs of the little scaly devils or just their prisoners bobby fiore and liu han looked at each other though he had been thinking of siccing the lizards on these guys if they turned out to be hoodlums that question had only one possible answer prisoners he said and mimed holding his hands up to the bars of a cell lo smiled so did two or three of his buddies the others just sat still and watchful lo said if you are prisoners you must want to help the oppressed peasants and workers strike a blow for freedom liu hans translation wasnt anywhere near as smooth as that fiore cocked his head to one side anyway traveling through small and mediumsized towns in an america staggered by the depression hed heard plenty of guys standing on crates at street corners who talked like that he pointed a finger at lo youre a red thats what you area communist a bolshevik liu han didnt recognize any of the english or russian she stared and spread her hands at a loss to interpret but one of the terms made sense to lo he nodded soberly to bobby fiore as if to say he was smarter than the chinese had figured then he spoke to liu han letting her know what was going on she didnt gasp as if shed just seen a rat scurry across the floor the way a lot of american women would have she just nodded and tried to explain to fiore then fell silent when she realized he already understood they not bad she told him they fight japanese more than kuomintang does okay he said the reds were on our side before the lizards came sure and everybody wants to give them a good swift kick but what do these guys want with me lo didnt answer not with words instead he nudged one of his comrades the young man reached under his tunic and pulled out a grenade he didnt say anything either he just let it sit in the palm of his hand bobby didnt need more than a heartbeat before the light went on in his head he started to laugh so you want me to do your pitching for you huh he said not caring that neither lo nor liu han understood what he was talking about i wish sam yeager was here you think my arms hot stuff you oughta see his lo politely waited till he was done before speaking liu han hesitantly translated they want you she forgot the english for throw but made a gesture to show what she meant fiore nodded then she pointed at the grenade yeah i already worked that out fiore said hed worked out some other things too if he said no for instance he and liu han were liable to end up wearing whatever chinamen used for concrete overshoes this wasnt just a shakedown if he said no he was a big danger to these people from everything hed ever heard bolsheviks didnt let people who were dangerous to them keep walking and breathing and besides he didnt want to say no he wished he could have chucked some grenades at the lizards back in cairo illinois after they caught him the first time that would have kept him out of this whole mess even though he did care for liu han he would have given a lot to be back in the good old us of a since he couldnt have that giving the little scaly bastards a hard time here on the other side of the world would have to do so what do you want me to blow up he asked lo maybe the red hadnt expected such enthusiastic cooperation he talked in low tones with his friends before he turned back to liu han she sounded worried as she told fiore they want you to go with them no say where he wondered if he ought to insist that lo tell liu han where hed be after a seconds doubt he decided that would be stupid if she didnt know she couldnt tell anybody especially the lizards and if she didnt know the reds would have less reason to come after her to shut her up in case things went wrong he got to his feet lets go take care of it he said to lo he felt edgy almost bouncy as he walked as if mutt daniels and he wondered what had happened to old mutt had flashed him the sign to steal home on the next pitch well why not he wasnt just trying to steal home he was going into combat sooner or later he was sure he would have volunteered for the army but even then he would have trained for months before he got the chance to see action nowit was as if hed got his rifle and headed up to the front line one right after the other no wonder he felt all looseygoosey he blew liu han a kiss lo and his fellow bolsheviks snickered and said things that were probably rude to one another chinese men werent in the habit of showing they gave a damn about their women well to hell with them too he thought liu han managed a return smile but he could see she was frightened about this whole business night in the prison camp was darker than anything fiore had known back in the states even in the panicky blackouts that had followed pearl harbor few of the huts had any windows and few of what windows there were had lights showing through them if the moon was up in the sky a thick layer of clouds made sure nobody could see it though that made fiore stumble along he didnt bellyache not even to himself darkness would give the lizards a harder time spotting him that he liked the chinese picked their way through the black as if they had headlights a couple of times bobby fiore heard people getting out of their way in a hurry a large group of disciplined men traveling confidently was something few wanted to mess with he liked that too before long he had no idea where in the camp lo was taking him it all looks alike to me he thought and stifled a nervous giggle he didnt know if the bolsheviks were walking him around in circles to get him lost or if it just worked out that way but lost he undoubtedly was lo opened the door of a shabby little hut gestured for his companions and fiore to go in the inside of the hut was darker than the alley had been that didnt stop lo he shoved aside a heavy wooden chestby all appearances the only furniture in the placeand pulled up a square piece of board underneath it he and two of his friends dropped down into the tunnel the board concealed one of the remaining reds nudged fiore and pointed to the round mouth of the tunnel he went into it with all the eagerness of a man walking to the electric chair as he had when he left the hut he shared with liu han he learned new lessons about how dark darkness could be as far as his eyes were concerned hed just gone blind but with chinese ahead and chinese pushing him on from behind he could have no doubt about which direction to go the tunnel wasnt tall enough for him to stand upright or even to crouch he had to crawl along on hands and knees and even then the top of his head kept bumping on the roof and showering clods of dirt down onto his neck the air in the tunnel smelled like moist earth dank and musty and felt dead as if nobody had any business breathing down here he had no idea how long he crawled either in time or distance it seemed forever either way he imagined the tunnel was sloping up several times but each one proved to be just that imaginary without eyes to help it his sense of balance played tricks on him at last though he smelled fresh air he hurried forward and now found himself going unmistakably upward as well he scrambled out and lay gasping in relief in a hollow in a field after the tunnel that seemed a wonderful luxury it also seemed almost bright as day the other three chinese reds came out of the hole just as eagerly as he had that made him feel better lo cautiously raised his head he turned to bobby fiore pointed fiore raised his head too off in the distance sat a lizard guard station on the camp perimeter fiore mimed lobbing a grenade in that direction lo smiled his teeth startlingly white in the darkness then he reached out and thumped fiore on the shoulder as if to say youre okay mac he whispered something to one of the other young men who handed bobby fiore a grenade he felt for the pin found it lo held up fingers close to his faceone two three then he too mimed throwing yeah i know i gotta get rid of it fiore said laconically the fellow whod given him the grenade proved to have three more which he also passed on fiore took them but less enthusiastically each time he figured he could throw one maybe two and get away in the confusion but anything after that and hed be asking to get blown to pieces but the reds werent asking him to do anything they werent game for themselves some of them pulled out pistols from the waistbands of their trousers lo and one other fellow had submachine guns insteadnot tommy guns like gangsters but stubbier lighter weapons of a make fiore didnt recognize he wondered if they were russian any which way he was glad he hadnt tried using that baseball bat back in his hut lo started crawling through the fieldbeans were growing in it fiore discoveredtoward the lizard outpost the other raiders and fiore trailed after him the reek of night soil as poetic a way of saying shit as hed ever heard filled his nostrils the chinese used it for fertilizer the lizards obviously werent expecting trouble from the outside the humans easily got within fifty yards of their perimeter lo looked a question to bobby fiore was this close enough he nodded lo nodded back and thumped him on the shoulder again for a chinaman and a communist lo was all right the raiders slithered out into a rough skirmish line lo stayed close by fiore he gave his comrades maybe a minute and a half to find firing position then pointed to fiore and then to the guard station i get to open the show huh it was an honor fiore could have done without but nobodyd asked his opinion he yanked the pin out of one of the grenades hurled it as if hed just taken a relay in short right and was trying to nail a runner at the plate then he flung himself flat on the stinking ground bang the blast was oddly disappointing hed expected more but it did what it was supposed to do it got the lizards attention fiore heard hissing shouts saw motion in and around the guard post that was what the chinese had been waiting for their guns opened up with a roar quite satisfyingly loud lo went through a whole magazine in what seemed no more than a heartbeat his submachine gun spat a flame bright and searingly yellow as the sun he rammed in another clip and started shooting again did the hisses turn to screams did lizards fall pierced by bullets fiore didnt know for sure he jumped up and threw another grenade its boom added to the cacophony all around for somebody whod never seen action till that moment hed gauged it pretty well no sooner had he hit the dirt again than the lizards woke up searchlights came on if the muzzle flash from los submachine gun had been sunbright they were like looking at the naked face of god and the machine guns they opened up with reminded fiore of god too or at least of his wrath bobby even wished he were back in the tunnel off to his left one of the chinese raiders started screaming and wouldnt stop off to his right fire from the second submachine gun cut off in the middle of a burst and didnt start up again just over his head bullets clipped off the tops of growing bean plants like a harvester from hell lo kept right on shooting which made him either brave or out of his everloving mind two searchlights swung toward him which meant that for a moment none was pointing at bobby fiore he threw his third grenade got down and started rolling away from where he had been the location didnt seem healthy any more los weapon fell silent fiore didnt know whether he was dead or also moving he kept rolling himself until he fetched up against a long obstruction a dead chinese pistol still in hand fiore took it and scuttled away from the lizard guns hed done all the fighting he intended to do today he put all the distance he could between himself and that terrible fire bullets lashed the plants all around him kicking up dirt that spattered his hands his feet his neck somehow none of the bullets hit him if lizard infantry came out after him he knew he was dead but the aliens relied on firepower instead and however awesome it was it wasnt perfectnot quite the last chinaman stopped shooting and started shrieking alternating hail marys with underhisbreath mutters of where the fucks that tunnel fiore slithered back toward where he thought it was after a while he realized he must have gone too far at the same instant he also realized he couldnt possibly go back not if he wanted to keep on breathing if i cant get back into camp that means i better get my ass outta here he mumbled he crawled and scuttled as fast as he could no searchlights picked hip up as he dodged between rows of beans then he tumbled into a muddy ditch or tiny creekbed in the poorly tended field that providentially ran diagonally away from the lizard guard post he hoped the chinese reds had done some damage there but was whatever theyd done worth six lives he didnt know he was damned sure it wasnt worth seven though after an eternity that might have lasted fifteen minutes the beans on either side of the ditch gave way to bushes and sapling about then a helicopter came rattling over the field and raked it with fire dust and pulverized bean plants flew into the sky the noise was like the end of the world bobby fiores teeth chattered in terror the same sort of flying gunships had strafed his train and the fields around it back in illinois after a while the gunship flew away it hadnt lashed the place where fiore lay trembling that still didnt mean he was safe the farther out of there he got the better off hed be he made himself move even though he shook he didnt feel as if he were in a tight baseball game any more combat against the lizards was more like the fly taking on the swatter he was altogether alone and on his own he counted up his assets he had one grenade a pistol with an uncertain number of cartridges and a tiny smattering of chinese it didnt seem like enough mild bloody climate george bagnall muttered stamping snow from his boots and brushing it from his shoulders sod jerome bloody jones not so bad in here ken embry answered shut the door youre letting in the bloody spring right bagnall slammed the door with a satisfying crash he promptly started to sweat and divested himself of fur cap and leatherandfur flying suit as far as he could tell the soviet union in general and pskov in particular had only two temperatures too cold and too hot the woodburning stove in the corner of the house he and embry had been assigned was more than capable of keeping it warm too much more than capable but none of the windows opened the notion seemed alien to the russian mind and if you let the fire go out you were facing chilblains again within the hour want some tea embry asked pointing to a dented samovar that added its quotient of warmth to the close tropical air real tea by god bagnall demanded eagerly not likely the pilot answered with a sneer same sort of leaves and roots and muck the bolshies are drinking these days no milk either and no cups same as always the russians drank teaand their ersatz toofrom glasses and used sugar but no milk considering that at the moment there was no milk in pskov save from nursing mothers and a few officers closely guarded cows and goats the englishmen had had to get used to it that way too bagnall consoled himself by thinking he was less likely to catch tuberculosis without milk in his tea the reds didnt fret over attestation he poured himself a glass of the murky brown brew stirred in sugar plenty of beets around pskov and tasted ive had worse he admitted whered you come by it bought it from a babushka embry answered god knows where she got itprobably grew the herbs herself then fixed them up to sell not what youd call perfect communism but then not much here seems to be no hardly bagnall agreed i wonder if it has to do with the germans having been here most of a year before the lizards arrived i have my doubts embry said from all ive seen my guess is that the russians did what they had to do for the collective farm and the factory and then turned around and did all they could for themselves mmyoure likely right even after some weeks in pskov bagnall did not know what to make of the russians he admired their courage and resilience about everything else he had doubts had englishmen so tamely submitted to those above them no one would ever have questioned the divine right of kings only their resilience had let the russians survive the string of incompetents and tyrants who ruled them and what is the news of the day embry asked i was just thinking i find russians difficult to fathom bagnall said but in one regard they are perfectly comprehensible they still hate the germans and i assure you the sentiment is most generously returned ken embry rolled his eyes oh god what now here wait let me get some more of this it isnt tea but it isnt too bad either bagnall poured his glass full sipped and went on one of the things we shall have to do on the unlikely assumption the ground ever unthaws is build miles upon miles of antitank ditches let me merely state that where to site these ditches the personnel to excavate them and the troops to defend them once dug are matters which remain in dispute do you care to give me the particulars embry asked with an expression that said he wasnt particularly eager to hear them but felt he should bagnall understood that expression he suspected his own matched it he said general chill is willing to have his wehrmacht lads do some of the digging but feels the rest should fall on the shoulders of what he terms the otherwise useless population typical german tact there what i am certain his soviet colleagues received that in the spirit in which it was intended embry said no doubt bagnall said dryly they were also particularly pleased with his proposal that russian soldiers and partisans be those particularly concerned with stopping the lizards tanks once they traverse said ditches i can see that they would be how generous of the distinguished german officer to offer his soviet allies the opportunity to commit suicide under such distinguished circumstances if you stick that tongue any farther into your cheek youre liable to bite it off bagnall said as long as hed known embry he and the pilot had dueled to see which of them could wield the twin scalpels of irony and understatement more effectively he feared embry had just taken the lead on points the pilot asked and why has general chill been so extraordinarily gracious his justification is that the nazis with their heavier weapons would be better used as a reserve to meet any possible lizard breakthroughs oh embry said in a slightly different tone just what i thought bagnall answered the rationale made just enough military sense to force one to wonder whether chills plan shouldnt be carried out as proposed the flight engineer added germans are bloody good at coming up with plausible reasons for things that are to their advantage to their shortterm advantage embry amended setting the russians up to be massacred will not endear chill to them bagnall snorted somehow i doubt that will cause him to lose any great quantity of sleep he wants to keep his own forces intact first he also wants to hold pskov embry said he wont do that without the russians helpnor will they without his a lovely muddle wouldnt you say if you want my opinion it would be even lovelier if viewed from a distancesay from a london pubthan when were caught in the middle of it something to that embry sighed real springtime leaves flowers birds a pint pot of best bitter perhaps even scotch the pain of longing pierced bagnall like a stiletto he feared hed never see england or its loveliness again as for scotch well the spirit the russians brewed from potatoes would warm a man or send him to sleep if he drank enough of it but it didnt taste like anything hed also heard that drinking neutral spirits kept you from feeling the effects the next morning he shook his head hed shot that theory right behind the ear more often than he cared to remember embry said speaking of getting stuck in the middle is there more talk of turning us into infantrymen again bagnall didnt blame him for sounding anxious their one foray against the lizard outpost south of pskov had been plenty to put the flight engineer off the life of a foot soldier forever the choice unfortunately did not rest with him he said they didnt say anything about that when i was in the krom but then they might not have wanted to either for fear wed bugger off you mean embry said bagnall nodded the pilot went on nothing id like better onlywhere would we go it was a good question the short answer unfortunately for both of them was nowhere not with the woods full of partisan bands german patrols and just plain bandits next to some of them the prospect of facing the lizards seemed less disastrous the lizards wouldnt do anything worse than killing you bagnall said you dont really believe those stories about the cannibals in the forest do you lets just say its something id sooner not find out by experiment too right there before bagnall could go on someone knocked at the door the plaintive voice that came through the thick boards was londonaccented can you let me in im fair frozen radarman jones bagnall threw the door wide jerome jones came in bagnall quickly shut the door after him and waved him over to the samovar drink some of that its fairly good wheres the beautiful tatiana ken embry asked jones as he poured himself a glass of herb tea embry sounded jealous bagnall didnt blame him somehow jones had managed to connect with a russian sniper who was even more decorative than she was deadly shes off trying to kill things i suppose the radarman answered he sipped the tea made a face maybe not bad but it could be better being all alone then you deigned to honor us with a visit eh bagnall said oh bloody hell jones muttered then hastily added sir his position in pskov was to put it mildly irregular while bagnall and embry were both officers and he very much from the other ranks he had the specialization in which the russiansand the naziswere interested ken embry said its all right jones we know they treat you like a field marshal everywhere else in town decent of you to remember your military manners around low cannonfodder types like ourselves the radarman winced even bagnall used to such sarcastic sallies had trouble being sure how much was intended as wit and how much fired with intent to wound a spell as an infantryman in an attack that got crushed was enough to jaundice anyones outlook giving the pilot the benefit of the doubt bagnall said dont let him faze you jones our mission was to get you here and that weve done what came afterwards the lanc getting bombedwell nichevo theres a useful word eh sir jones said anxious to change the subject cant be helped nothing to be done about itthat the russians pack it all into one word says a lot about them i think yes and not all of it good either embry said evidently willing to drop his bitterness these people have spent their entire history being stepped on tsars commissars what have youitd be a miracle indeed if that didnt show in the language shall we put mr jones knowledge of russian to more practical use bagnall said without waiting for a reply from embry he asked the radarman what do you hear going up and down in the city the name is jones sir as you noted not job jones replied with a grin which rapidly slipped people are hungry people are battered they dont love the germans or the bolsheviks if they thought the lizards would feed them and leave them alone otherwise a lot would just as soon see them as top dogs if id stayed safe at home in england id have trouble imagining that bagnall said of course flying bomber missions first against the germans and then against the lizards had been anything but safe but jones and embry both nodded understanding what he meant he went on after the jews rose for the lizards and against the nazis i thought they were the blackest traitors in the history of the worlduntil their story started coming out if a tenth part of what they say is true germany has more blood on her hands than a thousand years of hitlers reich can wash away and they and we are allies embry said heavily and they and we are allies yes bagnall agreed and so are they and the russians and so are we and the russians and stalin by all thats said matches hitler for butchery any day of the week even if hes not so showy about it its a rum old world embry said not far away somebody fired a rifle in the street somebody else fired another one with a report that sounded different one weapon was german the other soviet another handful of shots followed then silence bagnall waited tensely wondering if the shooting would start up again that would be all anyone neededwar inside pskov between alleged allies to accompany war outside against foes but silence held for a couple of minutes then the shooting started again worse than everone of those new german machine guns the ones with the terrifyingly high cyclic rate that made them sound even more dreadful than they really were added to the chaos several russian submachine guns gave answer through the raucous racket of gunfire came hoarse screams bagnall couldnt tell if they were russian or german oh bloody hell jerome jones said embry took hold of one end of a chest of drawers and started pushing it toward the front door saying best we put up something of a barricade wouldnt you say bagnall didnt say anything but did put his back into helping the pilot manhandle the heavy wooden chest into place then he picked up a chair and grunting set it on top of the low chest together he and embry leaned a table against the window by the doorway jones you have your pistol with you bagnall asked then answered himself yes i see you do good he went into the bedroom and returned with his mauser ken embrys and as much ammunition as they had left from the raid on the lizard base i hope we shant have to use these but quite embry said he glanced over at jones no offense old man but id sooner tatiana were here than you shed be likelier to keep us safe no offense taken sir the radarman answered id sooner tatiana were here too given any choice at all id sooner be back in dover or better yet london since bagnall had had almost the same thought not long before he could only nod embry went into the bedroom he came back with their pair of coalscuttle helmets i dont know whether we ought to put these on theyll keep out splinters or glancing bullets but theyll also make the russians take us for jerries which might prove less than ideal under the circumstances a random bullet smashed through the wooden front wall just missed jones and bagnall and buried itself in plaster next to the samovar ill wear a helmet bagnall said the russians may ask questions about who we are and whose side were on but their ammunition doesnt he heard the pop of a mortar and a moment later the much louder bang as its bomb went off he found cover behind another chair and aimed his rifle at the doorway the lizards may not need to take pskov he said seems to me more as if the russians and germans want to give it to them a tracked lizard troop carrier rattled down the wet dirt road splattering mud in all directions some of it splashed mordechai anielewicz as he trudged along on the soft shoulder the lizards in the tracked carrier took no special notice of him to them he was just another guntoting big ugly on the move his lips skinned back from his teeth in a humorless smile the motion set his whole face itching moishe russie when he fled the lizards had been able to get rid of his beard in one fell swoop growing one took longer and as far as anielewicz was concerned was a lot less comfortable also uncomfortable was the gewehr slung across his back he valued the rifle all the same hed promised himself zolraag and his minions would not take him alive and it was the means by which he could keep that promise hed also had the sense to take german marching boots a size too large when the time came to disappear from warsaw his feet had swollen in them yes but he could still take them off and put them on without trouble hed sent russie west to lodz now that it was his turn to escape the lizards he was walking south and east into the part of poland the russians had occupied in before the germans ran them out less than two years later his chuckle sounded anything but mirthful sooner or later the people who used to work with the lizards are going to be scattered all over the countryside he said and waved his arms to show what he meant the motion startled a magpie which flew away chattering angrily he sympathized with the bird till hed moved suddenly it had taken him as harmless hed thought the same about the lizards or at least that they were a better bargain than the nazis for the jews of poland he still thought them a better bargain than the nazis had they not come poland would have been judenfreiwithout jewsby now but he was coming to see that the world was a wider place than poland the lizards might not be out to exterminate mankind as the nazis aimed to exterminate polish jewry but they intended to do to humanity as the germans had done to the poles themselves turn them into hewers of wood and drawers of water forever anielewicz couldnt stomach that a pole came up the road heading toward warsaw with a wheelbarrow full of turnips the wheel of the wheelbarrow got stuck in a patch the lizards troop carrier had chewed to slime anielewicz helped the pole free it from the clinging ooze it was quite a fight the wheelbarrow seemed to think it ought to be a submarine finally though the two men wrestled it up onto firmer ground god and the black virgin of czestochowa that was tough the pole said shedding his tweed cap so he could wipe his forehead with a frayed sleeve thank you friend any time anielewicz answered back before the war hed been much more fluent in polish than yiddish hed thought himself secular then not so much denying his judaism as ignoring it until the nazis showed him it couldnt be ignored those are good fat turnips youve got there take a couple for yourself you hadnt been here i might have lost the whole load the fellow said his grin showed a couple of missing front teeth besides youve got a rifle how am i supposed to stop you i dont steal anielewicz answered not now i dont anyway im not starving at the moment when the nazis ran the warsaw ghetto though the poles grin got wider armija krajowa fighter are you it was a reasonable guess anielewiczs looks were more polish than jewish too without waiting for an answer the man went on better i should give you the turnips than sell em to the damned yids in warsaw anyhow eh he had no way of knowing how close he came to dying in the middle of the muddy road without ever learning why mordechai anielewicz took a tight grip on his temper it wasnt as if he hadnt known plenty of poles were antisemitesand a murder here was liable to make it easier for pursuers to trace him so he just said theyre still hungry in there i expect youll get a good price hungry why should the jews be hungry theyve got their mouths pressed to the lizards backsides and they eat their the pole spat into the roadway in lieu of finishing but left no doubt about what hed meant again anielewicz forced himself to coolness if the pole thought he was a countryman rather than a jew on the dodge his presence here would attract no notice so he told himself but oh the temptation here wait the turnip seller undid a polish army canteen from his belt yanked out the cork which had replaced the proper stopper have a belt of this to help you on your way this was vodka obviously homemade and strong enough to scar the lining of anielewiczs throat as it went down after a small nip he handed the canteen back to the pole thank you he said wheezing a little any time pal the pole tilted his head back for a couple of long swallows ahh jesus thats good us catholics got to hang together aint nobody gonna do it for us am i right not the damned jews not the godless russians not the stinking germans and sure as hell not the lizards am i right anielewicz made himself nod the worst thing was that the pole was right at least from his parochial perspective no one would give his people any special help so theyd have to help themselves but if every people helped itself at the expense of its neighbors how would any peopleor all the peoples togetherwithstand the lizards with a wave anielewicz headed down the road leaving the pole to trundle his turnips on toward warsaw the jewish fighting leader jewish refugee he corrected himselfsomeone new would head the fighters now wondered what the peddler would have done knowing he was a jew probably nothing much since he had a gun and the pole didnt but he didnt think he would have got the turnips let alone the belt of vodka a lizard jet flew by high overhead its vapor trail caught anielewiczs eye before he heard the thin attenuated bellow of its engines it probably carried a load of destruction he hoped someone would shoot it down after it had dropped the load of destruction on a nazis head the road ran through fields of barley potatoes and beets peasants and their animals plowed those fields as they had every spring for the past thousand years no tractors snorted or chuffed alongside the horses and mulesgasoline was next to impossible to come by that had been true under the germans and was even truer under the lizards overall though the aliens rule lay lightly on the land alter that armored troop carrier splattered past him anielewicz didnt see another lizard vehicle for the rest of the day the lizards garrisoned warsaw and other towns like lublin to which anielewicz intended to give a wide berth for just that reason but used the threat of their power rather than the power itself to hold down the countryside i wonder how many lizards there are altogether not just in poland but all over the world he mused aloud few enough so that they were stretched thin trying to hold it down and run it that seemed clear he wondered how humanity could best exploit such a weakness that musing quickly turned to one more practical he wondered what he was going to do about supper and a place to sleep sure he had hard bread and cheese in his pack to go with the turnips but none of that was inspiring fare similarly he could roll himself in a blanket on the ground but he didnt want to unless he had to the problem soon solved itself a farmer coming in from the fields waved to him and called are you hungry friend always happy to feed an armija krajowa man besides i killed a pig yesterday and ive got more meat than my family can eat join us if you care to anielewicz hadnt touched pork since the ghetto walls came down but to decline such a feast would only have made the farmer suspicious thank you very much he said youre sure its no trouble not a bit come in wash up sit and rest your feet the farmhouse stood between two thatchroofed outbuildings the farmer shooed some chickens away from the woodpile and into a henhouse in one of those outbuildings then slammed the door on them at the fellows urging anielewicz clumped up the wooden stairs and into the foyer a big brass basin there served for a sink he washed his hands and face dried them on a linen towel hung on a nail above the basin the farmer courteously waited for him to use the water first then cleaned himself off after that introductions were in order the farmer gave his own name as wladyslaw sawatski his wife was emilia a pleasantlooking woman who wore a kerchief over her hair his teenage son jozef and his daughters maria and ewa one older than jozef one younger anielewicz said he was janusz borwicz giving himself a good polish name to go with his polish looks everyone made much of him he got the seat at the head of the table in the parlor he got a mug of apple brandy big enough to make three people shikker and he got the familys undivided attention he gave them all the warsaw gossip he had especially the part pertaining to the polish majority did you fight the germans when the lizards came jozef sawatski asked he and his fatherand both his sisters tooleaned forward at that they wanted war stories mordechai realized well he could give them some yes as a matter of fact i did he said truthfully again he edited the tales to disguise his jewishness wladyslaw sawatski who had a brandy mug the size of anielewiczs slammed it down on the table with a roar of approval well done by god he exclaimed if wed fought like that in we wouldnt have needed thesecreaturesto get the nazis off our backs anielewicz doubted that sandwiched between germany and russia poland was going to get walloped every so often before he could come up with a polite way to disagree with his host emilia sawatski turned to her daughters and said why dont you go and bring in the food now alone in the family she hadnt cared about tales of conflict in came supper mountains of it boiled potatoes boiled kielbasa sausage big pork steaks headcheese freshbaked bread warsaw might be hungry but the countryside seemed to be doing pretty well for itself as maria the older girl plopped a length of sausage onto anielewiczs plate she gave him a sidelong glance then spoke in silky tones to her father youre not going to send a hero like janusz out onto the road after supper are you papa hell sleep here tonight wont he she wants to go to bed with me anielewicz realized with some alarm that alarm had nothing to do with marias person she was eighteen or nineteen and quite pretty in a widefaced blueeyed way anielewicz didnt particularly worry about angering her father either but if he took off his trousers for her he wouldnt be able to hide being a jew wladyslaw sawatski looked from maria to mordechai and back again the glance was full of understanding whatever else he might be sawatski was no fool he said i was going to let him rest in the barn maria but as you say he is a hero and too good for straw he can sleep on the sofa in the front room there he pointed to show anielewicz where that was mordechai was not surprised to discover it lay right outside the doorway to a bedroom that would surely be wladyslaws youd have to be crazy to try to screw there he said thank you sir that will be excellent sawatski might figure he was lying but he meant every word of it maria had to nodafter all her father had given her just what shed said she wanted anielewicz hadnt expected to find rabbinic wisdom in a polish farmer but there it was the meat on his plate smelled delicious then ewa sawatski asked dont you want any butter on your potatoes he stared at her mixing meat and dairy products in the same meal then he remembered the meat was pork if he was eating pork how could another violation of dietary law matter thank you he said and took some butter wladyslaw filled his mug when it got empty the farmer gave himself a refill too his cheeks were red as if hed rouged them but that was all the brandy did to him mordechais head was starting to swim but he didnt think he could decline the drink poles poured it down till they couldnt see didnt they the women went into the kitchen to clean up wladyslaw sent jozef off to bed saying we have plenty of work tomorrow but he still lingered at the table politely ready to talk as long as anielewicz felt like it that wasnt long when mordechai yawned and couldnt stop sawatski got him a pillow and a blanket and settled him on the sofa it was hard and lumpy but hed slept on worse in the ghetto and during the fighting afterwards no sooner had he taken off his boots and stretched himself out at full length than he was asleep if maria sneaked out bent on seduction in the night he didnt wake up for her breakfast the next morning was an enormous bowl of oatmeal flavored with butter and coarse salt emilia sawatski waved away mordechais thanks and wouldnt even take the turnips he tried to give her we have enough here and you may need them in your travel she said god keep you as you go wladyslaw walked out to the road with anielewicz he too said god keep you then added quietly friend janusz you do a good job of pretending to be a pole rather than a jew but not always good enough youre awkward when you cross yourself for instancein a single swift motion the farmer showed how it should be doneand you dont always do it at quite the right time at another mans house you might put yourself in danger mordechai stared at him finally he managed you knew yet you took me in anyway you looked like a man who needed taking in sawatski slapped anielewicz on the back now go on i hope you stay safe to wherever youre headed he asked no questions about that anielewicz noticed so much still dazed no man and especially no young man cares to be shown he is not as clever as he thought he was he started down the road away from warsaw hed had so much bitter experience with antisemitic poles that hed come to think the whole nation hated its jews being reminded that wasnt so made him feel good all the rest of the day xi ussmak hated the barracks at besancon because theyd been made for big uglies they were by his standards dark and dank and cold but even if theyd been a section of home miraculously transplanted to tosev he would not have been happy in them not now to him they stank of failure landcruisers after all were supposed to go forward pounding the enemy into submission and paving the way for new advances instead after the debacle against the deutsche his crew and the others who survived were pulled back here so officers could investigate what had gone wrong hessef and tvenkel had only two concerns to keep the investigators from learning they had a ginger habit and to do as much tasting as they could those concerns were in ussmaks mind too but not as intensely hed done a better job of coming to terms with ginger than his commander or gunner but if the investigating officers didnt figure out ginger had played a big part in the landcruisers lackluster performance what was their report good for wastepaper ussmak thought a new male with a sack full of gear came into the barracks his toeclaws clicked on the hard tile floor ussmak idly turned one eye turret toward the fellow but gave him both eyes when hed read his body paint by the emperor youre a driver too the newcomer cast down his eyes so did ussmak the new male said good to see someone who shares my specialization he tossed his stuff onto a vacant cot what are you called friend ussmak and you drefsab the new driver swiveled both eye turrets what a dismal ugly hole this is too right ussmak said even for the big uglies who used to live here it was nothing to boast about for properly civilized males he let that hang where did they transfer you from ive been serving in the far east of this continent against the chinese and nipponese drefsab answered you must have come out of your eggshell lucky ussmak said enviously thats easy duty from all ive heard the chinese dont have much in the way of landcruisers at all drefsab agreed the nipponese have some but they arent very tough hit them and theyre guaranteed to brew uponeshot firestarters we call them the new male let his mouth fall open at the joke ussmak laughed too but said dont get overconfident here or youll pay for it i was in the sssr just after the invasion and the soviets while their landcruisers werent too bad didnt have the faintest idea how to use them then i got hurt and then i came here i didnt believe what the males told me about the deutsche but ive been in action against them now and its true i listen drefsab said tell me more their new landcruisers have guns heavy enough to hurt us with a side or rear deck shot and front armor thick enough to turn a glancing shot from one of our guns you can forget about the oneshot firestarter business here and they use their machines well reverse slopes ambushes any trick you can think of and too many youve never imagined in your worst nightmares drefsab looked thoughtful as bad as that ive heard of some of the things youre talking about but i figured half of that maybe more was males shooting off steam to haze the new fellow listen my friend we were rolling north from here not long ago when we got our eye turrets handed to us ussmak told drefsab about the push that had started for belfort and ended up back here at the besancon barracks we were heldby big uglies the new driver sounded as if he couldnt believe it ussmak didnt blame him when the race tried to go somewhere on tosev it generally got there in lower tones drefsab went on what happened were all the landcruisers tonguedeep in the ginger jar although drefsab had spoken quietly ussmak scanned the barracks before he answered no one was paying any particular attention good almost whispering ussmak said as a matter of fact that might have had something to do with it have you been assigned to a landcruiser crew yet no drefsab said ill give you a few names to try to stay away from then thank you superior sir by their paint drefsab and ussmak were of virtually identical rank but drefsab honored him not only for the favor but also because of his longer service at this post now the new male glanced around the barracks he too whispered not that i have anything against a taste now and again you understandbut not in combat by the emperor after hed raised his eyes from the ritual gesture of respect for the sovereign ussmak said cautiously no thats not so bad it was what he tried to do himself but if drefsab had asked him for a taste he would have denied keeping any ginger he had no reason to trust the other male instead though drefsab produced a tiny glass vial from one of the pockets of his equipment bag want some of the herb he murmured were not in combat now ussmaks suspicions flickered and blew out when drefsab poured a little ginger into his hand ussmak bent his head down and flicked it off the scales with his tongue the new driver tasted too they sat companionably together enjoying the surge of pleasure the powdered herb gave them very fine ussmak said it makes me want to go out and kill all the deutsche i can findor maybe hessef instead he had to explain that hessef is my landcruiser commander if ginger truly made you as smart as it makes you think you are hessef would be the greatest genius the race ever produced barracks battle its all the same to him a good enough time for a taste and tvenkel the gunner tastes enough to make him shoot before he takes proper aim ive seen him do it that doesnt strike me as smart not if the deutsche are as good as you make them out to be drefsab said they are ussmak answered when we got to this miserable iceball of a planet we had equipment and training simulations the deutsche had experience in real combat and their equipment keeps getting better while ours doesnt let them choose the terms of the fight and they can be a handful drefsab made the vial disappear you dont taste before youre going into action i try not to ussmak moved his eye turrets in a way that said he was ashamed of his own weakness when the hunger for ginger comes on a malebut you know about that yes i know about that drefsab agreed soberly the way i look on it is this a male can yield himself up to the herb and let it be all he lives for or he can taste the herb as it suits him and go on with the rest of his life as best he can thats the road i try to follow and if it has some bumps and rocky places in itwell what road on tosev doesnt ussmak stared at him in admiration here was a philosophy for a ginger tasterno after hearing such words he needed to be honest with himself a ginger addictwho nonetheless tried to remember he was a male of the race obedient to orders attentive to duty he said to drefsab superior sir i envy you your wisdom drefsab made a gesture of dismissal wisdom for all i know i may well be fooling myself and now you whatever it is the price i paid to win it is much too high better by far the herb had never set its claws in me i dont know ussmak said after ive tasted i feel as if ginger were the only worthwhile thing this miserable world produces after ive tasted so do i drefsab said but before or when i need a taste badly and theres none to be had times like those ussmak im certain ginger is worst for the race not best times like those ussmak had the same feeling hed heard stories that some males if they got desperate enough for ginger traded pieces of the races military hardware for the herb hed never done anything like that himself but he understood the temptation before he found a safe way to tell that to drefsab some things you didnt say directly even to a male whod given you a taste of ginger not until you were positive you could trust him with your life as well as with the herb he heard a brief shrill whistle in the air followed by a loud crummp the glass from a couple of windows in the barracks blew inward in a shower of tinkling shards ussmak sprang to his feet as he did so a loudspeaker blared mortars incoming from forest patch grid red pursuit in force ussmak didnt wait to hear any more not with a good taste of ginger running through him come on he shouted to drefsab out to the landcruiser park another mortar bomb hit in the yard in front of the barracks his words punctuated by the blast drefsab said but ive been assigned to no crew so what some commander and gunner wont want to wait for their own driver ussmak was as sure of that as of his own name ginger ran rampant through the base at besancon some commander or other would be feeling more intrepid than patient the two males ran side by side down the stairs to the yard ussmak almost stumbled the risers were built for big uglies not the smaller race then he almost stumbled again this time because a blast from a mortar bomb nearly hurled him off his feet fragments whistled by he knew only luck kept them from carving him into jagged bloody bits off to one side of the barracks guns opened up flinging blast and sharpedged bits of hot brass back at the tosevites who were hurling them at the races bastion in besancon with luck artillery would take care of the raiders before landcruisers had to go in after them when no more mortar bombs fell for a little while ussmak hoped that had happened but then the bombs started coming in again the big uglies didnt have antiartillery radar but theyd learned they had to shift their guns to keep the race from pounding them to bits that was the trouble with the big uglies they learned too fast hessef and tvenkel came dashing up from wherever the investigation team had been questioning them come on they shouted together ussmak scrambled into his landcruiser the instant he got to it unless a mortar bomb landed on top of the turret or in the engine compartment it was the safest place he could be the familiar vibration of the big hydrogenburning engine starting up made him feel this was the purpose for which hed been hatched he noted with sober pride that his was the third landcruiser to move out of its revetment sometimes the energetic aggression ginger brought wasnt such a bad thing after all with the intercom button taped to one hearing diaphragm he listened to hessef telling tvenkel quick another taste i want to be all razor wire when we go after those deutsche or francais or whoevers trifling with us here you go superior sir the gunner answered and wouldnt the eggaddled snoops who were just grilling us pitch a fit if they knew what we were doing now who cares about them hessef said theyre probably hiding under their desks or else wishing they were back in those addled eggs silence followedlikely the silence of the two males laughing together ussmak laughed too a little what the other crewmales said was true but that didnt mean he was happy about their going into action with heads full of ginger even if he was doing the same thing himself its not my fault he thought virtuously i didnt know the big uglies would sneak a mortar into range square red was northeast of the fortress and east of the river that wound through besancon following the two landcruiser crews that had managed to get moving ahead of him ussmak roared down the hill on which the fortress sat and toward the nearest bridge big uglies stared at the landcruisers as they went by ussmak was sure they wished one of those mortar bombs had blown him to bits sometimes when he rumbled through town he drove unbuttoned and noticed the fancy wroughtiron grillwork that decorated so many of the local buildings not today today action was liable to be immediate so he had only his vision slits and periscopes to peer through the streets even the big ones were none too wide for landcruisers he had to drive carefully to keep from mashing a pedestrian or two and making the francais love the race even less than they did already he felt the explosion ahead as much as he heard it for a moment he thought it was an earthquake then gouts of flame shot from the lead landcruiser which lay on its side he slammed on the brakes as hard as he could the murdered landcruisers ammunition load began cooking off adding fireworks to the funeral pyre ussmak shivered in horror if id been just a clawtip faster out of the revetment id have driven over that bomb in the street he thought the big uglies must have figured out just how the race would respond to a mortar attack and set their ambush accordingly reverse hessef yelled into ussmak s hearing diaphragm get out of here the order was sensible and ussmak obeyed it but the commander of the landcruiser behind him didnt have reflexes as fast as hessefs maybe they werent gingerenhanced with a loud crunch the rear of ussmaks machine slammed into the front of that one a moment later the landcruiser in front of ussmak backed into him had the terrorists who planted the explosive under the road stayed around they might have had a field day attacking stuck landcruisers with firebombs perhaps they hadnt realized how well their plan would work the multiple accident of which ussmak found himself a part was far from the only one in the line of landcruisers the machines fortunately were tough and suffered little damage the same could not be said about the big uglies whod been standing anywhere near where the bomb went off ussmak watched other tosevites carry away broken bleeding bodies they were only aliens and aliens who hated him at that but ussmak wanted to turn his eye turrets away from them anyhow they reminded him how easily he could have been broken and bleeding and dead with patience which the race did have in full measure the snarls unkinked and the landcruisers chose the next best route out of besancon this time a special antiexplosives unit preceded the lead machine near the bridge over the river doubs everybody halted the unit found another bomb buried under a new patch of pavement even though air conditioning kept the interior of the landcruisers fighting compartment comfortably warm ussmak shivered the big uglies had known what the males of the race would do and done their best to hurt them not just once but twiceand their best had been pretty good eventually the landcruisers did reach square red by then of course the raiders and their mortar were long gone back at the barracks that evening ussmak said to drefsab they made idiots of us today not altogether drefsab said ussmak waggled one eye turret slightly in a gesture of curiosity the other male amplified we did a good job of making idiots of ourselves with that ussmak could not disagree it was however an opinion to be shared only among those of inconsequential rankor so he thought but he was wrong three days later inspectors of a sort altogether different from the first lot descended on besancon most of the males whom ussmak knew to be ginger tasters and especially ginger tasters whod let their habits get the better of them disappeared from the base hessef and tvenkel among them drefsab wasnt seen at besancon any more after that either ussmak wondered at the connection before long wonder hardened into near certainty he knew more than a little relief that the inspectors hadnt swept him up along with his crewmales if i ever see drefsab again ill have to thank him he thought jesus christ jager youre still alive the big deep voice boomed through the german encampment heinrich jager looked up from the pot of extremely ersatz coffee he was brewing over a tiny cookfire he jumped to his feet skorzeny he shook his head in bemusement and you wonder that im alive after the madcap stunts youve pulled off he hurried over to shake the ss mans hand otto skorzeny said pooh yes my stunts if thats what you want to call them are maybe more dangerous than what you do for a living but i spend weeks between them planning youre in action all the time and going up against lizard panzers isnt a childs game either he glanced at jagers collar tabs and a colonel too youve stayed up with me his rank badges these days also had three pips jager said thats your fault that madman raid on the lizards in the ukraine he shuddered he hadnt had a tank wrapped around him like an armored skin then ah but you brought home the bacon or half the rashers anyhow skorzeny said for that you deserve everything you got then you should be a colonelgeneral by now jager retorted skorzeny grinned the jagged scar that ran from the corner of his mouth toward his left ear pulled up with the motion of his cheek jager went on here do you have a cup drink some coffee with me its vile but its hot skorzeny pulled the tin cup from his mess kit as he held it out tie clicked his heels with mocking formality danke sehr herr oberst thank me after you ye tasted it jager said the advice proved good skorzenys scar made the face he pulled seem only more hideous jager chuckled under his breathwherever hed seen skorzeny in moscow in the ukraine and now here the man hadnt cared a fig for military discipline and now herejagers gaze sharpened what does bring you here standartenfuhrer skorzeny he used the formal ss title with less irony than he would have aimed at any other soldier of hitlers elite i am going to get into besancon skorzeny announced as if entering the lizardheld city were as easy as a stroll around the block are you jager said noncommittally then he brightened did you have anything to do with that bomb last week i hear it took out one of their panzers maybe two petty sabotage has its place but i do not engage in it skorzeny grinned again this time like a predator my sabotage is on the grand scale i aim to buy something of value which one of our little scaly friends is interested in selling i have the payment here he reached over his shoulder patted his knapsack jager jabbed they trust you to carry gold without disappearing o ye of little faith skorzeny sipped the notquitecoffee again that is without a doubt the worst muck i have ever drunk in my life no the lizards care nothing for gold i have a kilo and a half of ginger in there jager ginger jager scratched his head i dont understand think of it as morphine if you like then or perhaps cocaine skorzeny said once the lizards get a taste for it theyll do anything to get more and anything includes in this case one of the rangefinders that make their panzers so deadly accurate better than what we have in the panther jager set an affectionate hand on the road wheel of the brushcovered machine parked by the fire its a big step up from what they put into my old panzer iii get ready for a bigger step old son skorzeny said i dont know all the details but i do know its a whole new principle can we use it if you get it jager asked some of the things the lizards use seem good only for driving our own scientists mad he thought of his own brief and unhappy stay with the physicists who were trying to turn the explosive metal he and skorzeny had stolen into a bomb if skorzeny had that same thought he didnt show it i dont worry about such things thats not my job no more than setting foreign policy for the reich my job is getting the toys so other people can play with them that is a sensible way for a soldier to look at the world after a couple of seconds jager wished he hadnt said that hed believed it wholeheartedly until he found out how the ss went about massacring jews someone had given them that job and they went ahead and did it without worrying about anything else he changed the subject all right youre going into besancon to get this fancy new rangefinder how do you expect me to help were still close to eighty kilometers north of it and if i roll out my panzers for an attack theyll all be scrap metal before i get a quarter of the way there or have you arranged for your lizard who likes ginger so well to sell you all their rangefinders instead of just one that would be nice wouldnt it skorzeny slugged back the rest of his coffee made a horrible face this dreck is even worse after it cools down damn jager you disappoint me i expected you to run me right down the grande rue in besancon and on to the citadel cannon blazing good luck jager blurted before he realized the other man was joking hows this then skorzeny said chuckling still suppose you lay on an attacka few panzers artillery infantry whatever you can afford to expend and seem convincingly aggressive without hurting your defense too muchon the eastern half of the front i want you to draw as much attention as you can away from the western section where i a simple peasant shall pedal my bicycleyou do have a bicycle around here for me to pedal dont you into lizardheld territory and on down to besancon i have a way to get word to you when i shall require a similar diversion to aid my return jager thought about the men and equipment he would lose in a pair of diversionary assaults the rangefinder is as good as all that he asked so ive been told skorzeny gave him a fishy stare would you prefer formal written orders colonel i assure you that can be arranged id hoped to rely more on our previous acquaintance no i dont need formal orders jager said sighing i shall do as you say of course i only hope this rangefinder is worth the blood it will cost i hope the same thing but we wont find out unless i get the gadget will we no jager sighed again when do you want us to put in the diversionary attack herr standartenfuhrer do what you need to do herr oberst skorzeny answered i dont want you to go out there and get slaughtered because you hadnt shifted enough artillery and armor will three days give you enough time to prepare i suppose so the front is narrow and units wont have far to travel jager also knew but could not mention that the more men and machines he fed into the assault the more would be expended war assumed expending soldiers the trick was to keep from expending them on things that werent worth the price he moved men panzers and artillery mostly by night to keep the lizards from noticing what he was up to he didnt completely fool them their artillery picked up on the eastern sector of the front and an air strike incinerated a couple of trucks towing mm antitank guns caught out in the open but most of the shift went through without a hitch at on the morning of the appointed day with dawn staining the eastern sky artillery began flinging shells at the lizards positions near the chateau de belvoir riflecarrying men in field gray loped forward jager standing up in the cupola as a good panzer commander should braced himself as his panther rumbled ahead the lizards advance positions being lightly held were soon overrun though not before one of the aliens turned a panzer iv to jagers right to a funeral pyre with a rocket he didnt see any enemy panzers for which he thanked god intelligence said theyd pulled back toward besancon after the rough time hed given them in their latest attack but even without armor the lizards were a handful jager hadnt pushed forward more than a couple of kilometers before a helicopter rose into the sky and peppered his force with rockets and machinegun fire another panzer this one a tiger brewed up he wincednot only a powerful new machine but also a veteran crew gone forever a lot of foot soldiers were down too he got in sight of the main lizard position outside the chateau de belvoir lobbed a couple of highexplosive shells at the chateau itself not without an inward pang at destroying old monuments hed thought of archaeology as a career until world war i sucked him into the army for good and having taken enough casualties to provide the diversion skorzeny wanted withdrew to lick his wounds and wait to be called on to sacrifice again i hope the lizards dont follow us home klaus meinecke said as the panther made its way back to the start line if they do theyre liable to catch us with our pants down around our ankles too true jager said the gunner had found an uncomfortably vivid way to put words to his own fears maybe the lizards suspected the germans of trying to lure them into a trap whatever their reasons they didnt pursue jager gratefully seized the time they gave him to rebuild his defensive position after that he went back to watchful waiting all the while wondering how skorzeny was going to get word to him that he needed more strong young men thrown into the fire a week after the diversionary attack a frenchman in a tweed jacket a dirty white shirt and baggy black wool trousers came up to him sketched a salute and said in bad german our friend with thehis finger traced a scar on his left cheekhe needs the help you promise tomorrow morning he say is the good time you understand oui monsieur merci jager answered the frenchmans thin intelligent face did not yield to a smile but one eyebrow rose he accepted a chunk of black bread offering in exchange a swig of red wine from the flask on his belt then without another word he vanished back into the woods jager got on the field telephone to the nearest luftwaffe base can you give me air support he asked when their damned helicopter gunships show up i lose panzers i cant spare when i go after those gunships i lose aircraft i cant spare the luftwaffe man retorted and aircraft are just as vital to the defense of the reich as panzers guten tag the phone line went dead jager concluded he was not going to get his air support he didnt the attack went on nonetheless it even had a moment of triumph when meinecke incinerated a lizard infantry fighting vehicle with a wellplaced round from the panthers long mm gun but on the whole the germans suffered worse than they had in the first diversionary assault that had put the lizards wind up and they were ready and waiting this time maybe that meant theyd pulled some troops from the western section of their line jager hoped so it would mean he was doing what he was supposed to when hed soaked up enough casualties and damage to make the lizards believe with luck hed really tried to accomplish something he retreated once more no sooner had he returned to the jumpingoff point than a runner came panting up and said sir theres a lizard panzer advancing on our front line about five kilometers west of here a lizard panzer jager said the messenger nodded jager frowned that wasnt a bad as it might have been but even one lizard panzer made a formidable foe poor skorzeny he thought they must have caught on to his scheme this time then anger surged through him at having to mount diversionary attacks in support of a plan that hadnt been likely to succeed anyhow sir thats not all the messenger said what else then jager asked the panzer has a white flag flying from above the drivers station sir the fellow answered with the air of a man reporting something he doesnt expect to be believed i saw it with my own eyes this i must see with my own eyes jager said he hopped into a little volkswagen light army car waved the messenger in beside him as a guide and headed west he hoped he had enough petrol to get where he was going the light army cars engine put out less than twentyfive horsepower and didnt use much petrol but the wehrmacht had little to spare either as jager drove a suspicion began to form in the back of his mind he shook his head no he told himself impossible not even skorzeny could but skorzeny had when jager and the messenger pulled up in front of the lizard panzer the drivers hatch came open and the ss man squeezed out wriggling and twisting like a circus elephant inching through a narrow doorway jager gave him a formal military salute that didnt seem good enough so he also took off his cap which made skorzeny grin his frightening grin i give up jager said how the devil did you manage this just stainding in front of the lizard panzer was frightening to a man whod faced its like in battle its smooth lines and beautifully sloped armor made every german panzer save possibly the panther seem not merely archaic but ugly to boot staring down the barrel of its big main armament was like looking into a tunnel of death before answering skorzeny writhed and twisted jager heard his back and shoulders crunch better he said by god i felt like a tinned sardine cooped up in there except they dont have to bend sardines to get em into the tin how did i get it i tell you jager i didnt think i was going to get anything in besancon the lizards just cleaned out every gingerfresser they could catch i gather they didnt catch them all jager said pointing to the panzer nobody ever does skorzeny grinned again i made contact with one theyd missed when i showed him all the ginger i had he said you just want a rangefinder id give you a whole panzer for that so i took him up on it but how did you get it out of the city jager asked plaintively there were only two dicey bits skorzeny said with an airy wave first was getting me into the vehicle park we did that in dead of night second was seeing if id fit into the drivers compartment i do but just barely after that i up and drove it away it steers on the same principles as our machines but its a lot easier to drive the steering is power assisted and the gearbox shifts automatically didnt any of them challenge you jager said why should they if you were a lizard youd never think a human could take off in one of your panzers now would you god in heaven no jager answered honestly youd have to be out of your mind even to dream such a thing just what i thought skorzeny agreed and just what the lizards thought too evidently since they werent looking for me to try any such thing i was able to bring it off right under their snouts you couldnt pay me enough to try it twice though next time theyll be watching and he made a chopping motion with his right hand jager still couldnt believe the axe hadnt fallen during this first mad escapade he nervously glanced up at the sky if a lizard plane spotted them now gunships and fighterbombers would be on the way here in bare minutes to destroy their own panzer as if picking the thought from his head skorzeny said id better move along i need to get this beast under cover as quick as i can then arrange to ship it back to germany so the lads with the high foreheads and the thick glasses can figure out what makes it tick can you wait long enough for me to look inside without waiting for an answer jager scrambled up onto the upper deck of the fighting compartment and stuck his head through the drivers hatch he envied the lizards the compactness their smaller body size allowed skorzeny must have been bent almost double in there the drivers controls and instruments were a curious mix of the familiar and the strange the wheel the foot pedals though there was no clutch and the shift lever might have come from a german panzer but the drivers instrument panel with screens and dials full of unfamiliar curlicues that had to be lizard letters and numbers looked complicated enough to have belonged in the cockpit of a fockewulf in spite of that the space wasnt cluttered very much on the contrary refined was the word that crossed jagers mind as he contemplated the layout in any german panzerany human panzernot everything was exactly where it would most efficiently belong sometimes you couldnt see a dial without moving your head or reach for your submachine gun without banging your wrist against a projecting piece of metal none of that hereall such tiny flaws had been designed out of the area he wondered how long the lizards had been making little progressive changes to get everything both perfect and perfectly finished a long time he suspected he climbed up onto the top of the turret undogged the commanders cupola ignoring skorzenys impatient growl he slithered down into the turret this was where he belonged in a panzer where he could most easily judge what was similar and what was different about the way the lizards did things again he noticed refinement no sharp edges no outthrust chunks of metal anywhere you could if you were lizardsized move around without fear of banging your head then he noticed the turret had no loaders seat just as thered been no hull gunners position in the lizard panzers forward compartment did the gunner or commander have to load shells then he couldnt believe it that would badly slow the panzers rate of fire and he knew from bitter experience the lizards could shoot quicker than their german counterparts some of the gadgetry that filled the turret without crowding it had to be an automatic loader then he wondered how it worked no time to wonder not now except to hope german engineers could copy it the gunners station like the drivers instrument panel was a lot more complex than he was used to he wondered how the lizard who sat there could figure out what he needed to do in time to do it pilots managed so maybe the gunner could too noagain from experience certainly the gunner could too skorzenys voice peremptory now came down through the open cupola get your arse out of there jager im going to drive this beast away right now regretfullyhe hadnt seen all he wantedjager slithered out and dropped down to the ground the ss man climbed up onto the deck of the lizard panzer and got back into the forward compartment he was thicker through the waist than jager and had a devil of a time squeezing in but he managed back when the wehrmacht first ran into the russian t thered been talk of building an exact copy in the end the germans didnt do that although the panther incorporated a lot of the ts best features if the reich copied this lizard panzer jager thought theyd have to train tenyearolds to crew it nobody else really fit skorzeny started up the motor it was amazingly quiet and didnt belch clouds of stinking fumesrefinement again jager wondered what it used for fuel skorzeny put it in gear and drove off jager stared after him shaking his head the man was an arrogant bastard but he accomplished things nobody in his right mind would dream of trying let alone pulling off atvar glowered at the male who stood stiffly in front of his desk you did not clean out that clutch of gingerlickers as thoroughly as you should have he said the exalted fleetlord is correct drefsab replied tonelessly he may of course punish me as he sees fit some of atvars anger evaporated drefsab had himself been trapped in ginger addiction that he worked at all against his corrupted colleagues gave the fleetlord a weapon he would otherwise have had to do without nevertheless he snapped a landcruiser disappearing i never would have thought it possible which is probably just how it happened exalted fleetlord drefsab said no one else thought it was possible either and so no one took the precautions that would have kept it from happening that big ugly with the scar again atvar said they all look alike but that males disfigurement makes him stand out he has given us nothing but griefthe landcruiser now and spiriting mussolini away from right under our muzzles and i have some reason to believe he was involved in the raid where the big uglies hijacked our scattered nuclear material skorzeny drefsab turned the sibilants at the beginning and middle of the name into long hisses that is what deutsch propaganda called him after the mussolini fiasco yes atvar said in spite of your unfortunate taste for ginger drefsab youremain i believe the most effective operative i have available to me the exalted fleetlord is gracious enough to overestimate my capacities drefsab murmured i had better not be overestimating them atvar said my orders for you are simple i want you to rid tosev of this skorzeny by whatever means become necessary losing him will hurt the deutsche more than losing a hundred landcruisers and the deutsche along with the british and the americans are the most troublesome and ingeniously obstreperous big uglies there are which considering the nature of the big uglies is saying a great deal he must be eliminated and you are the male to do it drefsab saluted exalted fleetlord it shall be done after several months living and travel in places mostly without electricity sam yeager had all but forgotten how wonderful having the stuff could be the reasons werent always the obvious ones either keeping food fresh was great sure so was having light at night even if you did need blackout curtains so the lizards wouldnt spot it but he hadnt realized how much he missed the movies till he got to see one again part of the feeling sprang from the company he kept having barbara on the plush seat beside him her hand warm in his would have put a warm glow on anything this side of going to the dentist not a major concern for yeager anyhow not with his storebought teeth later his hand would probably drop to her thigh in the dim cavern of the movie theater nobody was likely to notice or to care if he did notice but part of what sam got from the movies had nothing to do with barbara for a couple of hours he could forget how miserable the world outside this haven on sixteenth street looked and pretend what happened on the screen was what mattered funny he whispered to barbara as they waited for the projectionist to start the newsreel i can get out of myself with a good story in a magazine or a book but watching a show is more special somehow reading lets me get away from things too she answered but a lot of people cant escape that way i feel sorry for them but i know its true the other thing is when youre reading youre by yourself here youre with lots of other people looking for the same release youre after it makes a difference i found what i was after sam said and squeezed her hand she turned to smile at him before she could say anything the lights dimmed and the big screen at the front of the theater came to sparkling life the newsreel wasnt the smoothly professional production it would have been before the lizards came yeager didnt know whether the aliens held hollywood itself but the distribution system for new films coming out of california had completely broken down what the moviegoers got instead was a us army production probably put together right here in denver some of the bits had sound added some used cards with words on them something sam remembered from silent film days but had thought to be gone for good eastern france one of those cards announced the camera panned slowly lovingly across burnedout lizard tanks a toughlooking fellow in german uniform walked among the wreckage people cheered wildly barbara murmured has everyone forgotten the nazis were our worst enemies a year ago yes yeager whispered back he had no love for the nazis but if they were hurting the lizards more power to em he hadnt loved the russian reds last year either but hed been damn glad they were in the fight against hitler another card flashed moscow there stood stalin shaking hands with a factory worker in a cloth cap behind them a row of almostcompleted airplanes stretched as far as the eyeor the cameracould see yet another card said the soviet union stays in the fight more cheers echoed through the movie theater the next segment had sound a fellow with a flat midwestern accent said outside of bloomington the lizards banged their snouts into tough american resistance as they tried to push north toward chicago again another picture of a wrecked lizard tank was followed by shots of tiredlooking but happy gis around a campfire yeager almost bounced out of his chair theres mutt by god he told barbara my old manager i mean jesus i wonder how he lived through all the fighting hes got sergeants stripes toodid you see i wouldnt have recognized him sam he wasnt my manager she answered which made him feel foolish she added im glad hes all right boy so am i he said ive played for some real hard cases in my day but he was one of the other kind the good ones he people to either side and behind made shushing noises yeager subsided abashed the newsreel cut to a card that said somewhere in the usa ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states the announcer said in the blackandwhite film franklin d roosevelt sat behind a desk in what looked like a hotel room the drapes were drawn behind him perhaps merely to give him a backdrop perhaps to keep the lizards from figuring out where he was by what the camera showed out the window roosevelt was in his shirtsleeves his collar unbuttoned and his tie loose he looked tired and worn but kept the cigarette holder at a jaunty angle in his mouth he still had cigarettes yeager noted without resentment fdr was working hard enough to be entitled to them the president took the holder from his mouth stubbed out the cigarette instead of letting it smolder to add a picturesque plume of smoke to the scene he leaned toward the microphone in front of him my friends he said and yeager felt roosevelt was speaking straight to him the fight goes on applause rippled through the theater then quickly faded so people could listen to what the president had to say even his first halfdozen words gave sam fresh hope fdr had always had that gift he hadnt always made things better but hed always made people feel they would get better which was half the battle by itselfit made people go to work to improve their own lot instead of moaning about how dreadful everything was roosevelt said the enemy is on our soil and in the air above our homes these creatures from another world believe they can frighten us into surrender by raining destruction down on our heads as our gallant british allies did with the germans in we shall prove them wrong every day we have more new weapons to hurl against the lizards every day they have less with which to resist those of you who still live free everything you do to help the war effort helps ensure that your children and your childrens children will grow up in freedom too and to those of you in occupied territory who may see this i say do not collaborate with the enemy in any way do not work in his factories do not grow crops for him do nothing you can possibly avoid without human beings to be his slaves sooner or later he will be helpless for we have hurt him in america in europe and in asia as well he is not superhuman he is merely inhuman our united nationsnow all the nations on this planetwill surely triumph in the end thank you and god bless you the next news segment showed ways to conserve scrap metal it had a soundtrack but yeager didnt pay much attention to it he didnt think anyone else did either just hearing fdrs voice was a tonic roosevelt made you think everything would turn out okay one way or another the newsreel ended with a burst of patriotic music sam sighed now hed have the stars and stripes forever noisily going around in his head for the next several days it happened every time he heard the song here comes the real movie somebody near him said as the opening credits for youre in the army now filled the screen yeager had seen it four or five times since it came out in new movies just werent getting out these days and even if they did they often couldnt have been shown because electricity was lost in so many places when hed seen the antics of phil silvers and jimmy durante and the horrified reactions of their superior officers before theyd left him limp with laughter now that he was in the army himself they didnt seem so funny any more soldiers like that would have endangered their buddies he wanted to give both comics a swift kick in the rear beside him though barbara laughed at the capers they cut sam tried to enjoy the escape with her the musical numbers helped they reminded him this was hollywood not anything real getting angry at the actors for doing what was in the script didnt do him any good once hed figured that out he was able to lean back and enjoy the movie again the house lights came up barbara let out a long sigh as if she didnt feel like coming back to the real world given its complications yeager didnt much blame her but the world was there and you had to deal with it whether you wanted to or not come on he said lets pick up our bikes and head back to the university barbara sighed again then yawned i suppose so when we get back there i think i want to lie down for a while im so tired all the time these days she managed a wan smile ive heard this is what being expecting is supposed to do to you and boy it sure does well take it nice and easy on the way back said yeager who was still inclined to treat barbara as if she were made of cut glass ad liable to break if jostled yourest and ill go round up ullhass and ristin okay sam outside the theater a herd of bicycles covered the sidewalk and the street by the curb keeping an eye on them in lieu of a sheepdog was a large burly fellow with a on his hip with no gas available for private cars bikes had become the way of choice to get around and stealing them as big a problem as horse theft in denvers younger days as many people packed a gun now as they had in the old days too an unarmed guard wouldnt have done much good most of denver was laid out on a northsouth eastwest grid the downtown area though nestled into the angle of the platte river and cherry creek turned that grid at a fortyfivedegree angle yeager and barbara pedaled southeast down sixteenth street to broadway one of the main northsouth thoroughfares the pioneer monument at the corner of broadway and colfax caught sams eye around the fountain were three reclining bronzes a prospector a hunter and a pioneer mother at the top of the monument stood a mounted scout on him yeager turned a critical gaze ive seen statues that looked realer he remarked pointing he does look more like an oversized mantelpiece ornament than a pioneer doesnt he barbara said they both laughed they turned left onto colfax bicycles people on foot horse and muledrawn wagons and quite a few folks riding horses made traffic if anything dicier than it had been when cars and trucks dominated then everything had moved more or less at the same speed now the ponderous wagons were almost like ambulatory roadblocks but you went around them at your peril too because a lot of them were big enough to hide what was alongside till too late the gilded dome of the threestory granite state capitol on colfax dominated the city skyline on the west lawn of the capitol building stood a union soldier in bronze flanked by two civil war brass cannon yeager pointed to the statue he said going up against the lizards sometimes i felt the way he would if he had to fight todays germans or japs with his muzzleloader and those guns theres an unpleasant thought barbara said they pedaled along on the east lawn of the capitol stood an indian also in bronze she nodded to that statue i suppose he felt the same way when he had to fight the white mans guns with nothing better than a bow and arrow yeah he probably did at that said sam whod never thought to look at it from the indians perspective he got guns of his own though and he hit us some pretty good licks tooat least i wouldnt have wanted to be in general custers boots youre right but instead of cheering up barbara looked glum even though the indians hit us some good licks they lostlook at the united states now or the way it was before the lizards came anyway does that mean well lose to the lizards even if we do hurt them in the fight i dont know sam chewed on that for the next block or so not necessarily he said at last the indians never did figure out how to make their own guns and gunpowder they always had to get em from white men he looked around to make sure nobody was paying undue attention to their conversation before he went on but were well on our way to making bombs to match the ones the lizards have thats true barbara did cheer up but only for a moment she said i wonder if therell be anything left of the world by the time were done fighting the lizards the sciencefiction pulps had printed plenty of stones about worlds ruined one way or another but sam hadnt really thought about living or more likely dying in one slowly he said if the choice is wrecking the earth or living under the lizards id vote for wrecking it from what ullhass and ristin say the race has kept two other sets of aliens under their thumbs for thousands of years i wouldnt wish that on anybody no neither would i barbara said but we sure do remind me of a couple of little kids quarreling over a toy if i cant have it you cant eitherand smash if we end up smashing a whole world but what else can we do i dont know yeager answered he did his best to think about something else the end of the world wasnt something he wanted to talk about with the woman he loved they turned right off colfax onto university boulevard traffic there was thinner and moved faster than it had in the center of town yeager looked around enjoying the scenery hed been up at altitude now in wyoming and colorado that he could pedal along as readily as he had at sea level just past exposition avenue he saw a couple of cyclists speeding north up university a skinny blond fellow in civvies followed closely by a burly man in uniform with a springfleld on his back the skinny guy saw sam and barbara too he scowled as he whizzed by oh dear barbara said that was jens she shook her head back and forth hard enough to make her bike wobble he hates me now i think her voice had tears in it hes a fool if he does sam said you had to choose somebody honey i wouldnt have hated you if youd gone back to him i just thank god every day that you decided to pick me that she had still surprised and delighted him im going to have your baby sam she said that changes everything if it werent for the babyoh i dont know what id do but with things the way they are i didnt see that i had any other choice they rode along in silence for a while if i hadnt knocked her up shed have gone back to larssen sam thought it made sense to him shed known jens a lot longer and he was on paper more her type she was a brain and while yeager didnt think of himself as stupid he knew damn well hed never make an intellectual not quite out of the blue barbara said both of you always treated me welltill now if id chosen jens i dont think youd act the way he is i just said that he answered the thing of it is ive had enough things go wrong in my life that ive sort of learned to roll with the punches that one would have been a joe louis right but i wouldve gotten back on my feet and gone on the best i could he paused again speaking ill of larssen was liable to make barbara spring to his defense picking his words carefully he went on im not sure jens ever had anything really tough happen to him before i think youre right barbara said thats very perceptive of you even all his grandparents are still alive or they were before the lizards camenow who can say but he sailed through college sailed through his graduate work and had a job waiting for him at berkeley when he finished then he got recruited for the metallurgical laboratory which was every physicists dream yeager finished for her yeah not a lot of people had jobs waiting for them when they finished school not in the depression they didnt so larssens family had all been healthy too and hed found this wonderful girl maybe hed started getting the idea he was fireproof nobodys fireproof yeager muttered with the conviction of a man whod had to hustle for work every spring training since he turned eighteen what did you say honey barbara asked the casual endearment warmed him he said i was just thinking things go wrong for everybody sooner or later count no man lucky before the end barbara said it sounded like a quotation but yeager didnt know where it was from she continued i dont think jens has ever had to deal with anything like this before and i dont think hes dealing with it very well again sam heard unshed tears i wish he were i know hon i do too it would make everything a lot easier but sam didnt expect things would always be easy he was as hed said ready to ride them out when they got tough and if jens larssen wasnt that was his lookout yeager carried his bicycle upstairs to the apartment he and barbara had taken across the street from the university of denver campus then he went down and carried hers up too im going to go take my little hissing chums off smittys hands he said have to see what hell want from me later on for babysitting them so i could get free for my saturday matinee with you barbara glanced at the electric clock on the mantel it showed a quarter to four so did sams watch he was having to get reused to the idea of clocks that kept good time she said itll still be afternoon for a little while longer wont it as he took her in his arms yeager wondered if she just needed reassurance after the brief wordless but unpleasant encounter with jens larssen if she did he was ready to give it if you couldnt do that you didnt have much business being a husband as far as he was concerned liu han felt like a trapped animal with the little scaly devils staring at her from all sides no superior sirs i dont know where bobby fiore went that night she said in a mixture of the little devils language and chinese these men wanted him to teach them to throw and he went with them to do that he didnt come back one of the scaly devils showed her a photograph it was not a plain blackandwhite image shed seen those before and even the color pictures the foreign devils printed in some of their fancy magazines but this photograph was of the sort the little scaly devils made not only more real than any human could match but also with the depth the scaly devils put into their moving pictures it made her feel as if she could reach in and touch the man it showed have you seen this male before the scaly devil holding the picture demanded in vile but understandable chinese imay have superior sir liu han said gulping just because she felt she could reach into the picture didnt mean she wanted to the man it showed was obviously dead lying in a bean field with his blood and brains splashing the plants and ground around his head he had a neat hole just above his left eye what do you mean you may have another scaly devil shouted either you have or you have not we think you have now answer me please superior sir liu han said desperately people dead look different from people alive i cannot be certain i am sorry superior sir she was sorry lofor the dead man in the picture was undoubtedly hehad ever wanted bobby fiore to show him how to throw she was even sorrier he and his henchmen had come to the hut and taken bobby fiore away but she was not going to tell the little scaly devils anything she didnt have to she knew they were dangerous yes and they had her in their power but she also had a very healthy respectfear was not too strong a wordfor the communists if she spilled her guts to the little devils she knew she would pay maybe not right now but before too long the scaly devil holding the picture let his mouth hang open he was laughing at her to you maybe to us all big uglies look alike alive or dead he translated the joke into his own language for the benefit of his comrades they laughed too but the little devil who had shouted at liu han said this is no joke these bandits injured males of the race only through the mercy of the watchful emperorhe cast down his eyes as did the other little devilswas no one killed no one killed liu han thought what of lo and his friends she was reminded of signs the european devils were said to have put up in their parks in shanghai no dogs or chinese allowed to the little scaly devils all human beings might as well have been dogs we should give her the drug that makes her tell the truth the scaly devil with the picture said then we will find out what she really knows liu han shivered she was ready to believe the scaly devils had such a drug they were devils after all with powers effectively unlimited if they gave it to her they would find out she hadnt told them everything and then then they would do something horrible to her she didnt care to think about that but then ttomalss spoke up thewhat had bobby fiore named his calling the psychologist that was it said no ssamraff for two reasons no first because the drug is not as effective as we believed it would be when we first made it and no second because this female big ugly has a hatchling growing inside her most of that was in chinese so liu han could follow it ssamraff replied in the same language who cares what she has growing inside her this growth is disgusting yes but it is part of a research study ttomalss insisted having the big ugly male who sired it disappear is bad enough but drugs could do to big ugly hatchlings what they sometimes do to our own as they grow in the egg before the female lays it we do not want this hatchling to emerge defective if we can avoid it therefore i say no to this drug and i say we need to learn who is trying to foully murder males of the race ssamraff retorted this to me is more important but he spoke weakly his body paint was less ornate than ttomalss which liu han had gathered meant he was of lower rank the little devils had made her give her body to strange men in their experiments they had watched her pregnancy with the same interest she would have given to a farrowing sow and no more now though because she was pregnant they wouldnt give her the drug that might have made her betray lo and the other reds about time i got some good out of being only an animal to them she thought ssamraff said if we cannot drug the female how can we properly question her then he swung his turreted eyes toward liu han she still had trouble reading the scaly devils expressions but if that wasnt a venomous stare shed never seen one i am sure she is telling less than she knows no superior sir liu han protested and then stopped in some confusion not only ssamraff but all the devils were staring at her she realized hed spoken in his tongueas had she when she answered you know more of our words than i thought ttomalss said in chinese liu han gratefully returned to the same language i am very sorry superior sir but i did not realize i was not supposed to learn i did not say that the psychologist answered but because you know we have to be more careful with what we say around you because she knows we should be trying to find out what she knows ssamraff insisted this male she was mating with had something to do with the attack on our guard station i think she is lying when she says she knows nothing of these other males we killed they are dead and the one she mates with is missing is this not a connection that hisses to be explored we are exploring it ttomalss answered but as i said we shall not use drugs ssamraff turned one eye turret toward liu han to see how she would react as he spoke in his own language what about pain then the big uglies are very good at using pain when they have questions to ask maybe this once we should imitate them a lump of ice formed in liu hans belly the communists and the kuomintangto say nothing of local bandit chiefs routinely used torture she had no reason to doubt the little scaly devils would be devilishly good at it but ttomalss said no not while the hatchling grows inside her i told you you may not disturb the conditions under which this experiment is being conducted this time even the little devil whod shouted at liu han supported ttomalss using pain to force our will even on a big ugly is liu han didnt understand the last word he used but ssamraff sputtered in indignation almost laughably obvious so it must have been one he didnt care for when he could speak instead of sputtering he said i shall protest this interference with an important military investigation go ahead ttomalss said and i shall protest your interference with an important scientific investigation you have no sense of the long term ssamraff we are going to rule the big uglies for the next hundred thousand years we need to learn how they work dont you see you are making that harder if we dont root out the ones who keep shooting at us we may never rule them at all ssamraff said to liu hans way of thinking he had a point but the other little scaly devils recoiled as if hed just said something much worse than suggesting that they torture her to find out what she knew of lo and the communists ttomalss said will you add that to your report i hope you do it will show you up as the shortsighted male you are i shall certainly make a note of your statement when i file my own protest you were rash to be so foolish in front of a witness his eye turrets swung toward the little devil whod yelled at liu han ssamraff looked at that little devil too he must not have liked what he saw for he said i shall make no protest in this matter by the emperor i pledge it he flicked his glance down at the floor for a moment so did the other little scaly devils then ttomalss said i knew you were a male of sense ssamraff no one wants to have a charge of shortsightedness down on his record not if he hopes to improve the design of his body paint that is so ssamraff admitted but this i also tell you to view in the long term on tosev is also dangerous the big uglies change too fast to make projections reliableor else we would have conquered them long since he turned and skittered out of liu hans hut had he been a man instead of a scaly devil she thought he would have stomped away ttomalss and the devil whod shouted at her both laughed as if hed been funny liu han didnt see the joke xii sometimes in the warsaw ghetto moishe russie had developed a feeling that something was wrong that trouble worse trouble he amended to himself just being in the ghetto was tsuris aplenty would land on him if he didnt do something right away hed learned to act on that feeling he was still alive so he supposed following it had done him some good now here in lodz he had it again it wasnt the usual fears hed known not the heartclutching spasm of alarm hed had for instance when hed seen his face on the wall in the balut market square with warnings that he raped and murdered little girls youd have to be meshuggeh he thought not to be frightened over something like that but what he felt now was different smallerjust a tickling at the back of his neck and the skin over his spine that something wasnt quite right somewhere the first day it was there he tried to make believe he didnt notice it the second day he knew it was there but he didnt tell rivka i could be wrong he thought the third dayor rather the evening after reuven had gone to bedhe said out of the blue i think we should move someplace else rivka looked up from the sock she was darning why she asked whats wrong here i dont know he admitted maybe nothing but maybe something too if you were a woman theyd call that the vapors rivka said but instead of laughing at him as she had every right to do she grew serious someplace else where a different flat in lodz a different town a different country id say a different planet but the lizards seem to be using the others too now he laughed but it wasnt funny nu if you think we should go well go rivka said better we should move and not need to than need to and not move why dont you start looking for a new flat tomorrow if you think that will be good enough i just dont know he said i wish i could tune the feeling like a wireless set but it doesnt work that way no it doesnt she agreed gravely what do you want to do do you want to go to zgierz for instance thats not far but it would probably mean leaving things behind still weve left enough things behind by now that a few more wont matter so long as the three of us are together nothing else counts if the war has taught us anything thats it youre right russie got up from his battered chair walked over to the bare light bulb by which rivka sat he let his hand rest on her shoulder but we shouldnt need a war to remind us of that she set down the sock and put her hand on top of his we dont not really but it has shown us we dont need things to get by in the world just people we love a good thing too because we dont have many things moishe stopped afraid his attempt at a joke had wounded his wife not only had they left things behind theyd left people as well a little daughter other loved ones dead in the ghetto and unlike things you could not get a new set of people if she noticed the catch in moishe s voice rivka gave no sign she stayed resolutely practical saying you never did answer me do you want to get out of lodz or shall we stay here the towns around here most of them are judenfrei he said wed stick out we dontlook polish we can t look polish i dontthink he sighed litzmannstadtthe name the germans gave lodzwould have been judenfrei too if the lizard hadnt come all right well stay here then rivka said accepting his oblique answer he didnt know if he was doing the right thing maybe they would be wiser to flee far from lodz even if that meant taking to the road to go to the eastern parts of lizardheld poland where the nazis had not had time to root out all the jews but he couldnt make himself flee like that for what might have been as rivka said a case of the vapors to make himself feel he was doing something he said ill start looking for a new flat tomorrow over by mostowski street that was about as far from where they were as one could go and remain in the lodz ghetto all right rivka said again she picked up the sock and put another few stitches in it after a moment though she added meditatively well have to keep on shopping in the balut market square though thats true moishe started to pace back and forth to go to stay he still couldnt make up his mind it will be all right rivka said god has protected us for this long would he abandon us now that argument would have been more persuasive moishe thought before since then how many of his people had god allowed to die moishe didnt say that to his wife he didnt even care to think it himself his own faith was shakier these days than he wished it were and he didnt want to be guilty of troubling hers instead he yawned and said lets go to bed rivka put down the sock again she hesitated then said do you want me to look for the flat the fewer people who see you the smaller the risk we run moishe knew that was true nonetheless his pride revolted at hiding behind rivka every dayand he had no evidence whatever to back up his hunch so he said it shouldnt be a problem ill be only a moment crossing the balut and i dont look like my poster picture anyhow not cleanshaven rivka gave him her best dubious look but didnt say anything he reckoned that a victory and indeed no one paid him any mind as he crossed the market square and turned east into the heart of the ghetto the shabby brick buildings cast the narrow streets into shadow though the lizards had driven the germans out of lodz nearly a year before the atmosphere of the hellishly crowded ghetto still clung to the place maybe more strongly than in warsaw maybe its the smell russie thought it was a smell of despair and stale cabbage and unwashed bodies and more garbage and sewage than the trash collectors and sewers could handle not all the people the nazis had crammed into lodz had been able to go home some had no homes not after the germans had fought poles and russians and the lizards fought the germans some carried into the ghetto in cattle cars from germany and austria had homes outside lizardheld territory even now the ghetto was a desperately crowded place posters of chaim rumkowski shouted at people from every blank wall surface as far as moishe could tell people werent doing much in the way of listening in all those teeming streets he saw only a couple of persons glance up at the posters and one of those an old woman shook her head and laughed after she did somehow that made russie feel a little better about mankind his own poster still appeared here and there too now beginning to fray and tatter a bit no one looked up at that any more either to his relief when he got to mostowski street he started poking his nose into blocks of flats and asking if they had any rooms to let at first he thought he would have no choice but to stay where he was or else leave town but at the fourth building he visited the fellow who ran the place said you are a lucky man my friend do you know that i just had a family move out not an hour ago why moishe asked in a challenging voice were you charging them a thousand zlotys a day or did the cockroaches and rats make alliance and drive them out its probably a pigsty youre going to show me from one jew to another that hit hard a couple of ways the landlord or manager or whatever he was clapped a hand to his forehead in a theatrical display of injured innocence a pigsty i should kick you out of here on your tokhus to talk like that one look at this flat and youll be down on your knee begging to rent i dont get down on my knees for god and i should do it for you you should live so long moishe said besides you still havent said what ridiculous price you want you shouldnt even see it with a mouth like yours but the landlord was already walking back toward the stairway moishe at his heels besides such a deadbeat couldnt pay four hundred zlotys a month if he lived in lodz king solomon couldnt pay four hundred zlotys a month you ganef moishe stopped im sorry i wasted my time good day he didnt leave a hundred fifty i might manage the landlord had one foot on the stairs he didnt put the other one with it i might manage to starve if i didnt have better sense than to listen to an obvious shlemiel like you i would be giving this lovely flat away at zlotys then give it away but not to me i have better ways to spend my money thank you very much a hundred seventy five would be too much let alone twice that definitely a shlemiel and you think im one too but the landlord started climbing the stairs and moishe climbed with him the stairwell reeked of stale piss moishe didnt know a stairwell in the ghetto that didnt by the time they got to the flat they were only a hundred zlotys apart there they stuck because moishe refused to haggle any further until he saw what he might be renting the landlord chose a key from the fat ring on his belt opened the door with a flourish moishe stuck in his head the place was cut from the same mold as the one he was living in a main room with a kitchen to one side and a bedroom to the other it was a little smaller than his present flat but not enough to matter the electricity works he asked the manager pulled the chain that hung down from the ceiling lamp in the living room the light came on the electricity works he said unnecessarily moishe went into the kitchen water ran when he turned the faucet handle how is the plumbing verkakte the landlord answered which made russie suspect he might have some honesty lurking in him but for lodz for now its not bad two seventyfive is about as low as i can go pal its not that bad moishe said grudgingly if i let my little boy go hungry i might make two twentyfive you give me two twentyfive and my little boy will starve shall we split the difference two fifty two forty moishe said two fortyfive done and you call me a ganef the landlord shook his head gottenyu youre the toughest haggler ive run into in a while if i told you how much more money i was getting out of the last people in here youd cry for me so when are you and your family coming in we could start bringing our things in today moishe answered its not that we have a lot to move believe me this i do believe the landlord said the germans stole the poles stole people stole from each otherand the ones who didnt had to burn their furniture to cook food or keep from freezing to death last winter or the one before or the one before that so fetch in whatever youve got nu but before one stick of it goes in there you put your first months rent right here he held out his hand palm up youll have it moishe promised mister uh stefan berkowicz and you are who so i can tell my wife the name of the man who cheated me emmanuel lajfuner russie answered without hesitation inventing an easily memorable name so he wouldnt forget it before he got home he and berkowicz parted on good terms when he described the haggle to rivka he proudly repeated the landlords praise for his skill and tenacity she shrugged and said if hes like most landlords he says that to all the people who take a flat in his building just to make them feel good but you could have done worse you have often enough praise with that faint damn left moishe feeling vaguely punctured he let rivka go downstairs and hire a pushcart in which to haul their belongings then it was just carrying things down to the cart till it was full manhandling it over to the new building and lugging them up to the flat berkowicz got his zlotys first except for the bedraggled sofa there wasnt anything one man couldnt handle by himself two small sets of dishes and pans moved in different loads some rickety chairs a pile of clothes not very clean not very fine a few toys a handful of books moishe had picked up now here now there a mattress some blankets and a wooden frame not much to make up a life moishe thought but while he was alive he could hope to gain more it will do rivka said when she first set foot in the new flat having expected worse sarcasm than that moishe grinned in foolish relief rivka stalked into the bedroom prowled the tiny kitchen she came back nodding in acceptance if not approval yes it will do without talking about it they arranged such furniture as they owned in about the same places it had occupied in the flat they were leaving moishe looked around the new place yes that helped give it the feeling of home almost done he said late that afternoon he was sweaty and filthy and as tired as hed ever been but one of the good things one of the few good things about moving was that you could see you were making progress whats left rivka asked i thought this was just about everything just about but theres still one more stool and a couple of old blankets that went up on the high shelf when spring finally got here and that sack of canned goods we hid under them for whenever god forbid we might be really hungry again as moishe knew only too well he was imperfectly organized but he had a catchall memory which helped make up for that he might not put papers say in the pile where they were supposed to go but he never forgot where he had put them so now he knew exactly what had been moved and what still remained in the old flat if it werent for the food id tell you not to bother rivka said but youre rightweve been hungry too much i never want to have to go through that again come back as fast as you can i will moishe promised straightening his cap he trudged down the stairs his arms and shoulders twinged aching protest as he picked up the handles of the pushcart ignoring the aches as best he could he made his slow way through the crowded streets and back to the old flat he was just pulling the sack of cans down from the shelf in the bedroom when someone rapped on the open front door he muttered under his breath and put the sack back as quietly as he could so the cans didnt clank togetherletting people know you had food squirreled away invited it to disappear he wondered whether it would be one of his neighbors coming to say goodbye or the landlord with a prospective tenant for the flat hed be polite to whoever it was and send him on his way then hed be able to get on his own way fixing a polite smile on his face he walked into the living room in the doorway stood two burly order service men both still wearing the redandwhite armbands with black magen davids left over from the days of nazi rule in the lodz ghetto they carried stout truncheons behind them were two lizards armed with weapons a great deal worse you moishe russie the uglier order service ruffian asked without waiting for an answer he raised his club you better come with us flying over the russian steppe traveling across it by train ludmila gorbunova had of course known how vast it was but nothing had prepared her for walking over what seemed an improbably large chunk of it to get where she was going ill have to draw new boots when we get back to the airstrip she told nikifor sholudenko his mobile features assumed what she had come to think of as an nkvd sneer so long as you are in a position to draw them all will be well even if you are in a position to draw them with none to be had all will be well enough she nodded sholudenko was undoubtedly right then one of her legs sank almost kneedeep into a patch of ooze she hadnt noticed it was almost like going into quicksand she had to work her way out a little at a time when slimy and dripping she was on the move again she muttered too bad nobody would be able to issue me a new pair of feet sholudenko pointed to water glinting from behind an apple orchard that looks like a pond do you want to clean off all right ludmila said since shed flipped her u the time when they returned to the airstrip formerly so urgent had taken on an atmosphere of nichevo when she and sholudenko werent sure of the day on which theyd arrive an hour or two one way or the other ceased to mean anything they walked over to the orchard which did lie in front of a pond ludmila yanked off her filthy boot the water was bitterly cold but the mud came off her foot and leg shed coated both feet with a thick layer of goose grease shed begged from a babushka if you were going to get wet as anyone who traveled during the rasputitsa surely would the grease helped keep rot from starting between your toes she washed the boot inside and out using a scrap of cloth from inside her pack to dry it as well as she could then she splashed more water on her face she knew how dirty she was and had in full measure the russian love of personal cleanliness i wish this were a proper steam bath she said without the heat first i dont want to take a cold plunge no that would be asking for pneumonia sholudenko agreed cant take the risk not out in the field he spoke like a soldier not like someone whod surely enjoyed a comfortable billet in a town until the nazis invaded the sssr and maybe till the lizards came ludmila had to admit he performed the same way he marched and camped capably and without complaint shed viewed the secret police as birds were supposed to view snakesas hunters almost fascinating in their deadliness and power men whose attention it was far better never to attract but as the days went by sholudenko seemed more and more just another man to her she didnt know how far she could trust that he knelt by the side of the pond and splashed his face too while he washed ludmila stood watch what with lizards and collaborators and bandits who robbed indiscriminately not a kilometer of ukrainian territory was liable to be safe as if to drive that point home a column of half a dozen lizard tanks rolled up the road the pilot and nkvd man had just left im glad they didnt see us carrying firearms ludmila said yes that could have proved embarrassing sholudenko said for some reason theyve developed the habit of firing machinegun bursts first and asking questions later a wasteful way to conduct interrogations not that they asked my opinion of it the casual way he talked about such things made the hair prickle up on ludmilas arms as if she were a wild animal fluffing out its fur to make itself look bigger and fiercer she wondered what sort of interrogations hed conducted once or twice shed almost asked him things like that but at the last minute she always held back even though he was nkvd he seemed decent enough if she knew what hed done instead of having to guess she might not be able to stomach him any more he said i wouldnt mind following those tanks to find out where theyre going if i could keep up with them and if i had a radio to get the information to someone who could use it he wiped his face with his sleeve and grinned wryly and i might as well wish for buried treasure while im about it eh as a matter of fact yes ludmila said which made sholudenko laugh she went on those tanks may not be going anywhere if they hit some really thick mud theyll bog down i saw that happen more than once last fall yes ive seen the same thing he agreed doesnt do to count on it though theyve swallowed up too much of the rodina without bogging down ludmila nodded strange she thought that an nkvd man should talk about the rodina from the day the germans invaded the soviet government had started trotting out all the ancient symbols of holy mother russia after the revolution the bolsheviks had scorned such symbols as reminders of the decadent nationalistic pastuntil they needed them to rally the soviet people against the nazis stalin had even made his peace with the patriarch of moscow although the government remained resolutely atheist sholudenko said i think we can get moving again i dont hear the tanks any more no nor i ludmila said after cocking her head and listening carefully but you have to be careful their machines arent as noisy as ours and could be lying in wait i assure you senior lieutenant gorbunova i have discovered this for myself sholudenko said with sarcastic formality ludmila chewed on her lower lip she had that comingthe nkvd man having to serve on the ground had earned the unlucky privilege of becoming intimately acquainted with lizard hardware at ranges closer than she cared to think about he went on it is even so a lesson which bears repeating this i do not deny mollified by the half apology which was by that one half more than shed ever imagined getting from the nkvd ludmila slid the boot back onto her foot she and sholudenko left the grove together and headed back toward the road one glance was plenty to keep them walking on the verge the column of lizard tanks had chewed the roadbed to slimy pulp worse than the patch into which ludmila had stumbled before this muck though went on for kilometers tramping along by the road wasnt easy either the ground was still squashy and slippery and the years new weeds and bushes growing frantically now that warm weather and long stretches of sunlight were here at last reached out with branches and shoots to try to trip up the travelers so it seemed to ludmila at any rate after she picked herself up for the fourth time in a couple of hours she snarled out something so full of guttural hatred that sholudenko clapped his hands and said ive never had a kulak call me worse than you just gave that burdock it certainly had it coming i must say ludmilas face turned incandescent by sholudenkos snicker the blush was quite visible too what would her mother have said if she heard her cursing likelike she couldnt think of any comparison dreadful enough going on two years in the red air force had so coarsened her that she wondered if she would be fit for anything decent when peace returned when she said that aloud sholudenko waved his arms to encompass the entire scene around them then he pointed at the deep ruts already filling with water the treads the lizard tanks had carved in the road first worry if peace will ever return he said after that you can concern yourself with trifles youre right she said from where we stand this war is liable to go on forever history is always a strugglesuch is the nature of the dialectic the nkvd man said standard marxist doctrine all at once though he turned human again i wouldnt mind if the struggle were a little less overt ludmila pointed ahead theres a village with luck well be able to lay up for a while with a lot of luck well even find some food as they drew closer ludmila saw the village looked deserted some of the cottages had been burned others showed bare spots in their thatches as if they were balding old men a dogs skeleton beginning to fall apart into separate bones lay in the middle of the street that was the last thing ludmila noticed before a shot rang out and kicked up mud a couple of meters in front of her her reflexes were goodshe was down on her belly and yanking her own pistol out of the holster before she had time for conscious thought another shotshe still didnt see the flash her head swiveled as if on a pivot where was cover where was sholudenko hed hit the dirt as fast as she had she rolled through muck toward a wooden fence it wasnt much in the way of shelter but it was a lot better than nothing whos shooting at us and why she called to sholudenko the devils uncle may know but i dont the nkvd man answered he crouched behind a well whose stones warded him better than the fence shielded ludmila he raised his voice hold fire were friends liar the shout was punctuated by a burst of submachinegun fire from another cottage bullets sparked off the stone facing of the well whoever was in there yelled you cant fool us youre from tolokonnikovs faction come to run us out i dont have the slightest idea who tolokonnikov is you maniac sholudenko said all he got for an answer was another shout of liar and a fresh hail of bullets from that submachine gun whomever the antitolokonnikovites did favor he gave them plenty of ammunition ludmila spied the flame the weapon spat she was seventy or eighty meters away very long range for a pistol but she squeezed off a couple of shots anyway to take the heat off sholudenko then quick as she could she rolled away the relentless submachine gun chewed up the place where shed been the nkvd man fired too and was rewarded by a scream and sudden silence from the submachine gun dont get up ludmila willed at him suspecting a trap he didnt sure enough in a couple of minutes the gunner opened up again by then ludmila had found a boulder behind which to shelter from that more secure position she called who is this tolokonnikov and what do you have against him if the people who didnt like him acted this way her guess was that he probably had something going for him she got no coherent answer out of the antitolokonnikovites only another magazines worth of bullets from the submachine gun and a yell of shut up you treacherous bitch deadly as shell fragments rock splinters knocked free by the gunfire flew just above her head she wondered how long the stalemate could go on the answer she came up with was glum indefinitely there wasnt enough cover for either side to have much hope of moving to outflank the other she and sholudenko couldnt very well retreat either that left sitting tight shooting every so often and hoping you got lucky then the equation suddenly grew another variable somebody showed himself for a moment just long enough to chuck a grenade through the window from which the fellow with the submachine gun had been firing a moment after it went off he jumped in the window himself ludmila heard a rifle shot then silence the grenade chucker came out by way of the window too and vanished from her sight whose side is he on she called to sholudenko i keep telling you ask the devils uncle he answered maybe tolokonnikovs maybe his own maybe even ours though i wouldnt bet my life on that the antitolokonnikovite with the pistol the one whod fired first took a fatal moment too long to realize his comrade had been disposed of ludmila wasnt sure what was happening because she couldnt see but she heard another grenade a rifle shot a pistol shot and then two rifle shots closer together after that came silence all the more deafening because of the clamor that had gone before now what ludmila asked i think we wait some more sholudenko answered after they got cute when i fired at them i dont fancy taking any more chances thank you very much the highly charged silence persisted at last from out of the village came a cautious call ludmila bist du da she shook her head someone here knows you sholudenko asked quietly someone german here knows you that was not a good thing to admit to an nkvd man but she did not see she had much choice georg is that you she asked also in german if sholudenko spoke it well and good if he didnt shed already become an object of suspicion in his eyes and so had little more to lose ja he answered still not showing himself tell me the name of the general who commands our base so i can be sure it is truly you tovarishch feofan karpov is a colonel as you know perfectly well she said he is also certain to be furious with you for leaving the base without his leave as i guess you didyoure the best mechanic he has i begin to see sholudenko saidso he did understand german then is he your ah special friend no ludmila answered angrily but he wishes he were which sometimes makes him a nuisance then as if she were reading the nkvd mans mind she added hastily dont harm him for that he is an excellent mechanic and has given the red air force good service even if he is a fascist this i will hear sholudenko said had you been sentimental he let the sentence hang but ludmila had no trouble completing it for herself through the front window of the hut where schultz had disposed of the second antitolokonnikovite ludmila spied something move she couldnt quite tell what it was a few seconds later georg schultz came out still holding an old rag on the end of a stick ludmila realized that was what shed seen had anyone fired at it schultz would have sat tight yes hes been through combat once or twice hasnt he she thought with reluctant admiration schultz certainly looked like a veteran he wore his usual mixture of russian and german gear though the nazi helmet on his head gave his nonuniform uniform a germanic cast stuffed into his belt along with a couple of potatomasher grenades was a pistol he held a soviet ppsh submachine gun and had slung his rifle over his back the panzer gunners teeth showed in a grin that seemed all the whiter because of the beard surrounding ita beard that did nothing to hinder his piratical aspect whos your kamerad he asked ludmila sholudenko answered for himself giving his name and patronymic but not announcing he was nkvd ludmila would have been astonished had he admitted it he went on in german so whats this did you desert your post to seek the fair maiden here your colonel will not be happy with you shultz shrugged fuck him it s not my army or even my air force if you know what i mean and when i get back with herhe jerked a thumb at ludmilaold man karpovll be glad enough to see both of us that he wont bellyache all that much you should have heard himmy best pilot gone whatever shall i do he raised his voice to a falsetto nothing like the colonels but comically effective all the same how did you know where to look for me ludmila asked i can follow a compass bearing and i figured you were smart enough to be doing the same if you were able schultz sounded affronted then his face cleared you mean how did i find out which bearing to follow he set a finger alongside his nose believe me there are ways ludmila glanced over at sholudenko who was undoubtedly taking all that in but the nkvd man just asked how far from the airstrip are we eighty ninety kilometers something like that schultz looked from him to ludmila and back again before asking her who is this fellow the man i was supposed to meet instead of bringing back the information he had i find im bringing him too by way of reply schultz just grunted ludmila felt like laughing at him if hed found her alone on the steppe as hed probably figured he would hed have had several days to try to seduce her or failing that just to rape her now he had to be wondering if shed slept with sholudenko none of your business nazi she thought with the first smile of genuine amusement shed worn since she flipped her aircraft she said shall we be off comrades the rest of the trek back to the airstrip was liable to be interesting along with the rest of the physicists jens larssen watched tensely as enrico fermi manipulated the levers that raised the cadmium control rods from the heart of the rebuilt atomic pile under the university of denver football stadium if we have the design correct this time the kfactor will be greater than one fermi said quietly we will have our selfsustaining chain reaction beside him leslie groves grunted we should have reached this point months ago we would have if the damned lizards hadnt come this is true general fermi said though groves still wore colonels eagles but from now on work will be much faster partly because of the radioactives we have stolen from the lizards and partly because they have shown us that what we seek is possible larssen thought about prometheus stealing fire from the gods and bringing it down to mankind he thought about what happened to prometheus afterwards too chained to a rock somewhere with an eagle gnawing his liver forever he suspected a lot of his colleagues had had that image at one time or another unlike most of them of course he didnt need the met lab to have a feel for the myth of prometheus every time he saw barbara hand in hand with that sam yeager the eagle took another peck at his liver the project was an anodyne of sorts though the pain never left him not entirely he watched the instruments listened to the growing chatter and then the steady roar of the geiger counter as it let the world know about the growing cloud of neutrons down in the heart of the pile any second now he breathed more than half to himself fermi drew out the rods another couple of centimeters he too glanced at the dials worked his slide rule scrawled a quick calculation on a scrap of paper gentlemen i make the kfactor here to be this pile produces more free neutrons than it consumes a few of the physicists clapped their hands more just nodded soberly this was what the numbers predicted all the same it remained a solemn moment arthur compton said the italian navigator has discovered the new world gentlemen this means you can now produce the explosive metal we need to make bombs like the ones the lizards use groves said it means we are a long step closer fermi said with that he lowered the control rods back into the pile needles swung to the left on the instrument board beside him the rhythm of the geiger counters clicks slowed fermi let out a small sigh of relief and it seems we can control the intensity of the reaction this is also of some considerable importance most of the scientists smiled leo szilard laughed out loud larssen had the urge to yank the cadmium rods all the way out of the pile and leave them out until the uranium spat radiation all over the stadium all over the university all over denver he fought it down as he had other lethal but less spectacular impulses over the past weeks what do we do next groves demanded what exactly do we have to accomplish to turn what weve got here into a bomb the big man was not a nuclear physicist but he had more determination than any four nobel prize winners jens could think of if anybody could drive the project to success by sheer force of will groves was probably the one leo szilard on the other hand had his own sort of practicality there is in my office a bottle of good whiskey he remarked what we do next i say is to have a drink the motion passed by acclamation jens trooped over to the science building with everyone else it was good whiskey it filled his mouth with the taste of smoke and left a smooth warm trail down to his stomach the only thing it couldnt do was make him feel good which was why people had started distilling whiskey in the first place szilard raised the bottle a couple of fingers worth coppery bright like a new penny still sloshed there jens held out his glass actually a hundredmilliliter erlenmeyer flask he devoutly hoped had never held anything radioactive for a refill you have earned it szilard said pouring all that work on the pile jens knocked back the second shot it hit hard reminding him he hadnt had any lunch it also reminded him he didnt have any business celebrating no matter how well his work was doing his life was strictly from nowhere good booze said one of the engineers whod worked under him now we all oughtta go out and get laid larssen set the flask on a bookshelf and slithered out of the crowded office his eyes filled with tears which he knew came out of the whiskey bottle but which humiliated him all the same a week before hed picked up a floozy in denver hed been drunk then not two drinks tiddly but plastered he wasnt able to get it up the girl had been kind about it which only made things worse he wondered when hed have the nerve to try that again failure once was bad enough failure twice why go on living with that cheerful thought echoing in his head he went downstairs to reclaim his bicycle oscar the guard stood by the newly built wooden bike rack to make sure none of the machines walked with jesus he nodded when he saw jens back to boq sir he asked yeah jens said through clenched teeth he hated his army cot he hated the base he hated having to go to the base and sleep on the cot and he hated colonel hexham with a deep and abiding loathing that matured like a fine burgundy as the days went by he wished he could have used hexham as a control rod in the nuclear pile if only the man had a neutron capture crosssection like cadmiums and then to make his day complete barbara came strolling up the walk toward the apartment she and sam yeager were using sometimes she just ignored him that his own behavior might have had something to do with that hadnt crossed his mind but barbara wasnt the sort to be rude in public she nodded to him and slowed down a little he walked over to her oscar was good at sticking with himall the physicists had bodyguards these daysbut knew better than to follow real close this time a small voice inside jens warned him hed only end up bruising himself but two nips of szilards good hooch made him selectively deaf hello dear he said hello barbara answeredthe lack of a return endearment set a fire under his temper how are you today about the same as usual he said not so good i want you back jens weve been over this a hundred times she said her voice tired it wouldnt work even if it might have right after i got to denver it wouldnt any more its too late what the devil is that supposed to mean he demanded her eyes narrowed she took half a step back from him instead of answering she said youve been drinking he didnt explain that they were drinks of triumph what if i have he said you going to tell me mr sam walkonwater yeager never takes a drink he knew the words were a mistake as soon as he said them that of course did him no good barbaras face froze goodbye she said ill see you some other time she started walking again he reached out and grabbed her arm barbara youve got to listen to me let me go she said angrily she tried to twist away he held on as if by malign magic oscar appeared he stepped between jens and barbara sir the lady asked you to let go he said quietly as usual and detached larssens hand from barbaras forearm he wasnt what youd call gentle but jens got the feeling he could have been a lot rougher if he felt like it sober he never would have swung on oscar with two whiskeys in him he didnt give a damn any more hed seen some action himself by godand by god barbara was his wife wasnt she oscar knocked his fist aside and hit him in the pit of the stomach jens folded up like a fan trying to breathe and not having much luck trying not to puke and doing a little better with that even as he went down on his knees he was pretty sure oscar had pulled that punch too with arms like those oscar could have ruptured his spleen if he really got annoyed are you all right maam oscar asked barbara yes she said and then a moment later thank you this has been hell on everybody and on jens especially i know that and im sorry but ive done what i have to do only then did her voice change you didnt hurt him did you no maam not like you mean hell be okay in a minute or two why dont you go on back to your place jens kept his eyes on the pavement in front of him but he couldnt help listening to barbaras recedingrapidly recedingfootsteps oscar hauled him to his feet with the same emotionless strength hed shown before let me dust you off sir he said and started to do just that jens knocked his hands away fuck you he gasped with all the air he had in him he didnt care if he turned blue and died after that and what with the way he still couldnt breathe he thought he just might yes sir oscar said tonelessly still just then jens motor finally turned over and he managed a long wonderful mouthful of air oscar nodded in approval there you go sir not too bad when you get on that bike ill ride with you to boq and tomorrow you can see about getting yourself a new guard wont be soon enough jens said louder now that his lungs were following orders again if youll forgive me sir i feel the same way oscar replied snarling jens stalked back to his bicycle oscar right on his heels jens rocketed away from the university oscar stuck with him hed already found out he couldnt shake the guard he wasnt really tryinghe was just doing his best to get rid of his own rage gravel kicked up under his wheels as he banked his weight to the side for the right turn from university to alameda and on to lowry field of all the places in the world lowry field boq was the last one he wanted to go but where else was he supposed to sleep tonight for a moment he didnt care about that either as the air base approached all he wanted to do was keep on going past the boq past the endlessly cratered endlessly repaired runways past everythingkeep on going to somewhere better than this stinking place this stinking life you keep on going the direction youre headed in youll end up in lizard country an interior voice reminded him that was enough for now to make him swing the bike up toward boq like a good little boy but even as he and oscar parked their bicycles side by side he was looking east again come on you misable lugsget movin mutt daniels growled rain ran off his helmet and down the back of his neck that never wouldve happened with an old limeystyle tin hat he thought resentfully the anger put an extra snap in his voice as he added we aint on the newsreels today we aint south o bloomington no more neither dracula szabo put in you are painfully correct private szabo lucille potter said in her precise schoohmarmish voice she pointed ahead to the complex of low stout buildings just coming into view through the curtains of rain that looks to be pontiac state penitentiary up there when they got a little closer szabo grunted looks like somebody kicked the shuh the tar out of it too us n the lizards must have done fought over this stretch of ground last year mutt said the penitentiary complex looked like any fortified area that had been a battleground a few times which is to say not a whole lot of it was left standing a bulletpocked wall here half a building a hundred yards over that way another wall somewhere elsethe rest was rubble bloomington lay thirtyfive bloody miles behind mutt now most of it was rubble too now that the lizards had run the army out again that made three times the town had changed hands in the past year even if the lizards went home and the war ended tomorrow mutt thought the usa would be years pulling itself back up on its pins hed never imagined his own country turning into something that looked like the worst hed seen in france in he did his best not to think about that a sergeant like a manager had to keep his mind on what was happening nowyou could lose the trees for the forest if you werent careful officers got paid to worry about forests mutt said any place bettern this we can camp from behind him somebody said its got good protection sarge i know it does from the ground anyway daniels said but if the lizards bomb us were sittin ducks theres a parkriverview park i think the name of it is lucille potter said ive been there once or twice the vermilion river winds around three sides of it plenty of trees there and benches and an auditorium too if anything is left of it its not far you know how to get there from here mutt asked when lucille nodded he said okay riverview park it is he raised his voice hey freddie look alive up there miss lucilles comin up on point with you she knows where a decent place for us to lay our bodies down is at i hope he added to himself hed seen a lot of parks in illinois and knew what to expect rolling grass plenty of trees places where you could start a fire for a cookout probably a place to rent a fishing boat too since the park was on a river the grass would be hay length now most likely he didnt figure anybody would have mowed it since the lizards came lucille potter found riverview park without any trouble whether it was worth finding was another question once in one of those crazy magazines sam yeager used to read mutt had seen a picture of the craters of the moon add in mud and the occasional tree that hadnt been blown to pieces and youd have a pretty good idea of what the park was like daniels wondered if enough trees still stood to offer his squad decent cover from lizard air attack the rain wouldnt stop the scaly sons of bitches hed already seen that they werent a whole lot less accurate in bad weather than in good either he didnt know how they managed that he just wished to the dripping heavens that they werent able to do it from up ahead freddie laplace called theres bones stickin up outta the ground yeah so what mutt answered this here place been fought over twothree times in case you didnt notice i know that sarge laplace answered in an injured voice thing of it is some of em look like theyre lizard bones he sounded half intrigued half sick whats that lucille potter said sharply let me see those frederick mutt went over to have a look at what freddie had found too lizard bones were the most interesting thing riverview park had to offer as far as he was concerned if he didnt take a gander at them hed have to get out his entrenching tool and start digging himself a hole in the tornup mud squelch squelch squelch his boots threatened to come off at every step the rain kept pattering down mutt sighed too damn bad you couldnt call a war on account of rain or on second thought maybe not on the ground if not in the air the storm probably slowed down the lizards worse than it did the americans course we were slower to start with he muttered under his breath freddie laplace a skinny little guy with a highly developed sense of selfpreservation pointed down into a shell hole that was rapidly turning into a pond sure enough white bones stuck out of the dirt those never came from no human bein sarge freddie said youre right lucille potter answered those never came from any creature on earth just look like arm bones to me mutt said yeah they got claws stead of fingers but so what he wrinkled his nose still got some old meat on em too the rain banished the worst of the afterthebattle stench but not all of it lucille let out an impatient sniff use your eyes mutt you must know that people have two long bones in their forearms and one in their upper arms see for yourselfwith the lizards its just the opposite well ill be a the memory of his fathers callused hand kept mutt from saying what hed be now that lucille pointed it out though he saw she was right his knowledge of anatomy came from no formal study but from farming and from dealing with players who hurt themselves on the fieldand with his own injuries back when he was playing himself now that his attention was focused he added i never seen any wrist bones like those neither they have to be different from ours lucille said a human wrist pivots the hand off two bones these off only one the muscle attachments would be very different too but we cant see much of them any more freddie laplace worked at the mud with his entrenching tool not to dig in but to expose more of the dead lizards skeleton in spite of the rain the deadmeat stink grew bad enough to make mutt cough hed already seen that lizards bled red now he learned they had no more dignity in death than men slain the same way lord i wonder what happens to em come judgment day he said very much as if he were asking the deity hed been raised a hardshell baptist and never bothered to question his childhood faith after he grew to manhood but if god had made the lizards at some time or other during creation and on which day would that have been would he resurrect them in the body come the last day mutt figured preachers somewhere were getting hot and bothered about that freddie exposed some of the alien corpses ribcage aint that peculiar he said more like latticework than a proper cage how come you know so much about it mutt asked him my old man he runs a butcher shop up in bangor maine laplace answered theres one thing i seen a lot of sarge its bones mutt nodded conceding the point lucille potter said that latticework arrangement is very strongthe english used it for the skeletons of their blenheim and wellington bombers is that a fact daniels said he was just making talk though if miss lucille said something was so you could take it to the bank she asked freddie do you think you can dig out his skull for me ill give it a try maam laplace said as if shed asked him up to the blackboard for a tough multiplication problem he thought he could do he started scraping away more mud with the folding shovel lucille potter made little eager noises as if he were digging up a brandnew chevy not that there were any brandnew chevies and enough gas to run it for a year try and figure women mutt thought as he watched lucille take a scalpel from her little case of instruments a dead lizard interested her but a live sergeant didnt mutt sighed he thought lucille liked him well enough he knew he liked her well enough and then some he knew she knew that too she could hardly have doubted it after the kiss hed given her when he used her bottle of ether to take out the lizard tank but the spark that jumped one way didnt come back the other he wondered if shed left a sweetheart behind when she signed up as an army nurse he had his doubts about that she had maiden lady written all over her just my luck he thought he was not a man to spend a lot of time brooding over what he couldnt help if he had been that sort of man years of catching and then of managing would have changed him into a different sort too many decisions to let any one reach earthshaking proportions even if it didnt work if you couldnt understand that down in your guts you were liable to end up like willard hershberger the reds catcher whod cut his throat in a new york hotel room after he called the pitch mel ott hit into the polo grounds stands for a ninthinning gamewinning homer and so mutt went around to see that the rest of his squad was well dug in and that dracula szabo had picked a spot with a good field of fire for his bar daniels didnt expect to be attacked here but you never could tell we got anything decent for chow tonight sarge szabo asked crations i expect and damn lucky to have those mutt answered bettern what we ever saw in france you can believe that the only real thing daniels had against the canned rations was that the supply boys had trouble getting enough of them into the field to keep him from being hungry more than he liked with the lizards controlling the air logistics got real sticky szabo had what mutt thought of as a city slickers face controlled knowing often with an expression that seemed to say hed be laughing at you if only you were worth laughing at it was a face that ached for a slap whether it did or whether it didnt though dracula had his uses now he reached under his poncho and showed mutt three dead chickens reckon we can do some better than crats he said smugly grinning like a fox whod just raided the hen coop that was probably just what he was too mutt thought he said we aint supposed to forage on our own people but his heart wasnt in it roast chicken did go down better than canned stew aw sarge they were just struttin around no people anywhere close szabo said as innocently as if he were telling the truth maybe more innocently but he knew as well as mutt that mutt wasnt going to call him on it im right glad o that daniels said you go ah findin chickens where there is people around youll have miss lucille diggin pellets outta your ass birdshot if youre lucky buckshot if you aint not while im luggin a bar szabo said with quiet assurance didnt miss lucille say something about an auditorium somewhere in this park if theres any roof at all cooking these birds gets a lot easier mutt looked around riverview park was goodsized and with the rain coming down in curtains he couldnt see anything that looked like a building ill ask her where its at he said and sloshed back to where she was playing mad scientist with the late unlamented lizards remains look at this mutt lucille said when he came up she used her scalpel to point enthusiastically at the lizards jaws lots of little teeth all pretty much the same not specialized like ours yeah i seen that when i captured a couple live ones not long after they invaded us mutt answered averting his eyes the skull had enough rotting meat still on it to threaten to kill his appetite you captured lizards sarge freddie laplace sounded impressed as all get out lucille just took it in stride the way she did most things mutt would have been happier had it been the other way around nothing he could do about it though he asked her where the auditorium was she pointed eastward he slogged in that direction hoping some of the place was still intact sure enough he discovered that although it had taken a shell hit that left one wall only a baby brickyard the rest seemed sound enough in the rain finding anything more than fifty yards away wasnt easy mud thin as bad diarrhea slopped over his boot tops and soaked his socks he hoped he wouldnt come down with pneumonia or the grippe halt who goes szabos voice came out of the water as if from behind a falls daniels couldnt see him at all dracula might be a chicken thief but he made a pretty fair soldier its me mutt called found that auditorium place you want to give me them birds ill cook em for you i grew up on a farm reckon ill do a better job than you would anyways yeah okay come on this way szabo stood up so mutt could spot him not gonna be any lizards around for a while though sargeis it okay if i wander over there in an hour or so and youll make sure theres some dark meat left for me i think maybe we can do that daniels said you put somebody here on your weapon before you go wandering though you hear me in case we do have trouble were gonna need all the firepower we can get our hands on dont you worry about that sarge szabo said even roast chicken aint worth gettin my ass shot off for he spoke with great conviction from any other dogface in the squad daniels would have found that convincing with szabo you never could tell he took the chickens back to the auditorium whoever had been there last americans or lizards had chopped up a lot of the folding wooden seats that faced the stage more than theyd used for their fires taking advantage of the free lumber mutt built his blaze on the concrete floor where others had made theirs before him he pulled out his trusty zippo he wondered how long it would stay trusty he had a package of flints in his shirt pocket but the zippo was burning kerosene these days not lighter fluid and he didnt know when hed come across any more kerosene either for now it still gave him a flame on the first try he quickly found out why the previous occupants of the auditorium had been so eager to use the seats for fuel the varnish that made them shiny also made them catch fire with the greatest of ease he went back out into the rain to throw away the chicken guts and to get some sticks on which to skewer the pieces of chicken he was going to cook his belly growled when the savory smell of roasting meat came through the smoke from the fire his grandfathers would have done their cooking in the war between the states the same way he was now except theyd have used lucifer matches instead of the zippo to get the fire going chow he yelled when he had a fair number of pieces finished men straggled in by ones and twos ate quickly and went back out into the rain when lucille potter came in for hers mutt asked jokingly you wash your hands before supper youd best believe i didand with soap too being a nurse lucille was in dead earnest about cleanliness did you wash yours before you cleaned these birds and cut them up well you might say so mutt answered his hands had certainly been wet anyhow didnt use soap though had lucille potters stare been any fishier shed have grown fins before she could say anything szabo strolled into the auditorium you save me a drumstick sarge heres a whole leg kid mutt said the bar man blissfully started gnawing away daniels took half a breast off the fire waved it in the air to cool it down and also began to eat he had to pause a couple of times to spit out burnt bits of feather hed done a lousy job of plucking the chickens then he paused again this time with the hunk of white meat nowhere near his mouth through the splashing rain came deepthroated engine rumblings and the mucky grinding noise of caterpillar tracks working hard to propel their burden over bad ground the chicken mutt had already swallowed turned to a small lump of lead in his stomach tanks the word came out as hardly more than a whisper as if he didnt want to believe it himself then he bellowed it with all the fear and force he had in him tanks dracula szabo dropped the mostly bare drumstick and thigh and sprinted back toward his bar what good it would do against lizard armor mutt couldnt imagine he also didnt think the rain would give him another chance to take out a lizard tank with a bottle of ethereven assuming lucille had any more which wasnt obvious he threw down his own piece of meat grabbed his submachine gun and peered out ever so cautiously through the gaping hole in the auditorium wall the tanks were out there somewhere not far away but he couldnt see them they werent firing maybe they didnt know his squad was in the park thats great he muttered gettin trapped behind enemy lines is just what i had in mind enemy lines all his attention on the noises coming from the dripping gloom outside mutt hadnt noticed lucille potter coming up behind him she went on those are our tanks mutt theyre coming down from the northeither the lizards havent taken out the bridges over the vermilion or else weve repaired themand they make a lot more racket than the machines the lizards use mutt listened again this time without panic blinding his ears after a twobeat pause he used around lucille to replace a useful sevenletter word be said youre right lord i was ready to start shooting at my own side some of the men are still liable to do that lucille said yeah mutt stepped outside shouted into the rain hold your fire american tanks comin south hold fire one of the grunting snorting machines rumbled by close enough for the commander to hear that cry to mutt he was just a vague shape sticking up from the top of the turret he called back in unmistakable new england accents were friendly all right buddy were usin the rain to move up without the lizards spotting usgive the little scaly sons of bitches a surprise if they come after you guys sounds right good pal daniels answered waving the tankhe could tell it was a sherman the turret was too big for a leerattled on toward the south edge of riverview park in a way mutt envied the crew for having inches of hardened steel between them and the foe in another way he was happy enough to be just an infantryman the lizards didnt particularly notice him tanks though drew their special fire they had some fancy can openers too the tank commander had to know that better than mutt did he kept heading south anyhow mutt wondered how many times hed been in action and if this one would be the last with a wave to the departing tank that was half salute he went back into the ruined auditorium to finish his chicken xiii vyacheslav molotov jounced along toward the farm outside moscow in a panje wagon as if he were a peasant with a couple of sacks of radishes he hadnt been able to sell from the way the nkvd man driving the wagon behaved molotov might have been a sack of radishes himself the soviet foreign commissar didnt mind he was rarely in the mood for idle chitchat with today no exception to the rule all around him the land burgeoned with russian spring the sun rose early now and set late and everything that had lain dormant through winter flourished in the long hours of daylight fresh green grass pushed up through and hid last years growth now gray brown and dead the willows and birches by the moscow river wore new bright leafy coats concealed by those new leaves birds chirped and warbled molotov did not know which bird went with which song he could barely tell a titmouse from a toucan not that you were likely to find a toucan in a russian treetop even in springtime ducks stuck their behinds in the air as they tipped up for food in the river the driver looked at them and murmured i wish i had a shotgun molotov saw reply as unnecessary the driver would likely have said the same thing had he been alone in the wagon molotov wished not for a shotgun but a car yes gasoline was in short supply with almost all of it earmarked for the front but as the number two man in the soviet union behind stalin he could have arranged for a limousine had he wanted one the lizards however were more likely to shoot up motor vehicles than horsedrawn wagons molotov played it safe when the driver pulled off the road and onto a meandering path molotov thought the fellow had lost his way the thrill ahead looked like an archetypical kolkhoz maybe a little smaller than most of its ilk chickens ran around clucking and pecking fat pigs wallowed in mud in the fields men walked behind mules the only buildings were row houses for the kolkhozniks and barns for the animals then one of the men dressed like any farmer in boots baggy trousers collarless tunic and cloth cap opened the door to a barn and went inside before he closed it after himself the foreign commissar saw that the inside was brightly lit by electric light even before the germans and the lizards came that would have been unusual for a kolkhoz now it was inconceivable his smile came broader and more fulsome than most who knew him would have imagined his face could form a splendid job of maskirovka he said enthusiastically whoever designed and implemented the deception plan he deserves to be promoted comrade foreign commissar i am given to understand the responsible parties have been recognized the driver said he looked like a peasanthe looked like a drunkbut he talked like an educated man maskirovka again molotov thought he knew intellectually he would not have a drunken peasant taking him to arguably the most important place in the soviet union but the man played his role well molotov pointed to the barn that is where they do their research comrade all l know is that that is where l was told to deliver you the driver answered what they do in there i could not tell you and i do not want to know he pulled back on the reins the horse drawing the highwheeled panje wagon obediently stopped molotov who was not a large man even if he was taller than stalin scrambled down without grace but also without falling as he headed for the barn door the driver took a flask from his hip pocket and swigged from it maybe he was an educated drunk the barn door looked like a barn door after that though the maskirovka failed the air that came out of the barn did not smell as it should molotov supposed that didnt matter if the lizards got close enough to go sniffing around the soviet union was likely to be finished anyhow he opened the door closed it behind him as quickly as the fellow who looked like a farmer had done inside the wooden building was uncompromisingly clean and uncompromisingly scientific even the farmers costume when seen close up was spotless the fellow hurried up to molotov comrade foreign commissar i am delighted to see you here he said extending a hand he was a broadshouldered man of about forty with a chin beard and alert eyes in a tired face i am igor ivanovich kurchatov director of the explosive metal project he brushed back a lock of hair that drooped hitlerlike molotov thought irrelevantly onto his forehead i have questions on two fronts igor ivanovich molotov said first how soon will you finish the bomb built from the captured lizard explosive metal and second how soon will this facility begin producing more of this metal for us to use kurchatovs eyes widened slightly you come straight to the point timewasting formalities are for the bourgeoisie molotov replied tell me what i need to know so i can report it to comrade stalin stalin of course received regular reports from the project beria had been here to see how things went too but molotov along with being foreign commissar also served as deputy chairman to stalin on the state committee on defense kurchatov licked his lips before he answered he was well aware of that he said in the first area we have made great progress we are almost ready to begin fabricating the components for the bomb that is good news molotov agreed yes comrade kurchatov said since we have the explosive metal in place it becomes a straightforward engineering matter of putting two masses of it neither explosive alone together so they exceed what is called the critical mass the amount required for an explosion i see molotov said though he really didnt if something was explosive it seemed to him the only difference between a little and a lot should have been the size of the boom but all the soviet physicists and other academicians insisted this strange metal did not work that way if they achieved the results they claimed he supposed that would prove them right he asked and how have you decided to join the pieces together the simplest way we could think of was to shape one into a cylinder with a hole through the center and the other into a smaller cylinder that would fit precisely into the hole an explosive charge will propel it into the proper position we shall take great care that it does not go awry such care is welladvised comrade director molotov said but although he kept his voice icy he intuitively liked the design kurchatov had described it had a russian simplicity to it slam the one into the other and bang molotov knew his own people well enough to know also that they had more trouble keeping complicated plans on track than did say the germans russians had a way of substituting brute force for sophistication theyd held the nazis outside moscow and leningrad that way now they were on the edge of striking a mighty blow against the lizards more deadly invaders still a mighty blow after we use up our stock of explosive metal we have no moreis that correct molotov asked yes comrade foreign commissar kurchatov licked his lips and went no further molotov frowned he had been afraid this would happen the academicians had a habit of promising stalin the moon whether they could deliver or not maybe the horse will learn to sing he thought an echo from some ancient history read in his student days he shook his head banishing the memory the here and now was what counted he knew the dilemma the scientists faced if they told stalin they could not give him something he wanted theyd head for the gulag unless they got a bullet in the back of the neck instead but if after promising they failed to come through the same applied again and the soviet union desperately needed a continuous supply of explosive metal in that molotov agreed with stalin he tried to remember the last time he had disagreed with stalin he couldnt it was too long ago he said what are the difficulties in production igor ivanovich and how are you working to overcome them as if on cue another man in farmers clothes came up kurchatov said comrade foreign commissar let me present to you georgi aleksandrovich flerov who recently discovered the spontaneous fission of the uranium nucleus and who is in charge of the team investigating these difficulties flerov was younger than kurchatov even in the clothes of a peasant he looked like a scholar he also looked nervous because he was in charge he was responsible for what his team didand for what it didnt do comrade foreign commissar the answer to your first question or to the first part of it is simple he said trying to hold his rather light voice steady the chief difficulty in production is that we do not yet know how to produce our techniques in nuclear research are several years behind those of the capitalists and fascists and we are having to learn what they already know molotov gave him a baleful stare comrade stalin will not be pleased to hear this kurchatov blanched so did flerov but he said if comrade stalin chooses to liquidate this team no one in the soviet union will be able to produce these explosives for him everyone with that expertise who is still alive is here we are what the rodina has for better or worse molotov was not used to defiance even frightened deferential defiance he harshened his voice as he replied we were promised fullscale production of explosive metal within eighteen months if the team assembled here cannot accomplish this the germans are not likely to have that within eighteen months comrade foreign commissar flerov said neither are the americans though the breakdown in travel has left us less wellinformed about their doings has played hob with espionage you mean molotov thought flerov had a little diplomat in him after all that however was a side issue molotov said if you cannot produce as promised we will remove you and bring in those who can good luck to you and goodbye to the rodina flerov said you may find charlatans who tell you worse lies than we could ever imagine you will not find capable physicistsand if you dispose of us you may never see uranium or plutonium produced in the soviet union he was not bluffing molotov had watched too many men trying to lie for their lives he knew nonsense and bluff when he heard them he didnt hear them from flerov rounding on kurchatov he said you direct this project why have you not kept us informed about your trouble in holding to the schedule comrade foreign commissar we are ahead of schedule in preparing the first bomb kurchatov said that ought to count in our favor even if the other half of the project is going more slowly than we thought it would we can rock the lizards back on their heels with one explosion igor ivanovich flerov began urgently molotov raised a hand to cut him off he glared at kurchatov you may be an excellent physicist comrade but you are politically naive if we rock the lizards with one explosion with how many will they rock us under the harsh electric lights kurchatovs face went an ugly yellowishgray flerov said comrade foreign commissar this has been a matter of only theoretical discussion you need to make it one of the theses of your dialectic molotov said he was convinced stalin had the right of that the lizards would hit back hard at any nation that used the explosive metal against them we shall do as you say kurchatov said see that you do molotov answered meanwhile the soviet unionto say nothing of all mankindrequires a supply of explosive metal you cannot make it within eighteen months you say how long then molotov was not large nor physically imposing but when he spoke with the authority of the soviet union in his voice he might have been a giant kurchatov and flerov looked at each other if things go well four years flerov said if things go very well three and a half kurchatov said the younger man gave him a dubious look but finally spread his hands conceding the point three and a half years more likely four molotov felt as if hed been kicked in the belly the soviet union would have its one weapon which it could hardly use for fear of bringing hideous retaliation down on its head and the germans and the americansand for all he knew maybe the english and the japanese tooahead in the race to make bombs of their own how am i to tell this to comrade stalin he asked the question hung in the air not only would the scientists incur stalins wrath for being too optimistic but it might fall on molotov as well as the bearer of bad news if the academicians were as irreplaceable as they thought the odds were good that stalin wouldnt do anything to them over the years molotov had done his best to make himself indispensable to stalin but indispensable wasnt the same as irreplaceable and he knew it he asked can i tell the general secretary you will succeed within two and a half to three years if he could arrange to present a small disappointment rather than a big one he might yet deflect stalins anger comrade foreign commissar you can of course tell the great stalin whatever you please but that will not be the truth kurchatov said when the time passes and we do not succeed you will have to explain why if the lizards give us so much time for research and engineering flerov added he looked to be enjoying molotovs discomfiture if the lizards overrun this place comrades i assure you that you will have no more joy from it than i molotov said stonily had the germans defeated the soviet union molotov would have gone up against a wall with a blindfold if he was lucky but nuclear physicists might have been useful enough to save their skins by turning their coats the lizards however would not want human beings to know atoms existed let alone that they could be split driving that home molotov added and if the lizards overrun this place it will be in large measure because you and your team have failed to give the workers and people of the soviet union the weapons they need to carry on the fight we are doing everything men can do flerov protested there are too many things we simply do not know now he was the one who sounded uncertain querulous that was how molotov wanted it he snapped you had better learn then softly igor kurchatov said it is easier to give orders to generals comrade foreign commissar than to nature she reveals her secrets at a pace she chooses she has revealed altogether too many of them to the lizards molotov said if they can find them so can you he turned his back to show the interview was over he thought hed recovered well from the shocking news the academicians had given him how well he would recover after he gave stalin that news was unfortunately another question the peddler smiled in appreciation as david goldfarb handed him a silver onemark piece with kaiser wilhelms mustachioed image stamped on it thats good money friend he said along with the baked apple on a stick that goldfarb had bought he gave back a fistful of copper and potmetal coins by way of change his expression turned sly you have money that good it doesnt matter how funny your yiddish sounds geh kak afen yam goldfarb said genially doing his best to hide the sudden pounding of his heart where i come from everybody talks like me what a miserable ignorant place that must be the peddler retorted at first i thought you had a nice warsaw accent the more i listen to you though the more i figure youre from chelm goldfarb snorted the legendary town was full of shlemiels what he really spoke of course was yiddish with a warsaw accent corrupted by living his whole life in england he hadnt thought it was corrupted till the british sub dropped him on the flat muddy coast of poland now comparing the way he spoke to the yiddish of people who used it every day of their lives he counted himself lucky that they understood him at all as an excuse not to say where he really did come from he bit into the apple hot sweet juice flooded into his mouth mmm he said a wordless happy sound it would be really good if i could get some cinnamon the peddler said but theres none to be had not for love nor money good anyhow goldfarb mumbled his full mouth muffling whatever odd accent the kings english gave him with a nod to the peddler he walked south down the dirt track toward lodz he was he thought just a couple of hours away he hoped that wouldnt be too late from what hed heard just before he sailed from england his cousin moishe was in jail somewhere in lodz he wondered how he was supposed to get moishe out with a noncoms fatalism he put that out of his mind hed worry about it when the time came first he had to get to lodz hed already discovered that a couple of years of fighting the war electronically had left his wind a shadow of what it was supposed to be his physicaltraining sergeant would not have approved something to be said for not laying about puffing on fags all day longitd be even shorter if id had more to smoke he said in lowvoiced english all the same i miss em he looked around just a glimpse of the endless flat farmland of the polish plain had been plenty to tell him all he needed to know about that countrys unhappy history besides the shelter of the english channel the united kingdom had mountains in the west and north in which to take refuge witness the survival of welsh and scots gaelic over the centuries poland nowall the poles had was the germans on one side and the russians on the other and nothing whatever to keep either one of them out except their own courage and when the germans outweighed them three to one and the russians two or three times as badly as that even suicidal courage too often wasnt enough no wonder they give their jews a hard time he thought with a sudden burst of insight theyre sure they can beat the jews after losing so many wars to their neighbors having in their midst people they could trounce had to feel sweet that didnt make him love the people who had driven his parents from poland but it did help him understand them goldfarb looked around again almost everywhere in england hed been able to see hills on the horizon here it went on forever the endless flat terrain made him feel insignificant and at the same time conspicuous as if he were a fly crawling across a big china platter the green of polish fields was different from what hed known in england too duller somehow maybe it was the light maybe the soil whatever it was hed noticed it almost at once hed noticed the workers in those fields too englishmen who labored on the land were farmers the poles were inarguably peasants he had trouble defining the difference but as with the colors of the fields it was unmistakable maybe part of it lay in the way the polish farmers went about their work by the standards goldfarb was used to they might as well have been moving in slow motion their attitude seemed to say that how hard they worked didnt matterthey werent going to realize much from their labors anyway a noise in the sky like an angry cockchafer goldfarb had heard that noise more times than he cared to remember and his reaction to it was instinctive he threw himself flat hugging the ground a flight of german bombers roared by heading east jus goldfarb thought identifying them by sound and shape as automatically as he would have told his father from an uncle he was used to praying for fighters and antiaircraft guns to blow german bombers out of the sky now he found himself wishing them luck that felt strange wrong the world had taken a lot of strange turns since the lizards came he got to his feet and peered south smoke smudged the horizon there the first mark hed seen that ought to be lodz he thought a little farther and he could start doing the job the british high command had in their wisdom decided he was right for cloth cap black jacket and wool trousersthey all shouted i am a jew he wondered why hitler had bothered adding yellow stars to the getup they struck him as hardly necessary even his underwear was different from what hed worn in england and chafed him in strange places he had to look like a jew he spoke yiddish but his polish was fragmentary and mostly foul in england even before he went into uniform hed dressed and sounded like everyone else here in poland he felt isolated from a large majority of the people around him get used to it he muttered most places jews dont fit in an ornate brass signpost said lodz km fastened above it was an angular wooden sign with angular black letters on a white background litzmannstadt km just seeing that sign pointing like an arrow at the heart of lodz set goldfarbs teeth on edge typical german arrogance to slap a new name on the town once theyd conquered it he wondered if the lizards called it something altogether different a little more than an hour brought him into the outskirts of lodz hed been told the town had fallen to the nazis almost undamaged it wasnt undamaged now the briefings hed read on the submarine said the germans had put up a hell of a scrap before the lizards drove them out of town and that theyd lobbed occasional rockets or flying bombs the briefings werent very clear about which at it ever since most of the people in the outer part of the city were poles if any german settlers remained from lodzs brief spell as litzmannstadt they were lying low sneers from the poles were bad enough he didnt know what he would have done with germans gaping at him all at once he regretted hoping the german bombers had a good mission then he got angry at himself for that regret the germans might not be much in the way of human beings but against the lizards they and england were on the same side he walked on down lagiewnicka street toward the ghetto the wall the nazis had built was still partly intact although in the street itself it had been knocked down to allow traffic once more as soon as he set foot on the jewish side he decided that while the germans and england might be on the same side the germans and he would never be the smell and the crowding hit him twin sledgehammer blows hed lived his whole life with plumbing that worked hed never reckoned that a mitzvah a blessing but it was the brown reek of sewage or rather slops garbage and unwashed humanity made him wish he could turn off his nose and the crowd hed heard men whod been in india and china talk of ant heaps of people but he hadnt understood what that meant the streets were jammed with men women children carts wagonsa goodsized city was boiled down into a few square blocks like bouillon made into a cube people bought sold argued pushed past one another got in each others way so that block after block of ghetto street felt like the most crowded pub where goldfarb had ever had a pint the peoplethe jewswere dirty skinny many of them sicklylooking after tramping down from the polish coast goldfarb was none too clean himself but whenever he saw someone eyeing him he feared the flesh on his bones made him conspicuous and this misery he realized remained after the nazis were the better part of a year out of lodz the jews now were fed better and treated like human beings what the ghetto had been like under german rule wasnot unimaginable for he imagined it all too vividly but horrifying in a way hed never imagined till now thank you father for getting out when you did he said for a couple of blocks he simply let himself be washed along like a fish in a swiftflowing stream then he began moving against the current in a direction of his own choosing posters of mordechai chaim rumkowski seemed to follow him wherever he went some were tattered and faded some as new and bright as if theyd been put up yesterday which they probably had rumkowski stared down at goldfarb from a variety of poses but always looked stern and commanding goldfarb shook his head the briefing papers had had considerable to say about rumkowski and his regime in lodz but not much of that was good in sum he amounted to a pocket jewish hitler just what we need goldfarb thought a couple of times he passed order service men with their armbands and truncheons he noticed them not only for those but also because they looked uncommonly wellfed a pocket jewish ss too wonderful goldfarb kept his head down and did his best to pretend he was invisible but he had to look up from time to time to tell where he was going studying a street map of lodz didnt do enough to let him make his way through the town itself luckily being one mote in a swirling crowd kept him from drawing special notice after three wrong turnsabout half as many as hed expectedhe walked into a block of flats on mostowski street and started climbing stairs he knocked on what he hoped was the right door a woman a couple of years older than he wasshe would have been pretty if she hadnt been so thinopened it and stared at his unfamiliar face with fearwidened eyes who are you she demanded goldfarb got the idea something unpleasant would happen to him if he gave the wrong answer he said im supposed to tell you even job didnt suffer forever and im supposed to tell you it must have seemed that way to him the womans whole body relaxed come in you must be moishes cousin from england thats right he said she closed the door behind him he went on and youre rivka wheres your son hes out playing in the crowds on the street the risk is small and besides someone has an eye on him good goldfarb looked around the flat was tiny but so bare that it seemed larger he shook his head in sympathy you must be sick to death of moving rivka russie smiled for the first time tiredly you have no idea reuven and i have moved three times since moishe didnt come back to the flat wed just taken she shook her head he thought someone had known who he was we must have been just too late getting out of the other place if it hadnt been for the underground i dont know what we would have done got caught i suppose they got word to england too goldfarb said and orders eventually got to me he wondered if they would have had churchill not spent a while talking with him at bruntingthorpe im supposed to help get moishe out of here and take himand you and the boy back to england with me if i can can you do that rivka asked eagerly gott vayssgod knows he said that won a startled laugh from her he went on im no commando or hero or anything like that ill work with your people and ill do the best i can thats all a better answer than i expected her voice was judicious is he still in lodz goldfarb asked thats the last information i had but its not necessarily good any more as far as we know yes the lizards arent in a lot of hurry about dealing with him that doesnt make sense to me when he did such a good job of embarrassing them theyre more sure than quick goldfarb said remembering pages from the briefing book very methodical but not swift what sort of charge do they have him up on disobedience rivka said from everything he ever said while he was on better terms with them they couldnt accuse him of anything much worse that fit in with what goldfarb had read too the lizards seemed rank class and dutyconscious to a degree that made the english and even the japanese look like wildeyed bombthrowing anarchists in that kind of society disobedience had to be as heinous a sin as blasphemy in the middle ages still here in lodz goldfarb mused thats good i suppose the lizards main polish headquarters is in warsaw getting him out of there would be a lot tougher he grinned wryly besides i dont fancy walking all that way east not when ive just come here from the coast the same way would you like some tea rivka asked a moment later she added another more indignant question whats so funny nothing really goldfarb said though he was still chuckling its only that any woman in my family would have asked exactly the same question i am a woman in your family rivka said quietly thats true you are they eyed each other across the gulf of lifetimes spent in very different lands goldfarbs parents had escaped the ghetto to him this place was something medieval returned to malignant life and rivka in her long black dress almost as much a part of the past come again he wondered how he seemed to her exotic stranger from a land rich and peaceful compared to poland in spite of everything hitler and the lizards had done to england or just an apikoros someone whod abandoned most of his judaism to get along in the wider world he didnt know how to ask or even if it was his business do you want that cup of tea rivka asked again its not real tea im afraid only choppedup herbs and leaves same sort of muck weve been drinking at home goldfarb said yes id like some if its not too much trouble rivka russie made the tea on an electric hot plate she served it to him in a glass with sugar but no milk that was how his parents drank it but hed come to prefer the way most englishmen took theirs asking for milk here though didnt seem likely to produce anything but embarrassment cautiously he sipped he raised an eyebrow not bad at all better than most of what ive had lately as a matter of fact to prove he meant it he quickly drained the glass then he said so youre still in touch with the underground yes rivka answered if it werent for them the order service men would have taken reuven and me along with moishe by now can you let me know how to get hold of them if nothing else ill need somewhere to sleep while im looking things over cant very well stay in a flat with my cousins wife not when hes in gaol its not as hard as you might think amusement shone in rivkas eyes go across the hall to flat number twentyfour knock on the doortwice then once hed used a password to identify himself to her now he had to trot out a secret knock hed always thought that sort of thing more the province of sensational novels than sober fact but he was learning better in a hurry if you wanted to keep going when every mans hand was raised against you you had to figure out ways to keep from being noticed he went across the hall found the battered door with a tarnished brass on it knock knock knock he waited the door opened the big man standing in it said nu nu the lady across the way sent me here goldfarb replied with his shaggy beard and soldiers cap over civilian clothes the big man looked like a bandit chief he also looked like someone it would be wiser not to annoy goldfarb was glad hed had the right code to introduce himself to rivka russie without it this fellow likely would have descended on him like a falling building hed been right to have his wind up but now the man grinned showing bad teeth and stuck out his hand so youre russies english cousin are you you can call me leon right the fellow had a blacksmiths grip goldfarb discovered he also noted that while the local jew had said he could call him leon that didnt mean it was his name another precaution out of the books and probably as necessary as the rest dont stand therecome in leon said never can tell whos liable to be looking down the hall he closed the door behind goldfarb take your pack off if you likeit looks heavy thanks goldfarb did the apartment was if anything barer than rivkas only mattresses on the floor said people lived or at least slept here he said moishes still in lodz leon he figured would know more surely than rivka had the big man nodded hes in prison one on franciszkanska streetthe nazis called it franzstrasse just like they called lodz litzmannstadt we call it franzstrasse ourselves sometimes because theres a big sign with that name right across from the prison that nobodys ever bothered taking down prison one eh goldfarb said how many are there plenty leon answered along with being good at killing people the nazis were good at putting them away too do you know where in the prison hes locked up goldfarb asked for that matter do you have plans for the building who do you think turned it into a prison the germans should have dirtied their hands doing the work themselves leon said oh yes we have the plans and we know where your cousin is too the lizards dont let jews anywhere near himtheyre learningbut they havent learned yet that some poles are on our side too this whole business must make you meshuggeh sometimes goldfarb said the lizards are better to jews here than the nazis ever were but theyre bad for everybody else so sometimes you find yourself working with the germans and the poles dont like jews either but i guess they dont like the lizards any better its a mess all right leon agreed im just glad i dont have to do much in the way of figuring out you wanted plans ill show you plans he went over to a cabinet yanked out a roll of paper and brought it over to goldfarb when goldfarb opened it he saw they werent just plans but germanically meticulous engineering drawings leon pointed they have machine guns on the roof here and here well have to do something about those yes goldfarb said in a small voice a machine gun we dont do something about would put rather a hole in our scheme wouldnt it that might have been leons first taste of british understatement he grunted laughter put a hole in us you meanprobably lots of holes but lets say we can take out the machine guns because if we dont we cant go on anyhow goldfarb broke in exactly leon said so lets say we do youre supposed to be bringing some presents with you have you got them by way of answer goldfarb opened the battered polish army pack that had come from an exile in england no one had paid any attention to it since hed landed here close to half the people on the road wore one like it and a lot of those who didnt had corresponding german or russian gear instead leon looked inside his long exhalation puffed out his mustache they dont look like much he said dubiously theyre bloody hell to load but theyll do the job if i cant get close enough to use them ive practiced with them believe me they will goldfarb said and whats all this mess leon pointed into the pack which held along with the bombs hed already disparaged a motley assortment of metal tubes levers and a spring that might have come from the suspension of a lorry the mechanism for shooting them goldfarb answered they built one in sections especially for me lucky chap that i am so the business end wouldnt keep sticking out the top of my pack the whole bloody thing together is called a piatprojector infantry antitank the last four words were necessarily in english leon luckily understood tank he shook his head anyhow no tankshe said panzersat the jail thered better not be goldfarb said but a bomb that will make a hole in the side of a tank will make a big hole in the side of a building he got the impression that that was the first thing hed said which impressed leon even a little the man from the underground goldfarb suppressed a picture of leon coming up from a london tube station plucked at his beard maybe you have something there how far will it shoot a couple of hundred yardsuh meters watch that goldfarb told himself you can give yourself away if you dont think metric should be far enough leons sardonic smile said hed caught the slip too do you want to look over the prison before you try cracking it id better im supposed to know what im doing before i do it right it helps yes leon studied him youve seen some action i think in the air yes not on the ground not like you mean on the ground ive just been strafed like everybody else yes i know about that too leon said but even in the airthatll do you wont panic when things start going crazy why dont you leave your hardware here we dont want to bring it around to the prison till its time to use it makes sense to me as long as youre sure nobodys going to steal it while were gone leon showed teeth in something that was not a smile anyone who steals from us hes very sorry and he never ever does it again this happens once or twice and people start to get the idea that probably meant just what goldfarb thought it did he didnt want to know for sure goldfarb left the pack on the floor and walked out of the flat after leon franciszkanska street was about ten minutes away again crowds and sights and smells buffeted goldfarb again he reminded himself that this was how things were long after the nazis had been driven away he stuck to leon like a pair of socks even though hed memorized the local map he didnt want to do much navigating on his own leon presently remarked well just walk by casual as you please nobody will think anything about us looking as long as we dont stop and stare the first rule is not to make yourself conspicuous goldfarb looked turning his head as if to carry on a conversation with leon at first glance the prison was a tough nut to crack two machine guns on the roof barred windows razor wire around the perimeter at second glance he said quietly its too close to everything else and it doesnt have enough guards they didnt send a blind man over leon said beaming right both times that gives us our chance and what do we do to take it goldfarb asked as they left prison one behind for now you dont do anything leon said you sit tight and wait for the right time me i have to go see some people and find out what i need to do to incite myself a riot bobby fiore paced along a dirt track somewhere in china his comrades said they werent far from shanghai that meant little to him because he couldnt have put shanghai on the map to keep himself out of the electric chair his guess was that it wasnt too far from the ocean the air had the vaguely salty tang hed known when he played in places like washington state and louisiana anyhow the weight of the pistol on his hip was comforting like an old friend his baggy tunic hid the little gun hed acquired a new straw hat if you ignored his nose and the five oclock shadow on his cheeks he made a pretty fair imitation peasant he still didnt know what to make of the rest of the band some of the men who trudged along in the loose column were chinese reds like lo and the rest of the gang who had gotten him into this mess in the first place they too looked like peasants which was fair enough because he gathered most of them were but the others he glanced over at the fellow nearest him who carried a rifle and wore a ragged khaki uniform hey yosh he called and mimed pivoting at second base to turn a double play yoshi fukuoka grinned exposing a couple of gold teeth he dropped the rifle and went into a first basemans stretch scissoring himself into a split and reaching out with an imaginary mitt to snag the equally imaginary ball out he yelled the word perfectly comprehensible to fiore who lifted a clenched fist in the air thumb pointing up the reds looked from one of them to the other they didnt get it to them fukuoka was an eastern devil and fiore a foreign devil and the only reason they were tagging along with the japs was that they all hated the lizards worse than they hated each other fiore hadnt even counted on that much when he stumbled into the japanese campand when he figured out the soldiers there were japs and not chinamen which took him a whilehe wished he could find himself a priest for last rites because roasting over a slow fire was the best hed expected from them theyd bombed pearl harbor theyd butchered liu hans husbandwhat was he supposed to expect the japs had taken a little while to figure out he was an american too their chinesethe only language they had in common with himwas almost as bad as his and a goodsized honker and round eyes had counted for less at first than his outfit when they did realize what he was theyd seemed more alarmed than hostile doolittle fukuoka had asked flying bombers over the ground with his hand even though he thought hed get killed in the next couple of minutes that had sent bobby into laughter which looking back on it was probably close to hysterical he knew a lot of the men from jimmy doolittles raid on tokyo had landed in china but getting mistaken for one by a jittery jap was too much i aint no bomber pilot hed said in english im just a second baseman and a lousy one to boot he hadnt expected that to mean a thing to his interrogator but the japs eyes had widened as much as they could second base hed echoed pointing at fiore beisoboru when fiore still didnt get it fukuoka had gone into an unmistakable hitting stance the light went on in fiores head baseball he yelled son of a bitch i dont believe it you play ball too it hadnt been enough for him to win friends and influence people right off but it had kept him from getting shot or bayoneted or suffering any of the other interesting things that could have happened to him his questioning stayed questions not torture when haltingly he explained how hed been part of the attack on the prison camp guard station that got him promoted from prisoner to fellow fighter you want killone of the japs had said a word in his own language when he saw fiore didnt get it hed amended it to little scaly devils yeah bobby had said savagely the japanese might not have known english but they understood that just fine and so hed started marching with them that still drove him crazy they were the enemy theyd kicked the usa in the balls at pearl harbor jumped on the philippines and singapore and burma and eight zillion little islands god knows where in the pacific and here he was eating rice out of the same bowl with them it felt like treason he had uneasy visions of standing trial for treason if he ever got back to the states but the japs hated lizards more than they hated americans and hed discovered he hated lizards worse than he hated japs hed stayed the reds had joined the band a couple of days after he did they and the japs hadnt seemed to have any trouble getting along that puzzled bobbytheyd been shooting at each other right up to the day the lizards came and probably for a while afterwards too the leader of the red detachment was a man of about his own age named nieh hoting fiore spent more time talking with the chinese than he did with any of the japs except pukuoka the ballplayer he had more words in common with them when he asked why they didnt have any trouble making common cause with their recent foes nieh had looked at him as if he were a moron and replied the enemy of my enemy is a friend it seemed as simple as that to the japs too they were looking for fighters they knew the reds could fight and that was all she wrote if they thought about anything else they sure didnt show it shanghai was in lizard hands the closer the band got to it the more bobby began to jitter what do we do if we see a lizard tank he demanded of nieh the chinese officer shrugged which infuriated fiore run he answered placidly if we cannot run we fight if we must we die we hope to hurt the enemy as they kill us thanks a hell of a lot fiore muttered in english he had no doubt nieh hoting meant just what he said too he had had that doordie look fiore had sometimes seen in the eyes of starting pitchers before a big game it hadnt always meant victory but it generally did mean a hell of an effort the japs had that look too in his dreadful chinese fukuoka told stories about pilots whod flown their bombers right at landed lizard spaceships accepting the loss of their own lives as long as they could hurt the foe too fiore shivered martyrs were all very well in church but disconcerting when encountered in real life he couldnt decide whether they were insanely brave not just plain insane they came to a road sign that said shanghai km along with its incomprehensible chinese chicken scratches at last the band split into little groups of men to make their advance less obvious bobby fiore didnt know much about shanghai or care he felt like a man whod just got out of jail in essence he was a man whod just got out of jail after a year or so trapped first in cairo illinois then on the lizard spaceship and then in the chinese prison camp just being on his own and moving from place to place again felt wonderful hed been a nomad for fifteen years riding trains and buses across the united states from one rickety minorleague park one middlesized town to the next every april to september hed done his share of winter barnstorming too he wasnt used to being cooped up in one place for weeks and months at a time he wondered how liu han was doing and hoped the lizards werent giving her too hard a time because hed gone grenadechucking with lo the red he shook his head she was a sweet gal no doubt about thatand he wondered what a kid who was half dago half chink would look like he rubbed his nose laughing a little he would have bet money the schnoz got passed on but no going back not unless he wanted to stick his head in the noose he wasnt a man to go back anyhow he looked ahead toward whatever came next the next series the next train ride the next broad liu han had been funshed been more than fun that much he admitted to himselfbut she was history and history somebody said was bunk peasants in their garden plots and rice paddies looked up when the armed band passed then went back to work theyd seen armed bands before chinese japanese lizards as long as nobody shot at them they worked in the end the armed bands couldnt do without them not unless the peopleand lizardswanted to quit eating up ahead on the road something stirred its approach was rapid purposeful mechanicalwhich meant it belonged to the lizards bobby fiore gulped seeing lizards coming reminded him he wasnt marching along from place to place here hed signed up to fight and the bill was about to come due the japs ahead started jumping off the road looking for cover that suddenly struck bobby as a real good idea he remembered the little streambed that had cut across the field outside the prison camp better an idea should strike him than whatever the lizards fired his way he got behind a big bush by the side of the road a moment later he wished hed gone into a ditch instead but by then it was too late to move he willed a thought at the japs dont start shooting attack right now would be suicidalrifles against armor just didnt work through the thick leafy branches of the bush he couldnt see just what kind ofarmor it was but the little band of fighters didnt have the tools to take on any kind closer and closer the lizard vehicles came moving with the near silence that characterized the breed bobby pulled out his pistol which all at once seemed a miserable little weapon indeed instead of squeezing the trigger he squeezed off a couple of hail marys somebody fired oh shit bobby said in the same reverent tone hed used a moment before to address the mother of god now he could tell what the fighters were up against not tanks but what he thought the us army called halftrackssoldierhaulers with machine guns of their own maybe a lizard had been dumb enough to ride with his head sticking out so a jap could try to blow it off fiore didnt think that showed the kind of brains which would have taken the jap very far on the question take a potshot at armor and the armor would chew you upwhich it proceeded to do the halftracks stopped and began hosing down the area with their automatic weapons the bush behind which bobby was hiding suffered herbicide as bullets amputated the top twothirds flat on his belly behind it fiore didnt get hit he had his pistol out and his surviving grenade alongside him but he couldnt make himself use the weapons that would only have brought more fire down on himand he wanted to live he had trouble understanding how anybody in combat ever fired at anybody else you could get killed like that the japanese soldiers didnt seem to worry about it they kept on blazing away at the lizards vehiclesthose of them who hadnt got killed in the curtain of lead the halftracks laid down anyway bobby had no idea how much damage the japs were doing but he was pretty damn sure it wouldnt be enough it wasnt along with keeping up the machinegun fire the halftracks lowered their rear doors a couple of squads of lizards skittered out their personal automatic weapons blazing they werent just going to hurt the people whod shot at them they were going to wipe em off the face of the earth oh shit fiore said again even more sincerely than he had before if the lizards caught him here with a pistol and a grenade he was dead no two ways about it he didnt want to be dead not even a little bit he shoved the evidence under the choppedoff part of the bush and rolled backwards till he fell with a splash into a rice paddy he crouched down there as low as he could huddling in the mud and doing his best to make like a farmer some of the real farmers were still in the kneedeep water one or two werent going to get out again red stains spread around their bodies others sensible chaps ran for their lives the japs didnt run or fiore didnt see any who did they held their ground and fought till they were all dead the lizards superior firepower smashed them like a shoe coming down on a cockroach then the shooting tapered off fiore fervently hoped that meant the lizards would get back into their halftracks and go away instead some of them came prowling his way making sure they hadnt missed anybody one of them pointed his rifle right at bobby fiore who you he demanded in lousy chinese he was standing no more than a foot and a half from the weapons bobby had stashed bobby was dreadfully aware he hadnt stashed them all that well either the lizard repeated who you name is uh nieh hoting fiore said stealing a handle from the red officer just farmer like rice he pointed to the plants peeping out of the water all around him hoping the lizard wouldnt notice how bad his own chinese was he might not have fooled another human being with his accent his nose his eyes and the stubble on his cheeks but the lizard wasnt trained to pick up the differences between one flavor of big uglies and the next he just hissed something in his own language then switched back to chinese you know these bad shooters no fiore said half bowed so he looked down into the murky water and didnt show much of his face they eastern devils i think me good chinese man the lizard hissed again then went off to ask questions of somebody else bobby fiore didnt move until all the males got back into the halftracks and rolled away jesus he said when they were gone i lived through it he scrambled up out of the rice paddy and reclaimed the weapons hed stashed hed started to feel naked without a pistol even if it wasnt any good against armorand having a grenade around made you warm and comfortable too he wasnt the only one scuttling for guns either the japs were all communing with their ancestors but most of the chinese reds had played possum the same way he had now they came splashing from the paddies and grabbed their rifles and pistols and submachine guns they searched the corpses of the japanese too but added little to what they already had nieh hoting made a sour face as he walked over to fiore scaly devils are good soldiers he said disappointedly they dont leave guns around for just anybody to pick up too bad yeah too bad fiore echoed water dripped from his pants and formed little puddles and streams by his feet whenever he moved the wet cotton made shlupshlup noises right out of an animated cartoon nieh nodded to him you did well unlike these imperialistshe pointed to a couple of dead japs not far awayyou understand that in guerrilla war the fighter is but one fish in a vast school of peasants when danger too great to oppose confronts him he disappears into the school he does not call attention to himself fiore didnt understand all of that but he got the gist look like farmer they not shoot me he said thats what i was talking about nieh answered impatiently bobby fiore gave an absentminded emphatic cough to show he understood nieh had started to go off his soaked pants went shlupshlup too he spun back around spraying small drops of water as he did so you speak the language of the little scaly devils he demanded a bit bobby held his hand close together to show how small a bit it was speak more chinese and if that wouldnt make my mama fall over in a faint what would he thought and then shes gonna have a halfchinese grandkid eveniif she doesnt know it that oughta do the job nieh hoting didnt care about grandkids you speak some though he persisted and you understand more than you speak yeah i guess so fiore said in english feeling himself flush he did his best to turn it into chinese nieh noddedhe got the idea he patted bobby on the back oh yes we will gladly take you to shanghai you will be very useful there we do not have many who can follow what the little devils say good bobby answered smiling to show how happy he was and he was happy toothe reds could just as easily have shot him and left him here by the side of the road to make sure he didnt make a nuisance of himself later on but since he made a good tool theyd keep him around and use him just like lo nieh hoting hadnt asked how he felt about any of that he had the feeling the reds werent good at askingthey just took he started to laugh nieh gave him a curious look he waved the red away it wasnt a joke he knew how to translate into chinese but of all the things hed never expected getting shanghaied to shanghai was right up at the top of the list exalted fleetlord here is a report that will please you the shiplord kirel said as he summoned a new document onto the screen atvar read intently for a little while then stopped and stared at kirel major release of radioactivity in deutschland he said this is supposed to please me it means the big uglies there are a short step away from a nuclear bomb but they do not know how to take that next step kirel replied if you please exalted fleetlord examine the analysis atvar did as his subordinate asked as he read his mouth fell open in a great chortle of glee idiots fools maniacs they achieved a self sustaining pile without proper damping from the radiation that has beenis beingreleased they seem to have done just that kirel answered also gleefully and its melted down on them and contaminated the whole area and with any luck at all killed off a whole great slew of their best scientists if these are their best atvars hiss was full of amazement theyve done almost as much damage to themselves as we did to them when we dropped the nuclear bomb on berlin no doubt you are right exalted fleetlord kirel said one of the main characteristics of the tosevites is their tendency to leap headlong into any new technology which comes within their capabilities where we would study consequences first they simply charge ahead because of that no doubt they went in the flick of an eye turret from spearflinging savages to industrialized savages atvar put in exactly so kirel agreed this time though in leaping they fell and smashed their snouts not all ventures into new technology come without risks something went right atvar said happily ever since we came to tosev weve been nibbled to pieces here two killercraft lost in one place five landcruisers in another deceitful diplomacy from the big uglies the allies weve made among them who betrayed us that male in poland who embarrassed us by recanting his friendship is back in our claws kirel said so he is id forgotten that atvar said well have to determine the most expedient means of punishing him too find some way to remind the tosevites who have joined us that they would do well to remember who gives them their meat no hurry there he is not going anyplace save by our leave no indeed exalted fleetlord kirel said we also need to consider the effect of stepping up our pressure on deutschland in light of their failure with the atomic pile we may find them discouraged and demoralized computer models suggest as much at any rate let me see atvar punched up detail maps of the northwestern section of tosev s main continental mass he hissed as he checked them the guerrillas in italia give us as much trouble as armies elsewhere and though the local king and his males loudly swear they are loyal to us they do cooperate with the rebels our drives in eastern france have bogged down againnot surprising when half the local landcruiser crews cared more about tasting ginger than fighting were still reorganizing there but from the eastsomething might be done i have taken the liberty of analyzing the forces we have available as well as those with which the deutsche could oppose us kirel said i believe we are in a position to make significant gains there and perhaps if all goes well to come close to knocking the deutsche out of the fight against us that would be excellent atvar said forcing them into submission would improve our logistics against both britain and the sssrand they are dangerous in their own right their missiles their jet planes their new landcruisers are all variables i would like to see removed from the equation they are dangerous in more ways than that exalted fleetlord kirel said quietly more even than the emperorslayers in the sssr they have industrialized murder eliminating them might also eliminate that idea from the planet atvar remembered the images and reports from the camp called treblinka and from the bigger one just going into operation when the race overran it called auschwitz the race had never invented any places like those neither had the hallessi or the rabotevs so many things about tosev were unique that was one piece of uniqueness he wished to the tip of his tailstump that the big uglies had not come up with he said when we are through here the tosevites will not be able to do that to one another and we will have no need to do it to them for they will be our subjects in obedience to the will of the emperor this shall be done along with atvar kirel cast down his eyes so it shall i hope two things exalted fleetlord that the other big uglies working toward nuclear weapons make the same error as the deutsche and that the disaster permanently ended the deutsch nuclear program given their viciousness i would not want to see them of all tosevites armed with atomic bombs nor i atvar said xiv heinrich jager gave his interrogator a dirty look i have told you over and over major i dont know one damned thing about nuclear physics and i wasnt within a good many kilometers of haigerloch when whatever happened there happened how you expect to get any information out of me under those circumstances is a mystery the gestapo man said what happened at haigerloch is a mystery colonel jager we are interviewing everyone at all involved with that project in an effort to learn what went wrong and you will not deny that you were involved he pointed to the german cross in gold that jager wore jager had donned the garishly ugly medal when he was summoned to berchtesgaden to remind people like this needle nosed snoop that the fuhrer had given it to him with his own hands anyone who dared think him a traitor had better think again now he wished hed left the miserable thing in its case he said i could better serve the reich if i were returned to my combat unit professor heisenberg was of the same opinion and endorsed my application for transfer from haigerloch months before this incident professor heisenberg is dead the gestapo man said in a flat voice jager winced nobody had told him that before seeing the wince the man on the safe side of the desk nodded you begin to understand the magnitude of theproblem now perhaps perhaps i do jager answered unless he missed his guess the interrogator had been on the point of saying something like disaster but choked it back just in time the fellow had a point if heisenberg was dead the bomb program was a disaster if you do understand why are you not cooperating with us the gestapo man demanded the brief sympathy jager had felt for him melted away like a panzer battalion under heavy russian attack in the middle of winter do you speak german he demanded i dont know anything how am i supposed to tell you something i dont know the secret policeman took that in stride jager wondered what sort of interrogations hed carried out how many desperate denials truer and untrue hed heard in a way innocence might have been worse than guilt if you were guilty at least you had something to reveal at last to make things stop if you were innocent theyd just keep coming after you because he was a wehrmacht colonel with his share and more of tin plate on his chest jager didnt face the full battery of techniques the gestapo might have lavished on a soviet officer say or a jew he had some notion of what those techniques were and counted himself lucky not to make their intimate acquaintance very well colonel jager the gestapo major said with a sigh maybe he regretted not being able to use such forceful persuasion on someone from his own side or maybe he just didnt think he was as good an interrogator without it you may go although you are not yet dismissed back to your unit we may have more questions for you as we make progress on other related investigations thank you so much jager rose from his chair he feared irony was lost on the gestapo man who looked to prefer the bludgeon to the rapier but made the effort nonetheless the bludgeon is for russians he thought waiting in the antechamber to the interrogation roomas if the gestapo man inside were a dentist rather than a thugsat professor kurt diebner leafing through a signals old enough to show only germanys human foes he nodded to jager so they have vacuumed you up too colonel so they have he looked curiously at diebner i would not have expected you he paused unable to think of a tactful way to go on the physicist didnt bother with tact to be among the living only the luck of the draw which does make a man thoughtful heisenberg chose to take the pile over critical when i was away visiting my sister maybe not all luck after allhe might not have wanted me around to share in his moment of fame jager suspected diebner was right heisenberg had shown nothing but scorn for him at haigerloch though to the panzer colonels admittedly limited perspective diebner was accomplishing as much as anyone else and more than most people jager said the lizards must have ways to keep things from going wrong when they make explosive metal diebner ran a hand through his thinning slickedback hair they have also been doing it rather longer than we have colonel haste was our undoing you know the phrase festina lente make haste slowly in his gymnasium days jager had done his share of latin just so its generally good advice but not advice we can afford at this stage of the war we must have those bombs to fight the lizards the hope was that if the reaction got out of hand throwing a lump of cadmium metal into the heavy water of the pile would bring it back under control this evidently proved too optimistic and also if i remember the engineering drawings correctly there was no plug to drain the heavy water out of the pile and so shut down the reaction that way most unfortunate especially to everyone who was working on the pile at the time jager said if you know all this dr diebner and youve told it to the authorities why are they still questioning everyone else too first i suppose to confirm what i sayand i do not know everything that led up to the disaster because i was out of town and also more likely than not to find someone on whom to lay the blame that made sense to jager after all hed been trying to escape being that someone the wehrmacht played games with assigning responsibility for maneuvers that didnt work too another old saying crossed his mind victory has a hundred fathers but defeat is an orphan that wasnt true any more these days the powers that be launched a paternity suit to pin a failure on somebody the results werent always just but he suspected they werent supposed to be the gestapo major came out probably to find out why diebner hadnt gone in he scowled to discover two of his subjects talking with each other jager felt guilty then angry at the secret policeman for intimidating him he stomped out of the waiting roomand almost bumped into a big man who was just coming in skorzeny he exclaimed so they dragged you into the net too did they the scarfaced ss colonel said theyre going to rake me over the coals even though as far as i know ive never been within a hundred kilometers of the little pissant town where the screwup happened some majors supposed to grill me in five minutes hes running late jager said he just got done with me and started in on one of the physicists want to go someplace and drink some schnapps nothing much else to do around here skorzeny slapped him on the back first good idea ive heard since they hauled me back here by god lets goeven if the schnapps theyre making these days tastes like its cooked from potato peelings itll put fire in your belly and i was hoping id run into you as a matter of fact im working on a scheme where you just might fit in very nicely really jager raised an eyebrow how generous of the ss to look kindly on a poor but honest wehrmacht man oh can the shit skorzeny said you happen to know things that would be useful to me now lets go get those drinks you were talking about after i ply you with liquor ill try seducing you he leered at jager ahh you only want me for my body the panzer man said no its your mind i crave skorzeny insisted laughing the two men found a tavern down the street from gestapo headquarters the fellow behind the bar wore uniform as did just about everyone in berchtesgaden these days even the whores here are all kitted out with fieldgray panties skorzeny grumbled as he and jager took a table in the dimly lit cave he raised his snifter in salute knocked back his schnapps and made a horrible face god thats vile jager also took a healthy nip it is isnt it but warmth did spread out from his belly its got the old antifreeze in it though no doubt about that he leaned forward before you jump on me im going to pick your brain what sort of goodies are they fishing out of that tank you stole i want to pretend im still a panzer man you see not a physicist or a bandit like you skorzeny chuckled flattery gets you nowhere but ill talkwhy the hell not half of it i dont understand half of it nobody understands which is part of the problem the lizards build machines that are smarter than the people we have trying to figure out what they do but therell be new ammunition coming down the line by and by and new armor toolayers of steel and ceramic bonded together the devils uncle only knows how you served on the russian front all right jager said new ammunition new armorthats not bad one day i may even get to use them probably not one day soon though eh skorzeny did not deny it jager sighed finished his shot went back to the bar for another round and returned to the table skorzeny pounced on the fresh drink like a tiger jager sat down then asked so what is this scheme you have that involves me ah that you were going to be an archaeologist before the first war sucked you into the army right youve been poking through my records jager said without much malice he drank more schnapps it didnt seem so bad nowmaybe the first shot had stunned his taste buds what the devil does archaeology have to do with the price of potatoes you know the lizards have italy skorzeny said theyre not as happy there as they used to be and the italians arent so happy with them either i had a little something to do with that getting mussolini out of the old castle where theyd tucked him away for safekeeping he looked smug hed earned the right too youre planning to go down there again and you want me along the panzer colonel asked id stick out like a sore thumbnot just my looks mind you but i dont speak much italian but skorzeny shook his massive head not italy the lizards are messing about on the eastern shore of the adriatic over in croatia i have trouble stomaching ante pavelic but hes an ally and we dont want the lizards getting a toehold over there you follow so far the strategy yes jager didnt say that he marveled at an ss mans having trouble stomaching anything word had trickled through the wehrmacht that the croat allies puppets whatever you wanted to call them took their fascismto say nothing of their blood feudsvery seriously indeed maybe skorzeny s admission was proof of that jager went on i still dont see what it has to do with me though skorzeny looked like a fisherman trying out a new lure suppose i were to tell youand i can because its truethe main lizard base in croatia is just outside split what would that mean to you diocletians palace jager answered without a moments hesitation i even visited there once on holiday eight or ten years ago hell of an impressive building even after better than sixteen hundred years i know you visited the report you wrote probably went into the operational planning for operation strafgericht strafgericht indeed we punished the yugoslavs properly for ducking out of their alliance with us but thats by the way what counts is that you know the area and not just from that visit but from study as well thats why i say you could be very useful to me youre not planning on blowing up the palace are you jager asked with sudden anxiety monuments suffered in wartime that couldnt be helped hed seen enough russian churches in flames during barbarossa but a russian church didnt carry the same weight for him as a roman emperors palace i will if i have to skorzeny said i understand what youre saying jager but if youre going to let that kind of attitude hold you back then ive made a mistake and youre the wrong fellow for the job i may be anyhow ive got a regiment waiting for me south of belfort remember youre a good panzer man jager but youre not a genius panzer man skorzeny said the regiment will do well enough under someone else for me though your special knowledge would truly come in handy do i tempt you or not jager rubbed his chin he had no doubt skorzeny could cut through the chain of command and get him reassigned hed pulled off enough coups for the brass to listen to him the question was did he want to go on fighting the same old war himself or try something new buy me another schnapps he said to skorzeny the ss colonel grinned you want me to get you drunk first so you can say you didnt know what i was doing when i had my way with you all right jager ill play he strode to the bar lieutenant general kurt chill turned a sardonic eye on his soviet opposite numbersor maybe george bagnall thought it was just the effect the torches that blazed in the pskov krom created but no the generals german was sardonic too i trust gentlemen we can create a united front for the defense of pleskau this would have been desirable before but cooperation has unfortunately proved limited the two russian partisan leaders nikolai vasiliev and aleksandr german stirred in their seats aleksandr german spoke yiddish as well as russian and so followed chills words well enough he said call our city by its proper name not the one you nazis hung on it cooperation ha you at least had that much courtesy before bagnall whose german was imperfect frowned as he tried to keep track of the jewish partisan leaders yiddish vasiliev had no yiddish or german he had to wait until an interpreter finished murmuring in his ear then he boomed da and followed it up with a spate of incomprehensible russian the interpreter performed his office brigadier vasiliev also rejects the use of the term united front it is properly applied to unions of progressive organizations not associations with reactionary causes beside bagnall jerome jones whistled under his breath he shaded that translation fascist jackals is really what vasiliev called the nazis why does this not surprise me bagnall whispered back if you want to know what i think that theyve come back to calling each other names instead of trying to kill each other is progress something to that jones said he started to add more but chill was speaking again if we do not join together now whatever the name of that union may be what we call this city will matter no more the lizards will give it their own name and how do we stop that as usual german got his comment in a beat ahead of vasiliev the russian partisan leader amplified what his comrade had said yes how do we dare put our men on the same firing line as yours without fearing theyll be shot in the back the same way i dare put wehrmacht men into line alongside yours chill said by remembering the enemy is worse as for being shot in the back how many red army units went into action with nkvd men behind them to make sure they were properly heroic not our partisans german said then he fell silent and vasiliev had nothing to add from which bagnall inferred general chill had scored a point chill folded his arms across his chest does either of you gentlemen propose to take overall command of the defenses of pleskauexcuse me pskov aleksandr german and vasiliev looked at each other neither seemed overjoyed at the prospect of doing as chill had suggested in their valenki bagnall wouldnt have been overjoyed either conducting hitandrun raids from the forest wasnt the same as fighting a standup campaign the partisans knew well how to make nuisances of themselves they also had to be uneasily aware that partisan warfare hadnt kept the germans from pskov or driven them out of it finally vasiliev said nyet he went on through his interpreter you are best suited to lead the defense provided you do it so that you are defending the town and the people and the soviet fighters in the area as well as your own nazis if i defend the area i defend all of it or as much as i can with the men and resources i have available chill answered this also means that if i give an order to one of your units i expect it to be obeyed certainly vasiliev answered so long as the units commander and political commissar judge the order to be in the best interest of the cause as a whole not just to the advantage of you germans that is not good enough chill replied coldly they must take the overall wellbeing as their governing assumption and obey whether they see the need or not one of the reasons for having an overall commander is to have a man in a position where he can see things his subordinates do not nyet vasiliev said again aleksandr german echoed him oh bugger here we go again bagnall whispered to jerome jones the radarman nodded bagnall went on weve got to do something before we go through another round of the idiocy that had the bolshies and nazis blazing away at each other a few weeks ago i dont know about you but i dont fancy getting stuck between them again nor i jones whispered back if thats what the groundpounders call war thank god for the raf is all i have to say you get no arguments from me bagnall said remember id already found that out you werent along for the raid on the lizard base south of here they thought you were too valuable to risk he thought without much rancor ken and poor dead alf and i we were expendable but not youyou know your radars too well as if thinking along similar lines jones answered i tried to come along the bloody russians wouldnt let me did you i didnt know that bagnalls opinion of jones went up a peg to volunteer to get shot at when you didnt have to took something special as most englishmen would jones brushed that aside it doesnt matter anyway we have to worry about now as you said he got up and said loudly tovarishchi even bagnal knew that oneit meant comrades jones went on in russian and then in german if we want to hand pskov to the lizards on a silver platter we can go on just as we are now yes and so kurt chill asked what is your solution shall we all place ourselves under your command his smile was hard and bright and sharp like a sharks jones turned pale and sat down in a hurry ive got a picture of that i do bloody generals kowtowing to a radarman not flipping likely why not bagnall got to his feet he had only german and not all he wanted of that but he gave it his best shot the red army doesnt trust the wehrmacht and the wehrmacht doesnt trust the red army but have we english done anything to make either side distrust us let general chill command if russian units dont like what he proposes let them complain to us if we think the orders are fair let them obey as if the commands came from stalin is that a fair arrangement silence followed save for the murmur of vasilievs interpreter as he translated bagnalls words after a few seconds chill said in general weakening command is a bad idea a commander needs all the authority over his troops he can get but in these special circumstances the englishmen would have to decide quickly aleksandr german said if they cannot make up their minds orders may become irrelevant before they give their answer that would be part of the packet bagnall agreed the englishmen would also have to remember that we are all allies together here against the lizards and that england is not specially aligned with the russians against the reich lieutenant general chill said decisions which fail to show this evenhandedness would make the arrangement unworkable in short orderand we would start shooting at each other again yes yes bagnall said impatiently if i didnt think we could do that i wouldnt have advanced the idea i might also say im not the only one in this room who has had trouble remembering we are all allies together and that plans should show us much chill glared at him but so did german and vasiliev jerome jones whispered you did well there not to single out either side this way each of them can pretend to be sure youre talking about the other chap downright byzantine of you in fact is that a compliment bagnall asked i meant it for one the radarman answered chill spoke to the russian partisan leaders is this agreeable to you gentlemen shall we let the englishmen arbitrate between us he rides that gentlemen hard jones murmured throws it right in the face of the comradesjust to irk em unless i miss my guess gentlemen dont fit into the dictatorship of the proletariat bagnall listened with but half an ear he was watching the two men whod headed the forest republic before the lizards arrived they didnt look happy as they muttered back and forth bagnall didnt care whether they were happy he just hoped they could live with the arrangement finally grudgingly nikolai vasiliev turned to general chill and spoke a single sentence of russian the translator turned it into german better the english than you on that if youreverse roles we agree completely chill said he turned to bagnall gave him an ironic bow congratulations you and your british colleagues have just become a threeman board of field marshals shall i order your batons and have a tailor sew red stripes to your trouser seams that wont be necessary bagnall said what i need is assurance from you and from your soviet counterparts that youll abide by whatever decisions we end up making without that we might as well not start down this road the german general gave him a long look then slowly nodded you do have some understanding of the difficulties with which you are involving yourself i wondered if this was so very well let it be as you say by my oath as a soldier and officer of the wehrmacht and the german reich i swear that i shall accept without question your decision on cases brought before you for arbitration what about you bagnall asked the two soviet brigadiers aleksandr german and vasiliev seemed imperfectly delighted once more but german said if in a dispute you rule against us we shall accept your decision as if it came from the great stalin himself this i swear da vasiliev added after the interpreter had translated for him stalin he spoke the soviet leaders name like a religious man invoking the deityor perhaps a powerful demon kurt chill said enjoy the responsibility my english friends he sent bagnall and jones a stiffarmed salute then strode out of the meeting chamber in the krom bagnall felt the responsibility too as if the air had suddenly turned hard and heavy above his shoulders he said ken wont be pleased with us for getting him into this when he wasnt even at the meeting thats what he gets for not coming jones replied mmmaybe so bagnall looked sidelong at the radarman do you suppose the germans will want you to give up the fair tatiana so as to have no reason to be biased toward the soviet side theyd better not jones said or ill bloody well have reason to be biased against them the one good thing in this whole pestilential townif anyone tries separating me from her hell have a row on his hands that i tell you what bagnall raised an eyebrow youre not enamored of spring in pskov you spoke so glowingly of it i recall when we were flying here in the lanc bugger spring in pskov too jones retorted and stomped off in fact spring in pskov was pretty enough the velikaya river icefree at last boomed over the rapids as it neared lake pskov gray boulders tinted with pink stood out on steep hillsides against the dark green of the allsurrounding woods grass grew tall on the streets of deserted villages around the city the sky was a deep luminous blue with only a few puffy little white clouds slowly drifting across it from west to east along with those clouds bagnall saw three parallel lines of white as straight as if drawn with a ruler condensation trails from lizard jets he thought and his delight in the beauty of the day vanished the lizards might not be moving yet but they were watching mordechai anielewicz looked up from the beet field at the sound of jet engines off to the north he saw three small silvery darts heading west theyll be landing at warsaw he thought with the automatic accuracy of one whod been spotting lizard planes for as long as there had been lizard planes to spotand german planes before that wonder what theyve been up to whoever headed the jewish fighters these days would have someone at the airport fluent enough at the lizards speech to answer that for him so would general borkomorowski of the polish home army anielewicz missed getting information like that being connected to a wider world he hadnt realized his horizons would contract so dramatically when he left warsaw for leczna contract they had the town had had several radios but without electricity what good were they polands big cities had electricity but nobodyd bothered repairing the lines out to all the country towns leczna probably hadnt had electricity at all until after the first world war now that it was gone again people just did without anielewicz went back to work he pulled out a weed made sure he had the whole root then moved ahead about half a meter and did it again an odd task he thought mindless and exacting at the same time you wondered where the hours had gone when you knocked off at the end of the day a couple of rows over a pole looked up from his weeding and said hey you jew what does the creature that says hes governor of warsaw call himself again the fellow spoke quite without malice using anielewiczs religion to identify him not particularly to scorn him that he might feel scorned anyhow never entered the poles mind because he knew that anielewicz didnt feel scorned or at least not badly zolraag he answered carefully pronouncing the two distinct a sounds zolraag the pole echoed less clearly he took off his cap scratched his head is he as little as all the others like him it hardly seems natural all the males ive ever seen are about the same size mordechai answered the pole scratched his head again anielewicz had worked with the lizards almost every day he knew them as well as any man could here in leczna lizards were hardly more than a rumor the locals might have seen them when they ran the nazis out of town or when they went to lublin to buy and sell other than that the aliens were a mystery here they are as nasty as people say the pole asked how was he supposed to answer that slowly he said they arent as vicious as the germans and they arent as smart eitheror maybe its just that they dont understand people any better than we understand them and that makes them seem dumber than they are but they can do more with machines than the germans ever dreamed of and that makes them dangerous youreason like a priest the farmworker said it wasnt quite a compliment for he went on ask a simple question and you get back well sort of this but sort of that too because of these things and on the other hand he snorted i just wanted a yes or a no but some questions dont have simple yesorno answers anielewicz said though hed been a secular man his ancestry had generations of talmudic scholars in itand just being a jew was plenty to teach you things were rarely as simple as they looked at first glance the pole didnt believe that anielewicz could see as much the fellow took a flask of vodka off his hip swigged and offered it to anielewicz mordechai took a nip vodka helped you get through the day after a while the pole said so what did you do to get yourself run out of warsaw and show up in a little town like this i shot the last man who asked me a question like that anielewicz replied deadpan the farmworker stared at him then let out a hoarse guffaw oh youre a funny one you are we got to watch you every minute hey he leered at mordechai some of the girls are watching you already you know that anielewicz grunted he did know that he didnt quite know what to do about it as leader of the jewish fighters he hadnt had time for women and they might have endangered security now he was just an exile his training in underground work insisted he still ought to hold himself aloof but he was a man in his midtwenties and emphatically not a monk grinning the pole said you go out to the backhouses at night you have to be careful not to look toward the haystacks or under the wagons never can tell when youre liable to see something youre not supposed to is that a fact mordechai said though he knew it was the poles were not only less straitlaced than the jews who lived among them they also used vodka or brandy to give themselves an excuse for acting that way anielewicz added i dont see how anyone is up to doing anything except sleep after a day in the fields you think this is work wait till harvest comes the pole said which made anielewicz groan the local laughed then went on more soberly all the oldtimers the ones left alive theyre sneering at us on account of were having to make do without tractors and such so i shouldnt give you a hard time friend you pull your weight and every pair of hands we can find is welcome we want to keep ourselves fed through winter we better work now he stooped tore out a weed moved ahead he probably didnt care what happened two kilometers outside leczna but hed put his finger on a worldwide truth there with so much farm machinery out of commission or out of fuel people everywhere were having to do all they could just to stay alive that meant they were able to do less to fight the lizards too anielewicz wondered if the aliens had planned it that way maybe not some of the things zolraag had said suggested they hadnt expected people to have machines let alone readapt to doing without them but if the lizards reduced all of mankind to nothing more than peasants grubbing a bare living from the soil would people ever be able to get free of them he shook his head like a horse bedeviled by gnats he couldnt see it then rational thought went away for a while as the ancient rhythm of the fields took over the next time he looked up from the furrows the sun hung low in the west sinking into the mist that rose from the flat moist land as it cooled with approaching evening where does the time go he said startled hed spoken more to himself than to anyone else but the polish farmworker was still close enough to hear him the pole laughed loud and long got away from you did it that happens sometimes you wonder what the devil youve been doing all day till you look back and see what youve done mordechai looked back sure enough hed done a lot he was an educated man a city man no matter how necessary farmwork was hed been sure it would drive him mad with boredom he didnt know whether to be relieved or alarmed that that hadnt happened relief seemed natural but if someone like him could sink down to the level of a farmer with no thought past his fields what did that say about the rest of humanity if the lizards pressed the yoke of serfdom down on their necks would they wear it he shook his head again if he was going to start thinking he would have preferred to start with something more cheerful the mist rose the sun sank until he could stare straight at its bloodred disk without hurting his eyes the pole said hell with it were not going to get any more done today lets go back to town all right by me anielewiczs back protested when he stood up straight if aches bothered the pole he didnt show it hed worked on a farm all his life not just for a couple of weeks leczna was an ordinary polish town bigger than a village not nearly big enough to be called a city it was small enough for people to know one another and for mordechai to stand out as a stranger people still greeted him in a friendly enough way jews and poles alike the two groups seemed to get on pretty wellbetter than in most places in poland anyhow maybe the friendly greetings came because he was staying with the ussishkins judah ussishkin had been doctoring jews and gentiles alike for more than thirty years his wife sarah a midwife herself must have delivered half the population of the town if the ussishkins vouched for you you were good as gold in leczna most of the jews lived in the southeastern part of town as was fitting for one who worked with both halves of the populace dr ussishkin had his house at the edge of the jewish district his nextdoor neighbors on one side in fact were poles roman klopotowski waved to anielewicz as he came down the street toward the doctors house so did klopotowskis daughter zofia mordechai waved back which made zofias face light up she was a pretty blond girlno woman she had to be past twenty anielewicz wondered why she hadnt married whatever the reason shed plainly set her sights on him he didnt know what to do about that he knew what he wanted to do but wasnt nearly so sure it was a good idea for the moment he did nothing but walk up the steps onto the front porch of dr ussishkins house and after wiping his feet on into the parlor good evening my guest judah ussishkin said with a dip of his head that was almost a bow he was a broadshouldered man of about sixty with a curly gray beard sharp dark eyes behind steelrimmed spectacles and an oldfashioned courtliness that brought with it a whiff of the vanished days of the russian empire good evening mordechai answered nodding in return hed grown up in a more hurried age and could not match the doctors manners he might even have resented them had they not been so obviously genuine rather than affectation how was your day well enough thank you for asking although it would have been better still had i had more medicines with which to work we would all be better off if we had more of everything mordechai said the doctor raised a forefinger there i must disagree with you my young friend of troubles we have more than a sufficiency anielewicz laughed ruefully and nodded yielding the point sarah ussishkin came out of the kitchen and interrupted of potatoes we also have a sufficiency at least for now potato soup is waiting whenever you tzaddiks decide youd rather eat than philosophize her smile belied the scolding tone in her voice shed probably been a beauty when she was young she remained a handsome woman despite gray hair the beginning of a stoop and a face that had seen too many sorrows and not enough joys she moved with a dancers grace making her long black skirt swirl about her at every step the potato soup steamed in its pot and in three bowls on the table by the stove judah ussishkin murmured a blessing before he picked up his spoon out of politeness to him anielewicz waited till he was done though hed lost that habit and his stomach was growling like an angry wolf the soup was thick not only with grated potatoes but also with chopped onion chicken fat added rich flavor and sat in little golden globules on the surface of the soup mordechai pointed to them i always used to call those eyes when i was a little boy did you sarah laughed how funny our aaron and benjamin said just the same thing the laughter did not last long one of the ussishkins sons had been a young rabbi in warsaw the other a student there no word had come from them since the lizards drove out the nazis and the closed ghetto ended the odds were mournfully good that meant they were both dead mordechais soup bowl emptied with amazing speed sarah ussishkin filled it again and he emptied it the second time almost as fast as the first you have a healthy appetite judah said approvingly if a man works like a horse he needs to eat like a horse too anielewicz replied the germans hadnt cared about that theyd worked the jews like elephants and fed them like ants but the work theyd got out of the jews was just a sidelight theyd been more interested in getting rid of them supper was just ending when someone pounded on the front door sarah come quick a frightened male voice bawled in yiddish hannahs pains are close together sarah ussishkin made a wry face as she got up from her chair it could be worse i suppose she said that usually happens in the middle of a meal the pounding and shouting went on she raised her voice leave us our door in one piece isaac im coming the racket stopped sarah turned to her husband for a moment ill probably see you tomorrow sometime very likely he agreed god forbid you should have to call me sooner for that could only mean something badly wrong i have chloroform a little but when it is gone it is gone forever this is hannahs third sarah said reassuringly the first two were so simple i could have stayed here for them isaac started banging on the door again im coming she told him again this time following words with action shes right about that judah told anielewicz after his wife had gone hannah has hips like having caught himself about to be ungallant he shook his head in selfreproach as if to make amends he changed the subject would you care for a game of chess why not youll teach me something before the war anielewicz had fancied himself as a chess player but either his game had gone to pot after close to four years of neglect or judah ussishkin could have played in tournaments because hed managed only one draw and no wins in half a dozen or so games against the doctor tonight proved no exception down a knight his castled kings position not well enough protected to withstand the attack he saw coming mordechai tipped the king over signifying surrender you might have gotten out of that ussishkin said not against you mordechai answered i know better do you want to try another game i can do better than that your turn for white judah said as they rearranged the pieces on the board he added not everyone would keep coming back after a string of losses im learning from you anielewicz said and maybe my game is coming back a little when im playing as well as i can i might be able to put you to some trouble anyhow he pushed his queens pawn to open they were in the middle of a hardfought game with no great advantage for either sidemordechai was proud of avoiding a trap a few moves beforewhen more pounding on the door made them both jump isaac shouted doctor sarah wants you to come right away she says oy judah said cultivated manner for once forgotten he pushed back his chair and stood up the game will have to keep im afraid he moved a pawn think about that while im gone he snatched up his bag and hurried out to the anxious isaac anielewicz studied the board the pawn move didnt look particularly menacing maybe judah was trying to make him think too much or maybe he really was missing something he looked at the board again shrugged and started to get ready to go to sleep he hadnt even pulled his shirt off over his head when the thrum of aircraft engines overhead made him freeze they were humanmade planes hed heard and hated that heavy drone for most of a month on end in when the luftwaffe systematically pounded a warsaw that could hardly defend itself these aircraft though were coming out of the east red air force anielewicz wondered the russians had flown occasional bombing raids after hitler invaded them or are the nazis still in business over there too he knew german ground forces had kept fighting inside the soviet union even after the lizards came was the luftwaffe still a going concern too he went outside if the bombers unloaded on leczna that was the worst place to be but he didnt think the little town was anybodys primary targetand it had been a while since humans tried an air raid on lizardheld territory several other people stood in the street too their heads craning this way and that as they tried to spot the planes cloud cover was thick there wasnt anything to see the pilots probably hoped the bad weather would help shield them then off to the south a streak of fire rose into the sky and another and another lizard rockets somebody close by said in polishzofia klopotowski the rockets vanished into the clouds a moment later an enormous explosion rattled windows a whole plane bombs and all anielewicz said sadly a streak of fire came out of the cloudsfalling not rising hes not going to make it zofia said her tone echoing mordechais sure enough the stricken bomber smashed into the ground a few kilometers south of leczna another peal of manmade thunder split the air the rest of the planes in the flight droned on toward their goal had anielewicz been up there and watched his comrades hacked from the sky he would have reversed course and run for home it might not have done him any good more missiles rose more aircraft blew up in midair or tumbled in ruins to the ground those that survived kept stubbornly heading west as the engines faded out of hearing most people headed for their homes a few lingered zofia said i wonder if i should be glad the lizards are shooting down the russians or germans or whoever was in those planes we live better now than we did under the reds or the nazis mordechai stared at her but theyre making slaves of us he exclaimed so were the reds and the nazis she replied and you jews were quick enough to hop in bed with the lizards when they pushed this way her choice of language made him cough but he said the nazis werent just making slaves of us they were killing us in carload lots we had nothing to loseand we didnt see at the start that the lizards wanted only servants not partners they want to do to the whole world what the germans and russians did to poland thats not right is it maybe not zofia said but if the lizards lose and the germans and russians come back here poland still wont be free and well all be worse off anielewicz thought about the revenge stalin or hitler would exact against people who had supportedthe dictators would say collaborated withthe lizards he shuddered still he answered but if the lizards win there wont be any free people at all left on earth not here not in england not in americaand theyll be able to do whatever they want with the whole world not just with one country zofia looked thoughtful or mordechai thought she didthe night was too dark for him to be sure she said thats true i have trouble worrying about anything outside leczna this is the only place ive ever known but you youve been lots of places and you can hold the world in your mind she sounded wistful or perhaps even jealous he wanted to laugh hed done some traveling in poland but hardly enough to make him a cosmopolitan in an important way though she was right books and school had taken his mind places his body had never gone and left him with a wider view of things than she had and having a pretty girl look up to him for whatever reason was a long way from the worst thing that had ever happened he glanced around and realized with some surprise that he and zofia were the last two people left on the street everyone else was snug inside and probably snug in bed too he waited for zofia to notice the lull in their talk say good night and go back to her fathers house when she didnt but kept standing quietly by him he reached out and quite in the spirit of experiment let his hand rest on her shoulder she didnt shrug him off she stepped closer so that his arm went around her i wondered how long that would take you she said with a small laugh miffed he almost said something sharp but luckily had a better idea he bent his face down to hers her lips were upturned and waiting for some time neither of them said anything then he whispered where can we go the doctor didnt take his car did he she whispered back ussishkin owned an ancient fiat one of the handful of automobiles in town she answered her own question no of course he didnt no one has any petrol these days so its right in back of his house if were quiet the fiats back door squeaked alarmingly when anielewicz opened it for zofia who let out an almost soundless giggle he slid in beside her they were cramped but managed to loosen and eventually pull off each others clothes all the same his hand strayed down from her breasts to her thighs and the warm moist softness between them she gripped him too when she did she paused a moment in surprise then giggled again deep down in her throat thats right she said as if reminding herself youre a jew its different he hadnt really thought he was her first but the remark jolted him a little just the same he made a wordless questioning noise my fiancehis name was czeslawwent to fight the germans she said he never came back oh im sorry he wished hed ignored her hoping he hadnt ruined the mood he kissed her again evidently he hadnt she sighed and lay back as well as she could on the narrow seat of the car he poised himself above her zofia he said as they joined she wrapped her arms around his back when he paid attention to anything but her again he saw the old fiats windows which ussishkin kept closed against pests had steamed up that made him laugh what is it zofia asked her voice came slightly muffled she was pulling her blouse back on over her head he explained she said well what would you expect he dressed too as fast as he could getting back into clothes in the backseat was even more awkward than escaping from them had been but he managed he opened the car door and slid out zofia right behind him they stood for a couple of seconds looking at each other as people do in such circumstances mordechai wondered where that first coupling would end up taking them he said youd better get back to your house your father will wonder where youve been actually he was afraid roman klopotowski might know where she d been but he didnt want to say that she stood on tiptoe so she could kiss him on the cheek thats for caring enough about me to worry what my father will think she said then she kissed him again openmouthed and thats for the rest he squeezed her if i werent so tired from working in the fields she burst out laughing so loud he twitched in alarm men are such braggarts its all right well find other times that meant hed pleased her he felt several centimeters taller i hope we do of course you hope we do men always hope that zofia said without much anger she laughed again i dont know why you jews go to so much trouble and hurt to make yourselves different once its in there its the same either way is it well i cant help that anielewicz said i am sorry about your czeslaw too many people poles and jews havent come back from the war i know she shook her head thats gods truth it certainly is its been a long timethree and a half years more im entitled to live my own life she spoke defiantly as if mordechai were going to disagree with her but he said of course you are and now you had better go home all right ill see you soon she hurried away anielewicz went back into the ussishkins house they came in a few minutes later tired but smiling judah said we got a good baby a boy and hannah i think will be all right too i didnt have to do a cesarean for which i thank godno real chance for asepsis here try as i will thats all good news anielewicz said it is indeed the doctor looked at him but what are you doing still awake youve been studying the chessboard unless i miss my guess i have noticed you dont like to lose however polite you may be so what are you going to do the chess game hadnt crossed mordechais mind once since the sound of airplane engines made him go outside now he walked back over to the board thanks to the pawn move ussishkin had crowed about he couldnt attack with his queen as hed planned he shifted the piece to a square farther back along the diagonal than hed intended fast as a striking snake judah ussishkin moved a knight it neatly forked the queen and one of mordechais rooks he stared in dismay here was another game he wasnt going to winand ussishkin was right he hated to lose all at once though it didnt seem to matter so much all right so hed lose at chess one more time hed played a different game tonight and won it leslie groves looked down the table at the scientists from the metallurgical laboratory the fate of the united statesand probably the worlddepends on your answer to this question how do we turn the theoretical physics of a working atomic pile into practical engineering we have to industrialize the process as fast as we can a certain amount of caution is indicated arthur compton said by what weve been told theyre paying in germany for rushing ahead with no thought for consequences that was an engineering flaw weve already uncovered wasnt it groves said a flaw you might say so enrico fermi made a fine latin gesture of contempt when their pile went critical they had no way to shut it down againand so the reaction continued out of control for all i know it continues still no one can get close enough to find out for certain it cost the germans many able men whatever we may think of them politically heisenberg someone said softly an almost invisible pall of gloom seemed to descend on the table many of the assembled physicists had known the dead german you couldnt be a nuclear physicist without knowing his work i am not about to let a foreign accident slow down our own program groves said especially when its an accident we wont have what were they doing throwing pieces of cadmium metal into the heavy water of their pile to try to slow it down weve designed better than that in this particular regard yes leo szilard said but who can say what other problems may be lurking in the metaphysical undergrowth groves gave the hungarian scientist an unfriendly look however brilliant he was he was always finding ways things could go wrong maybe he was so imaginative he saw flaws no one else would or maybe he just liked to borrow trouble whichever it was groves didnt intend to put up with it he growled if we never tried anything new we wouldnt have to worry about anything going wrong of course if wed had that attitude all along the lizards would have conquered us about twenty minutes after they landed here because wed all have been living in villages and sacrificing goats whenever we had a thunderstorm so we will go ahead and see what the problems are objections no one had any groves nodded satisfied the physicists were a bunch of prima donnas such as hed never had to deal with in the army but no matter how high in the clouds their heads were they had their hearts in the right place he said okay back to square one what do we have to do to turn our experimental pile here into a bomb factory get out of denver jens larssen muttered groves glowered at him hed had enough of larssens surly attitude then to his surprise he noticed several other physicists were nodding groves did his best to smooth out his features why he asked as mildly as he could larssen looked around maybe he didnt want the floor but hed opened his mouth and so he had it he reached into a shirt pocket as if digging for a pack of cigarettes not coming up with one he said why the most important reason is we dont have the water well need like any other energy source a nuclear pile also generates heat fermi amplified running water makes an effective coolant whether we can divert enough water here from other uses is an open question groves said how much are we going to need the mississippi the lizards are holding most of it these days im afraid hed intended that for sarcasm fermi didnt take it as such he said that being so the columbia is probably best for our purposes it is swiftflowing with a large volume of water and the lizards are not strong in the northwest you want this operation to move again after weve just gotten set up here groves demanded you want to pack everything up into wagons and haul it over the rockies what he wanted to do was start heaving nuclear physicists out the window nobel laureates first a move like the move we made from chicago no that would not be necessary fermi said we can keep this facility intact continue to use it for research but production as you call it would be better placed elsewhere heads bobbed up and down all along the table groves sighed hed been given the power to bind and loose on this project but hed expected to wield it against bureaucrats and soldiers he hadnt imagined the scientists he was supposed to ride herd on would complicate his life so he said if youre springing this on me now you probably have a site all picked out thats what he would have done anyhow but then he was a hardheaded engineer the ivorytower boys didnt always think the way he did this time though fermi nodded from what we can tell by longdistance research the town of hanford washington seems quite suitable but we shall have to send someone to take a look at this place to make certain it meets our needs larssen stuck his hand in the air ill go a couple of other men also volunteered groves pretended not to see them dr larssen i think i may take you up on that you have experience traveling through a war zone by yourself and he let the rest hang larssen didnt and itd be best for everybody if i got out of here for a while you were going to say now tell me one i hadnt heard he ran a hand through his shock of thick blond hair ive got a question for you will the lizard pows stay with the research end or go to the production site not my call groves turned to fermi professor i think perhaps they may be more useful to us here fermi said slowly thats kind of what i thought too larssen said okay now i know he didnt need to draw anybody a picture if the lizardsand sam yeager and barbara larssenturnedyeagerstayed here jens would likely end up at hanford far good assuming the place panned out that set off an alarm bell in groves mind we will need a scrupulously accurate report on hanfords suitability dr larssen youll get one jens promised i wont talk it up just so i can move there if thats what youre worried about okay groves thought for a minute then said we ought to send a gi with you too that would help make sure you got back here in one piece larssens eyes grew hard and cold you try sending anybody from the army with me general and i wont go the armys already done me enough bad turnsi dont need anymore ill be there all by my lonesome and ill get back too you dont like that put somebody else on the road groves glared larssen glared right back groves ran into the limits of his power to command if he told larssen to shut up and do as he was told the physicist was liable to go on strike again and end up in the brig instead of hanford and even if he did leave denver with a soldier tagging along what would his report be worth when he got back hed already proved he could survive on his own groves muttered under his breath sometimes you had to throw in your hand no help for it have it your way then he growled larssen looked disgustingly smug leo szilard stuck a forefinger in the air groves nodded his way glad of the chance to forget larssen for a moment szilard said building a pile is a large work of engineering how do we keep the lizards from spotting it and knocking it to pieces hanford now i would say as a statement of high probability has no such large works we have to make it look as if were building something else something innocuous groves said after a little thought just what i dont know we can work on that while dr larssen is traveling well involve the army corps of engineers too we wont need to depend on our own ingenuity if i were a lizard szilard said i would knock down any large building humans began on general principles the aliens must know we are trying to devise nuclear weapons groves shook his head again not in contradiction but in annoyance he had no doubt szilard was right if hed been a lizard himself hed have done the same thing hiding an atomic pile in the middle of a city isnt the worlds greatest idea either he said weve done it here because we had no choice and also because this was an experiment if something goes wrong with a big pile well have ourselves a mess just like the one the germans got how many people would it kill a good manyyou are right about that szilard said that is why we settled on the hanford site but we also do have to consider whether working out in the open would come to the enemys attention winning the war must come first before we go to work we must weigh the risks to city folk against those to the project as a whole from starting up a pile out in the open so to speak enrico fermi sighed leo you presented this view at the meeting where we decided what we would advise general groves the vote went against you nor was it close why do you bring up the matter now because whether in the end he accepts it or not he needs to be aware of it szilard answered behind glasses his eyes twinkled and to raise a little hell groves guessed he said well need dr larssens report on the area i suspect well also need to do some serious thinking about how well camouflage the pile if we do build there his smile challenged the eggheads since we have so many brilliant minds here im sure that will be no trouble at all a couple of innocents beamed perhaps their sarcasm detectors were out of commission for the duration a couple of people with short fusesjens larssen was oneglared at him several people looked thoughtful if he set them a problem theyd start working on it he approved of that attitude it was what he would have done himself gentlemen i think thats enough for today he said major okamoto seemed out of place in a laboratory teerts thought what the big uglies called a lab wasnt impressive to a male of the race the equipment was primitive and chaotically arranged and there wasnt a computer anywhere one of the nipponese who wore a white coat manipulated a curious device whose middle moved in and out as if it were a musical instrument superior sir what is that thing teerts asked okamoto pointing what thing okamoto looked as if he wanted to be interrogating not interpreting and answering questions oh that thats a slide rule its faster than calculating by hand slide rule teerts repeated to fix the term in his memory how does it work okamoto started to answer then turned and spoke in rapidfire nipponese to the big ugly who was wielding the curious artifact the scientist spoke directly to teerts it adds and subtracts logarithmsyou understand this word no superior sir teerts admitted explanations followed with considerable backing and filling eventually teerts got the idea it was he supposed clever in an archaic way how accurate is this slide rule he asked three significant figures the nipponese answered teerts was appalled the big uglies hoped to do serious scientific research and engineering with accuracy to only one part in a thousand that gave him a whole new reason to hope their effort to harness nuclear energy failed he didnt want to be anywhere close if it succeeded it was liable to succeed altogether too well and blow a big piece of tokyo into radioactive slag the nipponese added for finer calculations we go back to pen and paper but pen and paper are slow do you understand yes superior sir teerts revised his opinion of the big uglies abilitiesslightly because they had no electronic aids they did what they could to calculate more quickly if that meant they lost some accuracy they were willing to make the trade the race didnt work that way if they came to a place where they needed two different qualities and had to lose some of one to get some of the other they generally waited instead until in the slow passage of time their arts improved to the point where the trade was no longer necessary because of that slow careful evolution the races technology was extremely reliable what the big uglies called technology was anything but not only didnt they seem to believe in failsafes he sometimes wondered if they believed in safety at all much of tokyo which was not a small city even by the standards of the race looked to be built from wood and paper he marveled that it hadnt burnt down a hundred times traffic was even more horrifying than it had been in harbin and if a vehicle ran into another one or over a male who was also using the street too bad along with inaccuracy the big uglies accepted a lot of carnage as the price they had to pay for getting things done that thought put teerts in mind of something he thought hed heard a couple of the nipponese scientists discussing he turned to major okamoto excuse me superior sir may i ask another question ask okamoto said with the air of an important male granting a most unimportant underling a boon beyond his station despite so many differences between them in some ways the race and big uglies werent that far apart thank you for your generosity superior sir teerts played the inferior role to the hilt as if he were addressing the fleetlord rather than a rather tubby tosevite whom he devoutly wished dead did this humble one correctly hear that some other tosevites also experimenting with explosive metal suffered a mishap again okamoto and the scientist held a quick colloquy the latter said why not tell him if he is ever in a position to escape the war will be so badly lost that that will be the least of our worries very well okamoto gave his attention back to teerts yes this did happen the germans had an atomic pilewhat is the phrase reach critical mass and get out of control teerts let out a horrified hiss the big uglies didnt just accept risk they pursued it with insane zeal how did this happen he asked i am not certain the details are known especially since the accident killed some of their scientists okamoto said but those who still live are pressing ahead we shall not make the mistakes they did the americans have succeeded in running a pile without immediately joining their ancestors and they are sharing some of their methods with us oh teerts wished he had some ginger to chase away the lump of ice that formed in his belly when the race came to tosev the patchwork of tiny empires that dotted the planets surface had been a matter for jokes it wasnt funny any more back on home only one line of experiment at a time would have been pursued here all the competing little empires worked separately disunion usually was weakness but could also prove strength as now yoshio nishina came into the room his alarmingly mobile lipsor so they seemed to teertspulled back so that he showed what was for a big ugly a lot of teeth teerts had learned that meant he was happy he spoke with the other scientist and with major okamoto teerts did his best to follow but found himself left behind okamoto eventually noticed hed got lost we have had a new success the interpreter said we have bombarded uranium with neutrons and produced the element plutonium production is still very slow but plutonium will be easier to separate from uranium than uranium is hai nishina echoed emphatically we prepared uranium hexafluoride gas to use to separate the two isotopes of uranium from each other but it is so corrosive that we are having an impossible time working with it but separating plutonium from uranium is a straightforward chemical process major okamoto had to translate some of that too he and teerts used a mixture of terms from nipponese and the language of the race to talk about matters nuclear teerts took for granted a whole range of facts the big uglies were just uncovering but though he knew that things could be done he often had no idea as to how there they were ahead of him nishina added once we accumulate enough plutonium we shall surely be able to assemble a bomb in short order then we will meet your people on even terms teerts bowed which he found a useful way of responding without saying anything the nipponese didnt seem to have any idea how destructive nuclear weapons really were maybe it was because theyd never had any dropped on them as he had a dozen times before teerts tried to get across to them that nuclear combat wasnt anything to anticipate with relish they wouldnt listen any more than they had those other dozen times they thought he was just trying to slow down their research which he was and which he knew compromised his position okamoto said my country was backward until less than a hundred years ago we saw then that we had to learn the ways of the tosevite empires that knew more than we did or else become their slaves less than two hundred of our years teerts thought two hundred of his years before the race had been just about where it was now leisurely contemplating the conquest of tosev best wait till all was perfectly ready what difference could a few years make one way or the other theyd found out okamoto went on less than fifty years ago our soldiers and sailors beat the russians one of the empires that had been far ahead of us less than two years ago our airplanes and ships smashed those of the united states which had been probably the strongest empire on tosev by then we were better than they do you see where i am leading with this no superior sir teerts said though he feared he did major okamoto drove the point home with what teerts had come to think of as customary tosevite brutality we do not let anyone keep a lead on us in technology we will catch up with you too and teach you to learn better than to attack us without warning nishina and the other scientist nodded emphatically at that in the abstract teerts didnt suppose he could blame them had other starfarers attacked home he would have done everything he could to defend it but war with nuclear weapons was anything but abstractand if the nipponese did build and use one the race would surely respond in kind most likely on the biggest city nippon had right on top of my head in other words this is not your concern okamoto said when he worried about it out loud we will punish them for the wounds they have inflicted on us past that all i need say is that dying for the emperor is an honor he meant the nipponese emperor whose line was said to run back more than two thousand years and to be astonishingly ancient on account of that teerts was tempted to bitter laughter dying for the emperor was an honor too but he didnt want to do it any time soon especially not at the hands of the race nishina turned toward him lets go back to what we were discussing last week the best arrangement for the uranium in a pile i have the americans report i want to know how the race does the same thing you are likely to have more efficient procedures i should hope so teerts thought how do the americans do it superior sir he asked as innocently as he could hoping to get some idea of the big uglies technical prowess but the nipponese though technically backward were old in games of deceit you tell us how you do it okamoto said we do the comparing the rest is none of your business and you would be sorry if you made it so teerts bowed once more that was how the nipponese apologized yes superior sir he said and told what he knew anything was preferable to giving okamoto the excuse to start acting like an interrogator again xv ristin let his mouth hang open showing off his pointy little teeth and lizardy tongue he was laughing at sam yeager you have what he said in pretty fluent if accented english seven days in a week twelve inches in a foot three feet in a mile a yard sam corrected i thought something with grass growing in it was a yard ristin said but never mind how do youremember all these things how do you keep from going mad trying to remember all what youre used to yeager said a little uncomfortably he remembered trying to turn pecks into bushels into tons in school that was one of the reasons hed signed a minorleague contract first chance he gotexcept for banking and his batting average hed never worried about math since he went on most places except the united states use the metric system where everything is ten of this and ten of that if he hadnt read science fiction he wouldnt have known about the metric system either even time ristin asked no sixty seconds make a minute or an hour or whatever it is and twentyfour minutes or hours make a day he sputtered like a derisive steam engine then tacked on an emphatic cough to show he really meant it well no sam admitted all that stuff stays the same all over the world itstradition thats what it is he smiled happilythe lizards lived and died by tradition but ristin wasnt buying it not this time he said in our ancient days before we were what is the word civilized yes civilized we had traditions like that traditions that did harm not good we made them work for us or we got rid of them this was a hundred thousand years ago we do not miss these bad traditions a hundred thousand years ago yeager echoed hed gotten the idea that lizard years werent as long as the ones people used but even so a hundred thousand years agofifty thousand years ago too come to thatpeople were just cavemen savages i mean nobody knew how to read and write nobody knew how to grow their own food hell nobody knew anything to speak of ristins eye turrets moved just a little most people wouldnt even have noticed but sam had spent more time around lizards than just about anybody he knew the alien was thinking something he didnt want to say he could even make a pretty fair guess about what it was as far as youre concerned we still dont know anything to speak of ristin jerked as if sam had stuck him with a pin how did you know that a little bird told me yeager said grinning tell it to the marines ristin retorted he didnt quite understand what a marine was but he had the phrase down pat and used it at the right times sam wanted to bust out laughing every time he heard it shall we go outside he asked its a nice day no its not its cold its always cold on this miserable iceball of a world ristin relented its not as cold as it was though you are right about that he gave an exaggerated shiver to show how cold it had been if you say we must go out it shall be done i didnt say we had to yeager answered i just asked if you wanted to not very much ristin said before i was a soldier i was a male of the city thewhat do you call them wide open spaces are not for me i saw enough of them on the long long way from chicago to this place to last me forever sam was amused to hear his own turns of phrase coming out of the mouth of a creature born under the light of another star it made him feel as if in some small way hed affected the course of history he said have it your own way then even though i dont call some grass on the university of denver the wide open spaces maybe its just as well ullhass ought to be back in a few minutes and then i can take both you guys back to your rooms they do not need you to be there any more to translate ristin asked thats what they say yeager shrugged professor fermi hasnt called me this session so i guess maybe he doesnt both of you speak english pretty well now if you are not needed for this will they take you away from us ristin showed his teeth you want me and ullhass to forget how we speak english then they still need you we do not want you to go you have been good to us since you catch us all this time ago we think then that you people hurt us kill us you showed us different we want you to stay dont worry about me ill be okay yeager said a year before hed have found absurd the notion that anything a turreteyed creature with a hissing accent said could touch him touched he was though and sometimes he had to remind himself how alien ristin really was he went on ive been a bench warmer before its not the end of the world it may be from sympathetic ristin turned serious if you humans do build an atomic bomb it may be you will use it and we will use it and little will be left when all is done we werent the first ones to use them yeager said what about washington and berlin warning shots ristin said we could choose to use them in a way that did little harmhe ignored the choked noise that escaped from sams throatbecause we had them and you did not if they turn into just another weapon of war the planet will be badly hurt but if we dont use them the race is probably going to conquer us yeager said now ristin made a noise that reminded sam of a water heater in desperate need of replacement this ishow do you say two things that cannot be true at the same time but are anyhow a paradox sam suggested after some thought it wasnt a word he hauled out every day if that is what you say paradox ristin repeated you may lose the war without these bombs but you may lose it too because of them is this a paradox i guess so yeager gave the lizard a hard look but if you think things are like that how come you and ullhass have been so much help to the met lab at first we did not think you big uglies could know enough to make a bomb anyhow so no harm done ristin said sam knew he was worried because he didnt often slip and use the lizard slang name for human beings he went on soon we found how wrong we were you know enough and more and were mostly using us to check the answers you had already again because of this not much harm could come so we went along oh yeager said nice to know we surprised you ristins mouth opened and he wagged his head slightly he was laughing at himself this whole planet has been a surprise and not a good one from the first time people started shooting at us with rifles and cannon we knew everything we had believed about tosev was wrong somebody rapped on the door of the office where yeager and ristin were talking thatll be ullhass yeager said but when the door opened barbara came through it you are not ullhass ristin said in accusing tones he let his mouth hang open again to show hed made a joke you know what sam said im darn glad she isnt hi hon he gave her a hug and a peck of a kiss i didnt think they were going to let you off work till later one thing about english majors we do learn how to type barbara said as long as we dont run out of ribbons ill have plenty to do or until the baby comeswhichever happens first they ought to give me a couple of days off for that theyd better yeager said and added the emphatic cough he laughed at himself to ristin he said thats what i get for hanging around with the likes of you what a civilized language ristin said laughing his kind of laugh once more he turned civilized into a long hiss despite his accent he gave as good as he got yeager didnt fire back at him instead he asked barbara why did they let you go early i turned green i guess she answered i dont know why they call it morning sickness it gets me any old time of day it feels like you look okay now he said i got rid of what ailed me barbara said bleakly im just glad the plumbing works if it didnt somebodyprobably mewould have a mess to clean up youre supposed to be eating for two not throwing up what one has sam said if you know a secret way to make lunch stay down i wish youd tell me what it is barbara answered now with a snap in her voice everybody says this is supposed to go away after i get further along i hope to heaven thats true another knock this one on the frame of the open door here you go corporal said a kid in dungarees with a pistol holster on his belt ive brought your pet lizard back for you ullhass walked in and exchanged sibilant greetings with ristin the kid who except for the pistol looked like a college freshman nodded to yeager gave barbara a quick onceover and obviously decided she was too old for him nodded again and trotted off down the hall i am not a pet i am a male of the race ullhass said with considerable dignity yeager soothed him i know pal but havent you noticed that people dont always say exactly what they mean yes i have seen this ullhass said because i am a prisoner i will not tell you what i think of it if you ask me you just did yeager answered you were very polite about it though now come on boys ill take you home home for the lizards was an office converted into an apartment maybe cell block was a better word for it yeager thought at least hed never seen any apartments with stout iron bars across the windows and an armed guard waiting outside the door but ristin and ullhass liked it nobody bothered them in there and the steam radiator let them heat the room to the bakeoven level they enjoyed once they were safely ensconced yeager walked barbara out onto the lawn unlike ristin she didnt complain it was too cold all she said was i wish i had some cigarettes maybe theyd keep me from wanting to toss my cookies now that you havent smoked in a while theyd probably just make you sicker sam slipped an arm around barbaras waist which was still deliciously slim as long as you are off early you want to go back to the place and he let his voice trail away but squeezed her a little her answering smile was wan id love to go back to the place but if you dont mind all i want to do is lie down maybe take a nap im tired all the time and my stomach isnt what you call happy right now either is it okay she sounded anxious yeah its okay yeager answered fifteen years ago i probably would have fussed and sulked but im a grownup now i can wait till tomorrow my dick doesnt think for me the way it used to he thought but that wasnt something he could say to a newwed wife barbara let her hand rest on his thanks hon first time i ever got thanked for getting old he said she made a face at him you cant have it both ways are you a grownup and saying its okay because it really is or are you just getting old and saying its okay because youre all feeble and tired ooh he mimed a wound when she wanted to she could get him chasing his tail like nobodys business he didnt think of himself as dumb but then who does but he hadnt had formal training in logic and in fencing with words trading barbs with ballplayers in his dugout and the ones on the other side of the field wasnt the same thing barbara let out a loud theatrical groan as she got to the top of the stairs thats going to be even less fun when im further along she said maybe we should have looked for a place on the ground floor too late to worry about it now i suppose she groaned again this time with pleasure when she flopped onto the sofa in the front room wouldnt you be more comfortable on the bed yeager asked actually no i can put my feet up this way the overstuffed sofa had equally overstuffed arms so maybe that really was comfortable sam shrugged if barbara was happy he was happy too somebody knocked on the door whos that sam and barbara said in the same breath why doesnt he go away lay beneath the words whoever it was didnt go away but kept on knocking yeager strode over and threw open the door intending to give a pushy fuller brush man a piece of his mind but it wasnt a fuller brush man it was jens larssen he looked at sam like a man finding a cockroach in his salad i want to talk to my wife he said shes not your wife any more weve been through this yeager said tiredly but his hands bunched into fists at his sides what do you want to say to her its none of your damn business jens said which almost started the fight then and there but before yeager quite decided to knock his block off he added but i came to tell her goodbye where are you going jens in her stocking feet barbara came up behind sam so quietly that he hadnt heard her washington state larssen answered i shouldnt even tell you that much but i figured you ought to know in case i dont come back that sounds as if i shouldnt ask when youre going barbara said and larssen nodded to show she was right coolly she told him good luck jens he turned red because he was so fair the process was easy to watch he said for all you care i could be going off to desert to the lizards i dont think youd do that she said but larssen was right she didnt sound as if she much cared yeager had all he could do to keep from breaking into a happy grin barbara went on i told you good luck and i meant it i dont know what more you want that i can give you you know good and well what i want jens said and yeager gathered himself again if larssen wanted that fight bad enough hed get it that i cant give you i said barbara answered jens larssen glared at her at sam at her again as if he couldnt decide which of them he wanted to belt more with a snarl of curses some in english others in throaty norwegian he stomped off his furious footfalls thundered on the stairs he slammed the front door of the apartment building hard enough to rattle windows i wish that hadnt happened barbara said i wishoh what difference does it make what i wish now if hes going away for a while that may be the best thing that could happen well get some peace and quiet and maybe by the time he gets back hell have figured out he cant do anything about this god i hope so yeager said what hes put you through ever since we got here isnt right hed been riding the roller coaster himself but he kept quiet about that barbara was the one whod had the tough time because shed been in love with jensright up to the minute she found out he was still alive sam thought since then since shed chosen to stay barbara yeager instead of going back to being barbara larssen jens had done his best to act about as unlovable as a human being could barbaras sigh showed a weariness that had nothing to do with her being pregnant very strange to think that a year ago he and i were happy together i dont think hes the same person any more he never used to be bitterbut then he never used to have much to be bitter about either i guess you cant really tell about someone till you see him when the chips are down youre probably right sam had seen that playing ballsome guys wanted to be out there with the game on the line while others hoped they wouldnt come up or be on the mound or have the ball hit to them in that kind of spot musingly barbara went on i suppose thats one of the reasons people write so much about love and war theyre the situations that put the most strain on a persons character so you can see it at its best and at its worst makes sense yeager hadnt thought about it in those terms but it did make sense to him hed seen enough war close up to know it was more terrifying than exciting but it remained endlessly interesting to read about hed never thought about why until now you put things in a whole new light for me he said admiringly she looked at him then reached out and took his hands in hers youve put some things in a new light for me too sam she murmured he felt ten feet tall the rest of the day and didnt give jens larssen another thought superior sir i greet you and welcome you to our fine base here ussmak said to the new landcruiser commander my latest he thought and wondered how many more hed go through before tosev was conqueredif it ever was that gloomy reflection was a far cry from the spirit of unity with which heand all landcruiser maleshad gone into this campaign then theyd thought crews would stay together through the whole war theyd trained on that assumption so that a male without his crew was an object of pity both to his comrades and to himself things hadnt quite worked that way ussmak had had two commanders and a gunner killed on him and another commander and gunner swept away in the wild hunt for ginger lickers he studied this new male and wondered how long hed last the fellow seemed promising enough he was goodlooking and alert and his neatly applied body paint argued that he didnt have his tongue in a ginger jar though you never could tell ussmak was fastidious about his own paint just to keep his superiors from gettingjustifiablysuspicious landcruiser driver ussmak i am landcruiser commander nejas you are assigned to my crew the male said skoob our gunner will be along shortly he must be completing reporting formalities both of us will draw heavily on your knowledge as you have more combat experience than we do i shall help you in any way i can superior sir ussmak said as he had to he did his best to sound fulsome but was not rejoicing inside hed hoped hed get crewed with veterans but no such luck as delicately as he could he added the deutsche are not opponents to take lightly so i am given to understand nejas said i am also given to understand that this garrison has problems beyond the deutsche however is it true that the big uglies actually spirited a landcruiser out of the vehicle park here i fear it is superior sir ussmak was embarrassed about that himself though hed had nothing to do with it it showed drefsab hadnt managed to sweep out all the ginger tasters and it showed some of them didnt care for anything on tosev past where their next taste was coming from disgraceful nejas said we must have order aboard our own ship before we can hope to put down the tosevites another male came into the barracks and swiveled his eye turrets every which way taking the measure of the place by the time he was through he looked dismayed ussmak understood that hed felt the same way the first time hed inspected his new housing from everything hed heard even the big uglies lived better than this these days the newcomer might have been nejas broodbrother they both had the same perfect body paint the same alert stance and somehow the same air of trusting innocence about them as if theyd just come out of cold sleep and didnt know anything about the way the war against the big uglies was or rather wasnt going about what ginger had done to the landcruiser crews at besancon or about any of the many other unpleasant surprises tosev had given the race ussmak didnt know whether to envy or pity them nejas said driver ussmak here is skoob the gunner of our landcruiser crew ussmak closely studied skoobs body paint it said the other males rank was about the same as his nejas neutral introduction said the same thing ussmak had the feeling he was vastly superior in combat experience what nejas had said told him as much at any rate on the other hand skoob looked to have been together with nejas for a long time ussmak said i greet you superior sir skoob took the deference as nothing less than his due which irked ussmak i greet you driver he said may we brew up many tosevite landcruisers together may it be so ussmak wished he had a taste of ginger better that than the taste of condescension he got from skoob but because his life would depend in no small measure on how well the gunner did his job he went on politely the other half of the bargain involves keeping the big uglies from brewing us up shouldnt be that difficult nejas said ive studied the technical specifications for all the tosevites landcruisers even the latest ones from the deutsche theyve improved yes but we still handily outclass them superior sir in theory theres no doubt youre right ussmak said the only trouble ismay i speak frankly please do nejas said skoob echoing him a moment later from that they were an established crewpair i was wise to defer to skoob after all even if he is arrogant ussmak thought still he hoped their willingness to listen meant something the trouble with the big uglies is they dont fight the way wed expect or the way our simulations prepared us to meet theyre masters at setting ambushes at using terrain to mask what theyre up to at using feints and minefields to channel our moves into the direction they want and their intelligence is superb ours should be better skoob said we have reconnaissance satellites in place after all to see how they move how they move yes but not always what the moves mean ussmak said theyre very good at concealing thatuntil they hurt us and we may have satellites but they have every big ugly between here and their positions to let them know where were going this isnt like the sssr where a lot of the tosevites preferred us to either the deutsche or the russkis these big uglies dont want us and they wish wed all disappear nejas tongue flicked out and then in again as if at a bad taste helicopter gunships should take the edge off their tactics superior sir theyre of less use here than they were in the sssr ussmak said for one thing the countryside gives the deutsche good coveri said that before and for another theyve learned to bring antiaircraft artillery well forward theyve hurt our gunships badly enough that the males in charge of them have grown reluctant to commit them to battle except in emergency and sometimes then too what good are they to us if they cannot be used skoob asked angrily a good question ussmak admitted but what good are they to us if they get blown out of the air before they damage the big uglies landcruisers you are saying we face defeat nejas voice was silky with danger ussmak guessed part of his mission was keeping an eye turret turned for defeatists as well as ginger tasters superior sir no i am not saying that the driver replied i am saying we need to be more wary than we thought we would against the tosevites more wary possibly nejas said with the air of a male making a concession to another who was inferior mentally as well as in rank but when faced in accord with sound tactical doctrine i have no doubt the big uglies will fall ussmak had had no doubts either not until he had a couple of landcruisers wrecked while he was in them superior sir i say only that the tosevites are more devious than our tactical doctrine allows for he held up a hand to keep nejas from interrupting then told the story of the mortar attack on the races local base and the land mine waiting for the armor as it hurried toward the bridge that would let it get at the raiders nejas did break in i have heard of this incident my impression is that males with their heads in the ginger vial were in large measure responsible for our losing an armored fighting vehicle they charged straight ahead without considering possible risks superior sir thats true ussmak said recalling just how true it was but its not the point i was trying to make had they gone more cautiously they would have taken an alternate route under which the big uglies also had a bomb waiting we are devious by doctrine and training they seem to be devious straight from hatchlinghood they play a deeper game than we do that got through to skoob if not to nejas the gunner said how do we protect ourselves against this tosevite deviousness then if i had the whole answer to that id be fleetlord not a landcruiser driver ussmak said which made both his new crewmales laugh he went on the one thing i will say is that if a move against the big uglies looks easy and obvious youll probably find it has claws attached and the first thing you think of after the obvious move may well be wrong too and so may the second one i have it skoob said the thing to do is post our landcruisers in a circle in the middle of a large open fieldand then make sure the big uglies arent digging under them ussmak let his mouth drop open at that good to see one of the new males could crack wise anyhow nejas remained serious letting his eyes roam around the barracks once more he said this is such a gloomy place id hardly mind getting out of it to fight in a landcruiser i expect id be more comfortable in one than i will here does it have anything in its favor the plumbing is excellent ussmak said through the newcomers hisses of surprise he explained the big uglies have messier body wastes than we do so they need more in the way of plumbing and this whole planet is so wet they use water more for washing and such than we would dare back on home standing under a decently warm spray is invigorating even if it does play hob with your body paint let me at it skoob said we were on duty down south of here somewhere in the landmass unit the tosevites call africa it was warm enough there but the water was in the streams or falling from the sky in sheets the local big uglies didnt know anything about putting it in pipes nejas also made enthusiastic noises ussmak said here throw your gear on these bedsthey had been hessefs and tvenkelsand ill show you what we have all three males were luxuriating in the showers when the unit commander a male named kassnass stuck his head into the chamber and said all out we have an operations meeting coming up feeling unjustly deprived to say nothing of damp ussmak and his crewmales listened to kassnass set forth the newest plan for a push toward belfort to the driver it seemed more of the same nejas and skoob however listened as if entranced from what ussmak had heard they wouldnt have faced serious opposition in this africa place which was almost as backward technologically as the race had thought all of tosev to be things were different here the unit commander turned one eye turret from the holograms on which the positions of the deutsche and the race were marked to the males assembled before him a lot of you are new here he said weve had troubles with this garrison but by the emperorhe and the landcruiser crews cast down their eye turretsweve cleaned up most of that now our veterans know how devious the deutsche can be you newcomers follow where they lead and stay cautious if something looks too good to be true it probably is thats so ussmak whispered to nejas and skoob neither of them responded he hoped theyd pay more attention to kassnass than they did to him kassnass went on dont let them lure you into rugged country or the woods youre vulnerable if you get separated from the other landcruisers in the unit because then the big uglies will concentrate fire on you from several directions at once remember they can afford to lose five or six or ten landcruisers for every one of ours they take out and they know it too we have speed and firepower and armor on our side they have numbers trickery and fanatical courage we have to use our advantages and minimize theirs theyre the enemy and theyre only big uglies so of course we call their courage fanatical ussmak thought saying theyre just doing their best to stay alive like anybody else would give them too much credit for sense the males trooped out to the revetments that protected the landcruisers ussmak guiding his new commander and gunner the earth was scored with hits from tosevite mortars bomb fragment scars pocked the sides of buildings nejas and skoob rapidly swiveled their eye turrets ussmak guessed they hadnt seen resistance like this from the big uglies once in place in the drivers position he stopped worrying about what theyd seen and what they hadnt he had a vial of ginger stashed in the landcruisers fuse box but he didnt open it up and taste not now he wanted to be clear and rational not berserk if he saw action unexpectedly soon helicopter gunships took off with whickering roars audible even through the landcruisers thick armor theyd reach the target area well before the ground vehicles did with luck theyd soften up the deutsche and not take too much damage themselves ussmak knew somebody reckoned the mission important as hed told his crewmales helicopters had grown too scarce and precious to hazard lightly through the streets of besancon past the busylooking buildings with their filigrees of iron railings and balconies engineers preceded the landcruisers to make sure no more explosive surprises awaited all the same ussmak drove buttoned up and regarded every big ugly he saw through his vision slits as a potentialno even a likelyspy the deutsche would know they were coming even before the helicopters arrived ussmak breathed easier when his landcruiser rumbled over the bridge across the doubs and headed for open country he was also taking the measure of nejas as a landcruiser commander the new male might not have seen much action but he seemed crisp and decisive ussmak approved he hadnt felt part of a proper landcruiser crew since a sniper killed votal his first commander he hadnt realized how much he missed the feeling till he saw some chance of getting it back somewhere off in the trees a machine gun opened up with harassing fire a couple of bullets pinged off the landcruiser nejas said take no notice of him he cant hurt us anyway ussmak hissed in delight hed seen males with heads abuzz with ginger badly delay a mission by trying to hunt out tosevite nuisances the column rolled north and east reports came back that the helicopters had struck hard at the tosevite landcruisers ussmak hoped the reports were right knowing the big uglies could hurt him put combat in a new light a flash a streak of fire barely seen a crash that made the landcruiser ring like a bell turret rotate from zero to twentyfive nejas calledurgently but without the panic or rage or excessive excitement a ginger taster would have used machinegun fire into those bushes it shall be done superior sir skoob replied the turret swung through a quarter of a circle from northeast to northwest the machine gun yammered no way to tell whether i got him superior sir but he wont shoot another rocket at one of our landcruisers for a while i hope let us hope not nejas said were lucky that one hit us on the turret and not in the side of the hull where the armor is thinner briefings say the results can be most unpleasant briefings dont know the half of it superior sir ussmak said vivid inside his head were flames and explosions and unremitting fear fear that had come flooding back at that impact against the turret and now receded only slowly the landcruiser column rolled on every now and again bullets from the bushes struck sparks off armor plate but the column did not slow ussmak kept driving buttoned up he felt half blind but didnt care to have one of those rounds clip off the top of his head why dont they keep those pests from harassing us nejas asked after yet another band of tosevites sprayed the column with gunfire this is our territory if we cant keep raiders from slipping in we might as well not have conquered it superior sir the trouble is that almost all the tosevites hereabouts favor the raiders and shelter them and we have an impossible time trying to figure out who really lives in the farms and villages and who doesnt identity cards help but they arent enough this is their planet after all they know it better than we can hope to it was simpler down in africa the landcruiser commander said mournfully the big uglies there had no weapons that could hurt a landcruiser and did what they were told once we made a few examples of those who disobeyed we tried that here too ive heard ussmak said this was before i arrived the trouble was the big uglies had been making examples of one another yet fighting just the same they ignored the examples we made the same way theyd ignored their own mad skoob said ussmak didnt contradict him the landcruisers began passing old battlefields some still showing the scars of fires set by shotup landcruisers the hulks of destroyed deutsch armored fighting vehicles still sprawled in death some of them were the angular little machines ussmak had encountered on the plains of the sssr but others were the big new ones that could endanger a landcruiser of the race if well handledand the deutsche handled them well nejas said those are impressive looking hulks arent they even holograms dont do them justice when i first saw one i wondered why our males hadnt salvaged it i needed a moment to realize the big uglies had made it i apologize for wondering about some of the things you said ussmak now i believe you ussmak didnt answer but felt a burst of pleasure more subtle than the jolt he got from ginger and perhaps more satisfying as well it had been too long since a superior acknowledged that the races obligations ran down as well as up his last pair of landcruiser commanders had taken him for granted as if he were just a component of the machine he drove not even being a ginger buddy with hessef had changed that no wonder hed felt isolated alone hardly part of the race at all now it was almost as if hed come out of the eggshell anew smoke rose from the woods up ahead an artillery shell burst off to one side of the road the helicopters hadnt routed the deutsche then ussmak had hoped hed be going in to mop up he hadnt really believed it but hed hoped a cannon belched fire and smoke from behind some bushes wham ussmak felt as if hed been kicked in the muzzle but the landcruisers heavy glacis plate kept the tosevite shell from penetrating without being ordered ussmak swung the vehicle in the direction from which the round had come i almost fouled my seat he said if the big uglies had waited till we passed and shot at the side of our hull nejas took the time to give him one word yes then the landcruiser commander snapped an order to skoob gunner a moment later another singleword command followed sabot skoob put the automatic loader through its paces a round of armorpiercing discarding sabot ammunition clattered into the breech of the gun which closed with a solid thunk up the gunner reported landcruiser front nejas said noting the target for skoob identified skoob answered he had it in his thermal sight fire on the way skoob said the report of the landcruiser cannon was less than thunderous inside the hull but the massive vehicle rocked back from the recoil and a sheet of flame billowed across ussmaks vision slits again the driver knew pleasure almost as intense as ginger gave this was how a crew was supposed to work together he hadnt known anything like it since votal got killed hed forgotten how satisfying it could be and just as ginger brought a burst of ecstasy as it shot from the tongue to the brain so teamwork also had its reward fire and black smoke boiled up behind the bushes as the deutsch landcruiser that had tried to impede the progress of the race paid the price for its temerity the turret machine gun chattered mowing down the big uglies whod bailed out of their wrecked vehicle ahead driver nejas said it shall be done superior sir ussmak said along with part of the column of landcruisers he pushed the machine forward down the road past the ambush the big uglies had hoped to set the rest of the races armor went after the deutsche whod tried to waylay them the fight was savage but didnt last long when they werent caught by surprise in disadvantageous positions the races landcruisers remained far superior to those of the foe they methodically pounded the deutsche till no more deutsche were left to pound then rejoined the rear of the advancing column these big uglies are better than any tosevites ive seen before nejas said but they dont seem to be anything we cant handle ussmak wondered about that had his previous crew their wits cooked on ginger and their tactics and even their commands full of druginduced sloppiness really been so inept he had trouble believing it but here was an ambush that would have thrown them into fits brushed away like any minor annoyance on the highway black smoke rose from burning trucks that formed a barricade across the paved surface the landcruisers in front of ussmaks peeled off to the grassy verge to the left to bypass the obstacle ussmak was about to swing his handlebar controller to follow them when dirt fountained up under one and it slewed sideways to a stop he hit the brakes hard mines he shouted concealed deutsch landcruisers and guns opened up on the crippled vehicle no armor could take that pounding for long blue flames spurted from the engine compartment as a hydrogen line began to burn then the landcruiser went up in a ball of fire big ugly males with satchel charges burst from cover to attack the vehicles that had stopped machine guns cut down most of them but a couple managed to fling the explosives either under the rear of a turret or through an open cupola hatch the roars from those explosions shook ussmak even inside his armored eggshell driver i apologize nejas said but then a moment later he was all business again gunner sabot the cannon spoke and killed a big ugly landcruiser nejas gave his attention back to ussmak driver theres a narrow space of ground on the right between the road and the trees take itif we can get by well put ourselves in the tosevites rear superior sir that space is probably mined too ussmak said i know nejas answered calmly the gain we win by passing is worth the risk steer as close to the burning vehicles as you can without making our own paint catch fire it shall be done ussmak tramped down hard on the accelerator the sooner the passage was over the sooner his scales would stop itching with anticipation of the blast that would put his landcruiser out of commission with a hiss of relief loud as an air brake he was through and back on the road again big uglies turned a machine gun on his landcruiser he let his mouth fall open in scornful laughter that wouldnt do them any good nor did it from the turret the coaxial machine gun scythed down the tosevites keep advancing nejas said urgently we have more landcruisers behind us and mechanized infantry combat vehicles as well if we can deploy in the big uglies rear we ruin their whole position ussmak stepped on it again the landcruiser bounded ahead speed sometimes was as important a weapon as a cannon he spied a deutsch landcruiser barreling through the undergrowth trying to find a place from which to block the onslaught of the races armor gunner sabot nejas shoutedhed seen it too but before skoob could acknowledge the order and crank the round into the cannon a streak of fire off to one side took the big ugly vehicle in the engine compartment red and yellow flames shot up from it setting the bushes afire superior sir i think the infantrys dismounted from their carriers ussmak said that was an antilandcruiser rocket youre right nejas said and then steer right away from the road ussmak obeyed and caught sight of another tosevite landcruiser nejas gave orders to skoob the cannon barked the landcruiser jerked with the recoil and the deutsch machine brewed up before long ussmak saw something he hadnt seen much of since the early days on the endless plains of the sssr big uglies coming out of their overrun hiding places with arms raised in token of surrender he hissed in wonder just for a moment the sense of inevitable triumph hed felt thenbefore the race really understood how the big uglies could fightcame flooding back he doubted anything was inevitable any more but the way to belfort and with luck beyond lay open when the landcruiser finally stopped for the evening he thought hed have a taste of ginger to celebrate just a small one of course mutt daniels tasted the rich black earth just outside danforth illinois he knew soil hed grown up as a dirt farmer after all if he hadnt had a talent for baseball hed have spent his life eastbound behind the west end of a mule this was soil as good as hed ever come across no wonder the corn grew here in great green waves all the same he wished he werent making its acquaintance under these circumstances he tasted it because he lay flat on his belly between the rows his face jammed into the dirt so he wouldnt get a shell splinter in the eye with the coming of spring the lizards were driving hard he didnt know how the army would hold them out of chicago this time gotta try though he muttered and tasted dirt again more shells came in they lifted mutt up slammed him back to the ground like a wrestler putting on a show in a tank town unlike a wrestler they didnt pull any puncheshed be black and blue all over medic somebody shouted not far away the tone wasnt anguish surprise was more like it that meant one of two things either the wound wasnt bad or the fellow whod got it didnt realize how bad it was mutt had seen that before men perfectly calm and rational with their guts hanging out and blood soaking into the dark dirt and making it blacker than it already was medic the cry came again rawer this time mutt crawled toward it tommy gun at the ready no telling what the tall corn might hide but only lucille potter crouched by freddie laplace when daniels reached him she was gently getting him to take his bloodstained hands off his calf oh goodness freddie mutt said inhibited in his choice of language by lucilles presence he hurt not only for laplace but for the squad the little guy washad beenfar and away their best point man give me a hand mutt if you please lucille potter said the place where the shell fragment had gone in was a small neat hole the exit woundmutt gulped hed seen worse but this one wasnt pretty it looked as if somebody had dug into the back of laplaces leg with a sharp edged serving spoon and taken out enough meat to feed a man a pretty good dinner lucille was already cutting away the trouser leg so she could work on the wound careful with that scissors laplace said you dont want to slice me any worse than i am already mutt nodded to himself if that was what freddie was worrying about he didnt know how bad hed been hit ill be careful lucille answered gently were going to have to get you back to an aid station after mutt and i bandage you up sorry sarge laplace said still eerily composed i dont think i can walk that far dont worry about it kid mutt was wondering whether laplace would keep that leg not about his walking on it well get you there you just want to hold still now while miss lucille patches you up ill try sarge ithurts freddie was doing his best to be a good scout but it didnt sound easy any more after a while the numbness that often came with a wound wore off and then you started to realize what had happened to you that wasnt any fun at all lucille dusted the wound with sulfa powder then folded the skin over it as best she could too big and ragged to sew up she murmured to mutt just lucky it didnt smash the bones up too he may walk on it again one of these days she packed gauze into the hole and put more gauze and tape over it then she pointed back toward one of the windmills outside of danforth it had a big new red cross banner hanging from it lets get him over there right you are mutt stooped with lucille potter and got laplace upright with one of his arms draped over each of their shoulders they hauled him along toward the windmill musta been dutch settled around these parts mutt mused not many other folks use those things thats true but i couldnt tell you for certain lucille said were too far upstate for me to know much about the people hereabouts you know moren i do daniels said freddie laplace didnt stick his two cents worth in he hung limply in the grasp of the pair who carried him his head down on his chest if he was out it probably counted as a mercy oh god another one an unshaven medic with a grimy red cross armband said when they hauled freddie into the makeshift aid station in the room at the bottom of the windmill we just got captain maczek in herehe took one in the chest shit lucille potter said crisply which was exactly what mutt was thinking the word made his jaw drop just the same the medic stared at her too she stared back until he lowered his eyes and took charge of laplace saying well patch him up the best way we know how looks like you did good emergency work on him he knuckled his eyes yawned enormously jesus im tired other thing weve got to worry about is getting out of here in case were overrun weve been falling back a lot lately mutt almost gave him a hot answeranybody who bitched about the job the army was doing could go to hell as far as he was concerned but the medic had a real worry there because they probably would have to retreat farther and medic wasnt exactly a cushy job either the lizards honored the red cross most of the time but not alwaysand even it they meant to honor it their weapons werent perfect either so sighing he tramped away from the windmill and back toward his squad lucille potter followed him she said with the captain down mutt theyre liable to give you a platoon and turn you into a lieutenant yeah maybe he said if they dont reckon im too old he thought he could do the job if hed run a ballclub he could handle a platoon but how many guys in their fifties sudenly sprouted bars on their shoulders if this were peacetime youre rightthey would lucille said but the way things are now i dont think theyll worry about itthey cant afford to maybe mutt said ill believe it when i see it though and the way things are now like you said i aint gonna worry about it one way or the other the lizards can shoot me just as well for bein a lieutenant as for bein a sergeant you have the proper attitude lucille said approvingly a compliment from her made mutt scuff his wornout army boot over the ground like a damn schoolkid one thing bein a managerll teach you miss lucille he said and thats that some things you cant do nothin about if you know what i mean you dont learn that pretty darn quick you go crazy control what you can know what you cant and dont worry about it lucille nodded its a good way to live before mutt could answer a burst of firing came from the front line thats lizard small arms be said breaking into a trot and then into a run i better get back there he was afraid theyd need lucilles talents too but he didnt say that any more than he would have told a pitcher he had a nohitter going you didnt want to put the jinx on running through the corn made his heart pound in his throat partly from exertion and partly for fear hed blunder in among the lizards and get himself shot before he even knew they were there but the sound of the gunfire and a pretty good sense of direction brought him back to the right place he flopped down in the sweetsmelling dirt scraped out a bare minimum of a foxhole with his entrenching tool and started firing short bursts from his tommy gun toward the racket from the lizards automatics not for the first time he wished he had a weapon like theirs as hed said to lucille potter though some things you couldnt do anything about the lizards were pushing hard firing started to come from both flanks as well as straight ahead we gotta fall back mutt yelled hating the words dracula you n mell stay here to cover the rest when theyre clear we back up too right sarge to show he had the idea dracula szabo squeezed off a burst from his bar when you advanced if you were smart you split into groups one group firing while the other one moved you had to be even smarter to carry out that fireandmove routine while you gave ground what you wanted to do at a time like that was run like hell it was the worst thing you could do but you always had a devil of a time making your body believe it the guys in daniels squad were veterans they knew what they had to do as soon as they found decent positions they hunkered down and started firing again back mutt shouted to szabo shooting as they went they retreated through the rest of the squad the lizards kept pressing another couple of rounds of fire and fall back brought the americans into the town of danforth it had held three or four hundred people before the fighting started if the locals had any brains theyd abandoned their trim white and green houses a while ago a lot of the houses werent so trim any more not after artillery and air strikes the sour odor of old smoke hung in the air mutt pounded on a front door when nobody answered he kicked it open and ran inside one of the windows gave him a good field of fire to the south the direction from which the lizards were coming he crouched down behind it and got ready to give them a warm welcome mind if i join you lucille potters question made him jump and start to point his gun toward the doorway but he stopped in a hurry and waved her in freighttrain noises overhead and a series of loud bursts a few hundred yards south of town made mutt whoop with delight about time our artillery got off the dime he said feed the lizards a taste of what they give us before long northbound roars and whistles balanced those coming from out of the north theyre awfully quick with counterbattery fire lucille said awfully accurate too yeah i know daniels said butheck come to that all their equipment is bettern oursartillery and planes and tanks and even the rifles their dogfaces carry whenever they want to bad enough they can move us out of the way but its like they dont want to all the time unless i miss my guess theyre stretched thin lucille potter answered they arent just fighting in illinois or fighting against the united states theyre trying to take over the whole world and the world is a big place trying to hold it all down cant be easy for them lord i hope its not grateful for talk to help get him through the lull without worrying about what would happen when it stopped mutt gave her an admiring glance miss lucille you got a good way of lookin at things he hesitated then added matter of fact you look right good yourself mutt lucille hesitated too finally with exasperation in her voice she said is this really the right time or place to be talking about things like that far as i can see you dont think theres ever any right time or place mutt said also with some annoyance i aint no caveman miss lucille i just the lull ended at that moment some of the lizard artillery instead of going after its american opposite number started coming in on danforth the rising whistle of shells warned mutt they were going to hit just about on top of him he threw himself flat even before lucille yelled get down and also jammed her face into the floorboards the barrage put daniels in mind of france in the windows of the house those that werent broken already blew in scattering broken glass all over the room a glittering shard dug into the floor and stuck like a spear maybe six inches from mutt s nose he stared at it crosseyed the shells kept falling till the blast of each was lost in the collective din bricks fell from the chimney and crashed on the roof shell fragments punched through the walls of the house as if they were made of cardboard in spite of his helmet mutt felt naked you could take only so many heavy shellings before something in you started to crack you didnt want it to happen but it did once you got your quota you werent worth a whole lot as the pounding went on mutt began to think he wasnt far from his own limit trying not to go to pieces in front of lucille potter helped him ride it out he glanced away from the broken chunk of glass toward her she was flattened out just like him and didnt look to be having any easier time of it than he was later he was never sure which one of them rolled toward the other whichever it was they clung to each other tight as they could in spite of what theyd been talking about when the barrage hit there was nothing in the least sexual about the embraceit was more on the order of drowning men grabbing at spars mutt had hung on to doughboys the same way when the boches gave american trenches a goingover in the last war because he was a veteran of he got to his feet in a hurry when the curtain of lizard shells moved from the southern edge of danforth where he was to the middle and northern parts of town he knew about walking barrages and knew soldiers often walked right behind them danforth looked as if it had gone through the meat grinder and then been overcooked since the last time hed looked out the window now most of the houses were in ruins the ground cratered and smoke and dust rising everywhere and through the smoke sure enough came the skittering shapes of lizard infantry he aimed and sprayed a long burst through them fighting to hold the tommy guns muzzle down the lizards went over like tenpins he wasnt sure how manyif anyhed hit and how many were just ducking for cover off to one side the bar opened up might have known dracula was too sneaky to kill mutt said to nobody in particular if the lizards had any brains theyd try a rush and support advance to flush him and szabo out in the open he aimed to throw a monkey wrench into that scheme from a different window he fired at the bunch he thought would be moving he caught a couple of them on their feet they went down scrambling for cover in the tworeelers this is about the time the us cavalry gallops over the horizon lucille potter said as the lizards started shooting back right about now miss lucille id be glad to see em and thats a fact mutt said draculas bar was stuttering away and he had his tommy gun though he didnt have as many clips as he would have liked but only a couple of rifles had opened up with them rifles didnt add a whole lot as far as firepower went but they covered places the automatic weapons couldnt reach and denied the lizards the cover theyd need to flank out mutt and szabo and then just as if it had been a tworeeler the cavalry did come riding to the rescue a platoon of shermans rumbled through the streets of danforth a couple of them so fresh off the assembly line that only dust not paint covered the bright metal of their armor machine guns blazing and cannon firing high explosive they bore down on the lizard infantry the lizards didnt have armor with them theyd been more cautious about committing tanks to action since the americans started using bazookas they did have antitank rockets of their own though and quickly turned two shermans into blazing wrecks then the tanks shelled the rocketeers and after that they had the fight pretty much their own way most of the lizards died in place a few tried to flee and were cut down a couple came out with their hands up theyd learned the americans didnt do anything dreadful to prisoners mutt let out the catamount screech his grandfathers had called the rebel yell the house in which he and lucille potter sheltered was pretty well ventilated but the yell echoed in it just the same he turned around and hugged her this time he meant business he kissed her hard and his hands cupped her backside as she had when hed taken out the lizard tank with her bottle of ether she let him kiss her but she didnt do anything in the way of kissing back whats the matter with you he growled dont you like me i like you fine mutt she answered calmly i think you know it too youre a good man but that doesnt mean i want to sleep with youor with anybody else if thats what youre wondering over the years mutt had done a fair number of things hed enjoyed at the time but wasnt proud of afterwards forcing a woman who saidand obviously meantshe wasnt interested wasnt any of them though frustrated almost past words he said well why the dickens not youre a finelookin lady it aint like you dont have any juice in you thats so she said and then looked as if she regretted agreeing by jesus mutt murmured in a lifetime knocking around the united states hed seen and heard about a lot of things nobody who stayed on a mississippi farm ever dreamt of dont tell me youre one o themwhat do they call em lizzies is that right its close enough anyhow lucilles face shut up as tight as a poker playersespecially one who was raising on a busted flush pokerfaced still she said okay mutt what if i am she hadnt said she was not quite but she didnt deny it either only waited to see what hed say next he didnt know what the hell to say hed run across a few queers in his time but to find out somebody he liked not just because he wanted to lay her but on account of who she wasand he couldnt be fooled on something like that not when theyd been living in each others pockets through months of grinding combatwas one of these creatures almost as alien as a lizard that was a jolt no doubt about it i dunno he said at last reckon ill keep my mouth shut last thing i want to do is cost us a medic as good as you are she startled him immensely by leaning forward and kissing him on the cheek an instant later she looked contrite im sorry mutt i dont want to play games with you but thats one of the kindest things anybody ever said about me if im good at what i do why should the rest matter words like unnatural and perverted flashed across his mind but hed had plenty of chances to see that lucille was good peoplesomebody you could trust your life to in the most literal sense of the words i dunno he repeated but it does somehow just then the lizards started shelling the front part of danforth again probably sowing their little artillerycarried mines to keep the shermans from pushing farther south anytime soon mutt had never imagined he could be relieved to take cover from a bombardment but right at that moment he was liu han hated going out to the market people looked hard at her and muttered behind her back nobody had ever done anything to herthe little scaly devils were powerful protectorsbut the fear was always there little devils paced through the prison camp marketplace too they were smaller than people but nobody got too close to them wherever they went they took open space with them it was more often than not the only open space in the crowded market the baby in her belly gave her a kick even the loose cotton tunic she wore couldnt disguise her pregnancy any longer she didnt know what to feel about bobby fiore sadness that he was gone and worry about whether he was all right mingled with shame over the way the scaly devils had forced them together and a different sort of shame at conceiving by a foreign devil she let the market din wash over her and take her away from herself cucumbersa fellow pulled a couple of them from a wicker basket tied round his middle they were long and twisty like snakes a few feet away another man cried the virtues of his snake meat cabbages fine purple horseradish pork the man selling disjointed pieces of pig carcass wore shorts and an open jacket his shiny brown belly showed through and looked remarkably like one of the bigger cuts of meat he had on display liu han hesitated between his stall and the one next to it which displayed not only chickens but fans made from chicken feathers glued to brightly painted horn frames make up your mind foolish woman somebody screeched at her she hardly minded that at least was an impersonal insult she went up to the man who sold chickens before she could say anything he quietly told her take your business somewhere else i dont want any money from the running dogs of the imperialist scaly devils a communist she thought dully then anger flared in her what if i tell the scaly devils who and what you are she snapped youre not the dowager empress to put me in fear with a word he retorted if you do that i will find out about it and disappear before they can take meor if i dont my family will be looked after but youyouve been a quiet running dog so far but if you begin to sing as if you were in the peking opera i promise youll be sorry for it now go liu han went a stone in her heart even buying pork at a good price from the fellow in the stupid jacket didnt ease her spirit nor did the cries of the merchants who hawked amber or slippers with upturned toes or tortoiseshell or lace or beaded embroidery or fancy shawls or any of a hundred other different things the little scaly devils were generous to her why not when they wanted to learn from her how a healthy woman gave birth for the first time in her life she could have most of the things she wanted contrary to what shed always believed that didnt make her happy a little boy in rags flashed by running dog he squealed at liu han and vanished into the crowd before she got a good look at his face his mocking laughter was all she could report to the scaly devils assuming she was foolish enough to bother the baby kicked her again how was he supposed to grow up when everyone down to street urchins scorned his mother so the easy tears of pregnancy filled her eyes spilled down her cheeks she started back toward the house shed shared with bobby fiore though it was a house finer than the one shed had back in her own village it seemed as empty as the gleaming metal chamber in which the little scaly devils had imprisoned her on their plane that never came down the resemblance didnt end there either like that metal chamber it wasnt a home in any proper sense of the word but a cage where the little devils kept her while they studied her suddenly she had had all the study she could stand maybe no scaly devils waited back at the house right now to take photographs of her and touch her in intimate places and ask her questions that were none of their business and talk among themselves with their hisses and pops and squeaks as if she had no more mind of her own than the kang that kept her warm at night but so what if they werent there now they would be later today or tomorrow or the day after that back in her village the kuomintang was strong even thinking about being a communist was dangerous though communist armies had done more than most in fighting the japanese bobby fiore hadnt had any use for the reds either but hed willingly gone with them to take a poke at the scaly devils she hoped he still lived even if he was a foreign devil he was a good manbetter to get along with than her chinese husband had been if the communists had fought the japanese if bobby fiore had gone with them to raid the little devils they were likely to be doing more against the devils than anyone else i owe them too much to let them do whatever they want with me forever liu han muttered instead of going on to her house she turned around and went back to the stall of the fellow who sold chickens and chicken feather fans he was haggling with a skinny man over the price of a couple of chicken feet when the skinny man sullenly paid his price and went away he gave liu han an unfriendly look what are you doing here i thought i told you to go away you did she said and i will if thats what youreally want but if you and your friendsshe did not name them out loudare interested in knowing more about the little scaly devils who come to my hut youll ask me to stay the poultry sellers expression did not change youll have to earn our trust show youre telling the truth he said his voice still hostile but he did not yell for liu han to leave i can do that she said i will maybe well talk then he said and smiled for the first time xvi moishe russie paced back and forth in his cell it could have been worse he could have been in a nazi prison they would have had special fun with him because he was a jew to the lizards he was just another prisoner to be kept on ice like a bream until they figured out exactly what they wanted to do with himor to him he supposed he should thank god they werent often in a hurry theyd interrogated him after he was caught on the whole hed spoken freely he didnt know many names so he couldnt incriminate most of the people whod helped himand he figured they were smart enough not to stay in any one place too long either the lizards hadnt bothered questioning him lately they just held him fed him at least as much as hed been eating while he was free and left him to fight boredom as best he could they didnt put prisoners in the cells to either side of his or across from it even if they had neither the lizard guards nor their polish and jewish flunkies allowed much chatter the lizard guards ignored him as long as he didnt cause trouble the poles and jews who served them still thought he was a child molester and a murderer i hope they cut your balls off one at a time before they hang you a pole said hed given up answering back they didnt believe him anyhow some blankets a bucket of water and a tin cup another bucket for slopssuch were his worldly goods he wished he had a book he didnt care what it was he would have devoured a manual on procedures for inspecting light bulbs as things were he stood he sat he paced he yawned he yawned a lot a polish guard stopped in front of the cell he shifted the club he carried from right hand to left so he could take a key out of his pocket on your feet you he growled they got more questions for you or maybe theyre just gonna chop you up to see how you got to be the kind of filthy thing you are as russie got up he remembered there were worse things than boredom interrogation was one of them not so much for what the lizards did as for the neverending terror of what they might do crash something hit the side of the prison like a bomb at first as he staggered and clapped hands to ears moishe thought that was just what it was that the germans had landed one of their rockets right in the middle of lodz then another crash came hard on the heels of the first it flung the pole headlong against the bars of russies cell the guard went down stunned and bleeding from the nose the key flew from his hand in a spy story moishe thought it would have had the consideration to land in his cell so he could grab it and escape instead it bounced down the hall impossibly far out of reach still another crashthis one knocked russie off his feet and showed daylight through a hole in the far wall as he curled up into a frightened ball he wondered what the devil was going on the nazis couldnt have fired three rocket bombs so fast could they or was it artillery how could they have brought artillery through lizard held territory to shell lodz his ears rang but not so much that he couldnt hear the nasty chatter of gunfire a lizard ran down the hall carrying one of his kinds wicked little automatic rifles he fired out through the hole the shells had made in the wall whoever was outside returned fire the lizard reeled back red red blood spurting from several wounds someonea humanburst in through the hole another lizard came running up the man cut him down he had a submachine gun that at close range was as lethal as anything the aliens used more men rushed in behind the first one of them shouted russie here moishe yelled he uncoiled and scrambled to his feet hope suddenly overpowering fright the fellow whod called his name spoke in oddly accented yiddish stand back cousin im going to blow the lock off your door spy stories came in handy after all russie pointed to the floor of the corridor no need theres the key this mamzerhe pointed to the unconscious polewas about to take me away for more questions oy wouldnt that have been a ballsup the last wasnt in yiddish moishe wasnt sure what language it was in he had precious little time to wonder the man grabbed the key turned it in the lock he yanked the door open come on lets get out of here moishe needed no further urging alarms were clanging somewhere off in the distance power here seemed to be out as he ran toward the hole in the outer wall he asked who are you anyway im a cousin of yours from england david goldfarbs my name now cut the talk will you moishe obediently cut the talk bullets started flying again he ran even harder than he had before behind him somebody screamed the medical student part of him wanted to go back and help the rest made him keep runningout through the hole out through the open space around the prison out through a gap in the razor wire out through the screaming gaping people in the street there are machine guns on the roof he gasped why arent they shooting at us snipers his cousin answered good ones shut up keep running we arent out of this mess yet russie kept running then abruptly his companions those who survived threw away their weapons as they rounded a corner when they rounded another corner they stopped running david goldfarb grinned now were just ordinary peopleyou see i see moishe answeredand once it was pointed out to him he did it wont last said one of the gunmen whod been with goldfarb theyll turn this town inside out looking for us somebody kills a lizard they get nasty about that his teeth showed white through tangled brown beard which means its a good idea to get away from the net before they go fishing goldfarb said cousin moishe were going to take you back to england without rivka and reuven i wont go as soon as the words were out of his mouth russie realized how selfish and boorish they sounded these men had risked their lives to save him their comrades had died who was he to set conditions on what they did but he didnt apologize because however selfish what hed said sounded he also realized hed meant it he waited for goldfarb to scream at him and for the other manwho looked tough enough for anything no matter how desperate to pound him senseless and then do whatever he chose instead they just kept walking along easygoing as if hed made a remark about the weather goldfarb said thats taken care of theyll be waiting for us along the way thatswonderful moishe said dazedly too much was happening too fast for him to take it all in he let his cousin and the other fighter lead him through the streets of lodz while he tried to adjust to the heady joys of freedom it made him giddy as if hed gulped down a couple of shots of plum brandy on an empty stomach a tattered poster with his face on it peered down from a wall he rubbed his chin the lizards hadnt let him use a razor so his beard was coming back it wasnt as long as hed worn it before but pretty soon hed look like his pictures again dont worry about it goldfarb said when he fretted out loud once we get you out of town well take care of things like that how will you get me out moishe asked dont worry about it goldfarb repeated his nameless friend laughed and said asking a jew not to worry is like asking the sun not to rise you can ask all you like but that doesnt mean youll get what you ask for that was apt enough to make moishe laugh too before long they walked into a block of flats lodz was already beginning to boil around them the sound of explosions and gunfire carded a long way rumor rippled out from around the prison almost as fast as the racket the two women who went into the building just behind moishe and his companions were already wondering who had escaped if only they knew he thought dizzily they climbed stairs the fellow without a name rapped on a doorone two one again spy stuff david goldfarb muttered the other fellow poked him in the ribs with an elbow hard enough to make him give back a pace the door opened come in come in the skinny little bald man who greeted them looked like a tailor but tailors did not commonly carry submachine guns he looked them over lowered the weapon just you three where are the rest just us goldfarb answered a couple scattered off to the other hideyholes a couple others wont be going anywhere any more about what we figured the casual way he said that chilled russie his cousin went on were not hanging around here either you know you have what we need you need to ask with a scornful sniff the bald little man pointed to bundles on the couch therechange your clothes clothes are only part of it goldfarbs toughlooking friend said the rest is taken care of too the rest is taken care of the bald fellow sniffed again this time angrily we wouldnt be good for much if it werent would we who knows what were good for the nameless fighter answered but he shrugged off his shabby wool jacket and started unbuttoning his shirt moishe had no jacket to shrug off he shed with a long sigh of relief the clothes hed been wearing since he was captured their replacements didnt fit as well but so what they were clean good thing the lizards havent figured out prison uniforms theyd have made it harder for us to do a vanishing act with you goldfarb said as he too changed his yiddish was plenty fluent but full of odd turns of phrase he didnt seem to notice as if he was using it to express ideas that came first in english he probably was youre staying here right shmuel asked the nondescript little jew who kept the flat the nameless fighter now nameless no more nodded so did the little fellow who turned to moishe and goldfarb he handed each of them a thin rectangle of some shiny stuff about the size of a playing card moishe looked at his a picture that vaguely resembled him looked back from it the card gave details of a life hed never led the bald little man said dont pull these out unless you have to with luck youll be away before they do a proper job of cordoning off the city and without luck well buy a plot goldfarb said holding up his own card this bloke looks more like goebbels than he does like me best we could do the bald jew said with a shrug thats why you dont want to wave it around unless somebody asks for it but if somebody does he probably wont look at it hell feed it into a lizard machineand it shows youve been authorized for the past two weeks to leave lodz on a buying trip he clucked mournfully cost us plenty to pay off a pole who works for the lizards to make these for us and hed only take the best gold russie asked worse the fellow answered tobacco gold at least stays in circulation tobacco you smoke it and its gone tobacco goldfarb sounded even more mournful than the bald jew had what i wouldnt give for a fag its been a bloody long time russie didnt care one way or the other about tobacco hed never got the habit and his medical studies made him pretty sure it wasnt good for you but it did show how far the underground had gone to rescue him that warmed him especially since some people thought him a traitor for broadcasting for the lizards he said thank you more than i know how to tell you i shmuel cut him off listen youd better get out of here you want to thank us broadcast from england hes right david goldfarb said come on cousin standing around chattering doesnt up the chances of our living to collect an old age pensionnot that were in serious danger of it at any rate things being as they are out of the flat out of the block of flats they went as they walked north they listened to rumors swirl around them all the prisoners free the nazis did it my aunt saw a man in a german helmet half the lizards in lodz killed i heard my wifes brother says by tomorrow theyll be saying the lizards dropped an atomic bomb on this place goldfarb remarked dryly did you hear what he said someone going the other way exclaimed they used an atomic bomb to blow up the prison russie and goldfarb looked at each other shook their heads and started to laugh less than an hour had gone by since the first blast piat goldfarb called it which sounded more polish than either yiddish or english hit the prison but the streets heading out of the ghetto already had checkpoints on them the lizards and their human henchmen order service thugs and polish bullies had wasted not a moment some people took one look and decided they didnt need to leave after all others queued up to show they had the right moishe started to get into a line that led up to a couple of poles goldfarb pulled him out of it no no he said loudly come on over here this line is much shorter of course that line was much shorter at its head stood three lizards nobody in his right mind wanted to trust his fate to them when human beings were around humans might be thugs but at least they were your own kind of thugs but moishe couldnt drag goldfarb back from the line hed chosen without making a scene and he didnt dare do that convinced his cousin was leading them to their doom he took his place in the queue that led up to the aliens sure enough the wait to get to them was short a lizard turned one eye turret toward russie the other toward goldfarb you is he asked in bad yiddish he repeated the question in worse polish adam zilverstajn goldfarb answered at once using the name on his new forged identity card felix kirshbojm moishe said more hesitantly he waited for alarms to go off for guns to be pointed and maybe fired but the lizard just stuck out his hand and said card again goldfarb promptly surrendered his again moishe paused almost long enough to draw suspicion to himself before he handed his over the lizard fed goldfarbs card into a slot on a square metal box that sat on a table next to him the box gulped it down as if alive while still collaborating with the lizards russie had seen enough of their astonishing gadgetry to wonder if perhaps that wasnt so it spat out goldfarbs phony card the lizard looked at a displaylike a miniature movie screen moishe thoughtit held in its hand you go on business you be backseven days it said as it returned the card to moishes cousin thats right goldfarb agreed then russies card went into the machine he almost broke and ran as the lizard turned an eye turret toward the handheld display he was sure words like traitor and escapee showed up there but evidently they didnt for the lizard waited till the card came out again then said you go business seven days too yes moishe said remembering not to tack superior sir onto the end you both go seven days the lizard said you gohow to saytogether yes moishe repeated he wondered if the lizards were looking for people traveling in groups but the guard just handed him his card and got ready to receive the next set of people passing through the checkpoint david goldfarb indulged in the luxury of a long heartfelt whew as soon as theyd walked a couple of hundred meters past the guard and out of the ghetto whew did not seem enough to moishe gottenyu he said and then added i thought youd killed us both when you pulled me into that line with the lizards oh that now goldfarb looked jaunty no i knew just what i was doing there you could have fooled me no seriouslylook at it if we go through a line with poles or those order service wouldbe nazi shmucks theyre liable to look at the pictures on the cardsand if they do that we re dead no matter what the machine tells them theyll see we dontreally look like the pictures on the cards or not enough anyhow but the lizards cant tell you from hedy lamarr without the machine to do it for them thats why i wanted them to check us moishe thought it over and found himself nodding cousin he said admiringly youve got chutzpah never get anywhere with the girls if i didnt goldfarb said grinning you ought to see a chap i served with named jerome joneshe had crust enough to make a pie he did watching the way his cousin smiled put moishe in mind of his mother but goldfarb also had an alienness about him that went deeper than the curious expressions peppering his yiddish he wasnt automatically wary the way polish jews were so thats what growing up really free does for you moishe murmured what did you say never mind where will we pick up rivka and reuven russie wondered if goldfarb had lied to him about them just to get him moving the man had the gall for it no two ways about that but goldfarb just asked are you sure you want to find out suppose the lizards catch you but kill me the less you know the less they can squeeze out of you they arent as good at squeezing as youd think moishe said they didnt come close to getting everything i know out of me nevertheless he didnt push the question mordechai anielewiczs jewish fighters had had that dontaskifyoudontneedtoknow rule too which meant you wereyou area soldier goldfarb nodded raf actually but yes and you were going to be a doctor before the nazis came my father used to beat me over the head with that all i ever wanted to do was fiddle around with the insides of radios and such made me a valuable piece of goods when the war came though they put me into radar training straightaway and i kept an eye on the jerries all through the blitz russie didnt follow all of that a couple of key words were in english of which he knew next to nothing he was content just to walk along for a while savoring his freedom and daring to think about staying free a while longer if his accomplished cousin was from the british military maybe a submarine like the one anielewicz had sometimes summoned lay waiting off the polish coast he started to ask about that then changed his mind if he didnt need to know what was the point in trying to learn goldfarb hurried up krawiecka street he looked nervously to the right and left as he did finally he said the sooner were out of lodz the better ill like it outside the ghetto a jew really sticks out around here doesnt he well of course moishe answered then he realized it wasnt of course not to his cousin years of living in the ghetto and before that in a poland that didnt know how to deal with its three million jews had made him so used to being the suspected and despised outsider that he took it for granted being reminded things werent like that all over the world came as a distinct shock must be nice seeming like everyone else he said wistfully you mean instead of getting slammed down just for being a jew david goldfarb said russie nodded his cousin went on it is i suppose theres a good deal of small stuff left to fret over people have a way or taking for granted that youre cheap or not very brave or what have you but next to what ive seen here what my folks leftblimey that wasnt yiddish either but moishe had no trouble figuring out what it meant if the submarine came if it whisked him and his family off to englandwould he be able to deal with so much freedom learning a new language as a grown man wouldnt come easy for him thinking thus for a moment he was almost paralyzed with dread at the prospect of abandoning everything familiar no matter how unpleasant it could be then he and goldfarb strode past a couple of polish housewives chattering on a front porch the two pretty women stopped talking and stared at them as if they expected the plague to break out in their wake they kept on staring until the men had gone a block farther down the road moishe sighed no maybe i wont be sorry to get out of here after all i know what you mean his cousin answered everyone here keeps thinking were about to make off with the good silver i shant be sorry to see the last of that myself if all goes well we should have you and yours back in england in a couple of weeks how does that strike you the word that comes to mind is mechaieh moishe said his cousin grinned and clapped him on the back hurry up ludmila gorbunova shouted if i dont get the ammunition into my machine gun how am i supposed to shoot it at the lizards patience patience georg schultz answered as he checked the belts that fed the guns if your weapon jams when youre taking it into action you might as well not have it do things right at first and you wont be sorry later nikifor sholudenko paused before he passed schultz another belt the soviet union is not your country he observed to you it means little if sukhinichi falls to us it means moscow is in danger just as it was from your fascists in screw moscow schultz answered sending the nkvd man a glance redolent of dislike if sukhinichi falls it probably means i get shot you think that doesnt matter to me youre crazy enough you two ludmila said shed been saying that ever since the german and the security man met shed kept them from trying to kill each other on the tramp back to the village where theyd shot it out with the antitolokonnikovites she still didnt know who tolokonnikovs was or what sort of faction he led and sometimes kept them from sniping at each other with words for as long as half an hour you be careful up there schultz told her in the nottobedenied tones of a field marshal giving ordersor a man who wanted to go to bed with her she knew which only too well wanting to go to bed with her was the only thing on which he and sholudenko agreed the air base had needed a political officer when sholudenko got there but that wasnt the only reason sholudenko had arranged to stay on here even if it was the official one in a way climbing into the cockpit of her new u was a relief she didnt have to argue with the lizards or cajole them along all they wanted to do was kill her avoiding that was a lot simpler than the passes from schultz and sholudenko she kept ducking schultz spun the prop hed been right about one thingcolonel karpov had been so glad to have his mechanical talents back that hed overlooked the little matter of going off without bothering to get permission first that schultz had actually returned with ludmila hadnt hurt there either the kukuruzniks little fivecylinder radial buzzed into life it had a note slightly different from the one shed grown used to but schultz insisted that was nothing to worry about on engines if not many other places ludmila trusted his word she released the brake gave the biplane full throttle and bounced across the stillmuddy steppe till she was airborne she stayed at treetop height as she flew south and west toward the front one rule the red air force had learned the higher you flew against the lizards the less likely you were to come back the front south of sukhinichi was not far away and got closer all the time whether she was in the air or not with the coming of good weather the lizards were on the move again pushing through german remnants and soviet troops alike as they advanced on moscow by crackling shortwave stalin had ordered ni shagu nazad not one step back giving the order and being strong enough to make sure it was obeyed were not the same thing worse luck the red army had brought up all the artillery it could to try to stem the lizard tide ludmila flew past barechested young men in khaki trousers serving their guns for all they were worth when a cannon or sometimes a whole battery discharged close by the blast made the u tremble in the air like a falling leaf caught by a gust of wind the gun crews waved at her plane not because they knew she was a woman but for joy at seeing anything humanbuilt in the air tanks rumbled along the dirt roads some of them spewed smoke to help mask their positions ludmila hoped that would do some good going up against lizard armor was worse than facing the germans the nazis had had better tactics but worse tanks the lizards tanks were better than the ts and kvs that were the pride of soviet armored forces and their tactics werent bad either a curtain of dust thrown up from shell hits marked the front ludmila took a deep breath as she drew near every second she spent in and around that curtain or on the other side was a second in which she was hideously more likely to die than at any other time her bowels clenched and loosened her bladder felt very full though it wasnt she noticed none of that not consciously what she did notice was the soviet line beginning to go to pieces along with the dust smoke from burning tanks filled the air and made her cough and choke when she flew through plumes of it she didnt see many tanks right at the front to try to halt the lizards advance most either hunkered down where they were or pulled back toward sukhinichi ludmila shook her head that wasnt going to hold things together it would probably end up costing the vital railway center too the germans had had surprisingly few tanks but theyd massed them and used them aggressively against soviet troops shed thought the red army had grasped the principle it didnt seem that way not from what she was seeing here without armor to support them the russian infantrymen who huddled in their trenches had to take whatever the lizards dished out without much hope of hitting back she wondered how long they would stay and fight even with nkvd men with submachine guns back of the line to discourage them from doing anything else as the soldiers at the guns had some of the infantry waved as she flew over them she wondered if the young peasants and workers down below appreciated the irony of her sallying forth against the lizards in an aircraft that had seemed obsolete even against the nazis she doubted it all they saw was a plane with red stars on the fuselage and wings that was enough to give them hope then she was on the other side of the line the side the lizards controlled the ground below her resembled nothing so much as the craters of the moon shed once examined in a science text the aliens were advancing through territory that had already been fought over if that bothered them they didnt show it pop pop a couple of bullets tore through the doped fabric hat covered the us wings ludmila grunted in dismay the only thing that would protect her was the aircrafts speed and the kukuruznik wasnt very fast off to one side a couple of kilometers she glimpsed the fierce tadpole shape of a lizard helicopter gunship she heeled he u away from it and dove even closer to the deck the gunship could fly rings around her and blow her out of the sky and painful experience had taught that the machine guns she carried wouldnt do anything more than scratch its paint luck stayed with her the helicopter continued on up toward he front without spying her and her turn brought her straight toward a convoy of lorriessome lizardmade others captured from the red army or the nazisalso moving up with troops and supplies she never would have spotted them if she hadnt had to evade the gunship with a joyful whoop she thumbed the firing button the kukuruznik jerked a little as its twin machine guns began to hammer away orange lines of tracers showed she was scoring hits a germanmade lorry suddenly became a ball of flame ludmila whooped louder lizards bailed out of vehicles and started shooting at her she got out of there as fast as she could after a good strafing run like that she could have flown back to her base and truthfully reported success but like most good combat pilots she lusted for more she buzzed on deeper into lizardheld territory back of the line fire came her way less often the lizards seemed less alert or maybe just hadnt counted on many human planes getting through she wished she were flying a pe bomber with a couple of thousand kilos of high explosive rather than a wheezing trainer that had had a brace of machine guns strapped onto it but then the lizards shot down pes with effortless ease she spied more lorrieshumanmade ones stopped to fuel up she raked them with machinegun fire and felt a mix of terror and crazy exhilaration when flames shot so high that she had to pull up sharply to keep from flying straight through them the machine guns had performed without a jam they usually did so she didnt know how much georg schultzs relentless perfectionism had to do with that but it couldnt have hurt she swung the u back toward the north she was low on fuel and shed used a lot of ammunition she was willing to bet schultz had spent the time she was flying methodically filling belts with bullets coming back she was fired on not only by the lizards but also by jittery soviet troops convinced anything in the air especially if it flew over them from the other side of the line had to be dangerous but the kukuruznik not least because it was so simple was a rugged machine unless you hit the engine or the pilot or were lucky enough to snap a control wire with a bullet you wouldnt hurt it much ludmila flew over advancing lizard tanks they were across a small river whose line the soviets had been holding when shed gone out on her attack run an hour or so before she bit her lip it was as shed feared in spite of everything the red army could do in spite of her own pinprick successes inside lizardheld territory the local position was deteriorating sukhinichi would fall and after that only kaluga stood between the lizards and moscow the u bounced to a stop a couple of groundcrew men lugged jerricans of petrol toward the airplane squelching through mud that was still pretty thick behind them came georg schultz ammunition belts draped across his chest so that he resembled nothing so much as a cossack bandit he took a chunk of black bread from a pocket of the german infantry blouse he still wore held it out to ludmila khleb he said one russian word hed mastered spaseboshe answered and took a bite right in back of schultz slogged nikifor sholudenko maybe he didnt want the german spending even a moment alone with her because they were rivals or maybe just because he was nkvd either way ludmila was glad to see him he was someone to whom she could report which meant she wouldnt have to hunt up colonel karpov or could she the air base looked like an anthill somebody had kicked with people running every which way to no apparent purpose before she could ask any questions schultz spread his arms wide and exclaimed bolshoye drapbig skedaddle that was ironically the same term the russians had used to describe the flight of bureaucrats from moscow when it looked as if the germans would capture the capital in october ludmila wondered if schultz was using it with malice aforethought that however mattered relatively little skedaddle ludmila said in dismay were puffing out of here we are indeed nikifor sholudenko said orders are to shorten consolidate and strengthen the defensive front he didnt bother to add that that was a euphemism for retreat just as severe fighting meant a battle were losing ludmila knew that as well as he did so very likely did georg schultz ludmila said may i fly another mission before we pull back i stung them the last time they hardly had any air defenses set up who can defend against one of these things schultz said in german setting an affectionate hand on the us clothcovered fuselage they peep in through the keyhole when youre taking a leak sholudenko snorted at that but to ludmila he shook his head colonel karpovs orders are that we leave now they came in just after you took off if you hadnt been airborne we probably would have already cleared out where are we going ludmila asked the nkvd man pulled out a scrap of paper glanced down at it theyre setting up a new base at collective farm bearing distance fiftytwo kilometers ludmila translated distance and bearing into a dot on the map thats right outside kaluga she said unhappily just west of it as a matter of fact sholudenko agreed were going to fight the lizards house by house and street by street in sukhinichi to delay them while we prepare new positions between sukhinichi and kaluga then at need we will fight house by house in kaluga i hope the need does not arise he stopped there not even an nkvd man answerable to no one at the air base but himself and perhaps for something particularly heinous colonel karpov wanted to say too much but ludmila had no trouble reading between the lines he didnt expect whatever makeshift line the red army would set up north of sukhinichi to hold the lizards he didnt expect to hold them at kaluga either not by the sound of what he said and between kaluga and moscow lay only plains and forestno more cities in which to slow down and maul the invaders were in trouble georg schultz said in german ludmila wondered at his naivete in speaking so freely the nazis might not have the nkvd but they certainly did have the gestapo didnt schultz know you werent supposed to open your mouth where people you couldnt trust were listening sholudenko gave him an odd look the soviet union is in trouble he conceded no more so than germany however and no more so than any of the rest of the world before schultz could answer colonel karpov came running up the airstrip shouting get out get out lizard armor has broken through west of sukhinichi and theyre heading this way we have maybe an hour to get clearmaybe not too get out wearily ludmila climbed back into the little kukuruznik groundcrew men turned the plane into the wind georg schultz spun the twobladed wooden prop the engine reliable even if puny caught at once the biplane rattled down the runway and hopped into the air ludmila swung it northeast toward collective farm schultz sholudenko and karpov stood on the ground waving to her she waved back wondering if she would ever see them again suddenly instead of being the one who flew dangerous combat missions she was the one who could escape the oncoming lizards if they were only an hour away they had a good chance of overrunning the humans trying to escape from the air base she checked her airspeed indicator and her watch at the us piddling turn of speed collective farm was about half an hour away she hoped shed be able to spot the new base and then hoped she wouldnt if the maskirovka was bad the lizards would notice it of course if the maskirovka was good shed fly around and around and probably have to set down in the wrong place because she was running out of fuel airspeed indicator watch and compass were not the most sophisticated navigational instruments around but they were what she had a lizard warplane shot by far overhead the howl of its jet engines put her in mind of wolves deep in the forest baying at the moon she patted the fabric sides of her u it was also an effective combat aircraft no matter how puny and absurd alongside the jet it had seemed puny and absurd alongside an mel too she was still flying along when the lizard plane came shrieking back on the reciprocal to its former course she wasnt even done shifting bases and it had already finished its mission of destruction speed the word tolled in ludmilas mind a mournful bell the lizards had more of it at their disposal than people did their tanks rolled faster their planes flew faster because of that they held the initiative at least while the weather was good fighting them was like fighting the germans only worse nobody ever won a war by reacting to what the other fellow did a bullet cracked past her head rudely slaughtering that line of thought she shook her fist at the ground not that it would do any good the stupid muzhik down there was no doubt convinced that anything so clever as an airplane had to belong to the enemy had stalin had the chance to continue peacefully building socialism in the soviet union such ignorance might have become a thing of the past in a generations time as it was a peasant working in a newly sown field of barley took off his jacket and waved it as she buzzed over him the jacket had a red lining ludmila started to fly on by then exclaimed bozhemoi im an idiot the red air force wouldnt send up a flare literally or figuratively to let her know exactly where the new base was if they did the lizards would make sure said base didnt last long she could credit good navigationor more likely good luckfor finding her target at all she wheeled the kukuruznik through the sky as she bled off speed and what little altitude she had she spotted marks that cut across plowed furrows they told her where planes were landing and taking off she brought the u around one more time landed it in more or less the same place as if by magic men appeared where she had been willing to swear only grain grew they sprinted toward the biplane bawling out out out ludmila scrambled out as her booted feet dug into the stillmuddy ground she began senior lieutenant gorbunova reporting as tell us all that shit later said one of the fellows who was hauling the u away toward concealment though of what sort ludmila couldnt imagine he turned to a comrade tolya get her under cover too tolya needed a shave and smelled as if he hadnt seen soap and water in a long time ludmila didnt hold it against him she was probably just as rank but didnt notice it on herself any longer come on comrade pilot tolya said if he noticed she was a woman or cared he didnt let on some of his friends unrolled a broad stretch of matting that so cunningly mimicked the surrounding ground she hadnt even noticed it she was glad she hadnt tried taxiing across it it covered a trench wide and deep enough to swallow an airplane as soon as the kukuruznik vanished into the trench the mats went back on tolya led ludmila toward some battered buildings perhaps half a kilometer away we dont have to do anything special for people he explained not with the stuff for the kolkhozniki still standing ive flown from bases where people lived underground too ludmila said we didnt have much digging time here her guide said and machines come first somebody unrolled another strip of matting and ducked under it carrying a lighted torch is he starting a fire down there ludmila asked tolya nodded why she said more maskirovka he answered we found out the lizards like to paste things that are warm we dont know how they spot them but they do if we give them some they cant really hurt they waste munitions ludmila nodded ochen khoroshovery good even though they were alone in the middle of a field tolya looked around and lowered his voice before he spoke again comrade pilot youve flown over the front south of sukhinichi how did it look to you it was coming to pieces ludmila thought but she didnt want to say that not to someone she didnt know or trust who knew what he might be under his baggy peasantstyle tunic and trousers yet she didnt want to lie to him either carefully she replied let me put it this way im glad you dont have much in the way of heavy permanent installations here huh tolyas brow furrowed then he grunted oh i see we may have to move in a hurry is that it ludmila didnt answer she just kept walking toward what was left of the collective farms buildings beside her tolya grunted again and asked no more questions hed understood her notanswer exactly as she meant it alone on a bicycle with a pack on his back and a rifle slung over his shoulder jens larssen had spent a lot of time and covered a lot of miles that way ever since his plymouth gave up the ghost back in ohio hed gone to chicago and then all around denver on two wheels rather than four this though was different for one thing hed been on flat ground in the midwest not slogging his way up through a gap in the continental divide more important back then hed had a goal hed been riding toward the met lab and toward barbara now he was running away and he knew it hanford he said under his breath as far as he could tell they all just wanted an excuse to get him out of their hair youd think i was a goddamn albatross or something all right so hed made it real clear he wasnt happy about his wife shacking up with this yeager bum the way everybody acted it was his fault not hers shed run out on him and she got the sympathy when he tried to put some sense into her thick head it just isnt right he muttered she bailed out and im the one whos stuck in the plane wreck he knew his work had suffered since the met lab crew got to denver that was another reason everybody was glad to get him out of town on a bike if not on a rail but how was he supposed to keep his eyes on calculations or oscilloscope readings if they were really seeing barbara naked and laughing her legs wrapped around that stinking corporal as he bucked above her he reached back over his right shoulder with his left hand to touch the hard upthrust barrel of the springfield hed thought about lying in wait for yeager ending those terrible visions for good but he had enough sense left to realize hed probably get caught and even if he didnt blowing yeagers head off however delightful that might be wouldnt bring barbara back to him its a good thing im not stupid he told the asphalt of us under his wheels id be in a whole heap of trouble if i were he looked back over his shoulder he was thirty miles out of denver now and had gained a couple of thousand feet he could see not only the city but the plain beyond it that sloped almost imperceptibly downward toward the mississippi a long way away down in the flatlands the lizards held sway if he hadnt gone away from the city heading west he might have left heading east looked at rationally that made as little sense as ambushing sam yeager and jens knew it knowing and caring were two different critters instead of just getting his own back from yeager selling out the met lab project gave him vengeance wholesale rather than retail paying back all at once everybody whod done him wrong the idea had a horrid fascination to it the way the sharp edge of a broken tooth irresistibly lures the tongue feel it seems to say this isnt the way it should be but feel it anyhow pushing the bike along at feet took more out of him than making it go through the flat farming country of indiana he stopped every so often for a blow and just to admire the scenery ahead now the rockies loomed in every direction except right behind him in the clear thin air the snowcapped peaks and the deep green cloak of pine forest below them looked close enough to reach out and touch the sky was a deep deep blue with a texture to it hed never known before but for the sound of his own slightly winded breathing and the rustle of bushes in the breeze everything was quiet no buzz and wheeze of cars no growling rumble of trucks jens had passed a patient convoy of horsedrawn wagons four or five miles back and another coming into denver just as he was leaving but that was about it he knew the lizardinduced dearth of traffic meant the war effort was going to hell but it sure worked wonders for the tourist business except theres no tourist business any more either he said the habit of talking to himself when he was alone on his bike had come back in a hurry he swung his feet back up onto the pedals got rolling again in a couple of minutes he came up to a sign idaho springs miles that made him lift one hand from the handlebars to scratch his head idaho springs he muttered this was still colorado last i looked a few hundred yards ahead another sign said hot springs bathing vapor caves only that explained the springs but left him still wondering how a chunk of idaho had shifted south and east the town might have had a thousand people before the lizards came it straggled along a narrow canyon a lot of the houses looked deserted and the doors to several shops hung open jens had seen a lot of towns like that but if people had fled from everyplace where had they all gone his reluctant conclusion was that a lot of them were dead not everybody was gone from idaho springs a bald man in black overalls came out of a drygoods store and waved to larssen he waved back slowed to a stop where you from mister the local asked where you goin jens thought about replying that it was none of nosy parkers business but his eye happened to catch a bit of motion in a secondstory window that the breeze couldnt have caused a curtain shifted slightly perhaps from a rifle barrel stirring behind it the folk of idaho springs were ready to take care of themselves and so instead of getting smart jens said carefully im out of denver heading west on army business i can show you a letter of authorization if youd like the letter wasnt signed by groves the detested colonel hexhams john hancock was on it instead larssen had been tempted to wipe his backside with it now he was glad hed refrained black overalls shook his head nah you dont need to bother if you was one of them bad guys dont reckon youd be so eager to show it off the upstairs curtain twitched again as the notquiteunseen watcher drew back the bald guy went on anything we can do for you here jens stomach rumbled he said i wouldnt turn down some foodor even a drink if you folks have some hooch you can spare if you dont dont put yourselves out on account of me he added hastily in these times of scarcity people got mighty touchy about sharing things like liquor but the fellow in black overalls just grinned we can spare a bit i expect wed always stock up for the folks whod come to visit the springs you know and there aint been many o them lately you just want to ride on up ahead for another long block to the first street cafe tell mary there harvey says its okay to get you fed thanks uh harvey jens started the bicycle rolling again his back itched as he rode past the window where hed seen the curtain move but nothing at all stirred there now if hed satisfied harvey he must have satisfied the local hired gun too the idaho springs city hall was an adobe building with a couple of big millstones in the yard in front of it a sign identified them as coming from an old mexican arastra a mulepowered gadget that ground ore as an ordinary mill ground grain colorado had more history than jens had thought about the first street cafe by contrast looked like a bank it had its name spelled out in gold old english letters across a plate glass window jens stopped in front of it let down the kickstand on his bike he didnt think bike rustlers would be as big a worry here as they were in denver all the same he resolved not to eat with his back to the street he opened the door to the cafe a bell jingled above his head as his eyes adjusted to the gloom inside he saw the place was empty that amazed him because a wonderful smell filled the air from the room in back a womans voice called that you jack uh no jens said im a stranger here harvey was kind enough to say i could beg a meal from you if youre mary brief silence fell then yeah im mary just a second pal ill be right with you he heard footsteps back there then she came out behind the counter and looked him over hands on hips voice slightly mocking she went on so harvey says im supposed to feed you huh youre skinny enough you could do with some feeding thats for sure chicken stew do you it had betterits what ive got chicken stew would be swell thank you that was what was making the wonderful smell jens realized okay comin right up you can sit anywhere we aint what youd call crowded with a laugh mary turned and disappeared again jens chose a table that let him keep an eye on his bicycle plates clattered and silverware jingled in the back room mary softly sang something to herself that if he recognized the tune was a scandalous ditty hed last heard at the lowry field boq from a lot of women such lyrics would have scandalized him somehow they seemed to suit this mary on thirty seconds acquaintance she reminded him of sal the brassy waitress with whom among many others the lizards had cooped him up in a church in fiat indiana her hair was midnight black instead of sals peroxided yellow and they didnt look like each other either but he thought he saw in mary a lot of the same takeitorleaveit toughness sal had shown he still wished hed laid salespecially considering the way everything else had turned out it could have happened but hed figured barbara was waiting for him so hed stayed good shows how much i know he thought bitterly here you go pal mary set knife and fork and a plate in front of him fallingoffthebone chicken in thick gravy with dumplings and carrots the smell alone was enough to put ten pounds on him he tasted the taste was better than the smell he hadnt thought it could be he made a wordless fullmouth noise of bliss glad you like it mary said sounding amused a moment later she added listen its about dinnertime and like i said we aint exactly packed you mind if i bring out a plate and join you please he said why should i mind this is your place and your terrific food he thought he was going to say more but took another bite instead be right with you then she went back to get some stew of her own jens twisted his head to watch the way she walked like a woman he thought what a surprise her long gray wool skirt didnt show much of her legs but she had nice ankles he wondered if she was older or younger than he close either way she came back with not only a plate but two glass beer mugs filled with a deep amber fluid you look like you could use one of these she said as she sat down across the table from him just homebrew but its not bad joe simpson who makes it he used to work down at the coors brewery in golden so he knows what hes doin jens gulped at the beer it wasnt coorshed drunk that in denverbut it was a long way from bad oh lord he said ecstatically will you marry me she paused with a forkful of dumpling halfway to her mouth gave him a long appraising stare he felt himself turning red hed just meant it for a joke but maybe mary liked what she saw with a slightly wintry smile she answered i dunno but ill tell you this right nowits the best damn offer i had today and thats a fact hell if you was to tempt me with a cigarette who knows what i might up and do i wish i could he said regretfully for two different reasons i havent seen one in months yeah me neither she let out a long mournful sigh dont even know why i bothered to ask if you had smokes idve smelled em on you minute you walked in she took another bite then said mind if i ask you what your name is he told her and discovered in turn that her last name was cooley black irish he thought that fit her eyes were very very blue and her skin even fairer than his transparent white rather than pink she might not have been able to smell tobacco smoke on him but he was sure she could smell sweatgetting the bike here from denver had been work no two ways about it it didnt worry him the way it would have a year before he could smell her too and it was amazing how fast you got used to bodies that werent as clean as they might have been if most everybody needed a bath things evened out he finished the stew scraped up gravy with his fork until the plate was damn near clean again he didnt want to up and leave he felt full and happy and more nearly homey than he had since hed found out he didnt really have a home any more to give himself an excuse to stay a while longer he pointed to the mug and said could i have another one of those please that one hit the spot but it didnt quite fill it up sure thing pal ill get me one too she headed for the back room again this time jens thought she might have noticed him eyeing her as she walked but if she had she didnt let on she soon came back with the beer thanks he said as she sat down once more the scritch of the chair legs on the bricks of the cafe floor was almost the only sound jens asked how do you keep this place open with no customers what do you mean no customers youre here arent you her face was full of impudent amusement but yeah its pretty quiet at dinnertime supper now folks come for supper and i reckon the army would shoot me if i closed up shop i feed a lot of their people goin in and out of denver but then you said youre one of them right yeah jens took another pull at his beer he eyed her over the top of the mug bet you have to keep a shotgun by the till to keep some of the army guys from getting too friendly mary laughed spilling something hot on em mostly does the trick she drank too course the other thing is theres passes and then theres passes was that an invitation it sure sounded like one jens hesitated not least because the memory of his ignominious failure with that chippie back in denver still stung if he couldnt get it up twice running what was he supposed to do ride his bike off a cliff hed have plenty of chances pedaling along us through the mountains sometimes though leading with your chin was also a test of manhood he stretched out his foot under the table as if by accident the side of his leg brushed against hers if shed pulled away he would have risen from the table feeling foolish paid whatever she asked for the stew and the beer and headed west as it was she stretched too slowly and languorously he wondered if that sinuous motion came naturally or if shed seen it in the movies and practiced either way it made his heart thump like a drum he got up walked around the table and went down on one knee beside her it was a position in which he could have proposed although he had propositioning more in mind he got the idea though that she didnt want a lot of talk when he leaned forward and kissed her she grabbed his head and pulled him to her hard enough to mash his lips against her teeth he broke away for a moment partly to breathe and partly to let his mouth glide to her earlobe and then down the smooth side of her neck she arched her back like a cat and sighed deep in her throat his hand slid under her skirt her legs parted for him he was gently rubbing at the crotch of her cotton panties when he remembered that plateglass window idaho springs wasnt much of a town but anybody walking by could see in hell anybody walking by could walk in is there someplace we can go he asked hoarsely that seemed to remind her of the big window too come on back to the kitchen with me she said he didnt want to take his hand away but she couldnt stand up unless he did she paused only a moment to scoop up an old army blanket from behind the counter on which the cash register sat the stove in the kitchen a coalburner burning wood these days made the place hot but jens didnt care he was plenty hot himself he unbuttoned the buttons that ran down the back of marys white blouse and unhooked her brassiere her breasts filled his hands he squeezed not too hard she shivered in his arms he fumbled at the button that held her skirt closed undid it and yanked down the zipper beneath the skirt made a puddle on the floor she stepped out of it kicked off her shoes and pulled down her panties her pubic hair was startlingly dark against her pale pale skin she spread the blanket on the floor while he tried not to tear his clothes getting out of them in excess haste everything would be all right this timehe was sure of it everything was better than all right she moaned and gasped and called his name and squeezed him with those wonderful contractions of the inner muscles so he exploded in the same instant she did lord he said more an exclamation of sincere respect than a prayer she smiled up at him her faceprobably like hisstill a little slack with pleasure that was good she said and youre a gentleman you know that how do you mean he asked absently not quite listening he was hoping hed rise again but she answered you keep your weight on your elbows that made him not only laugh but also slip and stop being a gentleman at least by her standards she squawked and wiggled and he slid out of her when he sat back on his knees she reached for her discarded clothes so she hadnt been interested in a second round anyhow jens dressed even faster than hed undressed where before hed thought of nothing but getting his ashes hauled now he recalled how much a stranger he was here and what could happen to strangers when they fooled around with smalltown women another question formed in the back of his mind did mary expect to get paid if he asked and the answer was no hed mortally offend her if he didnt ask and the answer was yes hed offend her a different way one that might end up with his having a discussion he didnt want with the gunman behind that curtained window after a few seconds thought he found a compromise that pleased him what do i owe you for lunch and everything he asked if she wanted to interpret and everything to mean a couple of beers fine if she thought it meant more than that well okay too paper money mary asked jens nodded she said thirty bucks ought to cover it given the way prices had gone crazy since the lizards came that wasnt out of line for good chicken stew and two mugs of beer jens felt a surge of pride that she hadnt been a pro he dug in his pocket for a roll that would have astonished him in prewar days peeled off two twenties and gave them to her ill get your change she said and started for the cash register dont be silly he told her she smiled i said you were a gentleman listen mary when i come back from where im going he began with the sentimentality satiation and a bit of beer can bring she cut him off if i ever see you again tell me whatever youre going to tell me till then im not gonna worry about it the wars made everybody a little bit crazy isnt that the truth he said and thought about barbara for the first time since he decided to try playing footsie with mary take that bitch he said to himself aloud to mary he went on thanks for everythingand i mean for everything id better be heading out now she sighed i know nobody ever stays in idaho springsexcept me she took a couple of quick steps forward pecked him on the cheek and moved back again before he could grab her wherever it is youre going to you be careful hear me i will suddenly he wanted to stay in idaho springs a town hed never heard of until he started planning the trip for hanford amazing what a roll in the hay can do he thought but discipline held aided by doubts whether mary wanted anything more from him than that one roll either the doorbell jingled again as he walked out of the first street cafe he climbed onto his bicycle giddyap he muttered as he started to pedal the world wasnt such a bad old place after all he held that view even though he needed a solid day to get to the top of berthoud pass which wasnt much more than twenty miles beyond idaho springs he spent the night in the mining hamlet of empire then tackled the run to the pass the next morning he didnt think hed ever worked so hard in this life hed gained a thousand feet between idaho springs and empire and picked up another three thousand in the thirteen miles between empire and the top of the pass not only was he going up an eversteeper grade he was doing it in air that got thinner and thinner berthoud pass topped out at better than eleven thousand feet said a sign that announced the continental divide whew jens paused for a wellearned rest he was covered with sweat and his heart was beating harder than it had when hed come atop mary cooley a day before and most of a mile lower denver had taken some getting used to he wondered if anybody this side of an andean indian could hope to get used to the thin air of berthoud pass and yet signs on side roads pointed the way to ski resorts people actually came up here for fun he shook his head me im just glad its downhill from here on out he said swigging from one of the canteens hed filled back at bards creek in empire the kind folk there had also given him chunks of roast chicken to take along he gnawed on a drumstick as he tried without much luck to catch his breath he thought hed sweated out every drop of water in him but emptying the canteen proved him wrong he went off behind a bouldernot that anybody would have seen him if hed taken a leak right out in the middle of us and unzipped his fly the second he started to whiz he hissed in sudden and unexpected pain somebody might as well have lighted a match and stuck it up his joint and along with the urine came thick yellow pus what the hell is that he burst out and then a moment later as realization struck jesus christ ive got the fucking clap and where hed got it was painfully obvious in the most literal sense of the word not from the palm of his own hand that was for goddamn sure somebody whod lie down with one stranger passing through idaho springs he wondered how many strangers shed lain down with one of them had left her a present and shed been generous enough to give it to him thats great he said thats just wonderful here hed been on the point of rejoining the human race and this had to happen what hed hoped would be his ticket out of the black gloom that had seized him ever since barbara started laying that miserable ballplayer now turned out to be just another kick in the nutsagain literally he thought about turning the bicycle around and heading back toward idaho springs give that tramp a springfield thankyou he thought it would be an easy ride tooall downhill down that grade i could do twenty miles in twenty minutes he knew he was exaggerating but not by that much in the end he shook his head he didnt quite have coldblooded murder in him revenge was something else as far as he was concerned the whole human race had given him a screwing that made the dose hed got from mary cooley look like a pat on the back by comparison well not quite like a pat on the back as he climbed back onto the bicycle and started down the western slope of the rockies he was already dreading the next time hed have to piss back before the war sulfa had started knocking gonorrhea for a loop if any doctor so much as had the stuff these days hed be saving it for matters more urgent than a case of vd hanford jens muttered his breath smoked as the word escaped his lips even now the snow didnt lie that far above berthoud pass he pedaled harder to get warm again hed go on to hanford hed see what there was to see hed head back for denver and make his report he wondered how much good it would do or whether general leslie hotshot groves would pay the least bit of attention to it if he didnt like what he said none of the met lab people paid any attention to him these days they were probably too busy laughing at him behind his backand theyd laugh even harder when he came home with a drippy faucet so would barbara he wondered why he was wasting so much effort on sons of bitchesand one proper bitchwho wouldnt appreciate what he did if he went out and built a bomb singlehanded but hed said hed go and hed said hed come back and duty still counted for a lot with him hell hadnt been for duty id still be marriedyes sir i sure would he said theyd asked him to take word about the met lab from chicago to the governmentinhiding in west virginia and hed gone and done it but getting back hadnt been so easyand nobodyd bothered to ask his wife to keep her legs closed while he was gone so hed do what hed promised he hadnt made any promises about afterwards though he might take it into his head to ride east out of denver after all he picked up speed and he rolled downhill the thin air that blew against his face was spicy with the smell of the pines from the arapaho national forest all around or who knows he said i might even run into some lizards on the way to hanford theyd listen to me i bet what do you think the breeze didnt answer xvii atvar stood on sand looking out to sea this is a most respectable climate the fleetlord said decently warm decently dry the wind blew bits of grit into his eyes they bothered him not in the least his nictitating membranes flicked them out of the way without conscious thought on his part kirel came crunching up beside him even this northern africa is not truly home though exalted fleetlord he said it grows beastly cold at nightand winter here by the reports is almost as hideous as anywhere else on tosev not winter now for a moment atvar turned an eye turret toward the star the race called tosev as always its light struck him as too harsh too white not quite like the mellow sunshine of home i thought i would come down to the planets surface to see it at its best not its worst it is wellsuited to us here kirel admitted reports say the tosevites from europe therehe pointed north across the blue blue waterwho were fighting here when we arrived spent most of their time complaining about how hot and dry this part of their planet was even the natives dont care for the area during summer i have long since given up trying to fathom the big uglies tastes atvar said i would call them revoltingly ignorant except that were they only a little more ignorant our conquest would have been accomplished some time ago with the return of goodwell bearableweather to the lands of our principal foes the optimism i felt at the outset of our campaign here begins to return as well kirel said weve gained against the deutsche from both east and west were driving toward the capital of the sssr this moskva being an important rail and transport center along with an administrative site we continue to consolidate our hold on china despite bandits behind our lines and the americans fall back on the lesser continental land mass all true atvar agreed more happily than hed spoken of the military situation on tosev for some time i begin to hope the colonists may yet find a pacified world awaiting their settlement during the past winter in this hemisphere i wouldnt have put much credit in that nor i exalted fleetlord but if our munitions hold out i think we can successfully complete the conquest and settle down to administering rather than fighting atvar wished the shiplord hadnt added that qualifying phrase munitions were a continuing problem provident as usual the race had given the conquest fleet far more supplies and weapons systems than it had expected the warriors to need against the animalriding swordswinging savages the probes had shown inhabiting tosev the only troubles was that while atvar still reckoned the big uglies savages these days they made landcruisers fired automatic weapons and were beginning to fly jet aircraft and launch missiles what would have been lavish supplies against primitives had to be carefully rationed to keep from running out before the tosevites did atvar knew such care slowed the war effort but he lacked the munitions to shut down all the big uglies industrial areas and keep them shut down it does make things harder kirel said when atvar spoke of his concern still i count us ahead of the game in that weve not had to use nuclear weapons to any great degree wrecking the planet for the colonists would not leave our names in good odor in the annals of the race would not leave atvars name in good odor was what he meant though he was too polite to say so the fleetlord won the gloryif any glory was to be won if not he won the blame atvar didnt intend to win any blame some malesstraha for instance he observed would destroy tosev in order to conquer it they might as well be big uglies themselves for all the care they give to the future truth in your words exalted fleetlord kirel said he didnt care for straha either but he was also a thoroughgoing and conscientious officer so he added in truth though sometimes the tosevites are exasperating enough to make me wonder if we shouldnt exterminate them to keep them from troubling us later take this latest trouble withwhat was that big uglys name moishe russie oh yesthat atvar stuck out his tongue as at a bad smell i thought it had to be one of skorzenys exploits till intelligence reminded me russie belonged to one of the groups the deutsche were busy slaughtering until we came to tosev computer analysis makes it unlikely they would have tried to rescue one of their foes and i must say i agree with the machines here as do i kirel said with a hissing sigh but dont you think dismissing zolraag as governor of the province was a trifle harsh other than when dealing with russie and matters concerning him his record was good enough what hes cost us in those matters outweighs the rest atvar said he petitioned for a reconsideration i denied it we hold too much of tosev only because the locals submit to us out of fear if we are made to look like idiots we shall no longer be objects of fear and we shall have to divert forces from serious fighting to hold down areas now quiet no zolraag deserved sacking and sacking he got kirel cast his eyes to the ground in obedience to the fleetlords will another male came up to him and atvar one whose rather drab body paint made him seem out of place in such august company i greet you exalted fleetlord superb shiplord he said his words were perfectly correct his voice held the proper deference and yet atvar doubted his sincerity even so i greet you drefsab the fleetlord returned swinging one eye turret toward the intelligence operative drefsabs motions were quick and jerky with another male that might have betrayed a ginger habit but drefsab had moved that way even before he became addicted to the tosevite herb he had a big uglys restlessness trapped in a body that belonged to the race atvar said i presume you have come to report on the progress of your project inwhat is the name of that emperorless land nezavisna drzava hrvatskathe independent state of croatia drefsab answered his clawed fingers twitched restlessly a sure sign of disgust do you know exalted fleetlord there are times when the big uglies are as easy to manipulate as hatchlings still wet from the juices of their eggs i wish there were more such times kirel observed so do we all atvar said how have you managed to manipulate thecroats then theyre subordinates of the deutsche of course drefsab said the deutsche gained their support by giving them weapons and a free hand against their local enemies which essentially means anyone who lives nearby and is not a croat all i had to do was promise more and better weapons and an even freer hand and all at once they became most cooperative atvar felt faintly sick the guidelines on conquering tosev hed brought from home tomes composed thousands of years before after the race subjected first the rabotevs and then the hallessi suggested playing local groups against one another that sounded clean and logical the reality at least on tosev was apt to be sordid and soaked in blood drefsab went on when measured against tosev as a wholeas opposed to tosev as a hole which the emperor surely knows it isthe independent state of croatia is of no importance whatever being barely visible to the naked eye but its position gives it importance to the deutsche who do not want us gaining influence there at their expense and we have deliberately kept our effort there on a small scale confining it to the coastal city of split if you can damage the deutsche in this croatia place why make only a small effort kirel asked they are among the most dangerous of the tosevites to us though superb shiplord croatia has no great significance drefsab said and in any case i am seeking to elicit a specific response from the deutsche i dont want them flooding the area with males the terrain inland is mountainous and very bad for both armor and aircraft i want them to bring in their own specialists in sabotage and destruction and then i want to trap and destroy those specialists this is the lure you have prepared for skorzeny atvar exclaimed exalted fleetlord it is drefsab agreed as you pointed out he has embarrassed the race too many times soon he will do so no more eliminating skorzeny will go a long way toward getting rid of a weakness you just finished discussing exalted fleetlord kirel said excitedly big uglies around the world will have new reason to fear us once we take him out of play exactly so atvar turned his eye turrets back toward drefsab how fares your other battle the one against the tosevite herb you mean drefsab let out a long hiss i still taste now and again that far the addiction keeps its hold i continue to struggle not to let it master all my thoughts it has my body but i work to keep my mind as free as i can another lonely battle and a brave one atvar said so many yield both to ginger as free as i can i said drefsab answered dropping his eyes in deference he went on emperor knows the craving never leaves not altogether under the worst circumstances who knows what i might do for a taste for that very reason i attempt to avoid placing myself in those circumstances atvar and kirel also looked down at the yellowbrown sand when the fleetlord raised his eyes once more he said your discipline in the face of this adversity does you great credit because of it i am all the more certain you will succeed in eliminating that menace skorzeny exalted fleetlord it shall be done drefsab said vyacheslav molotov peered between the backs of stalin and his generals to study the map pinned down on the table in front of them from the way things looked soviet forces were effectively pinned down too comrade general secretary if moscow is to be held we need more men more armor more aircraft and above all more time to place our assets in proper position marshal georgi zhukov said absent these i do not see how we are to prevail few men dared speak so boldly to stalin zhukov had won the right by his successes first in mongolia against the japanese then defending moscow from the germans and finally in holding the lizards at bay through the winter just past stalin sucked on his pipe it was empty not even he could get tobacco these days he said georgi konstantinovich you saved this city once can you not do it again then i had fresh troops from siberia and the fascists were at the end of their tether zhukov answered neither applies here without some special miracle we shall be defeatedand the dialectic does not allow for miracles stalin grunted like so many revolutionaries especially georgian ones hed had seminary training now he said the dialectic may not allow for miracles comrade marshal but nevertheless i think i may be able to furnish you with one zhukov scratched his head he was a blocky roundfaced man much more typically russian in looks than the slender molotov what sort of miracle do you have in mind he asked molotov had wondered the same thing but all at once he knew fear coursed through him iosef vissarionovich we have discussed the reasons for not using this weapon he said urgently as far as i can see they remain valid that was as close as hed come in years to criticizing stalin the general secretary whirled around in surprise the pipe jumping in his mouth if the choice is between going down to defeat after using every weapon we have and yielding tamely without making every effort to hit back at the enemy i prefer the former zhukov didnt say anything ivan koniev asked what weapon is this if we have a weapon that will let us hurt the lizards i say we use itand to the devils grandmother with the consequences after zhukov koniev was the best general stalin had if he didnt know about the explosivemetal bomb project the secrecy was even more extraordinary than molotov had imagined he asked stalin may we speak freely of this weapon the pipe waggled again the time has come when we must speak freely of this weapon stalin answered he turned to koniev we have ivan stepanovich a bomb of the sort the lizards used on berlin and washington if they break through at kaluga and advance on moscow i propose to use it against them with his crooked front teeth koniev looked even more like a middleaged peasant than zhukov did bozhemoi he said softly if we have suchyou are right comrade general secretary if we have such bombs we should use them against the foe we have one such bomb molotov said and no prospect of getting more for some time no one knows how many of these bombs the lizards havebut we may be about to find out by experiment oh koniev said and then again in a whisper bozhemoi glancing nervously at stalin he went on this is a choice we must face with great seriousness one of these bombs by report can devastate a city as thoroughly as several weeks of unchallenged bombardment by an ordinary air force now the pipe worked angrily in stalins mouth before he could speak molotov said these reports are true comrade general i have seen photographs of both washington and berlin the melted stump of the washington monument he did not go on both from the remembered horror of the photographs and for fear of further antagonizing stalin but he was too afraid of what would happen if explosivemetal bombs began to be used freely to keep silent stalin paced back and forth he did not put down the incipient rebellion at once which was unusual maybe molotov thought he has doubts too stalin nodded to zhukov how say you georgi konstantinovich zhukov and stalin were the same sort of military team as molotov and stalin were a political team stalin the guiding will the other man the instrument that shaped the will to practical ends zhukov licked his lips plainly he was of two minds too at last he said comrade general secretary if we do not use this weapon i see nothing that will keep us from being overrun we may be able to continue partisan warfare against the lizards but not much more how can what they do to us after we use the weapon be worse than what they will do to us if we do not use it have you seen the pictures of berlin molotov demanded by then he was certain he had raised stalins wrath but he was too upset even to be frightened that was most unusual he would have to examine the feeling later no time now zhukov nodded comrade foreign commissar i have they are terrible but have you seen pictures of kiev after first the fascists and then the lizards went through it they are just as bad this bomb is a more efficient means of destruction but destruction will take place with it or without it as always molotov held his features immobile behind that unsmiling mask his heart sank it sank still further when general koniev asked how do we deliver this bomb can we drop it from an airplane if we can do that can we have some hope of putting an airplane where we most need it without the lizards shooting it down before we examine ways and means we still need to consider whether we should take this course molotovs impassive voice concealed the desperation that grew inside him stalin pretended he had not spoken and answered koniev instead comrade the bomb is too bulky to fit into any of our bombers and as you say the lizards shoot them down too readily to make them a good way to deliver it anyhow but planes are for taking bombs to an enemy who is far away if the enemy is instead coming to you he let the sentence hang molotov scratched his head not sure where stalin was going with that it must have made sense to zhukov and koniev though they both chuckled zhukov finished the phrase for stalinyou put the bomb where he will be and wait just so stalin said happily in fact we shall encourage him to concentrate in the sector where we shall place the bomb to make sure we do him as much damage as we can now it made sense to molotov too but it didnt t make him any happier koniev said two risks here the first is that the weapon will be discovered past maskirovka i dont see what we can do about that the second is that a weapon left behind wont go off when we want it to how do we make sure that does not happen we have multiple devices to set it off stalin answered one is by radio signal one is with a battery and one is with a clockwork manufactured by german prisoners in our employ he spoke utterly without irony molotov had no doubt those prisoners were no longer among the living they did not know to what device the clockwork would be affixed of course but it has been tested repeatedly it is most reliable just as well considering the use to which it will be put but koniev nodded you are right comrade general secretary however vile the fascists may be they make excellent mechanical devices this clockwork or one of the other means you noted should definitely be able to set off the bomb at a time of our choosing so the engineers and scientists have assured me stalin said with a slight purr in his voice that told what would happen if the engineers and scientists were wrong molotov would not have wanted to be in the shoes of the men who labored on that kolkhoz outside of moscow he pushed forward between zhukov and koniev both officers looked at him in surprise he was usually a good deal less assertive at military conferences which he attended mostly so he would know how developments on the battlefield affected the foreign policy of the soviet union he studied the map red units represented soviet forces green the lizards and occasional pockets of blue german troops that still fought on in the land they had invaded almost two years before even to his unsoldierly eye the situation looked grim the makeshift line patched together between sukhinichi and kaluga wasnt going to hold he could see that already not enough red army forces were in place to hold back the advancing lizard armor and once the line was pierced it was fall back or get cut off from your comrades and surrounded nazi panzers had done that to soviet troops again and again in the desperate summer and fall of nonetheless he stabbed a hesitant finger out toward kaluga cannot we stop them here he asked any effort it seems to me would be better than using the explosive metal bomb and facing whatever retaliation the lizards may choose to inflict even kaluga is too close to moscow far too close stalin said from airstrips behind the city they can smash us to pieces but he glanced at zhukov before he went on if they dont come past kaluga we shall not deploy the bomb that is an excellent decision iosef vissarionovich molotov said fulsomely zhukov and koniev both nodded molotov felt sweat under the armpits of his white cotton shirt he wondered if the tsars courtiers had had to tread so carefully in guiding their sovereign toward a sensible course he doubted itnot since the days of peter the great anyhow or maybe ivan the terrible when stalin spoke again his voice held some of the steel that had given iosef dzhugashvili his revolutionary sobriquet if the lizards advance past kaluga however the bomb will be used against them molotov looked to koniev and zhukov for support he found none the marshal and the general were both nodding perhaps without enthusiasm but without hesitation either molotov made his own head go up and down useless to argue with stalin he told himself useless to antagonize him he kept on nodding though in his heart winters chill had returned to oust the bright spring day heinrich jager glanced up at the sun before he raised the binoculars to his eyes in the afternoon the lizards down in split might have been able to spot reflections from the lenses the hillfortress of klis in which he sheltered sat only a few kilometers inland from the city on the adriatic coast the zeiss optics brought split leaping almost within arms length sixteen hundred years after it was built diocletians palace still dominated jagers view of the city fortress is a better word he thought actually it was in essence a roman legionary camp transformed into stone a rough rectangle with sides of to meters each one pierced by a single central gate three of the four towers at the corners of the rectangle were still standing jager lowered the binoculars not a place id care to try attacking even nowadays without heavy artillery on my side he said beside him otto skorzeny grunted i can see why you went into armor jager you have no head for the subtleties whats that hungarian curse a horses cock up your arse jager said both men laughed jager peered through the binoculars again even they couldnt make the lizard sentries on the walls of the palace and in positions around it seem much more than little moving antlike specks they were well sited no doubt about that in setpiece situations the lizards were quite competent skorzeny chuckled again i wonder if our scaly friends down there know that we have better plans of their strongpoint than they do they wouldnt have picked it if they did jager answered the plans hadnt come out of the archives of the german general staff but from the zeitschrift fur sudosteuropaischen archaologie skorzeny found that vastly amusing and called jager herr doktor professor every chance he got but even skorzeny had to admit that the quality of the plans couldnt have been better had military engineers drafted them i think youre right the ss man said to them its just the strongest building in town so naturally its where they moved in yes jager wondered if the lizards had a concept of archaeology word filtering out of intelligence said they were conservative by nature which hed already discovered from fighting against them and that theyd had their own culture as a going concern since the days when people were barbarians if not downright and barely upright savages that made jager think they wouldnt reckon any building a mere millennium and a half old worth studying as a monument of antiquity so what are you going to do about getting those cursed creatures out of there marko petrovic asked in fluent if accented german the croatian captains khaki uniform contrasted with the field gray the germans wore even though petrovic wore a uniform being around him made jager nervoushe seemed more bandit chief than officer his thick black beard only added to the effect it did not however completely conceal facial scars that made the one seaming skorzenys cheek a mere scratch by comparison skorzeny turned to the croat and said patience my friend we want to do the job properly not just quickly petrovic scowled his beard and scars made that scowl fearsome but the look in his eye chilled jager more to petrovic it wasnt just a military problem he took it personally that would make him a bold fighter but a heedless one jager performed the evaluation as automatically as he breathed whats the complication the croat demanded were in easy shelling range of the place now we move in some artillery open up and the idea of shelling a building that had stood since the start of the fourth century sickened jager but that wasnt why he shook his head artillery wouldnt root them all out captain and it would give them an excuse to expand their perimeter to take in these hills theyre staying in town id just as soon keep them down there as long as theyre willing to sit quietly you would not be bleating patience if split were a town in the reich petrovic said he had a point hitler waxed apoplectic over german territory lost jager was not about to admit that though he said we have a chance to drive them out not just annoy them i aim to make certain we dont waste it petrovic gloweredlike a lot of the locals he had a face that was made for glowering long and bony with heavy eyebrows and deep set eyesbut subsided skorzeny swatted him on the back and said dont you worry well fix those miserable creatures for you he sounded breezy and altogether confident if he convinced petrovic the croat captain did a good job of hiding it he said you germans think you can do everything youd better be right this time or he didnt say or what but walked off shaking his head jager was glad hed gone some of these croats are scary bastards he said in a low voice skorzeny nodded and anyone who worried him enough for him to admit it was a very rugged customer indeed jager went on wed better get the lizards out of there because if we dont ante pavelic and the ustashi will be just as happy in bed with them as with us as long as the lizards let them go on killing serbs and jews and bosnians and all their other neighbors skorzeny finished for him he didnt acknowledge that the germans had done the same thing on a bigger scale all through the east he couldnt have been ignorant of that he just deliberately didnt think about it jager had seen that with other german officers hed been the same way himself until he saw too much for him to ignore to him a lot of his colleagues seemed willfully blind skorzeny pulled a flask off his belt unstoppered it took a healthy belt and passed it to jager it was vodka made from potatoes that had died happy jager drank too zhiveli he said one of the few words of serbocroatian hed picked up skorzeny laughed that probably means something like heres hoping your sheep is a virgin he said which made jager cough and choke the ss man had another swig then stowed the flask again he glanced around with a skilled imitation of casual uninterest to make sure nobody but jager was in earshot then murmured i picked up something interesting n town yesterday ah jager said the ss colonel nodded youremember when i went into besancon i had the devils own time finding any lizards to do business with because one of their high muckymucks had gone through there and cleaned out a whole raft of the chaps whod gotten themselves hooked on ginger i remember your saying so yes jager answered it didnt seem to stop you he also remembered his own amazement and then awe as the bulky skorzeny writhed his way out of a lizard panzer several sizes too small for him thats my job not getting stopped skorzeny said with a mug grin that twisted the scar on his cheek turns out the name of that muckymuck was drefsab or something like that half the lizards in besancon thought he was wonderful for doing such a good job of clearing out the ginger lickers the other half hated him for doing such a good job what about it jager said then paused wait a minute let me guessthis drefwhoever is down there in split now youre clever you know that the ss man eyed him half in annoyance at having his surprise spoiled half in admiration i wasnt stupid to bring you along here either thats it exactly jager the very same lizard coincidence anything is possible skorzenys tone said he didnt believe it for a minute but by what he did back in france hes got to be one of their top troubleshooters and there arent any ginger lickers down there the locals would be selling to them if there were and the ten kilos i brought with me is gathering dust here in klis and if its not about ginger whats he doing down there dickering with the croats skorzeny rubbed his chin that makes more sense than anything ive come up with the lizards need to do some dickering not just to get their toehold here but also because the italians were occupying split until they surrendered to the lizards then the croats threw em out the scaly boys might be making a deal for italy as well as for themselves but its like a song thats a little out of tuneit doesnt seem quite right to me somehow jager was indignant at having his brainchild criticized why not what this drefsab did in besancon that was police work security workcall it whatever you like but would you send a gestapo man to negotiate a treaty now jager looked around to make certain neither captain petrovic nor any of his merry men could overhear if i were negotiating with ante pavelic and his croatian thugs i just might skorzeny threw back his head and bellowed laughter a couple of riflemen in the khaki of the independent state of croatia glanced over to see what was so funny wheezing still skorzeny said wicked man ive told you before you were wasted in panzers youve told me lots of things that doesnt make them true jager said which made the ss man give him a shot in the ribs with an elbow he elbowed back more to remind skorzeny he couldnt be pushed around than because he felt like fighting jager gave away centimeters kilograms and nasty attitude in any scrap with him he didnt think skorzeny knew what quit meant either here dig out those plans again skorzeny said i think i know what i want to do but im not quite sure yet jager obediently dug skorzeny bent over the drawings clucking like a mother hen i like these underground galleries we can do things with them the halls to which he pointed lay below the southern part of diocletians palace there used to be upper halls above them too with the same plan but those are long gone jager said then screw them skorzeny didnt care about archaeology just military potential what i want to know is whats in these galleries back in roman days they used to be storerooms jager said im not so sure whats in there now we need to talk to our good and loyal croatian allies he was proud of himself that came out without a hint of irony yes indeed skorzeny said accepting the advice in the spirit in which it was given what im thinking is maybe we can dig a tunnel from outside the wall into one of those galleries always making sure we dont happen to tunnel into the lizards barracks that would make things more complicated skorzeny chuckled but if we can do that we have our good and loyal allies make a nice loud showy attack on the walls draw any lizard who happens to be underground up to the top and then we bring in some of our lads through the tunnel and up andwhat was that the horses cock up the arse yes jager said i like that then like a proper devils advocate he started picking holes in the plan moving men and weapons into the city and into the place that houses the tunnel or at least somewhere close by it isnt going to be easy and well need a lot of men thats a big palace down there big enough for a church and a baptistry and a museum to fit inside plus god knows what all else the lizards will have packed a lot of fighters into it im not worried about the lizards skorzeny said if these croats decide to hop into bed with them though thatll nail our hides to the wall we have to keep that from happening no matter what i dont give a damn what we have to give pavelic to keep him on our side free rein would probably do it and he has that already pretty much jager said with distaste the independent state of croatia seemed to have only one plan for staying independent hammering all its neighbors enough to make sure nobody close by got strong enough to take revenge if skorzeny felt the same revulsion jager did he didnt show it he said we can promise him more chunks of the coast that the italians are still occupying hell like thatitll give him fresh traitors to get rid of he spoke without sarcasm he might have been talking about the best way to sweeten the deal for a secondhand car jager couldnt be so coldblooded very softly he said that schweinhund pavelic runs a filthy regime you bet he does but hes our schweinhund and we want make sure he stays that way skorzeny answered just as quietly if it does every one of these lizards that drefsab included is ours too he brought a fist down onto his knee that will happen compared to yielding to the lizards making deals with ante pavelic seemed worthwhile compared to anything else jager found it most repugnant and yet before the lizards came pavelic had been a loyal and enthusiastic supporter of the german reich jager wondered what that said about germany nothing good he thought shanghai amazed bobby fiore much of the town was pure chinese and reminded him of a largescale rowdier version of the prison camp where hed lived with liu han so far so good hed expected as much what he hadnt expected was the long streets packed full of europeanstyle buildings from the s it was as if part of paris say had been picked up carried halfway round the world and dropped down smack in the middle of china as far as fiore was concerned it didnt fit the other thing that amazed him was how much damage the city had taken you walked around you knew theyd been in a war here the japs had bombed the place to hell and gone and then burned it when they took it in he still remembered the news photo of the naked little burned chinese boy sitting up and crying in the ruins when he first saw it hed been ready to go to war with japan right then but hed cooled down and so had everybody else then pearl harbor came along and said hed been right the first time when the lizards took shanghai away from the japs they hadnt exactly given it a peck on the cheek either whole blocks were leveled and human bones still lay here and there the chinese werent what youd call eager to bury japanese remains their attitude was more on the order of let em rot in spite of everything though the town especially the chinese part of it kept right on humming the lizards made their headquarters in some of the westernstyle buildings the rest remained ruins in the chinese districts things were going up faster than you could shake a stick at them but since the lizards mostly stayed in the international settlement bobby fiore mostly stayed there too the job hed taken on for the reds was to keep on looking as much like a chinaman as he could to keep his ears open and to report to nieh hoting anything interesting he heard the red officer had promised hed get to go along when the guerrillas tried a raid based on what hed learned so far that hadnt happened and im not gonna worry about it neither fiore muttered under his breath yeah i wouldnt mind nailing a few of those scaly bastards but i didnt hire out to be no hero he walked across the garden bridge over soochow creek from the bund to the hongkew district to the north soochow creek itself was filled with junks and other small chinese boats whose names fiore didnt know from all hed heard people were born and raised and grew up and died on those boats some of them made their living fishing on the creek others worked on land but didnt have anyplace else to stay the hongkew district in spite of its chinese name was part of the international settlement the lizards had an observation post and probably a machinegun nest in the clock tower of the head post office which lay along soochow creek between broadway and north szechuen road bobby fiore was tempted to duck into the temple of the queen of heaven just a few yards north of the garden bridge even though the chinese didnt mean the virgin in the temples inner court were the images of the gods lin tsiang ching who was supposed to see everything within a thousand li of shanghai and ching tsiang ching who was supposed to hear everything within the same distance fiore glanced up toward heaven theyre just patron saints kind of he murmured to the catholic god he assumed to be glancing down at him the heavens remained mute he walked past the temple of the queen of heaven this time though hed gone in before streets and sidewalks were crowded no cars and trucks were running except lizard models and humanmade ones taken over by the lizards but people rickshaws pedicabs and draft animals took up the slack beggars staked out squares of sidewalk some of them chalked on the paving stones messages of woe fiore couldnt read they reminded him of the poor outofwork bastards whod hawked apples on streetcorners when the depression was at its worst if the streets had been crowded the hongkew marketplace at the corner of boone and woosung roads was jammed fishermen from soochow creek farmers butchersall cried their wares at something just over the top of their lungs if the market in the prison camp where hed stayed with liu han was fans field in decatur this place had to be yankee stadium not only locals shopped here either lizards made their skittering herkyjerky progress from one stall to another they could simply have taken whatever they wanted from what nieh hoting had said theyd done that at first now they pay hed said they learn that if they give nothing to get something it is not in the market square the next time they want it sure enough a lizard bought a live kicking lobster and paid the stall keeper in chinese silver dollars which for reasons fiore could not fathom were also called mex dollars the lizards companion said to him these are tasty creatures go on ianxx buy several more we can cook them for the commandants midday reception tomorrow it shall be done superior sir said the lobster buyer presumably ianxx he went back to bargaining with the fisherman fiore bent his head down and did his best to look chinese the brim of his conical straw hat covered his nose and tooround eyes he wore drab dark cottons that reminded him of pajamas just like most other people the lizards should have no reason to notice his skin wasnt exactly the right color they didnt they went off with their purchases holding them carefully to avoid the lobsters flailing claws bobby fiore followed them back across the garden bridge the lizards paid no attention to him as far as they were concerned he was just another big ugly now which commandant were you talking about he asked them silently they went through the public garden near the south edge of the garden bridge and then on to the british consulate fiore skinned back his teeth in a fierce grin that was where the lizard commandant for all shanghai had his headquarters not all of the international settlement was posh buildings full of foreignersor rather now full of lizards in an alley off foochow road jammed in between other equally unpretentious erections was a dilapidated place called the sweetheart the door had the name in english and what he presumed to be its equivalent in chinese characters when fiore went inside he was greeted by a blast of scratchy jazz from a phonograph and by the multilingual chatter of the working girls in the front lounge he snorted laughter nieh hoting was one smart cookie the reds had a reputation for being bluenoses who would have figured one of their big wheels would set up shop in a whorehouse as far as bobby knew nieh didnt go to bed with any of the girls he didnt mind if fiore enjoyed himself though and some of the russians girls whose parents had been on the losing side of the revolution and had to get out one step ahead of lenins bully boys were simply gorgeous he wondered what they thought of being in cahoots with a red now he hadnt tried finding out hed learned to keep his mouth shut when he wasnt sure about the person he was talking to he opened the door to the lounge the jazz got louder the chatter on the other hand suddenly stopped then the girls recognized him and started gabbing again he looked around like a kid in a candy store russians eurasians chinese koreans some in europeanstyle lingerie others in clinging dresses of chinese silk slit up to here and sometimes down to there too just being a fly on the wall at the sweetheart was almost as good as getting laid at some of the dismal sporting houses hed been to back in the states is uncle wu around he asked that was the name nieh hoting used hereabouts another wonderful thing about the sweetheart was that he could speak english almost all the girls understood it and two or three of them were about as fluent as he was one of the russians a blonde in a silk dress slit up to here and then a couple of inches farther pointed to the stairway and said da bobby he is in his room now thanks shura bobby made himself look away from the display of creamy thigh and head for the stairs up on the second floor he made sure he knocked on the third door on the left if hed picked the wrong one by mistake he might have interrupted somebody who didnt want to be interrupted too many people in shanghai carried guns to make that a good idea as a matter of fact when nieh hoting opened the door he was holding a submachine gun himself he relaxed when he saw fioreor relaxed as far as he ever did which wasnt much come in he said and closed the door behind fiore what do you have for me bobby hated shifting from english to his halting chinese but he knew nieh hoting would burst a blood vessel if he suggested using one of the hookers to interpret the red officer waved him to a chair on either wall multitudes of mirrored images of him also sat down this was a room in a brothel sure enough he told nieh hoting what hed heard in the hongkew market nieh listened asked questions and finally nodded luncheon tomorrow for their commandant in the british consulate you say he mused when fiore was done maybe we can make it a livelier occasion than the little scaly devils expect eh yeah bobby fiore said one of his frustrations in speaking chinese was that he couldnt qualify anything he had to go thumbsup or thumbsdown with nothing in the middle nieh hoting smiled not altogether pleasantly he said i was wise to use you and not liquidate you out in the countryside you have brought information i can employ and which i could not have had without you thats nice fiore said with an uneasy answering smile liquidate wasnt a chinese word hed figured hed pick up in ordinary conversation but nieh used it a lot the reds were in deadly earnest about what they did you werent with them youd better have your life insurance paid up the really crazy part of it was whenever nieh hoting didnt make like a revolutionary or a mafia soldier he was as nice a guy as youd ever want to meet it was as if he put all the murderous stuff in a box and took it out whenever he needed it but when he wasnt using it you wouldnt guess it was there now his smile was broad and happy as if such things as liquidation had never crossed his mind he said im going to do you a favor in return for the one you did me i am sure you will take it in the intended spirit yeah what kind of favor fiore asked suspiciously favors always sounded good sometimes they were as when nieh had said it was okay for him to fool around with the girls downstairs but sometimes this was one of those times still beaming nieh said i am going to keep the promise i made you you will be part of our raiding team uh thank you that was the best fiore could do in chinese if hed been speaking english it would have come out oh boy thanks a lot if nieh hoting noticed the irony and lack of enthusiasm he didnt show it aiding in the fight against the imperialist devils from another world is surely the duty of every human being those who do not join in the struggle are the devils running dogs and we know the fate of running dogs eh uh yeah sure bobby fiore muttered talk about stuck between a rock and a hard place if he came along for the ride the lizards would shoot him if he didnt the chinese reds would take care of the job either way he could forget about finding out how the latest serial over at the nanking on avenue edward vii was going to end musingly nieh hoting said your pistol is not a good enough weapon for this work we will make certain you have a submachine gun he held up a hand no dont thank me it is for the mission as much as for yourself bobby hadnt planned on thanking him he wished he were back in the lizard prison camp with liu han and that hed never ever tried to teach that chinaman named lo how not to throw like a girl with a slight curl to his liphe really was a bluenose at heartnieh said why dont you go downstairs and amuse yourself for a time if you have nothing better to do i need to find out if we can do what needs doing on such short notice and the best way to do it if we can fiore didnt need any more urging to go downstairs if he was going off to get shot at he carefully didnt think of it as to get shot tomorrow hed have fun tonight not much later he ended up back in one of those mirrored rooms with shura the white russian blonde by any objective standard she was prettier and better in the sack than liu han had been so he wondered why he didnt feel as happy as he might have when he went back to the room where he slept the only thing he could think of was that hed cared about liu han and she about him but shura was just going through the motions even if she played the mattress the way billy herman played second base goddamn he muttered sleepily i guess it was love next thing he knew the sun was up he went down to breakfast like a condemned man heading off for his last meal even eyeing the girls couldnt snap him out of his funk he was finishing his cup of tea when nieh hoting stuck his head into the kitchen and waved to him come here we have things to talk about bobby came nieh handed fiore a rattan suitcase it was heavy when fiore opened it he found a russian submachine gun several magazines of ammunition and four potatomasher grenades you will not go in with us nieh said you loiter across from the front entrance to the british consulate when the time comesyou will know i assure youkill the guards there if you can and help any human beings who come out through those doors okay fiore said in english when he was sure he understood what nieh wanted from him the red nodded he got that fiore switched to his lousy chinese how will you get in the consulate how will you bring more guns in i should not tell yousecurity but nieh hoting looked too pleased with himself to keep his mouth shut altogether he went on this much i will say the consulate will have some new human cooks and waiters today and they will be bringing in ducks to go with the lobsters for the commandants feast he clammed up againif bobby couldnt work it out from there that was his tough luck but he could and started to laugh when he thought about how those ducks would be stuffed no wonder nieh looked so smug good luck fiore said he stuck out his hand but yanked it back chinamen didnt go in for handshakes nieh hoting surprised him though by reaching out and taking his hand my soviet comrades have this custom i know what it means he said then looked at his watch take your place at noon the banquet is supposed to begin at half past the hour and will not last long okay fiore said if hed been in a town where he spoke the language he would have thought about taking it on the lam with the arsenal getting the reds mad at him though seemed a worse bet than taking his chances on the lizards he had plenty of time for another screw before he took off shura came back upstairs with him willingly enough afterwards she blinked when he gave her an extra couple of dollars mex he was usually as cheap as he could get away with you rob a bank bobby she asked two of em babe he said deadpan as he started to dress she blinked again then decided it was a joke and laughed suitcase in hand he headed for the bund he knew nieh hoting and his buddies were taking the real risk if the lizards inside the british consulate were on their toes the scheme was dead in the water he got to number the bund just as clocks were striking twelve nieh would be pleased with him when he said noon he meant on the dot now bobby had to hang around and look inconspicuous till the fireworks started he bought a bowl of watery soup from a passing vendor then had an inspiration and bought the bowl itself he sat down on the pavement with it beside him and made like a beggar every once in a while somebody tossed a copper in the bowl or even some silver bobby kept trackwhen the shooting started he had just over a dollar mex the british consulate was a large imposing building not even its stonework though could muffle the rattle of automatic weapons fire the lizard guards at the main entrance whirled around and stared as if unsure what to do next and unable to believe the ears they didnt have fiore didnt give them much of a chance to think it over as soon as he heard guns he opened the suitcase yanked out a grenade unscrewed the metal cap at the bottom pulled the porcelain bead inside to work the friction igniter and let fly as if he were making a throw to the plate had there been a runner he would have been out the grenade landed right in the middle of the four lizards when it went off a second later people who had been exclaiming over the shots inside the consulate started screaming and running instead the only trouble was it didnt knock out all the lizards a couple of them started shooting even if they didnt know just where it had come from the screams along the bund turned into shrieks fiore dove behind a solid bench of wood and iron he opened up with the submachine gun he hoped he didnt hit anybody on the street but he wasnt going to lose any sleep if he didthose lizards had to go down and down they went more shots from inside the british consulate then those entry doors burst open nieh and half a dozen other chinamen some wearing cooks clothes the rest looking like penguins in fancy waiter getup though waiters didnt commonly tote automatic weapons sprinted down the steps and then down the street lizards opened up on them from the roof and from secondstory windows the fleeing humans started spinning and dropping and kicking like flies swatted not quite hard enough to die right away you just talked about the bastards at the door goddammit bobby muttered as if nieh hoting were close enough to hear you didnt say nothin about the rest of em he raised the submachine gun and blazed away at the lizards till his magazine ran dry he grabbed another one slammed it into the weapon and had just started shooting again when a burst of three bullets stitched across his chest the submachine gun fell out of his hands he tried to reach for it found he couldnt he didnt hurt then he did then he didnt ever again brigadier general leslie groves strode across the campus of the university of denver with his head down as if he were a bull looking to trample anyone who got in his way that hardcharging attitude had been instinctive in him until one day he noticed and deliberately cultivated it thanks in no small part to that not a whole lot of people got in his way these days physicists he snorted under his breath again bullishly the trouble with them was they were so lost in their own rarefied world a lot of the time that they didnt always feel the pressure he put on them let alone yield to it he didnt note anything out of the ordinary about the day until he walked into the science building and discovered he didnt recognize any of the soldiers crowding the downstairs lobby that made him frown sam yeager and the rest of the dogface with the met lab crew were as familiar to him as his shoelaces he looked around for the highestranking officer he could find why have we been invaded major he asked the fellow with the gold oak leaves on his shoulders saluted if youd be so kind as to come with me general he said in the polite phrases lowerranking officers use to give their superiors orders groves was so kind as to come with him until he figured out where he was going which didnt take long major if i need an escort to find my own office im the wrong man to head this project he growled the major didnt answer he just kept walking groves fumed but followed sure enough they were heading for his office in front of it stood a couple of men who looked as tough and alert as soldiers but wore mediumsnappy civilian suits a light went on in groves head he turned to the major and asked secret service yes sir one of the tmen after checking groves face against a little photo he held in the palm of his hand nodded to the other the second one opened the door and said general groves is here sir well hed better come in then hadnt he an infinitely familiar voice replied from within it being his office after all why the devil didnt i get any warning president roosevelt was coming to denver groves hissed to the major security the other officer whispered back we have to assume the lizards monitor everything we broadcast and weve lost couriers too the less we say the safer fdr is now go on in hes been waiting for you groves went in hed met roosevelt before and knew the president wasnt as vibrant in person as he appeared in the newsreels being cooped up in a wheelchair would do that to you but since the last time hed seen fdr a year earlier at white sulphur springs the change was shocking roosevelts flesh seemed to have fallen in on his bones he might have aged a decade or more in that year he looked like a man worn to deaths door for all that though his grip was still strong when he reached out to shake general groves hand after the engineer had saluted youve lost weight general he observed amusement in his eyeshis body might be falling to pieces around it but his mind was still sharp yes sir groves answered roosevelt had lost weight too but he wasnt about to remark on it sit down sit down the president waved him to the swivel chair behind his desk groves obediently sat roosevelt turned the wheelchair to face him even his hands had lost flesh the skin hung loose on them he sighed and said i wish to god i had a cigarette but thats neither here nor therecertainly not here worse luck fdr sighed again do you know general when einstein sent me that letter of his back in i had the feeling all his talk of nuclear weapons and bombs that could blow up the world was likely to be so much moonshine but i couldnt take the chance of being wrong and it turns out i was rightand how i wish i hadnt been yes sir groves repeated but then added if you hadnt been right though sir wed have been in no position to resist the lizards and to copy what theyve done thats true but its not what i meant roosevelt said i wish id been right and that all the talk about nuclear weapons and atomic power and who knows what were so much moonshine then all id have to worry about would be beating hitler and hirohito and the lizards would be back on the second planet of the star tau ceti where they belong and people wouldnt meet them for another million years if we ever did is that where theyre from groves asked with interest ill have to have our liaison man put the question to the lizard pows we have here fdr made a gesture of indifference as you like and if you have the time otherwise dont trouble yourself about it these lizards are an astonishing intelligence resource arent they yes sir groves said enthusiastically the ones we have here have been extremely cooperative not just them general with what were learning from systematic interrogation of all our captives well leap forward by decades maybe centuries roosevelts expression which had brightened turned cloudy again if we win the war that iswhich is what i came to talk about what i want to know is how soon will we have nuclear weapons of our own to use against the lizards he leaned forward in his chair intently awaiting groves reply groves nodded hed expected the question sir i am told we can have one nuclear bomb fairly soon england supplied us with enough plutonium that we need to manufacture only a few more kilograms of our own to have enough for a bomb within a year the scientists here tell me thats not soon enough roosevelt made a sour face it may do but every day they shave off it will bring the country one day closer to being saved how long for more after the first now it was groves turn to look unhappy you understand sir that we have to come up with all the explosive material for them on our own the pilethats what they call itthe met lab staff has built here isnt ideally designed for that although we are improving it as we gain experience and one of our physicists is scouting a site where we can build a pile that will give us larger amounts of plutonium he wondered how jens larssen was doing i know about hanford roosevelt said impatiently i dont need the technical details generalthats why youre here but i do need to know how long i have to wait for my weaponry so i can make sure theres a country left when i get it i understand groves said if all goes wellif the pile goes up on schedule and works as advertised and if the lizards dont overrun hanford or wherever we put ityou should have more bombs starting about six months after the first one by the end of more or less not soon enough roosevelt repeated still were better off than the rest the germans might have been right there with us but youve no doubt heard about the mistakes they made with their pile the british are relying on us were passing information to the japanese who are well behind us and the russiansi dont know about the russians groves opinion of soviet scientific prowess was not high then he remembered the russians had got some plutonium from that raid on the lizards too a wild card he said thats right roosevelt nodded emphatically his famous jaw still had granite in it no matter how badly the rest of his features had weathered ive been in touch with stalin hes worriedthe lizards are pushing hard against moscow if it falls who can say whether the russians will keep on listening to their government and if they dont weve lost a big piece of the war yes sir groves said although he was as securityconscious as a man in his position had to be he also had a wellhoned curiosityand how often did you get to pick the brain of the president of the united states how bad is it over in the soviet union sir its not good fdr said stalin told me that if i had any men to spare hed leave them under their own officers leave them under my direct personal command if that was wanted as long as they went over there and fought the lizards groves lips puckered into a soundless whistle that was a cry of pain if ever hed heard one hes not just worried sir hes desperate what did you tell him i answered no of course roosevelt said we have a few small differences with the lizards on our own soil at the moment the highpitched laugh so familiar from the radio and the newsreel screen filled the office as it had so often in the past it lifted groves spiritsbut only for a moment the danger facingfillingthe united states was too great to be laughed off the president continued for instance the lizards are pushing hard against chicago too they have us cut in half along the mississippi almost as badly as the north did with the south during the civil war to say nothing of the other areas theyve carved out of the country it hinders us every way you can think of militarily and economically both believe me sir i understand that groves said remembering how hed had to bring the plutonium to denver by way of canada what can we do about it though fight em roosevelt answered if theyre going to beat us theyll have to beat us no other way from what we hear from prisoners weve captured theyve taken over two other whole worlds before they attacked us and theyve ruled them for thousands of years if we lose general if we lay down and give up its for keeps thats why i came to talk about the atomic bomb if i have any weapon i can use against those dastardly creatures i want to know about it im sorry i cant give you better news sir so am i roosevelt hunched his shoulders and let out another long sigh his shirt and jacket both seemed a couple of sizes too big the burden of the war was killing him groves realized with a jolt that that was literally true he wondered where vice president henry wallace was and what sort of shape he was in he couldnt t say that to the president what he did say was the trick will be to get through the time between using the one bomb we can make fairly quickly and the rest which will take longer yes indeed fdr said id hoped that would be a shorter gap as it is well have to be very careful picking the time when we use the first one youre right that we would be very vulnerable to whatever atomic response the lizards make groves had seen pictures of the slag heap the lizards had made of washington dc he heard men whod seen it talk about the incongruous beauty of the tall cloud of dust and hot gas that had sprouted over the city like a gigantic poisonous toadstool he imagined such toadstools springing into being above other cities across the united states across the world a bit of latin from his prep school days came back to haunt him they make a desert and they call it peace when he murmured that aloud the president nodded and said exactly so and in a curious way that may turn out to be one of our greatest strengths our lizard prisoners insist to a manwell to a lizardthat they dont want to use their atomic weapons here on a large scale they say it would do too much damage to the planet they want to control earth and settle colonists on it not just smash us by any means that come to hand whereas we can do anything we have to to get rid of them groves said yes sir i see what you mean odd that we should have fewer constraints on our strategy than they do when they have the more powerful weapons thats just what i mean roosevelt agreed if wehumanity that iscan say if we dont get to keep our world you wont use it either that will give our scaly friends something new and interesting to think about their colonization fleet will be here in a generations time and i gather it cant be conveniently recalled if the lizards lay earth to waste the colonists are like somebody invited to a party at a house thats just burnt to the ground all dressed up with no place to go and no one to pass them a hose to put out the fire either groves observed that won a chuckle from fdr nice to know you were paying attention when i made my lendlease speech any military man who didnt pay attention to what his commanderinchief said was an idiot as far as groves was concerned he replied the question is how far we can push that line of reasoning sir if the lizards are faced with the prospect of either losing the war or hurting us as badly as we hurt them which will they choose i dont know roosevelt said which made groves respect his honesty i tell you this though general compared to the problems we have right now i shouldnt mind facing that one at all i want you and your crew here to exert every effort possible to producing that first atomic bomb and then as many more as fast as you can if we go down id sooner go down with guns blazing than with our hands in the air yes sir so would i groves said well do everything we can sir im sure you will general roosevelt turned his wheelchair and rolled toward the door he got to it and opened it before groves could come around the desk to do the job for him that made the old jaunty look come back to his haggard features just for a moment he liked to preserve as much independence as his circumstances allowed and in that groves thought he was a good representative for the whole planet xviii mordechai anielewicz had never imagined he would be relieved that the lizards had set up a rocket battery right outside leczna but he was that gave him an excuse to stay indoors which meant he didnt have to see zofia klopotowski for a while its not that i dont like her you understand he told dr judah ussishkin over the chessboard one night no it wouldnt be that would it ussishkins voice was dry he moved a knight shes fond of you too anielewiczs face flamed as he studied the move zofia would have been more fond of him in direct proportion to any increased stamina he showed hed never imagined an affair with a woman who was more lecherous than he was up till now hed always had to do the persuading but zofia would drop anything to get between the sheetsor under a wagon or into the backseat of dr ussishkins moribund fiat trying to keep his mind on the game mordechai pushed a pawn one square ahead that kept the knight from taking a position in which with one more move it could fork his queen and a rook a beatific smile wreathed ussishkins tired face ah my boy you are learning he said your defense has made good progress since we began to play soon now you will learn to put together an effective attack and then you will be a player to be reckoned with coming from you doctor thats a compliment anielewicz wanted to be a player to be reckoned with and he wanted to mount an effective attack he hadnt got to be head of the jewish fighters in lizardoccupied poland by sitting back and waiting for things to happen his instinct was to try to make them happen against ussishkin he hadnt been able to not yet he did his best the midgame might have seen a machine gun rake the chessboard so fast and furious did pieces fall but when the exchanges were done he found himself down a bishop and a pawn and facing another losing position he tipped over his king you make me work harder all the time ussishkin said i got some plum brandy for stitching up a farmers cut hand yesterday will you take a glass with me yes thank you but dont ask me for another game of chess afterwards mordechai said if i cant beat you sober im sure i cant beat you shikker ussishkin smiled as he poured chess and brandy do not mix the brandy came from a bottle that had once by its label held vodka people still had vodka these days but it was homemade for that matter the plum brandy had to be homemade too ussishkin lifted his glass in salute lchaym lchaym anielewicz drank the raw brandy charred all the way down sweat sprang out on his face phew if that were any stronger you wouldnt need gasoline for your automobile ah but if i got it running think how disappointed you and zofia would be ussishkin said mordechai blushed again in the candlelight the doctor didnt notice or pretended he didnt he turned serious i know telling a young man to be careful is more often than not a waste of time but i will try with you do be careful if you make her pregnant her father will not be pleased which means the rest of the poles here will not be pleased either we and they have gotten on as well as could be expected all things considered i would not like that to change no neither would i mordechai said for one thing leczna held a good many more poles than jews strife would not be to the minoritys advantage for another strife among the locals was liable to draw the lizards unwelcome attention to the town they already had more interest than anielewicz liked for they drew their food locally he preferred staying in obscurity you seem sensible for one so young ussishkin sipped his brandy again he didnt cough or flush or give any other sign he wasnt drinking water an aspiring engineer till the war anielewicz guessed hed had his gullet plated with stainless steel the doctor went on you should also rememberif she does conceive the child would be raised a catholic and she might try to insist on your marrying her i doubtnow ussishkin coughed not from the plum brandy but to show he did more than doubtshe would convert would you no mordechai answered without hesitation before the germans invaded he hadnt been pious hed lived in the secular world not that of the shtetl and the yeshiva but the nazis didnt care whether you were secular or not they wanted to be rid of you any which way more and more hed decided that if he was a jew hed be a jew turning christian was not an option marriages of mixed religion are sometimes happy but more often battlegrounds ussishkin observed mordechai didnt want to marry zofia klopotowski he wouldnt have wanted to marry her if she were jewish he did however want to keep on making love with her if not quite as often as she had in mind if he did shed probably catch sooner or later which would lead to the unpleasant consequences the doctor had outlined he knocked back the rest of his brandy wheezed and said life is never simple there i cannot argue with you death is simple i have seen so much death these past few years that it seems very simple to me ussishkin exhaled a long gusty breath that made candle flames flutter then he poured fresh plum brandy into his glass and if i start talking like a philosopher instead of a tired doctor i must need to be more sober or more drunk he sipped you see my choice oh yes mordechai put an edge of irony in his voice he wondered how many years had rolled past since judah ussishkin last got truly drunk probably more than ive been alive he thought far off in the distance he heard airplane engines at first like gnats with deep voices but rapidly swelling to fullthroated roars then roars these harsh and abrupt rose from the rocket battery the lizards had stationed out beyond the beet fields ussishkins face grew sad more death tonight this time in the air yes anielewicz wondered how many german or russian planes how many young germans or russians were falling out of the sky almost as many as the lizards had shot attheir rockets were ungodly accurate flying a mission knowing you were likely to run into such took courage even if you were a nazi it took courage somewhere not far away a thunderclap announced a bombers return to earth dr ussishkin gulped down the second glass of brandy then got himself a third anielewicz raised an eyebrow maybe he did mean to get drunk the physician said a pity the lizards can slay with impunity not with impunity we anielewicz shut up one glass of brandy had led him to say one word too many he didnt know how much ussishkin knew about his role as jewish fighting leader hed carefully refrained from asking the doctor for fear of giving away more than he learned but ussishkin had to be aware he was part of the resistance for anielewicz was not the first man whod taken refuge here in a musing voice as if speculating about an obscure and much disputed biblical text ussishkin said i wonder if anything could be done about those rockets without endangering the townsfolk something could probably be done anielewicz said hed studied the site with professional interest while the lizards prepared it what would happen to the town afterwards is a different question the lizards are not the hostage takers the nazis were ussishkin said still musingly i have the feeling they knew war only from books before they got here mordechai answered a lot of the filthy stuff no matter how well it works doesnt get into that kind of book he glanced sharply over at ussishkin or are you saying i should do something about that rocket installation the doctor hesitated he knew they were treading dangerous ground at last he said i thought you might perhaps have some experience in such things was i wrong yesand no anielewicz said sometimes you had to know when to drop your cover too playing games with the lizards here is a lot different from what its like in a place like warsaw a lot more buildings to hide among therea lot more people to hide among too here their rocket launchers and everything they use are set up right out in the openhard to get at without being spotted i dont suppose the razorwire circles around them make matters any easier either ussishkin murmured they certainly dont anielewicz thought about going off in the night and trying to pot a few lizards from long range with his mauser but the lizards had gadgets that let them see in the dark the way cats wished they could even without those gadgets sniping wouldnt really hurt the effectiveness of the battery the lizards would just replace whatever males he managed to wound or kill then all of a sudden he laughed out loud and what amuses you judah ussishkin asked somehow i doubt its razor wire no not razor wire anielewicz admitted but i think i know how to get through it he explained it didnt take long by the time he was done ussishkins eyes were wide and staring this will work he demanded they had enough trouble with it in warsaw mordechai said i dont know just what it will do here but it ought to do something youre still lying low arent you ussishkin said then answered his own question yes of course you are and even if you werent id be a better choice to approach tadeusz sobieski anyhow hes known me all his life when he was born my sarah delivered him ill talk with him first thing in the morning well see if he can be as generous to the lizards as you have in mind with that anielewicz had to be content he stayed inside dr ussishkins house sarah wouldnt let him help with the cooking or cleaning so he read books and studied the chessboard every day a horsedrawn wagon rattled down the street carrying supplies from sobieski the grocer to the lizards at their rocket battery for several days nothing happened then one bright sunny afternoon a time when neither the luftwaffe nor the red air force would be insane enough to put planes in the air over poland the battery launched all its rockets one after another roar roar roar into the sky farmworkers came running in from the fields mordechai felt like hugging himself with glee as he listened to scraps of their excited conversation the things have gone crazy shot off their rockets then started shooting at each other never seen fireworks like them in all my born days dr ussishkin came into the house a few minutes later you were right it seems he said to anielewicz this was the day tadeusz laced all the supplies with as much ginger as he had they do have a strong reaction to the stuff dont they its more than a drunk for them more like a drug mordechai answered it makes them fast and nervoushairtrigger i guess you might say somebody must have imagined he heard engines or thought he saw something in one of their instruments and that would have been plenty to touch them off i wonder what theyll do now ussishkin said not the ones who went berserk out there today but the higher ranking ones who ordered the battery placed where it was they didnt have long to wait for their answer at least one of the lizards must have survived and radioed lublin for in side the hour several lizard lorries from the urban center rolled through the streets of leczna when they left the next day they took the rocket launchers with them if the battery went up again it went up somewhere else with the lizards out of the neighborhood anielewicz had no more excuse for staying indoors all the time zofia klopotowski waylaid him and dragged him into the bushes or as near as made no difference after his spell of celibacy he kept up with her for a while but then his ardor began to flag just as hed never imagined hed have been relieved to see the lizards erect their rocket battery in his own back yard so to speak he found equally surprising his halfhearted wish that theyd come back a disheveled soldier shouted frantically in russian when george bagnall didnt understand fast enough to suit him he started to point his submachine gun at the grounded aviator by then bagnall had had a bellyful of frantic russians hed even had a bellyful of frantic germans a species that did not exist in stereotype but proved quite common under the stress of combat he got to his feet knocked the gun barrel aside with a contemptuous swipe and growled why dont you shove that thing up your arseor would you rather i did it for you he spoke in english but the tone got across so did his manner the red army man stopped treating him like a servant and started treating him like an officer the old saw about the hun being either at your throat or at your feet seemed to apply even more to russians than it did to germans if you gave in to them they rode roughshod over you but if you showed a little bulge they figured you had to be the boss and started tugging at their forelocks bagnall turned to jerome jones whats this bloody goon babbling about i have more russian than i did when we got stuck herenot hard that since i had nonebut i cant make head nor tail of it when he goes on so blinking fast ill see if i can find out sir jones answered the radar man had spoken a little russian before he landed in pskov after several monthsand no doubt a good deal of intimate practice with the fair tatiana bagnall thought enviouslyhe was pretty fluent he said something to the russian soldier who shouted and pointed to the map on the wall the usual bagnall asked the usual jones agreed tiredly wanting to know if his unit should conform to general chills orders and pull back from the second line to the third one he switched back to russian calmed down the soldier and sent him on his way theyll obey even if he is a nazi they probably should have obeyed two hours ago before ivan there came looking for us but god willing they wont have taken too many extra casualties for being stubborn bagnall sighed when i proposed this scheme i thought wed get only the serious business he made a face i was young and naivei admit it youd damned well better said ken embry who was pouring himself a glass of herbandroot tea from a battered samovar on the opposite side of the gloomy room in the pskov krom you must have thought being tsar came with the droit de seigneur attached only for jones here bagnall retorted which made the radarman stammer and cough at the time i remember thinking two things first was to keep the nazis and bolshies from bashing each other so the lizards wouldnt have themselves a walkover here weve managed that for the moment anyhow embry said if the lizards committed more tanks to this front wed have a dry time of it but they seem to have decided they need them elsewhere they get no complaints from me on that score i assure you nor from me bagnall said theyre quite enough trouble as is theres fighting on the outskirts of kaluga the wireless reports jerome jones said thats not far southwest of moscow and theres damn all between it and red square doesnt sound what youd call good no thats bad embry agreed makes me glad so many of the fighters here are partisanslocalsand not regular army types recruited from god knows where if youre fighting for your own particular home youre less likely to want to pack it in if moscow falls i hadnt thought of that but i dare say youre right bagnall answered even if it is a most unsocialist thing to say what that youre gladder to fight for your own property well im a tory from a long line of tories and i dont feel the slightest bit guilty about it embry said all right george you didnt want the russians and the jerries to go at each other what was the other notion in what passes for your mind as to why we needed this particular headache after that raid on the lizards outpost i had a serious disinclination toward infantry combat if you must know bagnall said what of you well i must admit that given the choice between another stint of it and ending up in the kip with that barmaid in dover we all knew id be likely to choose sylvia embry said judiciously i do believe however that we perform a useful function here if we didnt id feel worse about not shouldering my trusty rifle and going out to do or die for holy mother russia oh quite bagnall agreed keeping the germans and the soviets from each others throats isnt the least contribution we could make to the war effort in pskov lizard planes roared low overhead antiaircraft guns mostly german threw shells into the air at them adding to the racket that pierced the kroms thick stone walls none of the antiaircraft guns was stationed very close to pskovs old citadel the ackack wasnt good enough to keep the lizards from hitting just about anything they wanted to hit and drew their notice to whatever it tried to protect bagnall approved of not having their notice drawn to the krom being buried under tons of rock was not the way of shuffling off this mortal coil he had in mind lieutenant general kurt chill stalked into the room followed by brigadier aleksandr german one of the chiefs of what had been the partisan forest republic until the lizards came both men looked furious they had even more basic reasons than most in pskov for disliking and distrusting each other it wasnt just wehrmacht against red army with them it was nazi against jew well gentlemen what seems to be the bone of contention now bagnall asked as if the disagreements in pskov were over the teams to pick for a football pool rather than moves that would get men killed sometimes that detached tone helped calm the excited men who came for arbitration and sometimes it didnt aleksandr german shouted this hitlerite maniac wont give me the support i need if he doesnt send some men a lot of the left is going to come apart and does he care not even a little bit as long as he can keep his precious troops intact who cares what happens to the front bagnall could barely follow the partisan brigadiers fast guttural yiddish it was close enough to german for chill to have no trouble understanding it though he snapped the man is a fool he wants me to commit elements of the nd antitank battalion to an area where no panzer are opposing his forces if i send the battalion piecemeal into fights which are not its proper province none of it will be left when it is most desperately needed as it will be youve got those damned s aleksandr german said they arent just antitank guns and were getting chewed up because we dont have any artillery to answer the lizards lets look at the situation map bagnall said weve had to fall back here and here aleksandr german said pointing if they force a crossing of this stream were in trouble because they can nip in toward the center and start rolling up the line were holding there for now but god knows how long we can keep doing it without some helpwhich herr general chill wont give us chill pointed at the map too you have russian units here you can draw on for reinforcements i have bodies god knows aleksandr german said and then was seized by a coughing fit as he realized hed twice invoked a deity he wasnt supposed to believe in he wiped his mouth on a sleeve and went on bodies wont do the job by themselves though i need to break up the lizards concentrations back of their lines its a wasteful use of antitank troops chill said ive been wasting russianswhy should your pampered pets be any different aleksandr german retorted they are specialists and irreplaceable the wehrmacht man replied if we expend them here they will not be available when and where their unique training and equipment are truly essential aleksandr german slammed a fist against the map they are essential now in the place where i requested them he shouted if we dont use them there we wont have a later for you to trot them out with all your fancy talk about right timing and right equipment look at the mess my men are in chill looked then shook his head with a disdainful expression on his face maybe you should reconsider bagnall told him the german general fixed him with a baleful stare i knew this piece of dumbheadedness was doomed to fail the moment it was suggested he said it is nothing more than a smokescreen to get good german troops thrown into the fire to save the anglorussian alliance oh balls bagnall said in english chill understood him his face got even chillier aleksandr german didnt but he got the tone the raf man went on in german again not half an hour ago i sent a russian off confirming youror some germans anyhoworder to fall back im trying to do the best job i can given my look at the map perhaps you left your spectacles behind when you left london chill suggested acidly maybe i did but i dont think so bagnall turned to aleksandr german brigadier i know there arent many tanks on your section of the front if the lizards had a lot of tanks theyd be here by now and wed all be dead not bickering but are they using those troop carriers with the turretmounted guns yes we have seen a good many of them the partisan leader answered at once there bagnall said to kurt chill are those troop carriers a good enough target for your antitank lads youd have to be lucky to take out a lizard tank with an but you can do all sorts of lovely things to a troop carrier with one this is so chill rounded on aleksandr german why did you not say light armor was part of the threat you were facing had i known i would have released units from the battalion at once who can tell what will make up a fascists mind aleksandr german answered if youre going to send men youd better go and do it they left the map room together arguing now about how many men and guns and where they needed to go rather than whether to send any at all bagnall indulged in the luxury of a long heartfelt whew jerome jones walked over and patted him on the back nicely done ken embry said we are earning our keep here after all seems to me he got himself a glass of hot brownish muck from the samovar then let one eyelid droop in unmistakable wink dyou suppose comrade brigadier german has really seen a whole fleet of armored troop carriers or even so many as one jones gaped his head swung from embry to bagnall and back again bagnall said i havent the foggiest notion truth to tell but he picked up his cue in a hurry didnt he if armor rumbles into the neighborhood even a literalminded jerry can hardly quarrel with rolling out the antitank guns now can he doesnt look as though he can at any rate embry said i would have to say that hand goes to the heroic partisan he raised his glass in salute comrade german is one very sharp chap bagnall said how good he is as a soldier or a leader of men im still not certain but he misses very little you threw out that line sure it was a lie and expecting him to snap at it anyhow jones said almost in accusation havent you ever done the like with a barmaid for instance bagnall asked and was amused to watch the radarman turn red my notion was that if he said no wed be no worse off than we were already chill was going to balk and we have nothing save whatever he uses as a sense of honor to get him to keep the promise he made to accept our decision giving him a reason he could swallow for doing what we wanted looked to be a good idea and next time with luck hell be likelier to go along embry said unless of course his men get wiped out and the position overrun which is a risk in this business if that happens it will announce itself bagnall said most likely by artillery shells starting to land on pskov he pointed to the map we cant lose much more ground without coming into range of their guns nothing to do now but wait jones said feels like being back at dover waiting for the jerries to fly over arid show up on the radar screen its a cricket match with the other side at bat and you have to respond to what their batsman does hours passed a babushka brought in bowls of borscht thick beet soup with a dollop of sour cream floating on top bagnall mechanically spooned it up till the bowl was empty hed never fancied either beets or sour cream but he fancied going hungry even less fuel he told himself nastytasting fuel but you need to top off your tanks evening came late to pskov these days the town didnt have the white nights of leningrad to the north and east but twilight lingered long the western sky was still a bright salmon pink when tatiana came into the map room just the sight of her roused all the englishmen who were fighting yawns even in the shapeless blouse and baggy trousers of a red army soldier she seemed much too decorative to have a rifle with a telescopic sight slung over her back jerome jones greeted her in russian she nodded to him but astonished bagnall by walking up to him and kissing him to a point just short of asphyxiation her clothes might have concealed her shape but she felt all woman in his arms my god he exclaimed in delighted amazement whats that in aid of ill ask jones said much less enthusiastically he started speaking russian again tatiana replied volubly he translated she says shes thanking you for getting the nazi mothermolesterher wordsto move his guns forward they hit a munitions store when they shelled the rear area and took out several troop carriers at the front lines they really were there embry broke in tatiana went on right through him after a moment jones fallowed her she says she had a good day sniping too thanks to the confusion the guns sowed among them and she thanks you for that too looks as though weve held at least for the time being embry said bagnall nodded but he kept glancing over at tatiana she was watching him too as if through that rifle sight her gaze was smoky as the fires pskov used for heating and cooking it warmed bagnall and chilled him at the same time he could tell she wanted to sleep with him but the only reason he could see for it was that hed helped her do a better job of killing the old saw about the female of the species being more deadly than the male floated through his mind hed heard it dozen times over the years but never expected to run across its exemplification he didnt meet tatianas gaze again no matter how pretty she was as far as he was concerned jerome jones was welcome to her crack sam yeager took an automatic step back then he realized the line drive was hit in front of him he dashed in dove the ball stuck in his glove his right hand closed over to make sure it didnt pop out he rolled over on the grass held up his glove to show he had the ball the fellow whod smacked the drive flipped away his bat in disgust yeagers teammates and from behind the backstop barbara yelled and clapped nice catch sam great play youre a regular hoover out there he threw the ball back to the pfc who was playing short wondering what all the fuss was about if you couldnt make that play you werent a ballplayer not by the standards he set for himself of course by those standards he was probably the only ballplayer at the sunday afternoon pickup game he sight not have ever come close to the big leagues but even a class b outfielder looked like joe dimaggio here after an error on a routine ground ball a strikeout ended the inning yeager tossed his glove to the ground outside the foul line and trotted in to the chickenwire cage that served for a dugout he was due to lead off the bottom of the sixth hed walked his first time up and swung at a bad ball the second hitting a little bleeder that had been an easy out the pitcher for the other side had a pretty strong arm but he also thought he was bob felleror maybe getting yeager the last time had made him cocky after wasting a curve down and away he tried to bust sam in on the fists with a fastball it wasnt fast enough or far enough in sams eyes lit up as soon as he pulled the trigger thwack when you hit the ball dead square your hands hardly know its met the batbut the rest of you does and so does everybody else the pitcher wheeled through one of those ungainly pirouettes pitchers turn to follow the flight of a long ball the ball would have been out of fans field or any other park in the threei league but the field they were playing on didnt have fences the left fielder and center fielder both chased after the drive sam ran like hell he scored standing up his teammates pounded him on the back and slapped him on the butt behind the backstop barbara bounced up and down beside her ullhass and ristin hissed excitedly they werent about to try going anywhere not with so many soldiers around yeager sat down on the park bench in the dugout whew he said panting im getting too old to work that hard somebody found a threadbare towel and fanned him with it as if he were between rounds in a fight with joe louis im not dead yet he exclaimed and made a grab for it he got another hit his next time up a line single to center stole second and went to third when the catchers throw flew over the shortstops head the next batter picked him up with a ground single between the drawnin shortstop and third baseman that was the last run in a win you beat them almost singlehanded barbara said when he came around the wire fence to join her and the lizard pows i like to play he answered lowering his voice he added and this isnt near as tough a game as im used to you certainly made it look easy she said make the plays and it does look easy like anything else he said mess them up and you make people think nobody could ever play it right god knows ive done that often enough toootherwise i wouldnt have been in the bush leagues all those years how can you hit a round ball with a round stick and have it go so far ristin asked it seems impossible its a bat not a stick yeager answered as to how you hit it it takes practice hed let the lizards swing at easy tosses a few times they choked way up on the bat they were only about the size of tenyearolds even so they had trouble making contact come on somebody called picnics starting it wasnt a proper picnic to yeagers way of thinking no fire for wieners just sandwiches and some beer but the mps and air raid wardens would have come down on them like a ton of bricksif lizard bombers hadnt already used the point of flame as a target for some of their explosive goodies the sandwiches were tasty ham and roast beef on homebaked bread and the coors brewery was close enough to denver that even horsedrawn wagons brought enough into town to keep people happy the beer wasnt as cold as sam would have liked but hed grown up in the days before iceboxes were universal and falling back to those days wasnt too hard for him the breeze kicked up as the sun went down yeager wouldnt have minded a fire then not at all denver nights got chilly in a hurry ullhass and ristin felt it worse than he did they put on the heavy wool sweaters theyd had knotted around their skinny scaly waists the sky got dark in a hurry too once the sun slipped behind the rockies stars glittered brightly in the midnightblue bowl of the heavens the ballplayers were used to having the lizard pows around one of them pointed up to the points of light in the sky and asked hey ristin which one of those do you come from it is behind tosevyour star for this world ristin answered you cannot see it now the lizards come from the second planet of tau ceti yeager said theyve got their hooks on the second planet of epsilon eridani and the first planet of epsilon indi we were next on the list those are the names of stars said the fellow whod asked ristin where he was from ive never heard of any of em i hadnt either not till the lizards came sam answered i grew up on a farm tooi thought i knew stars like the back of my hand i knew the dippers and orion and the dogs and the zodiac and things like that but theres a lot more sky than i ever figured on and epsilon indis like the southern crosstoo far south to see from here so whatre these places like the man asked tosev is hotter and brighter than the sunthe sun of home i mean ristin said rabotevwhat you call epsilon eridanihe hissed the nameis like our sun but halless epsilon indianother hissis cooler and more orange next to any of the worlds the race rules tosev is cold and wet and not very comfortable he gave a theatrical shiver the suns a typeg star a yellow one yeager added so is tau ceti but its at the cool end of the g range and the suns at the warm end epsilon eridanis at the warm end of the k range which is the next one over from g and epsilon indis a little fellow at the cool end of that range how much of this stuff did you know before you started riding herd on the lizards there somebody asked slyly some not all yeager said if i hadnt known some i would have been lostbut then if i hadnt known some i wouldnt have gotten the job in the first place he added ive learned a heck of a lot since then too he would have made that stronger if barbara hadnt been sitting on the grass beside him she reached out and squeezed his hand im proud of how much you know she said he grinned like a fool till barbara hed never known a woman who gave a damn how smart he wasand precious few men either if a ballplayer read books on the train or the bus he got tagged professor and it wasnt the sort of nickname you wanted to have he climbed to his feet come on ullhass ristintime to take you back to your nice heated room the adjective got the lizards moving in a hurry as it usually did sam chuckled under his breath hed always figured white men knew more than indians because columbus had found america and the indians hadnt discovered europe by that standard the lizards knew more than people sam might have flown to far planets in his mind but the lizards had come here for real all the same though the gap wasnt so wide that he couldnt manipulate them so long sam see you in the morning way to play today slugger the ballplayers said their goodbyes the pitcher off whom hed homered and singled added ill get you next timeor maybe well be on the same side and i wont have to worry about it they like you barbara remarked as they picked their way across the dark university of denver campus with ristin and ullhass keeping an eye on them made his answer come slower than would have otherwise why shouldnt they like me im a regular guy i get along with people pretty well now barbara walked along silently for a while at last she said when i would go out with jens it was always as if we were on the outside looking in not part of the crowd this is different i like it okay good he said i like it too every time she compared him favorably to her former husband he swelled with pride he laughed a little maybe she was using that the same way he used the promise of heat with the lizards whats funny barbara asked nothings funny im happy thats all he slipped an arm around her waist crazy thing to say in the middle of a war isnt it but its true he got ristin and ullhass settled in their secured quarters then headed back to the apartment with barbara they were just coming to east evans street when a flight of lizard planes roared over downtown denver to the north along with the roar of their engines and the flat crummp of exploding bombs came the roar of all the antiaircraft guns in town inside half a minute the sky turned into a fourth of july extravaganza with tracers and bursting shells and wildly wigwagging searchlights doing duty for skyrockets and pinwheels and roman candles shrapnel pattered down like hail we better not stand here watching like a couple of dummies sam said that stuffs no good when it lands on your head holding barbaras hand led her across the street and into the apartment building he felt safer with a tile roof over him and solid brick walls all around the antiaircraft guns kept hammering for fifteen or twenty minutes which had to be long after the lizards planes were gone behind blackout curtains sam and barbara got ready for bed when she turned out the light the bedroom was dark as the legendary coal cellar at midnight sam slid toward her under the cover even through his pajamas and the cotton nightgown she wore the feel of her in his arms was worth all the gold in fort knox and another five bucks besides yeah happy so am i barbara giggled by the way hes poking me there youre not just happy she wasnt shy about it or upset either that was the good half of her having been married before she was used to the way men worked but yeager shook his head nah hes horny but im not really he answered id sooner just hold you for a while and then go to sleep she squeezed him tight enough to bring the air out in a surprised oof thats a very sweet thing to say its a very tired thing to say he answered which made her poke him in the ribs if i were ten years youngerah phooey if i were ten years younger you wouldnt want anything to do with me youre right she said but i like you fine the way you are youreally have learned an amazing amount about the lizards in a very short time as if to prove her own point she added an emphatic cough mm i suppose so he said not as much as i want to though not just for the sake of the war but because im curious too and theres one thing i dont begin to have a clue about whats that how to get rid of them yeager said barbara nodded against his chest he fell asleep with her still in his arms ussmak gunned the landcruiser toward the next tosevite town ahead mulhouse its name was after so long going up and down the road between besancon and belfort pushing past belfort made him feel he was exploring new territory he spoke that conceit aloud we might as well be part of the band of sherranyou know the first male to march all the way around home we studied sherran just out of hatchlinghood driver nejas said how long ago did he live a hundred fifty thousand years something like thatlong before the emperors unified home under their benevolent rule ussmak cast down his eye turrets but only for a perfunctory instant no matter how important formalities were to the life of the race not getting killed counted for even more and the more builtup the area got the more danger the landcruiser faced and the smaller the chance he had to react to it a cloth whipped in the breeze above a halfburnt building not the red white and blue stripes of france but a white circle on a red background with a twisty black symbol on the white the big uglies used such flapping rags to tell one of their tiny empires from the next ussmak felt a certain amount of pride that the forces of the race had at last penetrated into deutschland bullets rattled off the landcruisers flank and turret the cupola up top closed with a clang ussmak hissed in relief for the first time in a long while he had himself a landcruiser commander whom he would have minded seeing dead driver halt nejas ordered and ussmak obediently pressed on the brake pedal gunner turret bearing that building with the banner above it two rounds high explosive the machine gun is in there somewhere two rounds high explosive skoob echoed it shall be done superior sir the landcruisers main armament spoke once twice inside the hull shielded by steel and ceramic the reports were not especially loud but the heavy armored fighting vehicle rocked back on its tracks after each one through his vision slits ussmak watched the building already in ruins fly to pieces the flag on the makeshift staff was wiped away as if it had never existed forward driver nejas said in tones of satisfaction forward superior sir ussmak acknowledged and stepped on the accelerator no sooner had the landcruiser begun to roll though than more bullets pattered off its side and rear deck shall i give them another couple of rounds superior sir skoob asked no the infantry will dig them out soon enough the landcruiser commander said smallarms ammunition is still in good supply but were low on shells and well need highexplosive as well as armorpiercing if we have to fight inside mulhouse he didnt sound happy at the prospect ussmak didnt blame him landcruisers were made for quick slashing attacks to cut off and trap large bodies of the enemy not to get bogged down battling for a city one street at a time but taking cities with infantry alone used up males at an alarming rate even with air strikes armor had to help a cloud of dust rose not far in front of the landcruiser dirt and asphalt rose in a graceful fountain then pattered down again some of it onto ussmaks vision slits he hit the cleaner button to clear them inside the landcruiser he needed to worry about only a lucky hit from artilleryand if a round did pierce the vehicle hed probably be dead before he knew it night was falling when they approached the builtup area ussmak had seen ahead nejas said we have orders to halt outside of town this shall be done of course again the commander sounded less than pleased as if trying to convince himself he went on however good our nightvision equipment may be our commanders do not care to go in amongst the big uglies buildings in darkness this is no doubt a wise precaution ussmak wondered if you lost momentum sometimes you had trouble getting it back again he said superior sir just this once i wish our commanders would stick their tongues in the ginger jar maybe hed have a taste himself after everything was secured for the night nejas had searched the landcruiser for his little vial but hed never found it the commander said just this once maybe they should i never thought i would hear myself say that driver but you may well be right several landcruisers bivouacked together under the cover of some broad leafy trees not for the first time ussmak marveled at the spectacular profusion of plants on tosev far more varieties than home enjoyed or rabotev or halless he wondered if all the water on this world had something to do with that it was the most obvious difference between the planets of the empire and the big uglies homeworld even with infantry sentries all around nejas ordered his crewmales to stay in the landcruiser till theyd finished eating then he and skoob took their blankets and went under the big armored hull to sleep which gave them almost as much protection from the alert deutsch snipers as staying inside the turret would have ussmaks seat flattened out enough to let him stay inside the forward hull section through the night that night should have passed peacefully but it didnt he jerked awake in alarm when the turret hatches clanged open fearing big ugly raiders he grabbed for his personal weapon and crawled back through the hull to poke his head up through the bottom of the turret ring the silhouette above him unmistakably belonged to a male of the race whats going on ussmak said indignantly i could have shot you as easy as not dont speak to me of shooting nejas sounded furious for a tenth of a days pay id turn the main armament of this landcruiser on what are lyingly called our supply services give the order superior sir skoob said the gunner had to be even more irate than his commander you wouldnt need to pay me to make me obey id do it for free and gladly no supply service would be better than the mishatched one we have in placeor no worse anyhow for as best i can tell we have no supply service in place we expended a couple of rounds of high explosive against that machinegun nest yesterday if youll recall nejas said and we used the usual amount of armorpiercing finstabilized discarding sabot rounds tooyou may have noticed weve been fighting lately he sounded as sardonic as drefsab the most cynical male ussmak had ever met the driver caught the drift of the way things were going we didnt get resupplied he asked we got resupplied skoob said again echoing his commander he went on sarcastically in their infinite wisdom and generosity the fleetlords of the supply service have deigned to dole out to us five magnificent new rounds one of which is actually high explosive aii ussmak let out a hiss of pain theyve shorted us before but never anywhere near so badly if they do that for another two or three days we wont have any ammunition left its all right skoob said before long theyll stop issuing hydrogen too so we wont be going anywhere anyhow that alarmed ussmak all over again nejas said its not quite so bad to make hydrogen all they need is water and energy if tosev has too much of anything its water and energy is cheap but ammunition needs precision manufacture too and the big uglies who can do precision manufacture or most of them anyhow arent on our side so were short on landcruiser shells they made it sound very logical when they explained it superior sir i dont care about logic like that the gunner retorted i have a logic of my own if i dont get rounds for my gun and if the race doesnt take over some of the places here that can turn out our rounds well losebut how can we take them if we dont have the ammunition to do it believe me i wasnt supporting what the supply service males said just setting it forth nejas said as far as im concerned they all come out of addled eggs if we dont have the ammunition to do the job now its just going to be tougher later the gunner grunted right you are superior sir lets get what they gave us stowedthe emperor knows well need it tomorrow even if the supply service hasnt a clue one after another the five new rounds clunked into place in the racks go back to sleep driver nejas said when the job was done thats what were going to do anyhow ussmak did his best to go back to sleep but found himself worrying instead skoobs circular logic set his own head spinning if the race didnt have the munitions to overcome the big uglies how were they supposed to conquer tosev for that matter how were they supposed to conquer mulhouse they could fight their way into the town but what were they supposed to do when they had no more shells and supply services had none to bring forward get killed thats what ussmak thought hed come too close to getting killed already hed seen too many males die around him to contemplate that with equanimity he wiggled and twisted on the lowered seat trying to find a position where he wouldnt have to think the manufacturers of the seat seemed to have overlooked that important design feature when sleep would not come no matter bow he tried to lure it he sat up and ever so cautiously took his vial of ginger from its hiding place even though he was alone in the landcruiser he let his eye turrets swivel in all directions to make sure no one was watching him only then did his tongue flick out to taste the precious powder instantly his worries about how the advance into deutschland would continue fell away of course the race would do whatever was required ussmak could see could all but reach out and touch the best and easiest way to smash the big uglies once and for all he wished nejas and skoob were in here with him his wisdom would amaze them but somehow try as he would he couldnt make the image glittering in his gingerfilled mind turn from mere image into concrete words and plans that was the herbs frustration what it showed you seemed real until you tried to make it so then it proved as evanescent as the steam of his breath on a chilly tosevite morning maybe if i have another taste everything will come clear ussmak said he reached for the vial again even before his hand closed on it his tongue flicked out in anticipation liu han hated the little scaly devils photographs whether they moved or stood still oh they were marvelous in their way full of lifelike color and able to be viewed from more than one perspective almost as if they were life itself magically captured but they had seldom shown her anything she wanted to see when the little devils held her prisoner on the airplane that never came down theyd made moving pictures of the congress theyd forced her to have with men she hadnt wanted then after bobby fiore put a child in her theyd terrified her with images of a black woman dying in childbirth and now she stared down at the still photograph the scaly devil named ttomalss had just handed her a man lay on his back on the paved sidewalk of some city his face looked peaceful but he rested in a great glistening pool of blood and a submachine gun lay beside him this is the big ugly male named bobby fiore ttomalss asked in fair chinese yes superior sir liu han said in a small voice where is this picture from may i ask from the city called shanghai you know this city yes i know this cityi know of it i should say because i have never been there i have never been close to it liu han wanted to make that as plain as she could if bobby fiore had been killed fighting against the scaly devils as certainly looked likely she didnt want ttomalss to suspect she was involved of that she was innocent the little devil turned one eye turret toward the photograph the other toward her she always found that disconcerting he said this male of yours met these evil males who fight us while he was in this camp he met with them here in this house we have proof of this and you do not ever say it is a lie if he is with the big ugly bandits maybe you are with these bandits too in spite of the interrogative cough his words sounded much more like a threat no superior sir liu han used the other cough the emphatic one she would have been more emphatic still had she not been feeding the communists information for weeks fear clogged her throat to the little scaly devils she was hardly more than an animal moreover she was a woman and women always ended up with the raw end of any deal i think you are telling me lies ttomalss used the emphatic cough too liu han burst into tears part of that was strategy as calculating as any generals tears bothered the little scaly devils even more than they bothered men the little devils never cried seeing water from a persons eyes affected them much as seeing smoke coming out of someones ears would have affected her it distracted them and kept them from pushing as hard as they would have otherwise but if she forced the timing of the tears at bottom they were real enough without the scaly devils she never would have had anything to do with bobby fiore hed been just another of the men with whom theyd paired her but hed been as good to her as circumstances allowedand he was the father of the child that kicked in her belly even now seeing him dead in a great puddle of his own blood was like a blow to the face and she wept for herself just before the little scaly devils came down from the sky the japanese had bombed her village and killed her husband and son now bobby fiore was gone too everyone she cared about seemed to die she hugged herself her forearms went around the swell of her abdomen the baby kicked again what would the little devils do with it once it came out into the world fear filled her again ttomalss said stop this disgusting dripping and answer what i say i think you are lying i tell you i think you know much more of these bandits than you admit is that the right word admit good i think you hide this from us we do not put up with these lies forever i promise maybe not for long at all do you know what i think liu han said i think you have night soil where your wits should be how am i supposed to be a bandit i am in this camp you put me here you put all the people in here if there are bandits among them whose fault is that not mine i tell you she managed to startle ttomalss enough to make him turn both eye turrets toward her there are bandits in this camp i admit that when we set it up we did not know how many foolish and dangerous factions you big uglies had so we did not weed you carefully before we planted you here but just because the bandits are here does not mean a properly obedient person will have anything to do with them the phrase he used had the literal meaning of properly respectful to ones elders hearing a little devil speak of filial piety was almost enough to send liu han from tears to hysterical laughter but she sensed shed made him retreat he spoke to her now more as equal to equal not in the badgering way hed used before she pressed her tiny advantage besides how could i have anything to do with bandits you watch me all the time the only place i ever go is to the market what can i do there the bandits came here ttomalss said this malehe held up the photo of bobby fiores corpsewent with them you knew it and you said nothing to us you are not to be trusted i did not know where bobby fiore went or why she returned i never saw him again after thattill now she started to cry again i told you not to do that the little devil said peevishly i canthelp it liu han said you show me a horrible picture that says my man is dead you say i did all sorts of dreadful things mostof which i didand now you want me not to cry too much ttomalss threw his hands in the air much as liu hans husband had when hed given up arguing with her she hardly mourned him and her boy any more her life had taken too many other hammer blows since they died the scaly devil said enough maybe you are telling the truth our drug to learn this works imperfectly and i noted that we do not want to give it to you for fear of harming the hatchling growing inside you you big uglies are revolting in so many different ways and we have to learn about all of them if we are to rule you properly yes superior sir being bold came anything but easy for liu han however useful she found it she always breathed a silent sigh of relief when she returned to the submissive behavior that had been drilled into her since childhood the scaly devil said you will be closely watched if you have any sense you will act in a way that shows youremember this he stalked out of liu hans dwelling had he been a man he would have slammed the door behind him since he was a scaly devil he left it open liu han had learned that meant he thought anyone on the street was welcome to come in she poured herself a cup of tea from the battered brass pot that simmered above a charcoal brazier sipping it helped relax herbut not enough she walked over and closed the door but that didnt make her feel any more secure she was as much the little devils captive here as she had been in the metal cell on the airplane that never came down she wanted to scream and curse and tell ttomalss exactly what she thought of him but made herself hold back screaming and cursing would make her a scandal among her neighbors and being the little scaly devils creature made her scandal enough already besides they might be taking talking cinema pictures of her as they had to her shame up in that metal cell if she cursed them they could find out about it the baby moved inside her not a kick this time but a slow oceanic roll followed by a quick flutter again her arms went protectively round her belly if she kept on obeying the little devils what would the babys fate be and if she didnt obey them what would its fate be then she didnt think the communists would disappear even if the scaly devils conquered all of china all of the world she added to herself something that never would have occurred to her before she spent time with bobby fiore theyd kept right on fighting the japanese they would count on the people to hide them from the little devils and they were very good at revenge in the end fear wasnt what made her go out of her house and walk slowly toward the prison camp marketplace fury was fury with the little scaly devils for turning her life upside down for treating her like a beast rather than a human being or showing her without the slightest worry over what she night feel to see him dead the picture of the man shed come to loveall they wanted from her was to confirm the body did belong to bobby fiore bean sprouts candles fine tea here carved jade peas in their pods sandals and straw hats you cant eat my tasty ducks fine silk parasolskeep your pretty skin white pork sits sweet in your belly the hubbub of the market square surrounded liu han along with vendors shouting the virtues of their wares customers shouted scorn in the ageold struggle to get a better price the din was dreadful liu han could hardly hear herself think ttomalss had warned her she would be closely watched she believed that the little scaly devils didnt understand people well enough to lie convincingly but just because they watched her and listened to her could they understand anything she said in this racket she couldnt understand people who were yelling right beside her and the little devils had trouble following even the most plainspoken chinese she could probably say most of what she wanted without their being any the wiser she went slowly through the market stopping now here now there to haggle and gossip even had she been foolish enough to go straight to her contact in the marketplace the communists would have trained her to know better as things were she spent a lot of time loudly complaining about the little devils to a cadaverouslooking man who sold herbal medicinesand who worked for the kuomintang if the scaly devils landed on him theyd be doing the communists a favor eventually in the course of her wanderings she reached the poultry dealer who had his stand next to the bigbellied pork merchant with the open vest as she looked over the cutup chunks of duck and chicken she remarked as if it were something that mattered little to her the little devils showed me a picture of bobby fiore today they do not say so but they put an end to him i am sorry to hear this but we know the ghost lifeistranscendent has been seeking him the poultry seller also spoke obliquely that prancing ghost was a precursor of the god of death he was in a city liu han said may he have aided the rise of the proletarian movement the poultry seller answered he paused then asked very quietly was the city shanghai what if it was liu han was indifferent to her one city was just like another shed never lived in a place that had more people than this prison if it was the fellow went on a heavy blow against oppression and for the liberty of the oppressed peasants and workers of the world was struck there not long ago in his passing the foreign devil may well have shown himself to be a hero of the chinese people liu han nodded since the scaly devils had the photo of bobby fiore dead shed figured they were likely the ones who had shot himand the likeliest reason they had for shooting him was his being part of a red raiding team he wouldnt have thought of himself as a hero of the chinese people she was sure of that though living with her had rubbed some of the rough edges off him at heart he remained a foreign devil she didnt much care that he had died a hero either she would rather have had him back at her hut foreign and difficult but alive she would rather have had many things that hadnt happened the poultry seller said what other interesting gossip have you heard the kind of gossip he found interesting had to do with the little scaly devils what do you want for these chicken backs here she asked not responding right away he named a price she shrieked at him he yelled back she attacked his gouging with a fury that astonished her then after a moment she realized shed found a safe way to vent her sorrow for bobby fiore for whatever reasons he had the poultry seller got caught up in the squabble too i tell you foolish woman you are too stingy to deserve to live he shouted waving his arms and i tell you the little scaly devils are on especial watch for your kind so you had better take care liu han waved her arms too at the same time she watched the poultry sellers face to make sure he understood your kind to mean communists not thieving merchants he nodded he followed that perfectly well she wondered how long hed been a conspirator looking for double meanings everywhere and finding them too she hadnt been a conspirator long but shed managed to put a double meaning across even if the little devils were listening to and understanding every word she said they wouldnt have grasped the second message shed given the poultry seller she was learning the ways of conspiracy herself xix london was packed with soldiers and raf men sailors and government workers everyone looked worn and hungry and shabby the germans and then the lizards had given the city a fearful pounding from the air bombs and fires had cut broad swaths of devastation through it the phrase on everyone s lips was its not the place it used to be all the same it struck moishe russie as a close approximation to the earthly paradise no one turned to scowl at him as he hurried west down oxford street toward number in warsaw and lodz gentiles had made him feel he still wore the yellow star of david on his chest even after the lizards drove away the nazis the lizards werent hunting him here either there were no lizards here he didnt miss them and what the english reckoned privation looked like abundance to him people ate mostly bread and potatoes turnips and beets and everything was rationed but nobody starved nobody was close to starving his son reuven even got a weekly ration of milk not a lot but from what he remembered of his nutrition textbooks enough theyd apologized for the modest soho flat in which theyd set up his family but it would have made three of the ones hed had in lodz he hadnt seen so much furniture in years they werent burning it for fuel here he even had hot water from a tap whenever he wanted it a guard in a tin hat in front of the bbc overseas services building nodded as he showed his pass and went in waiting inside sipping a cup of ersatz tea quite as dreadful as anything available in poland stood nathan jacobi good to see you mr russie he said in english and then fell back into yiddish and now shall we go and give the lizards little stumpy tails a good yank that would be a pleasure moishe said sincerely he pulled his script from a coat pocket this is the latest draft with all the censors notes included im ready to record it for broadcast jolly good jacobi said again in english like david goldfarb he flipped back and forth between languages at will sometimes hardly seeming to realize he was doing so unlike goldfarbs his yiddish was not only fluent but elegant and unaccented he spoke like an educated warsaw jew russie wondered if his english was as polished jacobi led the way to a recording studio but for a couple of glass squares so the engineers could watch the proceedings the walls were covered with sounddeadening tiles each punched with its own square grid of holes on the table sat a microphone with a bbc plaque screwed onto its side a bare electric bulb threw harsh light down onto the table and the chairs in front of it the arrangements were as uptodate as human technology could produce moishe wished they impressed him more than they did they were certainly finer than anything the polish wireless services had had in but that was not the standard by which russie judged them in the first months after the lizards took warsaw hed broadcast antinazi statements for them compared to their equipment the bbc gear looked angular bulky and not very efficient rather like an early windup gramophone with trumpet speaker set alongside a modem phonograph he sighed as he sat down on one of the hardbacked wooden chairs and set his script in front of him the censors stampsa triangular one that said passed for security and a rectangle that read passed for contentobscured a couple of words he bent down to peer at them and make sure he could read them without hesitation even though the talk was being recorded for later broadcast he wanted to be as smooth as he could he glanced over to the engineer in the next room when the man suddenly shot out a finger toward him he began to talk good day people of earth this is moishe russie speaking to you from london in free england that i am here shows the lizards lie when they say they are invincible and their victory inevitable they are very strong no one could deny that but they are not supermenhed had to borrow ubermenschen from the german to put that acrossand they can be beaten i do not intend to say anything about how i came from poland to london for fear of closing that way for others who may come after me but i will say that i was rescued from a lizard prison in lodz that englishmen and local jews took part in the rescue and they defeated both the lizards and their human henchmen too many men women and children live in parts of the world under lizard occupation i understand that if you are to survive you must to some degree go on about your daily work but i urge you from the bottom of my heart to cooperate with the enemy as little as you can and to sabotage his efforts wherever you can those who serve as their prison guards and police those who seek work in their factories to make munitions that will be used against their fellow human beingsthey are traitors to mankind when victory comes collaborators will be remembered and punished if you see the chance move against them now he had his talk nicely timedhed practiced it with rivka back in the flat he was just reaching his summingup when the engineer held up one finger to show he had a minute left and came to the end as the fellow drew his index finger across his throat the engineer grinned and gave him a twofinger v for victory then it was nathan jacobis turn he read an english translation similarly stamped with censors marks of what russie had just said in yiddish the better to reach as large an audience as possible his timing was as impeccable as moishes had been this time the engineer signaled his approval with an upraised thumb i think that went very well jacobi said with any luck at all it should leave the lizards quite nicely browned off i hope so moishe said he got up and stretched wireless broadcasting was not physically demanding but it left him worn all the same getting out of the studio always came as a relief jacobi held the door open for him they went out together waiting in the hallway stood a tall thin tweedy englishman with a long craggy face and dark hair combed high in a pompadour he nodded to jacobi they spoke together in english jacobi turned to moishe and switched to yiddish id like to introduce you to eric blair hes talks producer of the indian section and he goes in after us russie stuck out his hand and said tell him im pleased to meet him blair shook hands with him then spoke in english again jacobi translated he says hes even more pleased to meet you youve escaped from two different sets of tyrants and honestly described the evils of both he added blair is a very fine fellow hates tyrants of all stripes he fought against the fascists in spainalmost got killed therebut he couldnt stomach what the communists were doing on the republican side an honest man we need more honest men moishe said jacobi translated that for blair the englishman smiled but suffered a coughing fit before he could answer moishe had heard those wet coughs in warsaw more times than he cared to remember tuberculosis the medical student in him said blair mastered the coughs then spoke apologetically to jacobi he says hes glad he did that out here rather than in the studio while he was recording jacobi said moishe nodded he understood and admired the workmanlike professional attitude you worked as hard as you could for as long as you could and if you fell in the traces you had to hope someone else would carry on blair pulled his script from a waistcoat pocket and went into the studio jacobi said ill see you later moishe im afraid i have a mountain of forms to fill out perhaps we should put up stacks of paper in place of barrage balloons theyd be rather better at keeping the lizards away i think he headed away to his upstairs office moishe went outside he decided not to head back to his flat right away but walked west down oxford street toward hyde park people mostly women often with small children in towbustled in and out of selfridges hed been in the great department store once or twice himself even with wartime shortages it held more goods and more different kinds of goods than were likely to be left in all of poland he wondered if the british knew how lucky they were the great marble arch where oxford street park lane and bayswater road came together marked the northeast corner of hyde park across park lane from the arch was the speakers corner where men and women climbed up on crates or chairs or whatever they had handy and harangued whoever would hear he tried to imagine such a thing in warsaw whether under poles nazis or lizards the only thing he could picture was the public executions that would follow unbridled public speech maybe england had earned its luck after all only a handful of people listened toor heckledthe speakers the rest of the park was almost as crowded with people tending their gardens every bit of open space in london grew potatoes wheat maize beets beans peas cabbages german submarines had put britain under siege the coming of the lizards brought little relief they werent as hard on shipping but america and the rest of the world had less to send these days the island wasnt having an easy time trying to feed itself perhaps in the long run it couldnt not if it wanted to keep on turning out war goods too but if the english knew they were beaten they didnt let on all through the park trenches some bare some with corrugated tin roofs were scattered among the garden plots like warsaw london had learned the value of air raid shelters no matter how makeshift moishe had dived into one of them himself when the sirens began to wail a few days before the old woman sprawled in the dirt a few feet away had nodded politely as if they were meeting over tea they d stayed in there till the all clear sounded then dusted themselves off and gone on about their business moishe turned and retraced his steps down oxford street he explored with caution wandering a couple of blocks away from the streets hed already learned had got him lost more than once and he was always looking the wrong way forgetting traffic moved on the left side of the street not the right had more motorcars been on the road he probably would have been hit by now he turned right onto regent street then left onto beak a group of men was going into a restaurant therethe barcelona he saw as he drew closer he recognized the tall thin figure of eric blair in the party the india section man must have finished his talk and headed off for lunch beak street led russie to lexington and from it to broadwick street on which sat his block of flats as with much of the soho district it held more foreigners than englishmen spaniards indians chinese greeksand now a family of ghetto jews he turned the key in the lock opened the door the rich odor of cooking soup greeted him like a friend from home he shrugged out of his jacket the electric fire here kept the flat comfortably warm not sleeping under mounds of blankets and overcoats was another reward of coming to england rivka walked out of the kitchen to greet him she wore a white blouse and a blue pleated skirt that reached halfway from the floor to her knees moishe thought it shockingly immodest but all the skirts and dresses shed been given when she got to england were of the same length you look like an englishwoman he told her she cocked her head to one side giving that a womans consideration after a moment she shook her head i dress like an englishwoman she said with the same precision a yeshiva student might have used to dissect a subtle talmudic point but theyre even pinker and blonder than the poles i think she flicked an imaginary bit of lint from her own dark curls he yielded well maybe so they all seem so heavy too he wondered whether that perception was real or just a product of so many years of looking at people who were slowlysometimes not so slowlystarving to death the latter he suspected that soup smells good in his own mind food had grown ever so much more important than it seemed before the war even with ration books theres such a lot to buy here rivka answered the pantry already bulged with tins and jars and with sacks of flour and potatoes rivka didnt take food for granted these days either wheres reuven moishe asked across the hall playing with the stephanopoulos twins rivka made a wry face they havent a word in common but they all like to throw things and yell so theyre friends i suppose thats good moishe did wonder though in poland the nazisand the poles toohad cared too much that jews were different from them no one here seemed to care at all in its own way that was disconcerting too as if to ease his mind over something he hadnt even mentioned rivka said davids mother telephoned this morning while you were at the studio we had a good chat that is good he said working phones were another thing he was having to get used to all over again they want us over for supper tomorrow night rivka said we can take the underground she gave me directions on how to do it she sounded excited as if she were going on safari moishe suddenly got the feeling she was adapting to the new city the new country faster than he was teerts felt bright alert and happy when major okamoto led him into the laboratory he knew he felt that way because the nipponese had laced his rice and raw fish with gingerthe spicy taste still lay hot on his tonguebut he didnt care no matter what created it the feeling was welcome until it wore off he would feel like a male of the race a killercraft pilot not a prisoner almost as much beneath contempt as the slops bucket in his cell yoshio nishina came round a corner teerts bowed in nipponese politeness no matter how much the ginger exhilarated him he was not so foolish as to forget altogether where he was konichiwa superior sir he said mixing his own language and nipponese good day to you as well teerts replied the leader of the nipponese nuclear weapons research team we have something new for you to evaluate today he spoke slowly not just to help teerts understand but also the male thought because of some internal hesitation what is it superior sir teerts asked the warm buzz of ginger spinning inside his head made him not want to care but experience with the nipponese made him wary in spite of the herb to which theyd addicted him now nishina spoke quickly to okamoto rather than directly to teerts the nipponese officer translated we need you to examine the setup of the uranium hexafluoride diffusion system we are establishing teerts was a little puzzled that was simple enough for him to have understood it in nipponese these days okamoto mainly reserved his translations for more complicated matters of physics but pondering the ways of big uglies even with a head full of ginger seemed pointless teerts bowed again and said it shall be done superior sir show me these drawings i am to evaluate he sometimes wondered how the big uglies managed to build anything more complicated than a hut without computers that let them change plans with ease and view proposed objects from any angle they had developed what seemed like a series of clumsy makeshifts to portray threedimensional objects on twodimensional paper some of them were like single views of computer graphics others weirdly showed top front and side views and expected the individual doing the viewing to combine them in his mind and visualize what the object was supposed to look like not used to the convention teerts had endless trouble with it now major okamoto bared his teeth in the tosevite gesture of amiability when the scientists smiled at teerts they were generally sincere he did not trust okamoto as far sometimes the interpreter seemed amiable but sometimes he made sport with his prisoner teerts was getting better at reading tosevite expressions okamotos smile did not strike him as pleasant the major said dr nishina is not speaking of drawings we have erected this facility and begun processing the gas with it we want you to examine it not pictures of it teerts was appalled for a whole queue of reasons i thought you were concentrating on production of element plutonium you call it thats what you said before we have decided to produce both explosive metals okamoto answered the plutonium project at the moment goes well but more slowly than expected we have tried to speed up the uranium hexafluoride project to compensate but there are difficulties with it you will evaluate and suggest ways to fix the problems you dont expect me to go inside this plant of yours do you teerts said you want me to check it from the outside whichever is necessary okamoto answered but one reason you have so much trouble with uranium hexafluoride is that its corrosive by nature teerts exclaimed in dismay his voice turning into a guttural hiss of fright if i go in there i may not come out and i do not want to breathe either uranium or fluorine you know you are a prisoner what you want is of no importance to me okamoto said you can obey or you can face the consequences ginger lent teerts spirit he couldnt have summoned without it i am not a physicist he shouted loud enough for the stolid guard who accompanied okamoto to unsling his rifle for the first time in many days i am not an engineer not a chemist either i am a pilot if you want a pilots view of what is wrong with your plant fine i do not think it will help you much though you are a male of the race major okamoto fixed teerts with a glare from the narrow eyes in that flat muzzleless face never had he looked more alien or more alarming by your own boasting your people have controlled atoms for thousands of years of course you will know more about them than we do honto nishina said that is true he went on in nipponese slowly so teerts could understand i was speaking with someone from the army telling him what the atomic explosive would be like he said to me if you want an explosive why not just use an explosive bakatareidiot teerts was of the opinion that most big uglies were idiots and that most of the ones who werent idiots were savage and vindictive instead expressing that opinion struck him as impolitic he said you tosevites have controlled fire for thousands of years if someone sent one of you to inspect a factory that makes steel how much would your report be worth to him he used nipponese for as much of that as he could and spoke the rest in his own language okamoto interpreted for nishina then much to teerts delight the two of them got into a shouting match the physicist believed teerts the major thought he was lying finally grudgingly okamoto yielded if you dont think he can be trusted to be accurate or if you think he truly is too ignorant to be reliable i must accept your judgment but i tell you that with proper persuasion he could give us what we need to know superior sir may i speak teerts asked hed understood that well enough to respond to it the surge of pleasure and nerve the ginger had brought was seeping away leaving him more weary and glum than he would have been had he never set tongue on the stuff okamoto gave him another baleful stare speak his voice held a clear warning that if teerts words were not very much to the point he would regret it superior sir i just wish to ask you this have i not cooperated with you since the day i was captured i have told everything i know about aircraft to the males of your army and navy and i have told everything i knowmuch more than i thought i knewto these males here whom your professor nishina leadshe bowed to the physicisteven though they are trying to build weapons to harm the race okamoto bared his broad flat teeth to teerts they were unimpressive being neither very sharp nor very numerous he did however recognize the big uglys ugly grimace as a threat gesture mastering himself okamoto answered you have cooperated yes but you are a prisoner so you had better cooperate we have given you better treatment since you showed yourself useful too more comfort more food ginger teerts added he wasnt sure whether he was agreeing with okamoto or contradicting him the herb made him feel wonderful while he tasted it but the big uglies werent giving it to him for his benefit they wanted to use it to warp him to their will he didnt think they had so farbut how could he be sure ginger hai okamoto said suppose i tell you that after you go look at this uranium hexafluoride setup we will give you not just ginger powder with your rice and fish but pickled ginger root as much as you can eat youd go then neh as much ginger as he could eat did tosev hold that much ginger the craving rose up and grabbed teerts like a hand around his throat he needed all his will to say superior sir what good is ginger to me if i am not alive to taste it okamoto scowled again he turned back to nishina if he is not going to inspect the facility do you have any more use for him today the physicist shook his head to teerts okamoto said come along then i will take you back to your cell teerts followed okamoto out of the laboratory the guard followed them both even through the melancholy he felt after gingers exaltation left him teerts felt something akin to triumph that triumph faded as he went out onto the streets of tokyo even more man than he had in harbin he felt himself a mote among the vast swarms of big uglies in those streets hed been alone in harbin yes but the race was advancing on the mainland city had things gone well he could have been reunited with his own kith at any time but things had not gone well here in tokyo even the illusion of rescue was denied him sea protected the islands at the heart of the tosevite empire of nippon from immediate invasion by the race he was irremediably and permanently at the mercy of the big uglies they stared at him as he walked down the street hatred seemed to rise from them in almost visible waves like heat from red glowing iron for once he was glad to be between major okamoto and the guard tokyo struck him as a curious mixture some of the buildings were of stone and glass othersmore and more outside the central cityof wood and what looked like thick paper the two styles seemed incompatible as if theyd hatched from different eggs he wondered how and why they coexisted here airraid sirens began to wail as if by magic the streets emptied okamoto led teerts into a packed shelter in the basement of one of the stoneandglass buildings outside antiaircraft guns started pounding teerts hoped all the races pilotsmales from his flight perhapswould return safely to their bases do you wonder why we hate you when you do this to us okamoto asked as the sharp deep blasts of bombs contributed to the racket no superior sir teerts answered he understood it well enoughand what it would do to him sooner or later his eye turrets swiveled this way and that for the first time since hed resigned himself to captivity he began looking for ways to escape he found none but vowed to himself to keep looking wearing his majestys uniform once more felt most welcome to david goldfarb the ribbon of the military medal in the colors of the union jack held a new place of pride just above his left breast pocket hed imagined the only way a radarman could win a ground combat medal was to have the jerries or the lizards invade england going to poland as a commando hadnt been what hed had in mind bruntingthorpe had changed in the weeks hed been away more and more pioneer and meteor jet fighters sheltered in revetments the place was becoming a working air base rather than an experimental station but fred hipples team for evaluating lizard engines and radars still worked hereand goldfarb had not been surprised to discover on his return still shared a nissen hut with the meteorologists the one they had occupied was replaced but somebody else worked in it these days he traded greetings with his comrades as he went in and got ready to go to work the stuff brewing in the pot above the spirit lamp wasnt exactly tea but with plenty of honey it was drinkable he poured himself a cup adulterated it to taste and went over to the lizard radar unit it hadnt languished while hed been performing deeds of derringdo and speaking yiddish another radarman an impossibly younglooking fellow named leo horton had made a good deal of progress on it in the interim morning to you horton said in a nasal devonshire accent morning goldfarb agreed he sipped the notquitetea hoping this mornings batch would carry a jolt you couldnt gauge that in advance these days sometimes you could drink it by the gallon and do nothing but put your kidneys through their paces sometimes half a cup would open your eyes wide as hangar doors it all depended on what went into the witches brew on any given day i think ive made sense of some more of the circuitry horton said he was frightfully clever with a theoretical background in electronics and physics goldfarb couldnt come close to matching he also had a fine head for beer and perhaps not least because he made them feel motherly was cutting quite a swath through the barmaids up in leicester he reminded goldfarb of an improved model of jerome jones which was plenty to make him feel inadequate but business was business good show goldfarb said show me what youve got you see this set of circuits here horton pointed to an area of the disassembled radar not far from the magnetron im pretty sure it controls the strength of the signal you know i suspected that before i got drafted away from here goldfarb said i didnt have the chance to test it though whats your evidence horton opened a fat notebook with a cover almost the exact dark blue of his raf uniform here look at these oscilloscope readings when i shunt power through this lead here he pointed again to show which one he meant i think youre right goldfarb said and look at the amplification he whistled softly we wouldnt just be promotedwed be bloody knighted if we found out how the lizards do this and we could fit it into our own sets too true but good luck horton replied i can tell you what those circuits do but i will be damned if i have the slightest notion of how they do it if you took one of our lancs and landed it at a royal flying corps base in not that you could because no runways then were anywhere near long enoughthe mechanics then would stand a better chance of understanding the aircraft and all its systems than we do of making sense ofthis he jabbed a thumb at the lizard radar its not quite so bad as that goldfarb said group captain hipple and his crew have made good progress with the engines oh indeed but hed already figured out the basic principles involved we have the basic principles of radar goldfarb protested but their radar is further ahead of ours than their jet engines are horton said its just the quality of the metallurgy that drives the group captain mad here the lizards are using a whole different technology to achieve their results no valves everything so small the circuits only come clear under the microscope figuring out what anything does is a triumph figuring out how it does it is a wholly different question dont i know it goldfarb said ruefully there have been daysand plenty of emwhen id sooner have kicked that bleeding radar out onto the rubbish pitch than worked on it ah but you have managed to get away for a bit horton pointed to the military medal ribbon on goldfarbs chest i wish id had the chance to try to earn one of those remembering terror and flight goldfarb started to say he would have been just as glad not to have had the opportunity but that wasnt really true getting his cousin moishe and his family out of poland had been worth doing he knew only pride that hed been able to help there the other thing he noted with a small shock was the edge of genuine envy in hortons voice the new radarmans savvy had intimidated him ever since he got back to bruntingthorpe finding out that horton admired him was like a tonic he remembered the gap that had existed back at dover between those who went up to do battle in the air and those who stayed behind and fought their war with electrons and phosphors but goldfarb had crossed to the far side of that gap even before he went to poland hed gone aloft in a lancaster to test the practicability of airborne radar sets hed taken lizard fire then too but returned safely ground combat though was something else again if one of those lizard rockets had struck the lanc he never would have seen the alien who killed him ground combat was personal hed shot people and lizards in lodz and watched them fall he still had nasty dreams about it leo horton was still waiting for an answer goldfarb said in the long run what we do here will have more effect on how the war ends than anything anyone accomplishes gallivanting about with a bloody knife between his teeth you go gallivanting about with a knife between your teeth and itll turn bloody in short order thats for certain horton said flight officer basil roundbush came in and poured himself a cup of ersatz tea his broad ruddy face lit up in a smile not bad today by jove he said probably does taste better after you run it through that soup strainer youve got on your upper lip goldfarb said youre a cheeky bugger you know that roundbush took a step toward goldfarb as if in anger goldfarb needed a distinct effort of will to stand his ground he gave away three or four inches and a couple of stone in weight not only that roundbush wore a virtual constellation of pot metal and bright ribbons on his chest hed flown spitfires against the luftwaffe in what then looked to be britains darkest hour just a joke sir horton said hastily youre new here roundbush said his voice amused i know its a joke and whats more goldfarb there knows i know isnt that right goldfarb his expression defied the radarman to deny it yes sir i think so goldfarb answered although one cant be too certain with a man who grows such a vile caricature of a mustache leo horton looked alarmed roundbush threw back his head and roared laughter you are a cheeky bugger and you skewered me as neatly there as if you were errol flynn in one of those hollywood cinemas about pirates he assumed a fencing stance and made cutandthrust motions that showed he had some idea of what he was about he suddenly stopped and held up one finger i have it best way to rid ourselves of the lizards would be to challenge them to a duel foil epee sabermakes no difference our champion against theirs winner take all from one of the tables strewn with jet engine parts wing commander julian peary called one of these days basil youreally should learn the difference between simplifying a problem and actually solving it yes sir roundbush said not at all respectfully then he turned wistful it would be nice though wouldnt it to take them on in a contest where we might have the advantage something to that peary admitted leo horton bent over a scrap of paper sketched rapidly in a minute or two he held up a creditable drawing of a lizard wearing a longsnouted knights helmet complete with plume and holding a broadsword prepare to die earthling varlet the alien proclaimed in a cartoonstyle speech bubble that s not bad roundbush said we ought to post it on a board here thats quite good goldfarb said you should think of doing portrait sketches for the girls horton eyed him admiringly no flies on you ive done that a few times it works awfully well unfair competition thats what i call it basil roundbush grumped i shall write my mp and have him propose a bill classing it with all other forms of poaching as helpful as hed been before peary said you couldnt poach an egg and i wouldnt give long odds about your writing either about then goldfarb noticed fred hipple standing in the doorway and listening to the backandforth roundbush saw the diminutive group captain at the same moment whatever hot reply hed been about to make died in his throat with a gurgle hipple ran a forefinger along his thin brown mustache a band of brothers one and all he murmured as he came inside sir if we cant rag one another half the fun goes out of life roundbush said for you basil more than half unless im sadly mistaken hipple said which made the flight officer blush like a child but hipples voice held no reproof he went on so long as it doesnt interfere with the quality of our work i see no reason for the badinage not to continue ah capital roundbush said in relief that means i can include my distinguished grayhaired superior in that letter to my mp perhaps i can arrange to have his tongue ruled a noxious substance and shipped out of the country or at least possibly rabid and so subject to six months quarantine julian peary was not about to let himself be upstaged if we inquire at all closely into what your tongue has been doing basil old boy i dare say wed find it needs more quarantine than a mere six months roundbush had turned pink at hipples gibe now he went brickred torpedoed at the waterline goldfarb whispered to leo horton hes sinking fast the other radarman grinned and nodded hipple turned to the two of them goldfarb was afraid hed overheard but he just said how are we coming at fitting a radar set into the meteor fuselage gentlemen as long as we dont fly with fuel tanks in there well be fine sir goldfarb answered deadpan hipple gave him a fishy stare then laughedwarilyand nodded goldfarb went on horton though has made some exciting finds about which part of the circuitry controls signal amplitude hed expected that to excite hipple who had been almost as eager to learn about radar as he had been to tinker with his beloved jet engines but ripple just asked is it something we can apply immediately no sir horton answered i know what they do but not how they do it then well just have to leave it ripple said for now we must be as utilitarian as possible goldfarb and horton exchanged glances that didnt sound like the fred ripple theyd come to know whats up sir goldfarb asked roundbush and the other raf officers who worked directly under the group captain also paid close attention but hipple just said time is not running in our favor at the moment and buried his nose in an engineering drawing time for what goldfarb asked horton in a tiny voice the other radarman shrugged one more thing to worry about goldfarb thought and went back to work except for being illuminated only by sunlight dr hiram sharps office in ogden didnt seem much different from any other jens larssen had visited dr sharp himself a round little man with goldrimmed glasses looked at jens over the tops of them and said son youve got the clap i knew that thanks jens said somehow he hadnt expected such forthrightness from a doctor in mormon utah he supposed doctors saw everything even here after that hesitation he went on can you do anything about it not much dr sharp answered altogether too cheerfully for jens taste if i had sulfa i could give you some of that and cure you like nobodys business if i had acriflavine i could squirt it up your pipe in a bulb syringe you wouldnt like that for beans but it would do you some good but since i dont no point fretting over it the mere thought of somebody squirting medicine up his pipe made larssen want to cover his crotch with both hands well what do you have that will do me some good he demanded dr sharp opened a drawer pulled out several little foilwrapped packets and handed them to him rubbers he said as if jens couldnt figure that out for himself keep you from passing it along for a while anyway he pulled out a fountain pen and a book full of ruled pages whered you get it you know have to keep records even with everything all gone to hell these days a waitress named mary back in idaho springs colorado well well the doctor scribbled a note you do get around dont you son you know this here waitress last name it was uh cooley i think you think you got to know her pretty well some ways though didnt you dr sharp whistled tunelessly between his teeth okay never mind that for now you screw anybody else between there and here no jens looked down at the rubbers in his hand next time he did end up in the sack with a woman he might use one or he might not after what the bitches had done to him he figured he was entitled to get some of his own back just been a boy scout since you got your dose have you sharp said bet you wish you were a boy scout when you got it too the thought had crossed my mind larssen said dryly the doctor chuckled jens went on truth is ive been moving too much to spend time chasing skirt im on government business who isnt these days dr sharp said governments just about the last thing left thats workingand it isnt working what youd call well god only knows how were supposed to hold an election for president next year what with the lizards holding down half the country and beating the tar out of the half i hadnt thought of that jens admitted it was an interesting problem from a theoretical point of view as a theoretical physicist he could appreciate that the only even remotely similar election would have been the one of and by then north had pretty much won the civil war it wasnt invaded itself maybe fdr has volunteered for the duration maybe he has sharp said damned if i know whod run against him anyhow or how hed campaign if he did yeah jens said look doc if you dont have any medication thatll help me what am i supposed to do about what ive got dr sharp sighed live with it as best you can i dont know what else to tell you the drugs weve been getting the past few years theyve let us take a real bite out of germs for the first time ever i felt like i was really doing something worthwhile and now im just an herbandroot man again same as my grandpa back before the turn of the century oh maybe a better surgeon than gramps was and i know about asepsis and he didnt but thats about it im sorry son i dont have anything special to give you im sorry too larssen said do you think im likely to find any other doctors who have the drugs you were talking about even if the acriflavine treatment sounded worse than the disease it was supposed to help at least it would be over pretty soon you got gonorrhea for keeps nobody else here in ogden thats for damn sure dr sharp answered we share what we have not that its much your best bet would be some fellow in a little town who hasnt used up all his supplies and doesnt mind sharing them with strangers passing through a lot of that kind though wont treat anybody but the people they live with its like were going back to tribes instead of being one country any more jens nodded ive seen that too i dont much like it but i dont know what to do about it either before the lizards came hed taken for granted the notion of a country stretching from sea to shining sea now he saw it was an artificial construct built on the unspoken agreement of citizens and on long freedom from internal strife he wondered how many other things hed taken for granted werent as selfevident as they seemed to be like barbara always loving you for instance he thought dr sharp stuck out a hand sorry i couldnt help you more son no charge not when i didnt do anything good luck to you thanks a bunch doc larssen picked up the rifle he propped in a corner of the office slung it over his should and left without shaking hands sharp stared after him but you didnt want to get huffy with somebody packing a gun jens had chained his bicycle to a telephone pole outside the doctors office it was still there when he went out to get it looking up and down washington boulevard which us turned into when it ran through ogden he saw quite a few bikes parked with no chains at all the mormons were still trusting people his mouth twisted hed been trusting too and look where it had got him in ogden goddamn utah on my way to a job nobody else wants he muttered a fellow in overalls driving a horsedrawn wagon down the street gave him a reproachful stare he glared back so fiercely that mr overalls went back to minding his own business which was a pretty good idea any way you looked at it a puff of breeze from the west brought the smell of the great salt lake to his nostrils ogden lay in a narrow stretch of ground between the lake and the forestcovered wasatch mountains larssen had grown used to the tang of the sea his grad school days out in berkeley but the great salt lake odor was a lot stronger almost unpleasant hed heard you floated there that you couldnt sink even if wanted to wish i could throw yeager in and find out by experiment he thought and that waitress too id hold em under if they didnt drown on their own he stowed the chain swung up onto his bike and started pedaling north up washington he rolled past city hall park the threestory brick pile of the broom hotel with its eighteen odd bulging windows another threestory building at the corner of twentyfourth street had the wooden statue of a horse atop it complete with a tail that streamed in the breeze he had to stop there to let a convoy of wagons head west down twentyfourth while he waited he turned to a fellow on horseback and asked you live here when the man nodded went on whats the story of the horse he pointed to the statue oh nigger boy the man said he was a local racehorse hed beat critters you couldnt believe if you didnt see it now hes the best weather forecaster in town oh yeah jens said hows that the local grinned if hes wet you know its raining if covered with snow you know its been snowing and if tails blowin around like it is now its windy out walked into that one didnt i jens said snorting the wagon of the convoy creaked by he started rolling again soon passed tabernacle park the ogden latter day saints tabernacle was one of the biggest fanciest buildings in town hed seen that elsewhere in utah too the temples much more the focus of public life than the buildings dedicated to secular administration separation of church and state was another of the things i taken for granted that didnt turn out to be as automatic as hed thought here in utah he got the feeling they separated things to keep outsiders happy without really buying into notion that that was the right and proper way to operate he shrugged it wasnt his problem he had plenty of his own just past the city cemetery a concrete bridge took him over ogden river by then he was just about out of town the scrubby country ahead didnt look any too appetizing no wonder the mormons settled here he thought who else would be crazy enough to want land like this he lifted one hand to scratch his head as far as he was concerned what the mormons believed was good only for a belly laugh even so hed never felt safer in all his travels than he did in utah whether the doctrines were true or not they turned out solid people is that what the answer is he wondered as long as you seriously believe in something almost no matter what you have a pretty good chance of ending up okay he didnt care for the idea hed dedicated his career to pulling objective truth out of the physical world theological mumbojumbo wasnt supposed to stack up against that kind of dedication but it did maybe the mormons didnt know a thing about nuclear physics but they seemed pretty much content with the lives they were living which was a hell of a lot more than he could say himself putting your faith in what some book told you without any other evidence to show it was on the right track struck him as something right out of the middle ages ever since the renaissance people had been looking for a better freer way to live jesus loves me this i know cause the bible tells me so jens lip curled derisively sunday school pap thats what it was and yet when you looked at it the right way accepting your religion could be oddly liberating instead of being free to make choices you were free from making them theyd already been made for you and all you had to do was follow along yeah thats what hitler and stalin peddle too larssen said as he left ogden behind thinking was what he did best the idea of turning that part of him over to somebody else sent the heebiejeebies running up and down his spine people looked up from whatever they were doing when he rode past he didnt know how they did it but they could tell he didnt belong here maybe somebodyd pinned a sign to him i am a gentile he laughed partly at himself partly at utah hell even jews were gentiles here up ahead on us a fellow was riding a buckboard that had probably been sitting in the barn since his grandfathers day as jens put his back into pedaling and whizzed past the gray mule drawing the buggy the man called out to him you headin up toward idaho stranger stranger yeah they could tell all right larssen almost kept going without answering but the question hadnt sounded hostile or suspicious he slowed down and said what if i am just that you oughta be careful is all the man on the buckboard answered them lizard things theres some of em up there i hear tell are there jens said if he wanted to abdicate responsibility for his life that would be the way to do it he had enough reasons for thinking it wouldnt be such a bad thing either he owed so many people so much are there good he turned on the heat and left the fellow in the buggy staring after him the only way mutt daniels had ever wanted to see the south side of chicago was to bring in a bigleague team to play the white sox at comiskey park hed learned though that what you wanted and what life handed you all too often werent the same thing take the gold bars he wore on his shoulders he hadnt even changed shirts when he got em because he had only one shirt hed just taken off the stripes with somebodys bayonet and put on lieutenants insignia instead people from his old squad still called him sarge he didnt care he felt like a sergeant and the platoon he was leading now had taken enough casualties that it had only two squads worth of guys anyway one nice thing about turning into an officer was that he got his orders with one less layer of manure on top and that they gave him a bigger picture of what was going on as now captain sid klein whod been lieutenant klein till captain maczek got hit drew in the dirt between the ruins of what hadnt been fancy apartment buildings even before the lizards came saying it may not look that way boys but the brass says weve got these scaly bastards right where we want em yeah an we retreated through half of illinois to get em here too mutt said the captain was half his age damn near everybody in the army seemed like was half his age klein said you may think youre joking but youre not when it comes to maneuver they got us licked their tanks and trucks are faster than ours and theyve got those goddamn helicopters to give it to us in the rear when were bent over the wrong way but that doesnt count for much in city fighting here its just slugging block by block body by body mutts opposite number for the companys first platoon was a skinny midwesterner named chester hicks puts a lot of bodies underground he observed lord you can say that again daniels said i did some of that blockbyblock stuff last fall and its ugly even for war its ugly captain klein nodded you bet it is but the brass dont think the lizards can afford that kind of slugging any more when the germans were blitzing across russia in they got their noses bloody when they went into the towns not out on the plains maybe itll be the same way here and if it aint so what cause the lizards drove us back here anyways mutt said youre right about that captain klein sighed and ran a hand through his short curly red hair we gotta do all we can though go on back to your boys and give em the word mutts platoon was defending a couple of blocks of east th street off to the west was the gothic ornateness of the morgan park military academy daniels wondered if the cadets were in the line somewhere the way the boys from the virginia military institute had marched out and fought during the states war he didnt see anybody who looked like a cadet but he knew that didnt mean anything it was a hell of a big fight to the east was an american strongpoint on the high ground of pullman and then east of that the marsh around lake calumet if the lizards dislodged his boys he aimed to fall back to the east if he could north of th street stood the low ornate buildings that housed the pullman car shops hed fought through blocks of factories before that was even worse than the trenches had been back in france but captain klein was right about one thing digging determined troops out of a warren like that would cost the lizards plenty some of the platoons foxholes and bits of trench were on he south side of th some on the north some were literally in the middle of the street bombs and shells had torn big holes in the asphalt dracula szabo waved to daniels as he came up the broken sidewalk szabo was wearing the chevrons mutt had cut off his own sleeve mutts old squad belonged to him now mutt was sure the men would get on better than most as long as there were supplies to scrounge dracula would figure out how to scrounge them now he said took ya long enough to get back sargeuh i mean lieutenant youre lucky we still got more o what i came up with not more fancy booze mutt said i told you a dozen times if it aint beer or bourbon i aint interestednot real interested anyways he amended hastily bettern booze dracula said and before daniels could deny that anything was better than booze he named something that was or at least harder to come by i found somebodys stash o cigarettes ten beeyooteefull lovely cartons of pall malls goddamn mutt said reverently howd you manage that one cmere an ill show ya proud of his exploit szabo led daniels to one of the battered houses on the south side of th street then down into the basement it was dark down there and full of cobwebs mutt didnt like it worth a damn dracula seemed right at home he might have been in a transylvanian castle he started stomping on the floor it was somewhere right around here he muttered then grunted in satisfaction there you hear that a hollow daniels said you betcha szabo agreed he flicked on his zippo lifted up the board pointed lined with lead too so it dont get wet in there he reached in pulled out a couple of cartons and handed them to mutt here these are the last ones the precious tobacco had disappeared into daniels pack by the time he went outside again he didnt know whether dracula was telling the truth but if he tried putting the arm on him this time he was liable never to see any more bounty i want to jam a whole pack in my face all at once he said but i figure the first dragll be enough to do for meor maybe do me in i aint had one in so long yeah i know what you mean szabo said its been a while even for me mutt gave him a sharp stare at thathad he been holding out on other finds but szabo just gazed back bland as a preacher mutt gave up suddenly he grinned and headed off to a brick cottage a few hundred yards north of the front lines the house had a big red cross painted inside a whitewashed circle on the roof and a red cross flag flying on a tall pole above it to show the lizards what it was before mutt got halfway there the grin evaporated she dont even smoke he muttered to himself she said as much he stopped kicking a stone in irresolution then he pressed on even so i know what to do with em just the same perhaps because of the warning tokens the house that held the aid station and several around it were more or less intact though cattle could have grazed on their lawns here and there untended zinnias and roses bloomed brightly a medic on the front steps of the aid station nodded to daniels morning lieutenant mornin mutt went on up the stairs past the tiredlooking medic and into the aid station things had been pretty quiet the past couple of days the lizards didnt seem any too enthusiastic about the street fighting theyd have to do to take chicago only a handful of injured men sprawled on the cots and couches packed into every available inch of floor space lucille potter bent over one of those men changing a wound dressing the fellow sucked in his breath to keep from crying out when he was able to drive some of the rawness from his voice he said carefully that hurt some maam i know it did henry she answered but we have to keep the wound as clean as we can if we dont want it to get infected like a lot of nurses she used the royal we when talking to patients she looked up and saw daniels hello mutt what brings you here got a present for you miss lucille daniels said henry and a couple of the other guys in the aid station laughed one of them managed a wheezing wolf whistle lucilles face froze the look she gave mutt said youre going to have to stay after school charlie she figured he was trying to get her into the sack with whatever his present turned out to be as a matter of fact he was but he was smart enough to figure out that sometimes the indirect approach was the only one that stood a chanceif any approach stood a chance which wasnt nearly obvious he shrugged off his pack reached into it and pulled out one of the cigarette cartons the wounded dogface whod let out the wolf whistle whistled again a single low awed note mutt tossed the pack underhanded to lucille here you go share these out with the guys who come through here and want em flesh clung too close to the bony underpinnings of her face for it to soften much but her eyes were warm as she surehandedly caught the carton of pall malls thank you mutt ill do that she said a lot of people will be glad you found those dont give me the credit for that he said dracula found em i might have known she answered smiling now but you were the one who thought to bring them here so ill thank you for that me too sir henry said aint seen a buttuh a cigarettein a heheck of a long time got that right the whistler said maam can i have one now please ill be a good boy all the way till christmas if i can i promise he drew a bandaged hand over his chest in a crisscross pattern victor youre impossible lucille said but she couldnt keep from laughing she opened the carton then opened a pack the wounded men sighed as she took out a cigarette for each of them mutt could smell the tobacco all the way across the room lucille went through bet pockets her mouth twisted in annoyance does anyone have a match i do mutt produced a box good for startin fires at nightand besides you never can tell when you might come across somethin he handed the matches to lucille she lit cigarettes for her patients the aroma of fresh tobacco had made his nose sit up and take notice real tobacco smoke harsh and sweet at the same time was almost too much to bear give the lieutenant one too maam victor said hadntve been for him none of usd have any the other wounded soldiers agreed loudly a couple of them paused to cough in the middle of agreeing after you hadnt smoked for a while you lost the knack lucille brought the pack over to him he took out a cigarette tapped it against the palm of his hand to tamp down the tobacco and stuck it in his mouth he started to reach for the matches too but lucille had already struck one he bent down over it to get a light now this heres livin he said sucking in a long deep drag of smoke gettin your cigarette lit for you by a beautiful woman the gis whooped lucille sent him an illgetyoulater look he ignored it partly on general principles partly because he was busy coughing himselfthe smoke tasted great but it felt like mustard gas in his lungs spit flooded into his mouth he felt dizzy lightheaded the same way he had when he first puffed on a corncob pipe back in the dying days of the last century cigarettes may be good for morale lucille said primly but theyre extremely unhealthful what with everything out there that can kill me quick or chop me up i aint gonna worry about somethin thats liable to kill me slow mutt said he took another drag this one did what it was supposed to do his body remembered all the smoke hed put into it after all the wounded soldiers laughed again lucille sent him that narroweyed stare again if theyd been by themselves she would have tapped her foot on the ground too then a smile slowly stole across her face there is something to that she admitted mutt beamed any concessions he managed to get from her made him feel grand he brought his right hand up to the rim of his helmet in a sketched salute im gonna get back to my platoon miss lucille he said hope those cigarettes last you a good long time on account of thatll mean not too many guys gettin hurt thank you for your kindness mutt she answered the soldiers echoed her he nodded and waved and went outside the cigarette was still hanging out of the corner of his mouth but the medic taking a break on the front steps didnt notice till he caught the smell of smoke when he did his head came up as if he were a bird dog taking a scent he stared in disbelieving envy as mutt smoked the pall mall down to where the coal singed his lips then stubbed out the tiny butt on the sidewalk everything stayed pretty quiet as mutt made his way back to his unit off in the distance somewhere artillery rumbled like faroff thunder a couple of plumes of smoke rose one over toward lake calumet the other way off in the west but for somebody whod seen more close combat than he wanted to think about that kind of stuff was hardly worth noticing when he got back he discovered that a lot of his dogfaces had acquired cigarettes too dracula szabo was looking sleek and prosperous mutt suspected he hadnt given his chums smokes for free keeping your lieutenant happy was part of the cost of doing business but the rest of the soldiers were the guys you did business with as long as nobody in the platoon beefed to mutt about being gouged he was willing to look the other way he sent scouts out well south of th street to make sure the lizards wouldnt get away with pulling a fast one after darkness fell he was sorting through ration cans to see what hed have for supper when lucille potter came up everyone in the platoon who saw her greeted her like an older sister or a favorite aunt or even a mom shed been theirs for a long time before the shortage of anybody who knew anything about patching up the wounded forced her out of the front line got some smokes for the guys youre taking care of miss lucille dracula said thats been taken care of bela thank you though youre kind to offer she turned to mutt raised one eyebrow the ones you brought came from your own supply well yeah miss lucille mutt kicked at bits of broken concrete from what had been a sidewalk that just makes it nicer of you she said and he felt hed done his problem on the blackboard right to share what dracula passed on to you in particulari dont think that that many people would have done as much wasnt so much of a much he said though under dirt and stubble he knew he was turning red he held out a can of beef stew to lucille care to stay for some supper all right she pulled a can opener out of a pistolstyle holster on her belt and made short work of the lid to the stew she dug in with a spoon then sighed another cow that died of old ageand the potatoes and carrots with it mutt opened an identical can he sighed too after his first taste youre right about that sure enough but it does stick to your ribs better food than they gave us in france ill tell you that the trick in france was getting the frenchies to feed you then you ate good they could make horse meat taste like a tbone he didnt know what all hed eaten over there but he remembered it fondly before lucille answered lizard artillery opened up off to the east shells whistled in maybe half a mile awaynot close enough to make him dive for cover he looked over to see if theyd done any damage at first he didnt notice anything new but then he saw that the ornate water tower that had towered over the pullman car factory wasnt there any more lucille saw that too she said i dont think there are many peoplecivilian people i meanleft in chicago to feed us this was the second biggest city in the united states a year ago now it might as well be a ghost town out west somewhere yeah i been by some o those places like arizona nevada whatever they used to be for isnt around any more and they arent either chicago isor wasabout bringing things in and shippin em out or makin em here and shippin em out what with the lizards that isnt around any more either mutt said as if to punctuate his words more shells thumped in these a little closer than the ones before theyre working over the front line lucille potter observed but mutt those ghost towns out west never had more than a few hundred people a few thousand at most chicago had more than three million where is everybody a lot of em are dead he answered bleakly and she nodded a lot of em run off either scared away by the fighting or on account of their factories couldnt go on working because of the lizards or cause nobody could get food to em here so one way or another they aint here no more youre right she said you have a sensible way of looking at things yeah mutt glanced around none of his men was real close they were all going about their own business he lowered his voice even so im so allfired sensible how come i got stuck on you most likely just because we lived in each others pockets for too long lucille shook her head if things were different mutt it might have worked both ways even the way things are i sometimes wonder she stopped and looked unhappy plainly thinking shed said too much mutt unwrapped a chocolate bar like smoking the simple action gave him something to do with his hands while he thought he broke the bar in half and gave lucille a piece then ever so cautiously he said you mean you might be lookin attryin a man he wasnt sure how to phrase that to keep from offending her but did his best lucilles face was wary but she nodded might be looking at it is about right mutt im closer to it i think than ive ever been in my life but id be lying if i said i was ready yet i hope you can understand that and be patient miss lucille you get as old as i am some things you aint in a hurry about like you was when you were younger its just that mutt was going to say something about the uncertainty of war arguing against delay but he never got the chance the uncertainty of war came to him the hideous whistle in the air rose to a banshee shriek his body realized the lizard shells were aimed straight at him before his mind did without conscious thought he flattened out just as they landed the cluster of explosionsthree in allleft him stunned they picked him up from the ground and threw him back down as if a professional wrestler had bodyslammed him the blast tore at his ears and at his insides somebody might have been reaching in through his nose and trying to rip out his lungs shell fragments whistled and whined all around him more shells crashed home these not quite so close through the ringing in his ears and the crazy hammering of his heart mutt heard somebody scream somebody elsewas that draculas voice shouted miss lucille mutt dug his face out of the dirt aw heck he said they tagged somebody lucille potter didnt answer she didnt move one of those shell fragments that missed mutt had neatly clipped off the top of her head he could see her brain in there blood ran down into her graying hair her eyes were wide and staring shed never known what hit her anyhow miss lucille yeah that was dracula calling we need you over here mutt didnt say anything he looked at her body at the ruined chicago neighborhood that had just had a little more ruin rained onto it without intending to he started to cry he couldnt remember the last time hed done that the tears rolled down his cheeks and made tiny damp spots on the chewedup ground then they soaked in and were gone as if theyd never existed just like lucille he thought and cried even harder xx assembled shiplords i am pleased to report to you that progress in the conquest of tosev while slower than we hoped when we reached this planet is nonetheless accelerating atvar told the throng of highranking males aboard the th emperor hetto after some time down on tosev being back on his bannership felt good some details would be appreciated shiplord straha called out i have assembled the shiplords here this day to give those details atvar said he did not show straha the dislike he felt straha was waiting for him to get into trouble for the campaign to fail if enough went wrong the shiplords might turn atvar out of power and set someone in his place straha wanted to be that someone kirel had had such ambitions too but kirel was a good malehe put the cause of the race ahead of personal ambition all straha cared about was himself and the moment for all the forethought and restraint he showed he might as well we been a big ugly to kirel atvar murmured the first situation map please it shall be done exalted fleetlord kirel replied he touched a button on the podium a large hologram sprang into being behind the two males this is the big northern land area of the main continental mass atvar said by way of explanation as you will see we have smashed through the line of defense centered on the town of kaluga which the sssr threw up in a last desperate attempt to hold our forces away from their capital moskva the fall of this capital will give me particular satisfaction and not just from the military and strategic perspective kirel said the regime currently ruling the sssr came to power assembled shiplords as many of you know after murdering their emperor although most of the males in the hall did know that a murmur of horror ran through it just the same impericide was not a crime the race had imagined until the big uglies brought it to their notice the military and strategic considerations are not to be taken lightly either atvar said moskva being not only an administrative but also a communications hub its capture will go a long way toward taking the sssr out of the war that accomplished we shall be able to devote more of our resources to the defeat of deutschland and shall be able to attack the deutsche from improved positions he enjoyed the buzz of approval that rose from the shiplords he had not heard that sound often enough while discussing tosevite affairs at his hand signal kirel pressed the button again and brought up another map atvar said this is the island of britain which lies off the northwestern coast of tosev s main continental mass the british have also made themselves into unmitigated nuisances to us because the island was so small we did not reckon it of major significance in our opening attacks we made the same error with the island empire of nippon on the eastern edge of this same land mass air strikes have harmed both empires but not enough the males and materiel freed up after the defeat of the sssr will allow us to mount fullscale invasions of all these pestilential islands permission to speak exalted fleetlord straha called speak atvar said straha hadnt asked for permission the last time the list of successes and anticipated successes must have served notice to him that he wasnt likely to be fleetlord any time soon straha said with the deutsche still holding northernfrance is the proper geographic designation is it not can we invade this britain with reasonable hope of success even assuming the sssr drops out of the fight against us computer models show our probability of success as being higher than seventy percent under the circumstances you describe atvar answered with the sssr still in the war and forcing us to continue to expend resources to suppress it chances for a successful invasion of britain drop to slightly below fifty percent shall i send you a printout of the analysis shiplord if you please exalted fleetlord that was the most politeness atvar had heard from straha in a long time the fleetlord signaled kirel for the next map when it appeared atvar said this as you see illustrates our position in the northern part of the lesser continental mass particularly in our fight against the empire or rather notempire known as the united states the major urban center called chicago which eluded us in our previous attack has now been reached by our armies its reduction is only a matter of time kirel said with other major moves planned exalted fleetlord can we afford the drain on our resources a hardfought city campaign would entail my judgment is that we can atvar answered kirel might be a good and loyal male but he was also too cautious and conservative to suit the fleetlord straha on the other hand fairly bounced in his seat so eager was he to mix it up with the big uglies yes he might have been a tosevite himself if the fleetlord decrees it shall be done then of course it shall be done kirel declared atvar knew he would have to back into cold sleep if he wanted to live long enough to hear straha make the same pledge the fleetlord signaled to kirel once more and a new map replaced the one of the northern portion of the lesser continenal mass this one was far more detailed it showed the street plan of a seacoast town and enough of the hinterland to depict tumbledown ruin on a hilltop not far away i admit assembled shiplords that the situation portrayed here lacks the largescale strategic importance of those i have previously outlined atvar said nonetheless i shall set it forth for you because it also illustrates in a different way the progress we are making against the tosevites have security briefings brought the big ugly named skorzeny to the attention of everyone gathered here at this time the tosevite terrorist yes exalted fleetlord one of the males said atvar was comfortably certain some of them had paid no attention to their security briefings some of them never did well no matter not today as far as skorzeny was concerned it would soon be no matter ever again atvar resumed one of our operatives has set up an elaborate scheme in this townit is known as splitto lure the vassal state known as croatia out of the empire of deutschland and toward acceptance of the dominion of the race if this succeeds well and good but the effort has deliberately been kept to a small scale to let the deutsche get the notion they can check it by similarly modest means we have now confirmed that skorzeny is operating in the area all that remains is for our skilled operative to close the trap on him i expect that to be completed within days without this skorzeny the big uglies will not be able to cause us nearly so much trouble the assembled shiplords didnt quite burst into cheers but they came close atvar basked in the warm glow of their approval as if he were lying on a sandbank under summer sunshine back on home heinrich jager mooched through the streets of split in old yugoslav army boots baggy civilian pants and faded gray italian army tunic he fit in perfectly half the men in town wore a mixture of military and civilian garb even his craggy features belonged here he could have been a croat or a serb as easily as a german he ambled right past a couple of lizard patrols they didnt turn so much as an eye turret his way the tavern across the street from the south wall of diocletians palace had seen better days it had once had a window in front but the square of plywood nailed where the window had been was weathered almost gray it had been up there a long time jager opened the door slid inside shut it behind him in a hurry the fellow behind the bar was about fifty going gray with bushy eyebrows that grew together above his bony beak of a nose jager hadnt learned much in the way of serbocroatian but he had a little italian in that language he said are you barisha i hear youve got some special brandy in stock the bartender looked him over we keep the special stuff in the back room he said at last you want to come with me si grazie jager said a couple of old men sat at a table in the corner drinking beer they didnt look up when jager accompanied barisha into that back room the back room was considerably bigger than the one in front it took up not only the rear of barishas tavern but also the shuttered shops to either side it needed to be large for it was packed with poorly shaven men in a motley mixture of clothes one of the tallest of them grinned at him his teeth shining in the candlelight thought youd never get here the fellow said in german im here skorzeny jager answered you can take that makeup off your cheek now if you care to i was just getting used to going without the scar too the man said come hereive saved one of the fallschirmjagerwehrs for you he held the weapon up over his head jager pushed his way through the crowd some of the men carried infantry rifles others submachine guns a few like skorzeny himself had paratroop riflesautomatic weapons that fired a fullsized cartridge from a twentyround box magazine jager eagerly took the fg and several full magazines on skorzeny this is as good as anything the lizards carry he said better than what the lizards carry skorzeny said more powerful cartridge not inclined to argue the point jager said when are we going to go down the hole he pointed to a black pit that from the look of it might have led straight down to hell it didnt it led to the underground galleries inside the wall to diocletians palace five minutes by my watch after captain petrovic and his merry boys start their attack on the palace skorzeny answered five minutes he repeated in italian and serbocroatian everybody nodded a couple of men came in after jager skorzeny passed them submachine guns sneaking the weapons into split had been harder than getting the men in but skorzeny and his local contacts whoever they were had managed the job a thuttering roar filled the back room followed by another and another in italian somebody yelled start watching the time to skorzeny he shook his big head thats not fighting thats just some of the lizards heading off in helicopters he grinned again so much the better that leaves fewer of them for us deal with even up front with the pilot and weapons officer the helicopter was noisy drefsab didnt care to think about what it was like for the eight males back in the troop compartment he waited until all three of his assault aircraft had taken off before he turned to the pilot and said on to the ruined castle at klis the deutsche and the croats there have been plotting against us long enough this time we bag skorzeny and all his henchmales to the castle at klis the pilot repeated as if he were hearing the order for the first time rather than something like the hundred and first it shall be done superior sir the town of split shrank as the helicopter gained height drefsab found it remarkably ugly bricks and stucco and red tile roofs were nothing like the concrete and glass and stone of home the ruined castle already growing larger in the distance as the pilot shoved the collective forward struck him as even uglier why are you so hot to be rid of this particular big ugly superior sir the pilot asked because he is the biggest nuisance on this entire nuisance of a planet drefsab answered he is responsible for more grief to the race than any other three big ugly males i can think of he didnt go into detail the pilot had no need to know but his sincerity was so obvious that the pilot turned one eye turret to look at him for a moment before returning full attention to the flight the ruined gray stone pile of klis drew swiftly nearer drefsab waited for the tosevites hiding within to open up with smallarms fire satellite and aerial reconnaissance both claimed they had no antiaircraft artillery in there he hoped the males in recon knew whereof they spoke he wished hed tasted ginger before he got into the helicopter his body craved it but hed restrained himself ginger would take away his doubts and against a foe as wily as skorzeny he wanted them all in place shouldnt they be shooting at us by now the weapons officer asked the castle of klis seemed very quiet and peaceful as if no raiders had lived in it for thousands of years drefsab hissed softly thousands of years ago the castle probably hadnt even been built tosev was a new world he answered the males question you never can tell with big uglies they may be lying low hoping to make us think they arent really there or they may have some sort of ambush set id like to see them try superior sir the weapons officer said itd be a sorrylooking ambush after it bit down on us drefsab liked his confidence lets give the place a sandstorm of fire to make sure we dont have any trouble getting our males on the ground it shall be done the weapons officer and the pilot spoke together the pilot called on the radio to his opposite numbers in the other two helicopters one of them dropped to the ground to unload its soldiers the other along with the helicopter in which drefsab flew popped up into the air and started pasting the castle of klis with rockets and machinegun bullets no return fire came as soon as the eight males had scuttled out of the landed helicopter it rose into the air to join the barrage while the second one descended to disgorge its soldiers drefsab took a firm grip on his personal weapon he intended to go down there with the fighting males and to be certain skorzeny was dead there were whole little tosevite empires that had caused the race less trouble than that one deutsch male stolen nuclear materials mussolini kidnapped to spew propaganda against the race a landcruiser lifted out from under everyones snout at besancon and who could guess how many other crimes lay at his feet males scrambled away from the second helicopter opening up with their personal weapons to add to the fire that made whatever defenders huddled in klis keep their heads down the pilot started to lower drefsabs helicopter to let off the males it carried but before he could grab the collective the radio speaker taped to his hearing diaphragm began to chatter youd better hear this superior sir he said and touched the control that fed the incoming signal to the main speaker in the flight cabin through engine noise and ordnance a males voice squawked superior sir the outwalls of our base are under attack by a motley crew of big uglies with rifles and other small arms their forcing a breach seems unlikely but our defending males have taken some casualties some of the noise of firing drefsab realized was coming out of the speaker if the situation is not urgent i shall continue neutralizing this target before i return he answered his mouth fell open in a laugh of amusement and relief so skorzeny had chosen this moment to attack had he well he would pay for it the fighting males hed left here would be destroyed the race would keep a garrison in klis from now on control in this area would expand at the expense of the deutsche and one drefsab gingertasting addict though he was would rise in prestige and importance to the leaders of the races forces on tosev shall i proceed as planned superior sir the pilot asked yes drefsab said and the helicopter lost altitude drefsab ran a battery check on the radio gear implanted in his helmet if the main base needed to get in touch with him he wanted to ensure that he wasnt cut off that was the only special precaution he took against skorzenys attack ever so gently the helicopters wheels touched ground drefsab clapped the helmet onto his head and hurried back into the fighting compartment to exit with the rest of the males when jager fought he was usually closed up inside the thick steel shell of a panzer which muffled the racket all around him the taverns wall didnt do nearly so good a job as that the rifle and machinegun fire from and at the wall of diocletians palace all sounded as if it were aimed right at him the other soldiers and guerrillas in the back room of barishas tavern took no special notice so he assumed they were used to this kind of din through it skorzeny said two minutes in german italian and serbocroatian in german alone he went on do we have all the men with the automatic weapons closest to the hole the question was rhetorical hed bullied people into place before the shooting outside started with his fg jager was one of the lucky few who would lead the way through the tunnel around the troops with automatic rifles clustered those who carried submachine guns the men who bore ordinary boltaction rifles would bring up the rear one minute skorzeny said and then what seemed to jager a year or two later now he was the first one to plunge into the tunnel jager went in either fourth or fifth in all the jostling he wasnt sure which the dim light behind him vanished leaving him surrounded by absolute black the toe of his boot caught the heel of the man in front of him he stumbled and almost fell when he straightened up his head bumped the low ceiling dirt showered down some got inside his collar and slid down his back he wished he had a helmetfor more reasons than keeping the dirt off he also wondered how skorzeny was faring in the tunnelthe ss man who lacked only eight or ten centimeters of two meters probably had to bend himself double to move at all though the tunnel couldnt have been more than fifteen meters long it seemed to go on forever it was narrow as well as lowceilinged whenever his elbow bumped a wall jager felt s if it were closing in on him he was afraid someone would start screaming in the confining dark some people couldnt even stand being shut up in a panzer with the hatches dogged the tunnel was a hundred times worse he realized he could see the silhouette of the soldier in front of him a couple of paces later he emerged in a dusty storeroom illuminated only by lights from other rooms none of them especially close all the same after the tunnel it seemed almost noonday bright spread out spread out skorzeny urged in a hissing whisper give the men behind you room to get out when the whole force had emerged skorzeny thumped jager on the back the colonel here being an expert in archaeology knows where the stairs are by now the ss manand several others among the raidershad studied the underground maze enough to know it as well as jager if not better he appreciated the nod even so reminded the men that his word counted next after skorzenys he said i just dont want to find a lot of lizards down here if we have to fight underground we wont get up the surface and sweep them off the walls thats what petrovics diversion is for skorzeny said to flush all of them up to the top so they wont notice us till too latefor them jager knew that was what the diversion was for he also knew diversions werent always diverting enough to do what they were supposed to do he kept quiet theyd find out soon enough how well this one had worked skorzeny turned his attention to the group as a whole my advice is simple shoot first he repeated the phrase in italian and serbocroatian the men he led just grinnedtheyd figured that one out for themselves skorzeny grinned too come on you lugs as hed been first into the tunnel he was first out of the storeroom jager had never seen the underground maze of hallways and chambers in diocletians palace not till now but he moved through it confidently counting off turns under his breath as he trotted along a blast of heat came from one big room he passed the lizard barracks if ever the raiders would be discovered down here this was the place no shouts no hisses no gunfire there ahead were the stone stairs skorzeny bounded up them three at a time the rest of the men jager still near the front of the pack ran at his heels the panzer colonels stomach knotted an eye turret turned at the wrong moment and the assault could still turn into a slaughter trying to match the lizards swiveling eyes his head twisted every which way as he reached the top of the stairs the aliens were still banging away from the wall but the bulk of the baptistry hid them from himand him from them skorzeny used hand signals to divide the raiders into two groups and to show no one had better argue against jagers leading one of them he pointed right and then forward to show jagers group was to go around the baptistry then led his own group to the left come on jager hissed to his men he trotted at their fore if you wanted to impress anybody whod already seen skorzeny in action youd better lead from the front otherwise your men wouldnt follow you for long he waved the group to a halt as they came to the corner of the baptistry fg at the ready he stepped out into the narrow street that led north to the wall as he did so he heard skorzenys group start firing a lizard a couple of hundred meters ahead whirled at that unexpected sound it caught sight of jager before it could bring up its rifle he cut it down forward he shouted and ran up the street the pound of boots on cobblestones behind him said hed brought his troops with him personal weapon at the ready drefsab scrambled over a big gray stone and dropped down into the enclosed area of the castle of klis his feet scrunched on dry weeds several other males were already there scurrying around and nervously checking anything that could hide a big ugly thus far theyd found precisely nothing drefsab was disappointedhe wanted skorzeny dead and proved dead but sealing off this place and taking possession of it for the race wasnt bad in and of itself either high time to expand the foothold in croatia beyond the town of split he thought theyve been here a male said pointing to the litter scattered wherever it wasnt visible from split why arent they here now he sounded indignant to the race the world by rights should have been a neatly predictable place they may have timed their attack in town to match ours here drefsab answered their intelligence is revoltingly good that didnt surprise him overmuch only natural for beings of one kind to stick together against those of another especially when the latter were trying to conquer them he badly wanted a taste of ginger hed all but promised the fleetlord that hed bring back skorzenys head in a clear block of acrylic resin would atvar be content if presented with a mere strategic gain rather than said head unless skorzeny got himself killed and identified back in split it looked as if drefsab would have to find out ginger wouldnt change that but would keep him from having to think about it for a while another male waved to him from a stonelined hole in the ground over here superior sir he said looks like the big uglies that haunted this place made their home underground drefsab shone an electric torch into the hole even without it he would have been sure this was a big ugly den the tosevites rank meaty smell filled the scent receptors on his tongue he played the torch back and forth then let out a low hiss this place will hold a lot of big uglies thats true superior sir the male agreed where do you suppose theyve all gone some of them back to their villages i suppose and some into town to attack our walls drefsab answered he stuck out his tongue the words did not taste right from all hed learned of skorzeny such a simpleminded frontal assault seemed out of character if you want us to set up camp in this pile of stones superior sir i hope you dont expect us to use that place down there the soldier also stuck out his tongue and waggled it in derision and disgust it stinks that it does drefsab said and no i promise you wont have to set up your sleeping gear down therenot until we fumigate anyhow his mouth and the other males dropped open in a laugh the speaker built into his helmet suddenly screamed at him superior sir superior sir were under attack not just from outside the wall but also from within somehow a large party of big uglies managed to get inside the walls without being noticed were taking heavy casualties need for assistance urgent in the extreme drefsab made a noise like a pressure cooker forgotten on top of a hot stove none of them slipped away to their villages he said when coherent speech returned the male beside him stared in confusion he hadnt heard the desperate call drefsab went on they all went down into split no skorzeny wasnt simpleminded at all who the big uglies the male asked still trying to figure out what was going on drefsab ignored him he waved to the soldiers scattered over the castle of klis back to the helicopters he shouted quick as you can a virtue of the race was obedience to superiors the males neither hesitated nor asked questions they ran toward the helicopters as fast as their legs would take them behind the armorglass windscreens the pilots waved frantically theyd got the message too then drefsab dashed up to the cockpit to the fortress he snarled skorzeny will pay for this oh how he will pay all the pilot said was it shall be done he pulled up on the collective the helicopter sprang into the air it wheeled within its own diameter and darted back toward split only then did the pilot say may i ask your plan superior sir use our firepower to blast the big uglies out of the fortress drefsab answered they may have smuggled in men and rifles i refuse to believe they could carry antiaircraft weapons into split without our noticing no doubt you are right about that superior sir the weapons officer said with all proper deference but i see i must remind you that we expended most of our munitions in the bombardment of that empty castle we have little left to use back at the city drefsab stared at him in blank dismay after a moment he said keep going anyhow ill think of something the ground blurred by under the helicopter he didnt have much time jager had fought house to house street to street in towns and cities in the ukraine hed hated it then even with a panzer wrapped around him it was deadly dangerous work doing it in nothing but these ragged clothes struck him as clinically insane youd never get me to join the infantry now he muttered sheltered in the doorway of a building near the wall i did that the last war bullets sprayed past him biting chips out of stone and brickwork they stung when they hit if you got one in the eye it could blind you the lizards all had automatic weapons and by the way they hosed fire around they might have had all the ammunition in the world too jager was too aware that he didnt the fg was a wonderful weapon but it went through magazines in a hurry several men in front of him shot back at the lizards that was the signal for him and half a dozen fellows with him to leapfrog forward past them leaving the doorway was as hard as getting out of a trench and springing across nomansland had been in france a generation ago but fire and move was how you fought as a foot soldier if you wanted any kind of chance of living to do it again he bounded along the cobblestones bent over as if his belly griped him to make himself as small a target for the lizards as he could the men firing hadnt suppressed all the enemies ahead bullets struck sparks from the cobbles close by his feet and ricocheted away at crazy angles hed had a new doorway in mind when he started his dash he threw himself into it panting as if hed just run a marathon rather than a few meters a moment later another fellow squeezed in behind him in slavicaccented german he asked think any of the things are inside here jager made a sour face were getting up close to their position it could be i have grenade the croat said pulling a german potatomasher model from his belt he tried a thick wooden door the knob turned in his hand that was plenty to make jager suspicious and the croat as well he unscrewed the grenades protective cap yanked the igniter opened the door chucked in the grenade and slammed it again the blast made jagers head pound fragments rattled off the door jager flung it open once more sprayed a quick burst into the chamber to catch any lizards the grenade had missed then he dove behind a massive oaken desk that had probably sat there since the days of the austrohungarian empire the croat ran to the next door in fired a few rounds from his submachine gun then peered around the corner that was the right order in which to do things he grunted i think we maybe are lucky better for us to shoot up the place and not need to than to need to and not do it jager said the croat nodded taking no chances even so jager crawled back to the outer doorway just as he got there a blast like a kilo bomb went off to the north when he ever so cautiously looked out of the doorway he saw a great hole in the outwall to diocletians palace the antiquarian in him lamented the soldier rejoicedskorzenys raiders had distracted the lizards enough to let petrovics men lay the explosives next to the wall he sprang to his feet stormed forward the best time to advance was while the enemy was momentarily stunned now the lizards would have a doubly hard time theyd have to fight skorzenys men and keep petrovics followers from getting through the breach in the wall this mad raid just might work then a stuttering roar filled the sky jager dove for the nearest cover he could find the lizard helicopters were coming back split was in flames with smoke mounting fast into the sky drefsab hissed in astonished disbeliefwho could have imagined a town could go from peace to ruin in so short a time oh skorzeny how you will pay he whispered even as the helicopters reached the outskirts of split a big explosion sent a great cloud of dust leaping into the air theyve blown up part of the wall the pilot said in dismay scanning the electronically amplified vision display how did they get all these munitions into town under our muzzles some have probably been there all alongthe big uglies were fighting among themselves when we got here you know as for the rest theyre good at it drefsab said bitterly we didnt xray every bit of every single animal cart going in and now were paying the price but if we did that everywhere we wouldnt have enough males to do anything else the fault here is mine i accept it that made him feel virtuous otherwise it did nothing to change matters split kept on burning radio calls for help kept pouring in every one of them reported some fresh tosevite gain what do we do superior sir the weapons officer asked fixing drefsab with worried eyes we have no rockets left and our machinegun ammunition is low worries about conserving ammunition drefsab thought had cost the race victories if they lost here it wouldnt be on account of that if we dont expend what we have our ground position in split falls he said next to that ammunitionor come to that three helicopterscounts for nothing maybe we can kill enough of the big uglies to make the rest break contact and give our males a chance lets go try it shall be done superior sir neither the pilot nor the weapons officer sounded enthusiastic drefsab couldnt blame them for thateven if the big uglies didnt have antiaircraft guns the helicopters were still going into danger if theyd armored all the wires and hydraulics heavily enough to protect em from rifle fire the aircraft would have been too heavy to fly but the pilot didnt hesitate he radioed drefsabs orders to his two comrades the three helicopters skimmed low over the rooftops of split they started taking fire long before they got to the rectangular stone wall the race had used as a perimeter for its base some bullets went spanng off armored sections others inched through sheet metal in less vital spots drefsab quickly realized the ground fire away from the fortress came from big uglies who just happened to have rifles and pistols it turned into a storm of bullets when the aircraft approached the fighting zone shall i return fire against the tosevite males outside the walls superior sir the weapons officer asked no drefsab said the ones who got inside are even more important if we have only limited ammunition well use at the point of decision again the pilot relayed drefsabs will to the males flying the other two helicopters all three machines hovered above the narrowing area inside the walls that the race still held the machine guns roared drefsab felt a savage surge of satisfaction almost as good as ginger as big uglies twisted and fell under assault from the air well get them out of there yet he cried another doorway this time jager didnt think it would be cover enough he kicked in the door and rolled inside automatic rifle at the ready no lizard shot at him he crawled toward a northfacing window outside death reigned hed hated the lizards helicopters when he was in a panzer their rockets smashed through armor as if it were pasteboard against infantry their machine guns were similarly destructive the fire wasnt aimed it didnt need to be as hed seen in france in the last war machine guns put out so many bullets that if this one didnt get you the next one would without luck amounting to divine intervention anyone caught on the street without cover would be dead the helicopters noses seemed to be spitting flame jager squeezed off a burst at the nearest of them then rolled away as fast as he could he had no idea whether hed damaged the helicopter but he was sure as need be that the lizards would have spotted his muzzle flashes sure enough bullets battered the wall some pierced the stones others sent shards of glass from the broken window flying like shell fragments something bit jager in the leg blood began to soak into his trousers it wasnt a flood he cautiously tried putting weight on the leg it held he might not run as fast as usual for a while but he could move around pretty well he headed up to the second story of the building when he got there he planned on firing another burst at the helicopters it would also let him deliver plunging fire against the lizards at the base of the walls he was still on the stairs when the firing from the helicopters died away first one machine gun fell silent then a second then a third his first thought was to rushor come as close as he could to rushing with a sliver of glass in his legback down and join the final attack that would sweep away the last of the lizards his second thought was that his first one was less than smart the lizards surely had imagination enough to stop shooting and see how many men they could fool into thinking theyd run out of ammunition he went up to the second floor after all the helicopters still hung menacingly in the air but they werent shooting men on the groundskorzenys forces and petrovics bothkept blazing away at them though jager fired too this time the lizards didnt shoot back maybe you are out of ammo he muttered to himself even so he didnt hurry downstairs and rush out into the street maybe they werent out of ammo too drefsab turned to the weapons officer in anger and dismay when the machine gun stopped firing is that all of it he demanded not quite superior sir but almost all the fellow answered ive reserved the last couple of hundred rounds whatever decision you make on how or if we use them though i suggest you make it quickly we already have one male wounded back in the fighting compartment and we cant stay under such intense fire indefinitely the odds of any one bullet doing us significant damage are low but we are encountering a great many bullets that was an understatement the patter and clatter of incoming rounds all but deafened drefsab he said the area close to the wall is too built up to let us land and take aboard those of our males who still live he added the interrogative cough to that though it looked pretty plain to him maybe the pilot would tell him he was wrong but the pilot didnt we could fit the fuselages of our marines down there superior sir but the rotors he didnt finish the sentence but drefsab had no trouble finishing it for him the pilot went on we do still have fuel enough to return to italia where the race holds unchallenged control he sounded hopeful no drefsab said flatly he reached into a pouch on his belt took out a vial of ginger and tasted the pilot and weapons officer gaped at him he didnt care atvar the fleetlord knew he was addicted so what these lowgrade officers thought mattered not at all to him he said we shall not flee but superior sir the pilot broke off perhaps because of drilled subordination perhaps because he couldnt decide whether to protest drefsabs tactics or the vial of ginger he still held so blatantly in his left hand ginger certainty and ginger cunning rushed through drefsab the big uglies cant have brought all that many males into the fortress he said if we land behind them where we took off we can catch them between two fires as theyve done with our males down there now the pilot had something concrete to which to object but superior sir weve twentythree effectives at most i dont know if anyone aboard the other helicopters is wounded thirty drefsab corrected his voice cold pilots and weapons officers have their personal weapons and i have mine if we can drive the big uglies from the fortress we may be able to hold on here long enough for reinforcements to arrive the pilot was still staring drefsab deliberately looked away from him daring him to protest further to underline his contempt he tasted again ginger filled him with the burning urge to do something and with the confidence that if he just acted boldly everything would turn out fine back to the landing area he snapped it shall be done superior sir the pilot said miserably he relayed drefsabs command to the other two helicopters when the helicopters darted away jager hoped with all his heart they were fleeing but though the engine noise diminished it didnt vanish where are they going he muttered suspiciously he couldnt believe they would just up and fly away not when theyd done such a job of working over the humans positions moments before he tried to think himself into the head of the lizard commanderdrefsab skorzeny had said his name was the exercise had proved useful over and over again in the soviet union if you could figure out what the other fellow needed to do you were halfway to keeping him from doing it all right assume this drefsab was no fool he wouldnt be not if hed made the lizards shape up in besancon jager wondered how his regiment was faring the news out of franceand then out of germanyhadnt been good and been entrusted with swinging the croats away from germany what to do then those big lizard helicopters carried soldiers as well as munitions what would skorzeny do if he had some men he could put anywhere he wanted the answer to that formed of itself in jagers mind hed stick them up the enemys rear hed done just that here in split next question was would skorzeny figure that out for himself hed better jager couldnt get in touch with him by radio or field telephone but skorzeny was no fool either hed think of something like that jager told himself hopefully the panzer colonel wondered if he ought to head back toward the rear before he made up his mind he decided to evaluate the position he already held he moved toward the window peered out from well back in the room so as not to make himself an obvious target for the lizards by the wall he needed only a couple of seconds to realize he was in too good a place to abandon he could see four or five lizards no more than a hundred meters from him and they didnt know he was there he switched the fg from automatic to single shot raised it breathed out and touched the trigger on the exhale the automatic rifle bucked against his shoulder one of the lizards toppled over bonelessly even singleshot the weapon was a lot faster than a boltaction rifle all you had to do was pull the trigger again he missed a shot at his second lizard but his next round was on the way before the creature could react to the one before he didnt think he made a clean kill on that lizard but he was sure hed hit it getting it out of the fight would definitely do instinct made him move away from the window after that hardly had he done so when bullets came searching for him he nodded to himself if you pushed things too far you paid for it firing broke out off to the south at first mostly lizards weapons then mens answering back jager nodded again drefsab was trying to retrieve the situation all right he might have been a nasty little alien from the black depths of unknown space but he knew what fighting was all about drefsab had been trained as an intelligence officer when he got to tosev hed never expected to meet combat facetoface his brief forays in a landcruiser at besancon hadnt come close to preparing him for what infantry fightingespecially in the heart of a townwas like the helicopters had remained under fire all the way to the landing area from which theyd taken off what seemed like a couple of years before a male was hit exiting through the troop compartment door and another couple as they skittered toward cover the weapons officers had used up the last precious rounds in the helicopter machine guns trying to suppress the big ugly defenders drefsab had never felt so naked as when sprinting across the cobblestones toward a pile of rubble not even gingers bravado could make him believe he was invulnerable to the bullets cracking past him but he reached the rubble without getting hit he sprawled down behind it and started shooting back he didnt need long to realize only a couple of tosevites were defending against the males of the race the soldiers commander figured out the same thing at the same time his orders crackled in the speaker inside drefsabs helmet some of the males sprayed bullets at the big uglies to make them keep their heads down others moved to gain positions from which they could fire at the enemy from the side soon the tosevites were down the males of the race ran forward they hadnt taken the big uglies as much by surprise as drefsab had hoped the trouble was they were fighting in too small a space an alert commanderand no one had ever faulted the tosevites for thatcould quickly pull some of his males from the fighting near the wall and send them to meet the new threat and the males of the race trapped against the wall had trouble exploiting that because of the danger from the big uglies in the buildings on the other side no sooner had that thought crossed drefsabs mind than an explosion to the north made him sure another piece of the wall had just gone down he hissed in dismay his detachment couldnt hold the fortress by itself if the males he was trying to rescue perished split would fall hurry he shouted we have to fight through the tosevites and reach them two of the helicopter pilots were already down theyd joined the attack bravely enough but they had even less notion of how to fight on the ground than drefsab did and so many bullets were in the air that the most skilled soldier if he was unlucky would fall as readily as anyone else crouched in a doorway drefsab tasted again he needed the spirit ginger brought him if it drained away he wouldnt be able to keep on fighting so he told himself at any rate one of the buildings ahead or more than one had caught fire smoke filled the narrow street a determined maleespecially one who was full to bursting with gingercould take advantage of the cover drefsab thought there would be plenty of hiding places ahead he burst out of the doorway sprinted up the street he changed directions every few steps no one would get a good shot at him if he could help it the thick smoke made him gasp and cough nictitating membranes slid across his eyes to protect them from the stinging stuff through the smoke he didnt see the tosevite until they almost ran into each other he hadnt heard him either the din of battle made sure of that even for a big ugly this male was enormous he could have made two of drefsab weapons were great equalizers though as drefsab swung his toward the tosevite he noted that the fellow had a scar on his face hidden not quite well enough by paint and power he started to shout skorzeny but skorzeny had a weapon too a rifle of unfamiliar make spat a stream of fire like the automatic rifles of the race something hit drefsab a series of hammer blows he felt only the first one or two lizard jets screamed overhead thunderous blasts ripped across the area diocletians palace had enclosed huddled in a doorway jager prayed the building wouldnt fall down on top of him he didnt think much would be left of the palace by the time the bombers were done sixteen hundred years of history blown to hell in an afternoon the jets unloaded their last bombs and flew away stunned battered but with no worse wounds than that chunk of glass in his leg jager slowly got to his feet he looked around at the smoking ruins of what had been a scenic little port its ours he said and a good thing too somebody behind him answered he whirled that hurt but his battle reflexes permitted nothing less there stood skorzeny sweat had made his makeup run but his face was so covered with grime and soot that the scar wasnt easy to spot anyhow he went on if wed bogged down there they might have been able to fly in reinforcements to their soldiers here that wouldnt have been much fun not even a little bit jager said fervently he looked around at the wreckageand the carnage theyre tougher than i thought they were they can fight skorzeny looked around if the devastation bothered him he didnt show it we found out the russians were tougher than we thought too but we would have licked them in the end nothing seemed to get him down give him a military job no matter how bizarre or impossible it seemed and hed go out and do it a croat aimed his rifle at a lizard prisoner halt jager shouted as loud as he couldif the croat understood any german that would be it stop that skorzeny echoed even louder than jager what the bleeding hell do you think youre doing you shitheaded syphilitic cretinous puddle of dog puke the croat understood german all right he swung his rifle away from the frightened cringing lizardand halfway toward skorzeny i get rid of this thing he said maybe i get rid of you first most of the men on the battered streets most of the men who had done the fighting in split were croats not germans a lot of them started drifting over toward skorzeny and jager they didnt quite aim their weapons at the german officers but they had them ready among them was captain petrovic he looked as ready to get rid of the germans as any of his troops jager said shooting lizards is wasteful they know so much that we dont better to keep them alive and squeeze it out of them the croat with the rifle spat this i care for what they know i know i enjoy killing this one so i do it if you kill that lizard ill kill you skorzeny said as casually as if he were sitting over coffee with the croat if you try to kill me ill kill you colonel jager is right and you damn well know it the croats scowl got blacker yet he did not move his rifle another centimeter in skorzenys direction though jager gestured to the lizard a peremptory comehere the lizard skittered over to stand beside him good skorzeny said softly he turned to petrovic raised his voice order your men to round up the rest of the lizards and bring them here from what ive heard we should have twenty or so who surrendered plus about as many wounded i want them all thereimmediately theyre as big a haul as this whole town you want petrovic said coldly so what this is the independent state of croatia not germany i give orders here not you what do you do if i tell you no shoot you skorzeny answered if you think i cant take you out along with your cheerful friend over therehe jerked his chin at the croat who had threatened the lizardbefore your bully boys bring me down youre welcome to find out if youre right petrovic was no coward had he been a coward he wouldnt have thrown himself into the middle of the fighting that had just ended skorzeny stood almost at ease waiting for him to do whatever he would do jager did his best to match the ss mans show of confidence matching his gall was something else again after a long long pause petrovic barked orders in serbocroatian one of his men shouted a protest petrovic screamed abuse at him jager hadnt picked up much of the local language but the invective sounded impressive as hell the croats straggled away a few minutes later they started coming back with lizard prisoners first the males who had given up as the fighting ebbed and then on makeshift litters the crudely bandaged ones wounds had forced out of combat their sounds of pain were unpleasantly close to the ones men made i wasnt sure youd get away with that jager murmured to skorzeny you have to make it personal skorzeny whispered back these bastards take everything personally i just played their game with them and i won his smile was smug as he added one final word again georg schultz said i figured id get into moscow one way or another but i never guessed what those ways would befirst you flew me in and now im retreating into it it isnt funny ludmila gorbunova tore a chunk of black bread with her teeth someone handed her a glass of ersatz tea she gulped it down someone else gave her a bowl of shchi she gulped the cabbage soup too while she refueled herself groundcrew men took care of her aircraft pouring petrol into it loading on light bombs and stowing the belts of machinegun ammunition schultz had filled i never said it was funny the german said he looked worn unto death his skin gray rather than fair his hair and beard unkempt grease on his face and tunicno one had much chance to wash these days purple pouches lay under his eyes ludmila was sure she was no more prepossessing she couldnt remember the last time shed had more than a couple of hours of sleep at a stretch even before the kaluga line began to unravel shed been desperately overtaxed since then the cry was buy time when the germans neared moscow in old men boys and tens of thousands of women had dug trenches and antitank obstacles to slow their progress they were out again how much good their bathers would do against the lizards when stronger ones had already failed was questionable but the soviet capital would not fall without as much of a fight as the soviet people could put up ready comrade pilot one of the groundcrew men shouted ready or not ludmila put down the bowl of shchithin watery stuff without ham or salami and without enough cabbage tooand got up she climbed wearily into the u biplane georg schultz said i hope you come back i hope were still here when you come back nikifor sholudenko walked up just in time to hear the panzergunnerturnedmechanic say that the nkvd man bristled the penalty for defeatist talk is death he said schultz rounded on him whats the penalty for killing the only decent technician this base has he retorted you do that you do more to make your side lose than i do by talking this may be true sholudenko said but there is no fixed sentence for it his hand fell to the tokarev pistol he wore on his hip ludmila knew each of them wanted the other dead loudly she said spin my prop one of you save your war with each other until after weve held off the lizards if we hold off the lizards she added to herself had she said that aloud she wondered whether sholudenko would have come down on her for defeatism probably not he didnt want to see her deadonly naked the nkvd man and the exwehrmacht sergeant both sprang toward the front of the kukuruznik schultz got there first when he yanked at the prop sholudenko had to back way walking into a spinning prop blade would kill you as surely as a pistol and a lot more messily buzz the prop caught the fivecylinder radial engine spat out acrid exhaust fumes ludmila released the brake the u bounded over the rough airstrip not really a strip at all just a stretch of field picking up speed ludmila gave it more throttle eased the stick back the ugly little biplane clawed its way into the air even in flight the u did not go from duckling to swan yet as a mosquito will bite and escape where a horsefly gets noticed and swatted kukuruzniks came back from missions more often than any other soviet planes not much was left of kaluga ludmila flew over the outskirts of the industrial town the germans had wrecked part of when they took it in their drive on moscow in fall and the russians had wrecked more when they took it back later the same year whatever theyd left standing the lizards had knocked down over the last couple of weeks the front lay north of kaluga these days the lizards had cleared a few of the northsouth streets through the town so they could move supplies forward lorries some of their manufacture others captured from the nazis or the soviets some of those russianmade others american rolled along as if no enemies were to be found for a thousand kilometers i may not be much of an enemy but im the best the soviet union has here ludmila thought she worked her flaps and rudder heeled the u over into an attack run on the lorry column shed spotted no one in the column spotted her until she was close enough to open fire the mosquito stings she hollered and whooped with glee as lizards bailed out of the lorries and dove for cover some of them didnt bail outsome shot back bullets snarled past the u ludmila kept boring in she pulled the bombrelease handle the aircraft suddenly got lighter and more maneuverable as weight and drag fell away she gunned it for every ruble it was worth although with the kukuruznik such things were better measured in kopecks the biplane shook slightly as the bombs exploded behind it ludmila looked back over her shoulder some of the lorries were burning merrily between them and the little bomb craters shed made the lizards wouldnt be moving much forward on that route for a while pity the u could carry only light bombs i dont just want to block off one road for a while ludmila said as if a witch might hear and grant her wish i want to keep the lizards from using the whole city what she wanted and what she could do sadly were not one and the same she flew over kaluga at rooftop heightnot that many of the gutted houses and factories still had roofsshooting at whatever targets she saw none was as good as that first line of lorries the lizards shot back after a while they started shooting the instant she came into range sometimes before she opened up herself time to go she thought the lizards used many more radios than the red army did they must have spread the word that she was buzzing around she got out of kaluga as fast as she could ducking down between ruined buildings to make herself as nearly unhittable as she could it must have worked she escaped with no more damage than a few bullet holes through the fabric covering of the us wings and fuselage she flew off toward the west the lizards had to know the air base lay in that direction and flying into the afternoon sun made her a harder target for gunners in kaluga but she zigzagged around a halfburned grove of plum trees and then headed east and north toward the front with not much standing between the lizards and moscow she had to do all she could however little that was to stem the tide of their advance wreckage littered the ground north of kaluga the alltoofamiliar signs of a soviet army in disintegration shattered tanks and armored cars trench lines reduced to craters by artillery unburied corpses in khaki even zooming by at full throttle she gagged at the stink of death and decay that filled her nostrils far less lizard wreckage was strewn about the lizards made a point of salvaging their damaged equipment which accounted for some of the disparity but most of it sprang from their losing a lot less than their opponents had that had been a constant of the war since its earliest days artillery boomed and flashed off toward the east the lizards guns outranged those of the red army too from north of kaluga they could all but reach moscow ludmila flew toward the guns if she could shoot up the crews that would be a good part of a days work though retreating the red army hadnt given up the fight she heard screams in the air a ragged pattern of explosions tore up a square kilometer of ground not far ahead of the kukuruznik katyushas she cried in high glee the rockets were some of the best weapons the soviets had unlike more conventional artillery they were easily portable and a flight of them not only did a lot of damage but also spread terror some lizards were just emerging from their hideyholes after the katyusha salvo when ludmila flew by she opened up with her machine gun the lizards dove back into cover she hoped some of them werent fast enough to reach it but was gone before she could be sure as she approached the lizards artillery position she got down below treetop height some of those gun stations had tank chassis with antiaircraft cannon mounted in place of big guns protecting them if she spotted one of those shed sheer off a hit or two from their shells would turn the u to kindling she deliberately thought about it in terms of the aircraft rather than herself jinking weaving ludmila came up on the lizard guns she didnt see any of the antiaircraft tanks so she bored in za rodina for the motherland she shouted as her thumb came down on the firing button lizard gunners scattered before her like cockroaches across a kitchen floor when someone comes in with a lamp unlike cockroaches some of them snatched up personal weapons and shot back muzzle flashes might have looked pretty as fireflies but they meant the lizards were trying to kill her more thrumming noises spoke of bullets making hits on the kukuruznik but the little biplane kept flying ludmila glanced at her fuel gauge she had a bit more than half a tank left time to head for home she thought regretfully she hadnt had such a good day shooting up the lizards in a long time but she also knew about stretching her luck if she tried to go on until she found one more perfect target she was only too likely to make one instead there will be more tomorrow she said and then laughed at herself she wouldnt wait for tomorrow to go out again as soon as she had more fuel more bullets more bombs shed be in the air again they kept using you until they used you up then they found somebody elseif they could what happens when they run out of everybody she wondered the answer came back stark then we lose it hadnt happened yet no matter how black things sometimes looked but when the germans drove on moscow in theyd faced russian winter and fresh troops from siberia now it was the beginning of summer and if the red army had any fresh troops left ludmila didnt know where they might come from which means the veterans like me will just have to carry the load a while longer she said adding after a moment if any veterans like me are left alive there was georg schultz but he didnt really count hed started the war on the wrong side colonel karpov had been through the whole thing but he was more a military administrator than a fighting soldier ludmila had nothing against that karpov ran his air base as well as a man could in the chaos of a losing war but it removed him from her list or what would have been her list had she had anyone to put on it she wondered how heinrich jager was doing these days hed been in it from the start even if he came from the wrong side too the memory of their brief time together in germany the winter before seemed faded unreal what would she do if she ever saw him again she shook her head for one thing it wasnt likely for another how could she know till it happened down on the ground a man in a khaki red army uniform waved his cap as she flew by she was back over sovietheld territory now well away from the bulge northeast of kaluga where the lizards were forcing their way toward moscow they were concentrating their effort on that push and had loaded the bulge with troops and weapons ludmila dared hope the air base would still be operating when she got back to it the u bucked in the air as if it had taken a hit from an antiaircraft gun then the aircraft steadied ludmila swore were red army gunners shooting at her again she checked the sketchy instrument panel everything looked fine though she had trouble reading some of the dials because of the black shadow her head and shoulders cast on them she accepted that for a moment then she remembered she was flying into the sun even as she wheeled the kukuruznik through a tight turn that impossible shadow began to fade she looked back to see what could have made it her first guess was a lizard bomb the shock wave from a bomb might have made her think she was hit but while the flash from a bomb might have given her a momentary shadow it could hardly have lasted long enough for her to notice it she figured that out while her head turned ahead of the planes motion to see what had happened because she checked the near distance first she didnt spot anything right away then she raised her eyes a little higher and felt like the prize fool of all time the fireball that had printed her shadow on the instrument panel was already dissipating but not the enormous cloud of dust and wreckage it had raised bozhemoimy god she whispered that growing cloud had to be at least twentyfive kilometers off to the east maybe more it towered thousands of meters into the air glowing yellow and pink and salmon and colors for which she had no name its shape took her back to fall days before the war when she and her family would hunt mushrooms in the woods outside kiev bozhemoi she said again when what it had to be hit her like a kick in the stomach one of the lizards explosivemetal bombs the kind that had flattened berlin and washington dc she moaned back deep in her throatwere the lizards sealing the rodinas doom by raining such destruction on it the cloud climbed and climbed five thousand meters six eight she couldnt begin to guess she simply watched stunned flying the u with hands and feet but without much conscious thought little by little though as her wits began to work once more she noticed where the bomb had gone off not ahead of the lizards lines to clear the road to moscow but right at the front or a little behind itat a spot where it would hurt the lizards much more than the soviet forces opposing them had the lizards dropped it in the wrong place she hadnt thought they made mistakes like that or somehow had the scientists of the soviet union devised an explosivemetal bomb of their own please god let it be so she said and didnt feel the least bit guilty about praying reports flooded onto atvars desk video of the nuclear explosion from a spy satellite confirmation as if he needed any from those ground commanders lucky enough not to have been incinerated in the blast sketchy preliminary lists of units that hadnt been so lucky kirel came in atvar grudged him a brief glance from one eye turret
