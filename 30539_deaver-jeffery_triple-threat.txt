fast they were just about to see the octopus when she received a text alerting her that two hundred people were going to die in two hours kathryn dance rarely received texts marked with exclamation pointsthe law enforcement community tended not to punctuate with emotionso she read it immediately then called her office via speed dial three boss the young mans voice spilled from her iphone details tj over their heads will the ticket holders for the onethirty exhibition make their way inside please mom the little girls voice was urgent thats us hold on a second honey then into the phone go on tj

dailies tj mean to the monterey bay aquarium is pleased to host the largest specimen of enteroctopus dofleini on exhibit in the northern california area weighing in at pounds we know youre going to enjoy viewing our visiting guest in his specially created habitat okay whats the story dance persisted into the phone as she and her children edged closer to the exhibit hall theyd waited fortyfive minutes who would have thought octopuses octopi would be such a big draw tj said everybody believed they were going to hit somewhere up there alameda contra costa san fran but maybe there was too much heat oakland pd had a ci inside the group and he said two of their people came down here set up something and she interrupted set up something what does that mean an attack of some kind he doesnt know what exactly maybe an ied maybe chemical probably not bio but could be but the number of victims is for sure what i texted you two hundred plus or minus thats confirmed and whatever it is its up and running the perps set it and they were headed back the ci said pm is when the attack goes down two and a half hours a little less lord no idea of the victims location tj scanlon offered none but you said they were headed back right we caught a break theres a chance we can nail em the ci gave us the make of the cara taurus light blue chp spotted one in marina and went after it the driver took off probably them they lost the pursuit on surface roads everybodys searching the area bureaus coming in from the field office hold on boss im getting something dance happened to glance up and see her reflection in the glass panel on the other side of which elegant and eerie sea horses floated with sublime careless ease dance noted her own still gaze looking back at her in a narrow cate blanchett face hair in a ponytail held taut by a black and green scrunchy installed that morning by her tenyearold daughter currently champing beside her her mopheaded son wes twelve was detached from mother and sister he was less intrigued by cephalopods however big and more by an aloof fourteenyearold in line a girl who should have been a cheerleader if she wasnt dance was wearing jeans a blue silk blouse and a tan quilted vest comfortably warm sunny at the moment the monterey peninsula could be quite fickle when it came to weather fog mostly mom theyre calling us maggie said in her weegee voice the high pitch that conveyed exasperation really well one minute thiss important first it was a second now its a minute jeez one onethousand two onethousand wes was smiling toward but not at the cheerleader the line inched forward drawing them seductively closer to the cephalopod of the century tj came back on the line boss yep its them the tauruss registered to the brothers of liberty chps in pursuit where seaside dance glanced around her at the dim concrete and glass aquarium it was holiday breakten days before christmasand the place was packed and there were dozens of tourist attractions like this in the area not to mention movie theaters churches and offices some schools were closed but others not was the plan to leave a bomb in say that trashcan out front she said into the phone ill be right in turning to the children she grimaced at their disappointed faces she had a theorypossibly unfoundedthat her two children were more sensitive to disappointment than other kids their age because they were fatherless and because bill had died suddenly there in the morning and then never again it was so very hard for her to say what she now had to sorry guys its a big problem at work aw mom maggie grumbled this is the last day its going to san diego tomorrow wes too was disappointed though part of this wasnt sea life but pretty cheerleaders sorry guys cant be helped ill make it up to you dance held the phone back to her ear and she said firmly to tj and tell everybody no shooting unless its absolutely necessary i dont want either of them killed which brought conversation around them in the octopus line to a complete stop everyone stared speaking to the wideeyed blond wes said reassuringly its okay she says that a lot the venue for the party was good the monterey bay seaside motel was near the water north of the city and what was especially nice about this place was that unlike a lot of banquet rooms this one had large windows opening onto a stretch of beach right now carol messner noted the beach had that december afternoon look to it bleached dusty though the haze was mostly mist with a bit of fog thrown in not so focused but hey a beach view beat a highway view any day provided the sun held hal she said to her associate you think we need more tables over there it looks empty carol president of the local branch of the california central coast bankers association was a woman in her sixties a grandmother several times over although her employer was one of the larger chain banks that had misbehaved a bit a few years ago shed had no part of mortgagebacked securities she firmly believed banks did good she wouldnt have been in the business if she didnt think that she was living proof of the beneficence of the world of finance carol and her husband had comfortable retirement funds thanks to banks her daughter and soninlaw had expanded their graphic arts business and made it successful thanks to banks her grandsons would be going to stanford and ucdavis next fall thanks to student loans the earth revolved around money but that was a good thingfar better than guns and battleshipsand she was happy and proud to be a part of the process the diminutive whitehaired woman wouldnt have been in the business for fortysix years if shed felt otherwise hal reskin her second in command at the cccba was a heavyset man with a still face a lawyer specializing in commercial paper and banking law he eyed the corner she pointed at and agreed asymmetrical he said cant have that carol tried not to smile hal took everything he did quite seriously and was a far better idotter than she asymmetrical would be a sin possibly mortal she walked up to the two motel employees who were organizing the room for the christmas party which would last from three to five today and asked that they move several of the round tentops to cover the bald spot in the banquetroom floor the men hefted the tables and rearranged them hal nodded carol said deasymmetricalized her vice president laughed taking his tasks seriously didnt mean he was missing a sense of humor hal took the room in looks good to me double check the sound system then well get the decorations up the pa she asked i tried it yesterday it was fine but being the idotting banker that she was carol walked to the stage and flicked on the pa system nothing a few more flicks of the offon toggle as if that would do any good this could be a problem carol followed the cord but it disappeared below the stage maybe those workers hal said peering at the microphones who those two guys who were here a half hour ago maybe before you got here no i didnt see anybody jose and miguel she asked nodding at the men on the motel staff now setting up chairs no other ones they asked if this is where the banking meeting was going to be i told them yes and they said they had to make some repairs under the stage they were under there for a few minutes then they left she asked the two motel workers in the corner did you hear that there was a problem with the sound system no maam maria guest services she handle everything with the microphones and all that she said it was fine this morning but she off now where are those other workers carol asked after receiving blank stares she explained what hal had told her i dont know who theyd be maam were the ones jose and me who set up the rooms walking toward the access door to the stage hal said ill take a look you know electronics she asked are you kidding i set up my grandsons kinect with his xbox all by my little ole lonesome carol had no idea what he was talking about but he said it with such pride she had to smile she held open the access door as he descended beneath the stage good luck three minutes later the pa system came on with a resonant click through the speakers carol applauded hal appeared and dusted off his hands those guys earlier they knocked the cord loose when they were under there well have to keep an eye out they dont do it again i think theyll be back really maybe they left a tool box and some big bottles down there cleaner i guess okay well keep an eye out but the workmen were gone from carols mind decorations had to be set up food had to be arranged she wanted the room to be as nice as possible for the two hundred cccba members whod been looking forward to the party for months a stroke of luck and good policing the chp had collared the brothers of liberty perps kathryn dance whod dropped the disgruntled children off with her parents in carmel was standing in the weedy parking lot of an outlet mall only six miles from the california bureau of investigations monterey office where she worked michael oneil now approached he looked like a character from a john steinbeck novel maybe doc in cannery row although the uniform of the mcso was typical county sheriffs khaki chief detective oneil usually dressed softtoday in sport coat and tan slacks and blue dress shirt no tie his hair was saltandpepper and his brown eyes beneath lids that dipped low moved slowly as he explained the pursuit and collar his physique was solid and his arms very strongthough not from working out in a gym that was amusing to him but from muscling salmon and other delicacies into his boat in monterey bay every chance he got oneil was taciturn by design and his face registered little emotion but with dance he could usually be counted on to crack a wry joke or banter not now he was all business a fellow cbi agent massive shavedheaded albert stemple stalked up and oneil explained to him and dance how the perps had been caught the fastest way out of the area was on busy highway north to then to which would take the suspected terrorists directly back to their nest in oakland that route was where the bulk of the searchers had been concentratingwithout any success but an inventive young highway patrol officer had asked himself how would he leave the area if he knew his mission was compromised he decided the smartest approach would be to take neighborhood and singlelane roads all the way to highway several hours away and so he concentrated on small avenues like jacks and oil well andthis was the luck parthe spotted the perps near this strip mall which was close to highway the montereysalinas highway the trooper had called in backup then lit em up after a twentyminute highspeed pursuit the perps skidded into the mall sped around back and vanished but the trooper decided they were trying a feint he didnt head in the same direction they were instead he squealed to a stop and waited beside a tires plus operation after five excessively tense minutes the brothers of liberty had apparently decided theyd misled the pursuit and sped out the way theyd come in only to find the trooper had anticipated them he floored the cruiser equipped with ram bars and totaled the taurus the perps bailed the trooper tackled and hogtied one the other galloped toward a warehouse area three or four hundred yards away just as backup arrived there was a brief exchange of gunfire and the second perp wounded was collared too several chp officers and a colleague of dances at the cbi tj scanlon were at that scene now at the outlet mall the perp whod been tackled one wayne keplar regarded dance stemple and oneil and the growing entourage of law enforcers nice day for an event keplar said he was a lean man skinny you could say parentheses of creases surrounded his mouth and his dark narrowset eyes hid beneath a severely straight fringe of black hair a hook nose long arms big hands but he didnt appear particularly strong albert stemple whose every muscle seemed to be massive stood nearby and eyed the perp carefully ready to step on the bug if need be oneil took a radio call he stepped away keplar repeated event event could describe a game you know he spoke in an oddly high voice which dance found irritating probably not the tone more the smirk with which the words were delivered or could be a tragedy like theyd call an earthquake or a nuclear meltdown an event the press i mean they love words like that oneil motioned dance aside that was oakland pd the cis reporting that keplars pretty senior in the brothers of liberty the other guythe wounded one he nodded toward the warehouses gabe paulson hes technical at least has some schooling in engineering if its a bomb hes probably the one set it up they think thats what it is no intelligence about the means oneil explained on their website theyve talked about doing anything and everything to make their point bio chemical snipers even hooking up with some islamic extremist group and doing a quote joint venture dances mouth tightened we supply the explosives you supply the suicide bomber that pretty much describes it her eyes took in keplar sitting on the curb and she noted that he was relaxed even jovial dance whose position with the cbi trumped the other law enforcers approached him and regarded the lean man calmly we understand youre planning an attack of some sort event he reminded event then in two and a half hours is that true deed it is well right now the only crimes youll be charged with are traffic at the worst we could get you for conspiracy and attempt several different counts if that event occurs and people lose their lives the chargesll be a lot more serious he said jovially let me ask youwhats your name agent dance cbi she proffered her id he smacked his lips as irritating as his weasely voice agent dance of the cbi let me ask you dont you think we have a few too many laws in this country my goodness moses gave us ten things seemed to work pretty well back then and now weve got washington and sacramento telling us what to do what not to do every little detail honestly they dont have faith in our good smart selves mr keplar call me wayne please he looked her over appraisingly which cut of meat looks good today ill call you kathryn she noted that hed memorized her name from the perusal of the id while dance as an attractive woman was frequently undressed in the imaginations of the suspects she interviewed keplars gaze suggested he was pitying her as if she were afflicted with a disease in her case she guessed the disease was the tumor of government and racial tolerance dance noted the impervious smile on his face his air of what yes almost triumph he didnt appear at all concerned hed been arrested glancing at her watch dance stepped away to take a call from tj scanlon updating her on the status of gabe paulson the other perp she was talking to him when oneil tapped her shoulder she followed his gaze three black suvs dusty and dinged but imposing sped into the parking lot and squealed to a halt red and blue lights flashing a half dozen men in suits climbed out two others in tactical gear the largest of the men who were brooks brotherscladsix two and two hundred poundsbrushed his thick graying hair back and strode forward michael kathryn hi steve stephen nichols was the head of the local field office of the fbi hed worked with dances husband bill swenson a bureau agent until his death shed met nichols once or twice he was a competent agent but ambitious in a locale where ambition didnt do you much good he should have been in houston or atlanta where he could freestyle his way a bit further he said i never got the file on this one dont you read the dailies dance said we didnt either everybody assumed the bol would strike up near san francisco that bay not ours nichols said whos he keplar stared back with amused hostility toward nichols who would represent that most pernicious of enemiesthe federal government dance explained his role in the group and what it was believed theyd done here any idea exactly what they have in mind another agent with nichols asked nothing so far there were two of them nichols asked dance added the others gabe paulson she nodded toward the warehouses some distance away he was wounded but i just talked to my associate its a minor injury he can be interrogated nichols hesitated looking at the fog coming in fast you know i have to take them kathryn he sounded genuinely regretful at this rank pulling his glance wafted toward oneil too though monterey was pretty far down on the rung in the hierarchy of law enforcement here represented and nobodyeven the sheriff himselfexpected that the county would snag the bad boys sure dance glanced toward her watch but we havent got much time how many interrogators do you have the agent was hesitating just me for now were bringing in somebody from san francisco hes good bo right hes good but she tapped her watch lets split them up steve give me one of them at least for the time being nichols shrugged i guess dance said keplars going to be the trickiest hes senior in the organization and hes not the least shaken by the collar she nodded toward the perp who was lecturing nearby officers relentlessly about the destruction of the individual by governmenthe was supplying the capitalization hes going to be trickier to break paulsons been wounded and thatll make him more vulnerable she could see that nichols was considering this i think our different styles background yours and mine itd make sense for me to take keplar you take paulson nichols squinted against some momentary glare as a roll of fog vanished whos paulson exactly oneil answered seems to be the technician hed know about device if thats what theyve planted even if he doesnt tell you directly he could give something away thatd let us figure out whats going on the monterey detective wouldnt know exactly why dance wanted keplar and not gabe but hed picked up on her preference and he was playing along this wasnt completely lost on the fbi agent nichols would be considering a lot of things did dances idea to split up the interrogation make sense did she and he indeed have different interrogation styles and background also hed know that oneil and dance were close and they might be double teaming him in some way though he might not figure out to what end he might have thought she was bluffing hoping that hed pick wayne keplar because she herself wanted gabe paulson for some reason or he might have decided that all was good and it made sense for him to take the wounded perp whatever schematics were drawn in his mind he debated a long moment and then agreed dance nodded ill call my associate have paulson brought over here she gestured to the two chp officers towering over wayne keplar he was hoisted to his feet and led to dance oneil and nichols albert stemplewho weighed twice what the suspect didtook custody with a nononsense grip on the mans scrawny arm keplar couldnt take his eyes off the fbi agents do you know the five reasons the federal government is a travesty dance wanted him to shut upshe was afraid nichols would change his mind and drag the perp off himself first economically i whatever nichols muttered and wandered off to await his own prisoner dance nodded and stemple escorted keplar to a cbi unmarked dodge and inserted him into the backseat michael oneil would stay to supervise the crime scene here canvassing for witnesses and searching for evidencepossibly items thrown from the car that might give them more information about the site of the attack as she got into her personal vehicle a gray nissan pathfinder dance called to nichols and oneil and remember we have two and a half hours weve got to move fast she pulled out her phone briefed tj scanlon about paulson and nichols and turned on the flashing lights suctioned to her windshield dance left rubber on the concrete as she sped out of the parking lot fast albert stemple was parked outside cbi looking with some contempt at the press vans that were lolling near the front door dance parked behind him she strode to the dodge a reportera man with an aura of jude law if not the exact lookspushed to the barricade and thrust a microphone their way kathryn kathryn dance dan simmons the true story dot com she knew him a sensationalist reporter who oozed toward the more tawdry aspects of a story like slugs to dances doomed vegetable garden simmonss cameraman a squat froggy man with crinkly and unwashed hair aimed a fancy sony videocam their way as if about to launch a rocketpropelled grenade no comment on anything dan she and stemple shoehorned wayne keplar out of the car the reporter ignored her can you give us your name aimed at the suspect keplar was all too happy to talk he shouted out the brothers of liberty and began a lecturette about how the fourth estate was in the pocket of corporate money and the government not all reporters wayne simmons said not us were with you brother keep talking this impressed keplar quiet dance muttered leading him toward the front door and were about to strike a blow for freedom what are you going to do wayne simmons shouted we have no comment dance called well i do ive only been arrested wayne offered energetically with a smile ignoring dance and mugging for the reporter whose disheveled photographer was shooting away with his fancy digital video camera im not under a gag order freedom of speech thats what the founders of this country believed in even if the people in charge now dont let him talk agent the reporter called i have no comment at this time simmons replied we dont want your comment kathryn we want waynes he then added were you hurt wayne youre limping they hurt me in the arrest thatll be part of the lawsuit he hadnt been limping earlier dance tried to keep the disgust off her face we heard there were other suspects ones wounded and in fbi custody the others at large police scanners dance grimaced it was illegal to hack cell phones but anybody could buy a scanner and learn all they wanted to about police operations wayne what do you expect to achieve by what youre doing makin the people aware of the overbearing government the disrespect for the people of this great nation and dance actually pushed him through the door into the cbi monterey headquarters an unimpressive building that resembled one of the insurance agencies or law offices in this business park east of the airport on the way to salinas off highway simmons called kathryn agent dance the cbis front door was on a hydraulic closer but she would have slammed it if she could have dance turned to him wayne ive read you your rights you understand you have the right to an attorney and that anything you say can and will be used against you in court yes maam do you wish to waive your right to an attorney and to remain silent yup you understand you can break off our interview at any time i do now thanks very much informative will you tell us where youre planning this attack do that and well work out a deal will you let our founder osmond carter go free hes been illegally arrested in contravention of his basic human rights we cant do that then i think im not inclined to tell you what weve got in mind a grin but im happy to talk always enjoy a good chinwag with an attractive woman dance nodded to stemple who guided keplar through the maze of hallways to an interrogation room she followed she checked her weapon and took the file that a fellow agent had put together on the suspect three pages were in the manila sleeve thats all she wondered flipping open the file and reading the sparse history of wayne keplar and the pathetic organization he was sacrificing his life for she paused only once to glance at her watch and learn that she had only two hours and one minute to stop the attack michael oneil was pursuing the case at the crime scene as he always did meticulously patiently if an idea occurred to him if a clue presented itself he followed the lead until it paid off or it turned to dust he finished jotting down largely useless observations and impressions of witnesses in front of where the trooper rammed the suspects car man it was totally like loud the detective felt a coalescing of moisture on his face that damn monterey fogas much a local institution as john steinbeck cannery row and langston hughes he wiped his face with broad palms on the water fishing from his boat he didnt think anything of the damp air now it was irritating he approached the head of his forensic services unit a darkcomplexioned man who was of latino and scandinavian heritage abbott calderman the cbi didnt have a crime scene operation and the fbis closest one was in the san josesan francisco area the mcso provided most of the forensics for crimes in this area caldermans team was clustered around the stillvaporing taurus practically dismantling it to find clues that could tell them about the impending attack officers were also examining then bagging and tagging the pocket litter from the two suspectsthe police term for wallets money receipts twentydollar bills serial numbers thanks to atms revealed more than youd think sunglasses keys and the like these items would be logged and would ultimately end up at the jail where the men would be bookedsalinasbut for now the team would examine the items for information about the event wayne keplar had so proudly referred to calderman was speaking to one of his officers who was swathed in bright blue crime scene overalls booties and a surgeons shower cap michael the cs head said joining the detective my folksre going through the car a glance at the totaled vehicle air bags deployed its real cleanno motel keys letters or schematics rarely were perps discovered with maps in their possession with a red grease pencil x the legend reading attack here well know more when we analyze the trace from the tires and the floor of the passenger compartment and the trunk but they did find something you ought to know about a thermos of coffee and it was still hot right calderman nodded that oneil caught the significance of the discovery and no receipts from starbucks or a place that sells brewed coffee so they mightve stayed the night here somewhere and brewed it this morning possibly oakland was a long drive it could take three hours or more finding the thermos suggested though hardly proved that theyd come down a day or two early to prepare for the attack this meant thered probably be a motel nearby with additional evidence though theyd been too smart to keep receipts or reservation records the crime scene head added but most important we found three cups inside two in the cup holders in the front seat one on the floor in the back and the rear floor was wet with spilled coffee so theres a third perp oneil asked looks that waythough the trooper who nailed them didnt see anybody else couldve been hiding in the back oneil considered this and called oakland pd he learned that the ci had only heard about paulson and keplar but it was certainly possible he decided to ask someone else along the snitch had severed all contact with the bol worried that by diming out the operation hed be discovered and killed oneil texted dance and let her know about the third perp in case this would help in the interrogation he informed the fbis steve nichols too he then disconnected and looked over the hundred or so people standing at the yellow police tape gawking at the activity the third perp maybe hed gotten out of the car earlier after setting up the attack but before the chp trooper found the suspects or maybe hed bailed out here when the taurus was momentarily out of sight behind the outlet store oneil summoned several other monterey county officers and a few chp troopers they headed behind the long building searching the loading docksand even in the dumpstersfor any trace of the third suspect oneil hoped theyd be successful maybe the perp had bailed because he had particularly sensitive or incriminating information on him or he was a local contact who did use credit cards and atm machineswhose paper trail could steer the police toward the target or maybe he was the sort who couldnt resist interrogation perhaps the teenage child of one of the perps fanatics like those in the brothers of liberty had no compunction about enlistingand endangeringtheir children but the search team found no hint that someone had gotten out of the car and fled the rear of the mall faced a hill of sand dotted with succulent plants the area was crowned with a tall chainlink fence topped with barbed wire it would have been possible though challenging to escape that way but no footprints in the sand led to the fence all the loading dock doors were locked and alarmed he couldnt have gotten into the stores that way oneil continued to the far side of the building he walked there now and noted a burger king about fifty or sixty feet away he entered the restaurant carefully scanning to see if anyone avoided eye contact or more helpfully took off quickly none did but that didnt mean the third perp wasnt here this happened relatively often not because of the adage which was wrong about returning to or remaining at the scene of the crime out of a subconscious desire to get caught no perps were often arrogant enough to stay around and scope out the nature of the investigation as well as get the identities of the investigators who were pursuing themeven in some cases taking digital pictures to let their friends and fellow gangbangers know who was searching for them in english and spanish he interviewed the diners asking if theyd seen anyone get out of the perps car behind the outlet store typical of witnesses people had seen two cars three cars no cars red tauruses blue camrys green chryslers gray buicks no one had seen any passengers exit any vehicles finally though he had some luck one woman nodded in answer to his questions she pulled gaudy eyeglasses out of her blond hair where they rested like a tiara and put them on squinting as she looked over the scene thoughtfully pointing with her gigantic soda cup she indicated a spot behind the stores where shed noticed a man standing next to a car that couldve been blue she didnt know if hed gotten out or not she explained that somebody in the car handed him a blue backpack and hed left her description of the menone in combat fatigues and one in black cargo pants and a black leather jacketleft no doubt that they were keplar and paulson did you see where he went toward the parking lot i guess i like didnt pay much attention looking around then she stiffened oh what oneil asked thats him she whispered pointing to a sandyhaired man in jeans and work shirt with a backpack over his shoulder even from this distance oneil could see he was nervous rocking from foot to foot as he studied the crime scene he was short about five three or so explaining why the trooper might easily miss him in the back of the taurus oneil used his radio to call an mcso deputy and have her get the womans particulars she agreed to stay here until they collared the perp so she could make a formal id he then pulled his badge off his neck and slipped it into the pocket of his jacket which he buttoned to conceal the glock he started out of the burger king mister detective the woman called one thingthat backpack you oughta know when the guy handed it to him they treated it real careful i thought maybe it had something breakable in it but now maybe im thinking it could be you know dangerous thanks it was then that the sandyhaired man glanced toward oneil and he understood he eased back into the crowd hiking the backpack higher on his shoulder he turned and began to run speeding between the buildings to the back of the mall there he hesitated for only a moment charged up the sand hill and scaled the sixfoot chainlink oneil had surveyed earlier shredding part of his jacket as he deftly vaulted the barbed wire he sprawled onto the unkempt land on the other side of the fence also mostly sand it was a deserted former military base hundreds of acres oneil and two deputies approached the fence the detective scaled it fast tearing his shirt and losing some skin on the back of his hand as he crested the barbed wire he leaped to the sand on the other side he rolled once righted himself and drew his gun anticipating an attack but the perp had disappeared one of the deputies behind him got most of the way up the fence but lost his grip and fell he dropped straight down off balance and oneil heard the pop of his ankle as it broke oh the young man muttered as he looked down at the odd angle he turned as pale as the fog and passed out the other deputy called for a medic then started up the fence no oneil shouted stay there but ill handle the pursuit call a chopper and he turned sprinting through the sand and succulents and scrub oak and pine dodging around dunes and stands of dry treesbehind any one of which an armed suspect could be waiting he hardly wanted to handle the pursuit alone but he had no choice just after hed landed hed seen a sign lying face up on the sand danger uxo unexploded ordnance it featured a picture of an explosion coming up from the ground red years ago the paint was now pink this area had been part of the military bases artillery range and reportedly thousands of tons of shells and grenades were buried here waiting to be cleared as soon as the pentagons budget allowed but oneil thought of the two hundred people whod die in less than two hours and began to sprint along the trail that the suspect had been kind enough to leave in the sand the unreasonable idea occurred to him that if he took kathryn dances adviceto move fasthe might be past the cannon shell when it detonated he didnt however think an explosion like that was something you could outrun kinesic analysis works because of one simple concept which dance thought of as the ten commandments principle although she herself wasnt religious she liked the metaphor it boiled down to simply thou shalt not what came after that prohibition didnt matter the gist was that people knew the difference between right and wrong and they felt uneasy doing something they shouldnt some of this stemmed from the fear of getting caught but still were largely hardwired to do the right thing when people are deceptive either actively misstating or failing to give the whole story they experience stress and this stress reveals itself charles darwin said repressed emotion almost always comes to the surface in some form of body motion the problem for interrogators is that stress doesnt necessarily show up as nail biting sweating and eye avoidance it could take the form of a pleasant grin a cheerful nod a sympathetic wag of the head you dont say well thats terrible what a body language expert must do is compare subjects behavior in nonstressful situations with their behavior when they might be lying differences between the two suggestthough they dont provedeception if there is some variation a kinesic analyst then continues to probe the topic thats causing the stress until the subject confesses or its otherwise explained in interrogating wayne keplar dance would take her normal approach asking a number of innocuous questions she knew the answer to and that the suspect would have no reason to lie about shed also just shoot the breeze with him no agenda other than to note how he behaved when feeling no stress this would establish his kinesic baselinea catalog of his body language tone of voice and choice of expressions when he was at ease and truthful only then would she turn to questions about the impending attack and look for variations from the baseline when he answered but establishing the baseline usually requires many hours if not days of casual discussion time that kathryn dance didnt have it was now still there was no option other than to do the best she could shed learned that there was another suspect escaping through the old military ordnance storage and practice ground with michael oneil in pursuit she knew the dangers of the base and didnt want to think of the risks to him and the monterey crime scene team was still going over the taurus and the items that paulson and keplar had on them when arrested but these aspects of the investigation had produced no leads dance now read the sparse file once more quickly wayne keplar was fortyfour high school educated only but hed done well at school and was now one of the philosophers at the brothers of liberty writing many of the essays and diatribes on the groups blogs and website he was single never married hed been born in the haight lived in san diego and bakersfield now in oakland he didnt have a passport and had never been out of the country his father was deadkilled in a wacoruby ridgetype standoff with federal officers his mother and sister a few years older than he were also involved in bol which despite the name boasted members of both sexes neither of these family members had a criminal record keplar on the other hand didbut a minor one and nothing violent his only federal offense had been graffitiing an armed forces recruitment center he also had an older brother who lived on the east coast but the man apparently hadnt had any contact with keplar for years and had nothing to do with the bol a deep data mine search had revealed nothing about keplars and gabe paulsons journey here this was typical of militia types worried about big brother theyd pay cash for as much as they could normally shed want far more details than this but there was no more time fast dance left the folder at the desk out front and entered the interrogation room keplar glanced up with a smile uncuff him she said to albert stemple who didnt hesitate even though he clearly wasnt crazy about the idea dance would be alone in the room with an unshackled suspect but she couldnt afford to have the mans arms limited by chains body language analysis is hard enough even with all the limbs unfettered keplar slumped lazily in the gray padded office chair as if settling in to watch a football game he had some but not a lot of interest in dance nodded to stemple who left and closed the thick door behind him her eyes went to the large analog clock at the far end of the room keplar followed her gaze then looked back youre goin to try to find out where theevents takin place ask away but ill tell you right now its going to be a waste of time dance moved her chair so that she sat across from him with no furniture between them any barrier between interviewer and subject even a small table gives the perp a sense of protection and makes kinesic analysis that much harder dance was about three feet from him in his personal proxemic zonenot so close as to make him stonewall but near enough to keep him unsettled except that he wasnt unsettled at all wayne keplar was as calm as could be he looked at her steadily a gaze that was not haughty not challenging not sexy it was almost as if he were sizing up a dog to buy for his child wayne you dont have a drivers license another way for the government to keep tabs on you where do you live oakland near the water been there for six years town has a bad rap but its okay where were you before that san diego she asked more about his personal life and travels pretending not to know the answers shed left the file outside his responses were truthful and as he spoke she noted his shoulders were forward his right hand tended to come to rest on his thigh he looked her straight in the eye when he spoke his lips often curled into a halfsmile he had a habit of poking his tongue into the interior of his cheek from time to time it could have been a habit or could be from withdrawalmissing chewing tobacco which dance knew could be as addictive as smoking whyd you leave san diego wayne weathers nicer than oakland not really i dont agree with that but i just didnt like it you know how you get a vibration and its just not right thats true she said he beamed in an eerie way do you you know that youre a firecracker kathryn yes you are a chill coursed down her spine as the nearset eyes tapped across her face she ignored it as best she could and asked how senior are you in the brothers of liberty im pretty near the top you know anything about it no id love to tell you youre smart ms firecracker youd probably think therere some pretty all right ideas weve got im not sure i would a oneshoulder shruganother of his baseline gestures but you never know then came more questions about his life in oakland his prior convictions his childhood dance knew the answers to some but the others were such that hed have no reason to lie and she continued to rack up elements of baseline body language and verbal quality the tone and speed of speech she snuck a glance at the clock times got you rattled does it youre planning to kill a lot of people yes that bothers me but not you i see ha now youre sounding just like a therapist i was in counseling once it didnt take lets talk about what you have planned the two hundred people youre going to kill two hundred and change so more victims his behavior fit the baseline this was true he wasnt just boasting how many more two hundred twenty id guess an idea occurred to dance and she said ive told you were not releasing osmond carter that will never be on the table your loss well not yours two hundred and some odd peoples loss and killing them is only going to make your organization a pariah a i know what pariah means go on dont you think it would work to your advantage from a publicity point of view if you call off the attack or tell me the location now he hesitated maybe that could be yeah then his eyes brightened now im not inclined to call anything off thatd look bad or tell you direct where this things going to happen but you being ms firecracker and all how bout i give you a chance to figure it out well play a game game twenty questions ill answer honestly i swear i will sometimes that last sentence was a deception flag now she didnt think so and if you find out where those two hundred and ten folksre going to meet jesus then good for you i can honestly say i didnt tell you but you only get twenty questions you dont figure it out get the morgue ready you want to play kathryn if not ill just decide i want my lawyer and hope im next to a tv in he looked at the clock one hour and fortyone minutes all right lets play dance said and she subtly wiped the sweat that had dotted her palms how on earth to frame twenty questions to narrow down where the attack would take place shed never been in an interrogation like this he sat forward thisll be fun is the attack going to be an explosive device question oneill keep count no what will it be thats question two but sorry you know twenty questions has to be yes or no answers but ill give you a doover will it be a chemicalbio weapon sorta cheating there a twofer but ill say yes is it going to be in a place open to the public number three yes sorta public lets say therell be public access he was telling the truth all his behavior and the pitch and tempo of voice bore out his honesty but what did he mean by public access but not quite public is it an entertainment venue question four well not really but there will be entertainment there christmas related he scoffed thats five are you asking questions wisely ms firecracker youve used a quarter of them already you could have combined christmas and entertainment anyway yes christmas is involved dance thought this curious the brothers of liberty apparently had a religious side even if they werent bornagain fanatics she would have thought the target might be islamic or jewish have the victims done anything to your organization personally thinking police or law enforcement or government six no youre targeting them on ideological grounds seven yes she asked will it be in monterey county number eight yes in the city of no if she followed those lines of questioning shed use up all the questions just asking about the many towns and unincorporated areas in monterey county will it be near the water sloppy question expect better from you ms firecracker doover near the what stupid of her dance realized her heart pounding there were a number of bodies of water and rivers in the area and dont ask about the ocean technically monterey wasnt on the pacific will it be within a half mile of monterey bay good he said enjoying himself yes that was nine almost halfway there and she could see he was telling the truth completely every answer was delivered according to his kinesic baseline do you and gabe paulson have a partner helping you in the event one eyebrow rose yes number ten youre halfway to saving all them poor folks kathryn is the third person a member of the brothers of liberty yes eleven she was thinking hard unsure how to finesse the partners existence into helpful information she changed tack do the victims need tickets to get into the venue twelve i want to play fair i honestly dont know but they did have to sign up and pay thats more than i should give you but im enjoying this and indeed it seemed that keplar was she was beginning to form some ideas is the venue a tourist attraction thirteen yes id say so at least near tourist attractions now she felt safe using one of her geographical questions is it in the city of monterey no fourteen carmel no fifteen dance kept her own face neutral what else should she be asking if she could narrow it down a bit more and if michael oneil and his crime scene team came up with other details they might cobble together a clear picture of where the attack would take place then evacuate every building in the area how you doing there kathryn feeling the excitement of a good game i sure am he looked at the clock dance did too hell time had sped by during this exchange it was now she didnt respond to his question but tried a different tack do your close friends know what youre doing he frowned you want to use question sixteen for that well your choice yes do they approve yes all of them seventeen getting all you need here kathryn seems youre getting off track but she wasnt dance had another strategy she was comfortable with the information she hadtourist area near the water a paidfor event christmas related a few other factsand with what oneil found she hoped they could narrow down areas to evacuate now she was hoping to convince him to confess by playing up the idea raised earlier that by averting the attack hed still score some good publicity but wouldnt have to go to jail forever or die by lethal injection even if she lost the twenty questions game which seemed likely she was getting him to think about the people he was close to friends and family he could still spend time withif he stopped the attack and familydo your siblings approve question eighteen dont have any im an only child you only got two questions left kathryn spend em wisely dance hardly heard the last sentences she was stunned oh no his behavior when hed made the comment about not having siblingsa bald liewas identical to that of the baseline during the entire game hed been lying their eyes met tripped up there didnt i he laughed hard were off the grid so much didnt think you knew about my family shoulda been more careful everything you just told me was a lie thin air whole cloth pick your cliché ms firecracker had to run the clock theres nothing on gods green earth going to save those people she understood now what a waste of time this had been wayne keplar was probably incapable of being kinesically analyzed the ten commandments principle didnt apply in his case keplar felt no more stress lying than he did telling the truth like serial killers and schizophrenics political extremists often feel they are doing whats right even if those acts are criminal or reprehensible to others theyre convinced of their own moral rectitude look at it from my perspective sure we wouldve gotten some press if id confessed but you know reporterstheyd get tired of the story after a couple days two hundred dead folk hell well be on cnn for weeks you cant buy publicity like that dance pushed back from the table and without a word stepped outside michael oneil sprinted past ghosts the monterey area is a place where apparitions from the past are ever present the ohlone native americans the spanish the railroad barons the commercial fisherman all gone and the soldiers too whod inhabited fort ord and the other military facilities that once dotted the monterey peninsula and defined the economy and the culture gasping and sweating despite the chill and mist oneil jogged past the remnants of barracks and classrooms and training facilities some intact some sagging some collapsed past vehicle pool parking lots supply huts rifle ranges parade grounds past signs that featured faded skulls and crossed bones and pink explosions uxo the suspect wove through the area desperately and the chase was exhausting the land had been bulldozed flat in the s and forties for the construction of the base but the dunes had reclaimed much of the landscape rippled mounds of blond sand some of them four stories high the perp made his way through these valleys in a panicked run falling often as did oneil because of the dicey tractionand the fast turns and stopandgo sprinting when what looked like a potential explosives stash loomed oneil debated about parking a slug in the mans leg though thats technically a nono besides oneil couldnt afford to miss and kill him the suspect chugged along gasping redfaced the deadly backpack over his shoulder bouncing finally oneil heard the thud thud thud of rotors moving in he reflected that a chopper was the only smart way to pursue somebody through an area like this even if it wasnt technically a minefield the birds wouldnt trip the explosives as long as they hovered and what were the odds that he himself would detonate some ordnance mangling his legs what about the kids then what about his possible life with kathryn dance he decided that those questions were pointless this was military ordnance hed end up not an amputee but a mass of red jelly the chopper moved closer god they were loud hed forgotten that the suspect stopped glanced back and then turned right disappearing fast behind a dune was it a trap oneil started forward slowly but he couldnt see clearly the chopper was raising a turbulent cloud of dust and sand oneil waved it back he pointed his weapon ahead of him and began to approach the valley down which the perp had disappeared the helicopter hovered closer yet the pilot apparently hadnt seen oneils hand gestures the sandstorm grew more fierce some completely indiscernible words rattled from a loudspeaker back back oneil called uselessly then in front of him he noticed what seemed to be a persons form indistinct in the miasma of dust and sand the figure was moving in blinking trying to clear his eyes he aimed his pistol freeze putting some pressure on the trigger the gun was doubleaction now and it would take a bit of poundage to fire the first round shoot he told himself but there was too much dust to be sure this was in fact the perp what if it was a hostage or a lost hiker he crouched and staggered forward damn chopper grit clotted his mouth which was when a second silhouette smaller detached from the first and seemed to fly through the gauzy air toward him what was the blue backpack struck him in the face he fell backward tumbling to the ground the bag resting beside his legs choking on the sand michael oneil thought how ironic it was that hed survived a uxo field only to be blown to pieces with a bomb the perp had brought with him the bankers association holiday party was underway it had started as they always did a little early who wanted to deny loans or take care of the massive paperwork of approved ones when the joy of the season beckoned carol and hal were greeting the cccba members at the door showing them where to hang coats giving them gift bags and making sure the bar and snacks were in good supply the place did look magical shed opted to close the curtainson a nice summer day the water view might be fine but the fog had descended and the scenery was gray and gloomy inside though with the holiday lights and dimmed overheads the banquet room took on a warm comfy tone hal was walking around in his conservative suit white shirt andoversized santa hat people sipped wine and punch snapped digital pictures and clustered talking about politics and sports and shopping and impending vacations also a lot of comments about interest rates the fed and the euro with bankers you couldnt get away from shop talk ever we heard theres a surprise carol one of the members called what came another voice be patient she said laughing if i told you it wouldnt be a surprise now would it when the party seemed to be spinning along on its own she walked to the stage and tested the pa system once again yes it was working fine thank goodness the surprise depended on it shed arranged for the chorus from one of her grandsons high schools to go up on stage and present a holiday concert traditional and modern christmas and hanukkah songs she glanced at her watch the kids would arrive at about shed heard the youngsters before and they were very good carol laughed to herself recalling the entertainment at last years party herb ross a vp at first peoples trust whod injected close to a quart of the special punch had climbed on the table to singand even worse or better for later water cooler stories to act outthe entire twelve days of christmas himself the leaping lords being the high point kathryn dance spent a precious ten minutes texting and talking to a number of people in the field and here at headquarters it seemed that outside the surreality of the interrogation room the investigation hadnt moved well at all montereys forensic services unit was still analyzing trace connected with the taurus and the suspects pocket litter and abbott calderman said they might not have any answers for another ten or fifteen minutes lord she thought michael oneil when last heard from had been pursuing the third conspirator in the abandoned army base a police chopper had lost him in a cloud of dust and sand shed had a brief conversation with fbi agent steve nichols in a nearby mobile command post whod said this paulson isnt saying anything not a word just stares at me id like to waterboard him we dont do that dance had reminded im just daydreaming nichols had muttered and hung up now returning to the interrogation room with wayne keplar dance looked at the clock on the wall hey said wayne keplar eyeing it briefly then turning his gaze to dance youre not mad at me are you dance sat across the table from him it was clear she wasnt going to power a confession out of him so she didnt bother with the tradecraft of kinesic interviewing she said im sure its no surprise that before i tried to analyze your body language and was hoping to come up with a way to pressure you into telling me what you and gabe and your other associate had planned didnt know that about the body language but makes sense now i want to do something else and im going to tell you exactly what that is no tricks shoot im game dance had decided that traditional analysis and interrogation wouldnt work with someone like wayne keplar his lack of affect his fanatics belief in the righteousness of his cause made kinesics useless contentbased analysis wouldnt do much good either this is body languages poor cousin seeking to learn whether a suspect is telling the truth by considering if what he says makes sense but keplar was too much in control to let slip anything that she might parse for clues about deception and truth so she was doing something radical dance now said i want to prove to you that your beliefswhats motivating you and your group to perform this attacktheyre wrong he lifted an eyebrow intrigued this was a ludicrous idea for an interrogator one should never argue substance with a suspect if a man is accused of killing his wife your job is to determine the facts and if it appears that he did indeed commit murder get a confession or at least gather enough information to help investigators secure his conviction theres no point in discussing the right or wrong of what he did much less the broader philosophical questions of taking lives in general or violence against women say but that was exactly what she was going to do now poking the inside of his cheek with his tongue once more thoughtful keplar said do you even know what our beliefs are i read the brothers of liberty website i you like the graphics cost a pretty penny a glance at the wall dance continued you advocate smaller government virtually no taxes decentralized banking no large corporations reduced military religion in public schools and that you have the right to violent civil disobedience along with some racial and ethnic theories that went out of fashion in the s well bout that last onetruth is we just throw that in to get checks from rednecks and border control nuts lot of us dont really feel that way but ms firecracker you done your homework sounds like weve got more positions than you can shake a stick at but thosell do for a start so argue away thiss gonna be as much fun as twenty questions but just remember maybe ill talk you into my way of thinking hanging up that tin star of yours and coming over to the good guys what do you think about that ill stay openminded if you will deal she thought back to what shed read on the groups website you talk about the righteousness of the individual agree up to a point but we cant survive as individuals alone we need government and the more people we have with more economic and social activity the more we need a strong central government to make sure were safe to go about our lives thats sad kathryn sad sure i have more faith in humankind than you do sounds like were pretty capable of taking care of ourselves let me ask you you go to the doctor from time to time right yes but not very often right pretty rare hmm more often with the kids ill betsure you have kids i can tell she let this go with no reaction but what does the doctor do short of broken bone to set the doctor tells you pretty much to do what your instinct told you take some aspirin go to bed drink plenty of fluids eat fiber go to sleep let the body take care of itself and percent of the time those ideas work his eyes lit up thats what government should do leave us alone percent of the time and what about the other percent dance asked ill give you that we need lets see highways airports national defense ah but whats that last word defense you know they used to call it the war department well then some public relations fellas got involved and war wouldnt do anymore so they changed it but thats a lie see its not just defense we go poking our noses into places that we have no business being the government regulates corporations that would exploit people he scoffed the government helps em do it how many congressmen go to washington poor and come back rich most of them but youre okay with some taxes he shrugged to pay for roads air traffic control and defense the sec for regulating stocks we dont need stocks ask your average joe what the stock market is and theyll tell ya its a way to make money or put something away for your retirement fund they dont realize that thats not what its for the stock markets there to let people buy a company like youd go to a used car lot to buy a car and why do you want to buy a company beats me maybe a few peopled buy stock because they like what the company does or they want to support a certain kind of business thats not what people want them for do away with stocks altogether learn to live off the land youre wrong wayne look at all the innovations corporations have created the lifesaving drugs the medical supplies the computers thats what companies have done sure and iphones and blackberrys and laptops have replaced parents and kids learn their family values at porn sites what about government providing education ha thats another racket professors making a few hundred thousand dollars a year for working eight months and not working very hard at that teachers who can hardly put a sentence together themselves tell me kathryn are you happy handing over your youngsters to somebody you see at one or two pta meetings a year who knows what the hell theyre poisoning their minds with she said nothing but hoped her face wasnt revealing that from time to time she did indeed have those thoughts keplar continued no i got two words for you there home schooling you dont like the police you claim but were here to make sure you and your familyre safe well even make sure the brothers of liberty is free to go about your business and wont be discriminated against and wont be the victim of hate crimes police state think on this ms firecracker i dont know what you do exactly here in this fancy building but tell me true you put your life on the line every day and for what oh maybe you stop some crazy serial killer from time to time or save somebody in a kidnapping but mostly cops just put on their fancy cop outfits and go bust some poor kids with drugs but never get to why of it whats the reason they were scoring pot or coke in the first place because the government and the institutions of this country failed them so you dont like the federal government but its all relative isnt it go back to the eighteenth century we werent just a mass of individuals there was state government and they were powerful people had to pay taxes they were subject to laws they couldnt take their neighbors property they couldnt commit incest they couldnt steal everybody accepted that the federal government today is just a bigger version of the state governments in the s ah good kathryn ill give you that he nodded agreeably but we think state and even local laws are too much so youre in favor of no laws lets just say a lot lot less dance leaned forward with her hands together then lets talk about your one belief thats the most critical now violence to achieve your ends ill grant you that you have the right to hold whatever beliefs you wantand not get arrested for it which by the way isnt true in a lot of countries were the best keplar agreed but thats still not good enough for us but violence is hypocritical he frowned at this how so because you take away the most important right of an individualhis lifewhen you kill him in the name of your views how can you be an advocate of individuals and yet be willing to destroy them at the same time his head bobbed up and down a tongue poke again thats good kathryn yes she lifted her eyebrows keplar added and theres something to it except youre missing one thing those people were targeting theyre not individuals theyre part of the system just like you so youre saying its okay to kill them because theyre what not even human couldnt have said it better myself ms firecracker his eyes strayed to the wall the helicopter set down in a parking lot of the outlet mall in seaside and michael oneil and a handcuffed suspectno id on himclimbed out oneil was bleeding from a minor cut on the head incurred when he scrabbled into a cluster of scrub oaks trees escaping the satchel bomb which turned out to be merely a distraction no ieds no anthrax the satchel was filled with sand the perp had apparently disposed of whatever noxious substance it contained on one of his crosscut turns and weaves and the evidence or bomb or other clue was lost in the sand the choppers downdraft hadnt helped either what was most disappointing though was that the man had clammed up completely oneil was wondering if he was actually mute he hadnt said a word during the chase or after the detective had tackled and cuffed him and dragged him to the helicopter nothing oneil could saypromises or threatscould get the man to talk the detective handed him over to fellow monterey county sheriffs office deputies a fast search revealed no id they took his prints which came back negative from the field scanner and the man was processed under a john doe as unsub a the blond woman with the big soda cupnow mostly emptywhod spotted him in the crowd now identified him formally and she left the crime scene boss strode up to oneil dont have much but ill say that the taurus had recently spent some time on or near the beach along a stretch five miles south of moss landing calderman explained that because of the unique nature of cooling water from the power plant at moss landing and the prevailing currents and fertilizer from some of the local farms he could pinpoint that part of the county if five miles could be called pinpointing anything else nope thats it might get more in the lab calderman nodded to his watch but theres no time left oneil called kathryn whose mobile went right to voice mail he texted her the information he then looked over at the smashed taurus the emergency vehicles the yellow tape stark in the gray foggy afternoon he was thinking it wasnt unheard of for crime scenes to raise more questions than answers but why the hell did it have to be this one when so little time remained to save the two hundred victims hands steady as a rock harriet keplar was driving the car shed stolen from the parking lot at the outlet mall but even as her grip was firm her heart was in turmoil her beloved brother wayne and her sometimes lover gabe paulson were in custody after the bomb detonated shortly shed never see them again except at trialgiven waynes courage she suspected hed plead not guilty simply so he could get up on the stand and give the judge jury and press an earful rather than work a deal with the prosecutor she pulled her glasses out of her hair and regarded her watch not long now it was ten minutes to the dunes inn which had been their staging area and would have been where theyd wait out the next few days watching the news but now sadly plan b was in effect shed go back to collect all the documents maps extra equipment and remaining explosives and get the hell back to oakland she bet there was a goddamn snitch within the brothers of liberty up therehow else would the police have known as much as they didand harriet was going to find him it was a good thing theyd decided to split up behind the outlet mall as the taurus had temporarily evaded the highway patrol trooper and skidded to a stop harriet in the backseat wayne decided they had to make sure somebody got back to the motel and ditched the evidencewhich implicated some very senior people at the bol she jumped out with the backpack containing extra detonators and wires and tools and phony ids that let them get into the banquet hall where the cccba was having their party harriet had been going to hijack a car and head back to the dunes inn but the asshole of a trooper had rammed gabe and wayne and police had descended shed slipped into a burger king to let the dust settle shed ditched the contents of the satchel but to her dismay the police were spreading out and talking to everybody at the mall harriet decided she had to find a fall guy to take attention away from her shed spotted a solo shopper a man about her height with light hairin case the trooper had seen her in the backseat she stuck her glock in his ribs pulling him behind the bk then grabbed his wallet she found a picture of three spectacularly plain children and made a fake call on her mobile to an imaginary assistant telling him to get to the poor guys house and round up the kidlings if he didnt do exactly as she said theyd be shot oldest to youngest his wife would be the last to go she got his car keys and told him to stand in the crowd if any cops came to talk to him he was to run and if he was caught he should throw the pack at them and keep running if he got stopped he should say nothing she of course was going to dime him outand when the police went after him she would have a chance to take his car and leave it would have worked fine except that goddamn detectiveoneil was his namehad her stay put so she could formally id the sandyhaired guy oh how she wanted to get the hell out of there but she couldnt arouse suspicion so harriet had cooled her heels sucking down diet coke and tried to wrestle with the anger and sorrow about her brother and gabe then oneil and the poor bastard had returned shed ided him with a fierce glance of warning and given them some fake information on how to reach her and now she was in his car heading back to the dunes inn oh wayne ill miss you gabe too the motel loomed she sped into the parking lot and braked to a stop she was then aware of an odd vibration under her hands the steering column what was it an earthquake a problem with the car she shut the engine off but the vibration grew louder leaves began to move and the dust swirled like a tornado in the parking lot and harriet understood oh shit she pulled her glock from her bag and sprinted toward the motel door firing blindly at the helicopter as it landed in the parking lot several officers and damn it that detective oneil charged toward her drop the weapon drop the weapon she hesitated and laid the gun and her keychain on the ground then she dropped facedown beside them harriet was cuffed and pulled to her feet oneil was approaching his weapon drawn and looking for accomplices a cluster of cops dressed like soldiers was slowly moving toward the motel room anyone in there he asked no it was just the three of you yes the detective called treat it dynamic in any case howd you know she snapped he looked her over neutrally the cargo pants what you described the man in the car and said one was wearing cargo pants you couldnt see the pants of somebody inside a car from sixty feet away the angle was wrong hell harriet thought never even occurred to her oneil added that the man theyd believed was one of the conspirators was acting too nervous it occurred to me that he mightve been set up he told me what youd done we tracked his car here with his gps oneil was going through her purse youre his sister waynes im not saying anything else harriet was distracted her eyes taking in the motel room oneil caught it and frowned he glanced down at her keychain which held both a fob for her car and the second one she caught his eye and smiled ied in the room he called everybody back now it wasnt an explosive device just a gas bomb gabe had rigged in the event something like this happened it had been burning for three minutes or soshed pushed the remote control the second shed seen the chopperbut the smoke and flames werent yet visible then a bubble of fire burst through two of the windows armed with extinguishers the tactical team hurried inside to salvage what they could then retreated as the flames swelled one officer called michael we spotted a box of plastic explosive detonators some timers another officer ran up to oneil and showed him what was left of a dozen scorched documents they were the floor plan for the site of the attack at the cccba party he studied it a room with a stage could be anywhere a corporation school hotel restaurant he sighed harriet panicked then relaxed as she snuck a glimpse and noted that the name of the motel was on a part of the sheet that had burned to ash where is this oneil asked her bluntly harriet studied it for a moment and shook her head ive never seen that before you planted it to incriminate me the government does that all the time at the bankers party the high school students arrived looking scrubbed and festive all in uniforms which carol approved of tan slacks and blazers for the boys plaid skirts and white blouses for the girls they were checking out the treatsand the boys were probably wondering if they could cop a spiked punchbut would refrain from anything until after the twentyminute concert the kids took their music seriously and sweets tended to clog the throat her grandson had explained she hugged the blond goodlooking boy and shook the hand of the chorus director everyone everyone she called take your seats and the children climbed up on stage taking their positions the clock in the interrogation room registered dance broke off the debate for a moment and read and sent several text messages as wayne keplar watched with interest your expression tells me the news isnt good not making much headway elsewhere kathryn dance didnt respond she slipped her phone away im not finished with our discussion wayne now i pointed out you were hypocritical to kill the very people you purport to represent and i pointed out a hole a mile wide with that argument killing also goes against another tenet of yours wayne keplar said calmly how so you want religion taught in school so you must be devout well killing the innocent is a sin he snickered oh please ms firecracker read the bible sometime god smites people for next to nothing because somebody crosses him or to get your attention or because its tuesday i dont know you think everybody drowned in noahs flood was guilty of something so alqaedas terrorist tactics are okay well alqaeda itselfcause they want the strongest government of all its called a theocracy no respect for individuals but their tactics hell yes i admire the suicide bombers if i was in charge though id reduce all islamic countries to smoking nuclear craters kathryn dance looked desperately at the clock which showed nearly she rubbed her face as her shoulders slumped her weary eyes pleaded is there anything i can say to talk you into stopping this no you cant sometimes the truth is more important than the individuals but he added with a sincere look kathryn i want to say that i appreciate one thing no more ms firecracker whats that she said in a whisper eyes on the clock you took me seriously that talk we just had you disagree but you treated me with respect pm both law officer and suspect remained motionless staring at the clock a phone in the room rang she leaned over and hit the speaker button fast yes the staticky voice a mans kathryn its albert im sorry to have to tell you she sighed go on it was an ied plastic of some sort we dont have the count yet wasnt as bad as it could be seems the device was under a stage and that absorbed some of the blast but were still looking at fifteen or so dead maybe fifty injured hold on chps calling ill get back to you dance disconnected closed her eyes briefly then glared at keplar how could you wayne frowned he wasnt particularly triumphant im sorry kathryn this is the way it had to be its a war out there besides score one for your sideonly fifteen dead we screwed up dance shivered in anger but she calmly said lets go she rose and knocked on the door it opened immediately and two large cbi agents came in also glaring one reshackled keplars hands behind him hoping it seemed for an excuse to taser the prisoner but the man was the epitome of decorum one agent muttered to dance just heard the death counts up to she waved him silent as if denying keplar the satisfaction of knowing the extent of his victory she led the prisoner out the back of cbi toward a van that would ultimately transport him to the salinas lockup well have to move fast she told the other agents therere going to be a lot of people whod like to take things into their own hands the area was largely deserted but just then dan simmons the blogger whod pestered dance earlier the jude law lookalike peered around the edge of the building as if hed been checking every few minutes to see if theyd make a run for it this way simmons hurried toward them along with his unwashed cameraman dance ignored him simmons asked agent dance could you comment on the failure of law enforcement to stop the bombing in time she said nothing and kept ushering keplar toward the van do you think this will be the end of your career silence wayne do you have anything to say the blog reporter asked eyes on the camera lens keplar called its about time the government started listening to people like osmond carter this never would have happened if he hadnt been illegally arrested wayne what do you have to say about killing innocent victims sacrifices have to be made he called simmons called but why these particular victims whats the message youre trying to send that maybe bankers shouldnt be throwing themselves fancy holiday parties with the money theyve stolen from the working folk of this country the financial industrys been raping citizens for years they claim okay hold it dance snapped to the agents flanking keplar who literally jerked him to a stop dance was pulling out a walkietalkie michael its kathryn you read me four by four weve got six choppers and the entire peninsula com network standing by youre patched in to all emergency frequencies what do you have the targets a partychristmas id guessinvolving bankers or savings and loan people bank regulators something like that it is a bomb and its under the stage in that room you texted me about wayne keplar stared at her awash in confusion a half dozen voices shot from her radio variations of roger copy that checking motels with banquet rooms in the target zone south of moss landing contacting all banks in the target zone what is this keplar raged everyone ignored him a long several minutes passed dance standing motionless head down listening to the intersecting voices through the radio and then this is major rodriguez chp weve got it central coast bankers association annual christmas party monterey bay seaside motel theyre evacuating now wayne keplars eyes grew wide as he stared at dance but the bomb he glanced at dances wrist and those of the other officers theyd all removed their watches so keplar couldnt see the real time he turned to an agent and snapped what the hell time is it about ten to four replied dan simmons the reporter he blurted to dance the clock in the interrogation room oh she said guiding him to the prisoner transport van it was fast a half hour later michael oneil arrived from the motel where the bankers party had been interrupted he explained that everyone got out safely but thered been no time to try to render the device safe the explosion was quite impressive the material was probably semtex abbott calderman had guessed judging from the smell the forensic services head explained to oneil that it was the only explosive ever to have its own faq on the internet which answered questions like was it named after an idyllic pastoral village yes was it mass produced and shipped throughout the world as the late president vaclav havel claimed no and was semtex the means by which its inventor committed suicide not exactlyyes an employee at the plant did blow himself up intentionally but he had not been one of the inventors dance smiled as oneil recounted this trivia steve nichols of the fbi called and told her they were on the way to the cbi to deliver the other suspect gabe paulson he explained that since shed broken the case it made sense for her to process all the suspects there would be federal chargesmostly related to the explosivesbut those could be handled later as they waited in the parking lot for nichols to arrive oneil asked so howd you do it all i know is you called me about three i guess and told me to get choppers and a communications team ready you hoped to have some details about the location of the attack in about fortyfive minutes but you didnt tell me what was going on i didnt have much time dance explained what happened was i found out after wasting nearly an hour that keplar was kinesics proof so i had to trick him i took a break at three and talked to our technical department seems you can speed up analog clocks by changing the voltage and the frequency of the current in the wiring they changed the current in that part of the building so the clock started running fast oneil smiled that was the byword for this case remember you said it yourself and remember we have two and a half hours weve got to move fast dance continued i remembered when we got to cbi keplar started lecturing dan simmons about his cause oh that obnoxious reporter and blogger right i called him and said that if he asked keplar why he picked those particular victims id give him an exclusive interview and i called you to set up the search teams then i went back into the interrogation i had to make sure keplar didnt notice the clock was running fast so i started debating philosophy with him philosophy well wikipedia philosophy not the real stuff probably real enough nowadays she continued you and the crime scene people found out that it was probably a bomb and that it was planted in a large room with a stage when the clock hit four in the interrogation room i had albert call me and pretend a bomb had gone off and killed people but the stage had absorbed a lot of the blast that was just enough information so that keplar believed it had really happened then all i had to do was perp walk him past simmons who asked why those particular victims keplar couldnt keep himself from lecturing sure was close true ten minutes meant the difference between life and death for two hundred people though fate sometimes allowed for even more narrow margins one of the fbis black suvs now eased to a stop beside dance and oneil steve nichols and another agent climbed out and helped their shackled prisoner out a large bandage covered much of his head and the side of his face oneil stared at him silently the fbi agent said kathryn good luck with this fellow wish you the best but hes the toughest ive ever seenand ive been up against alqaeda and some of the mexican cartel drug lords theyre chatty cathy compared with him not a single word just sits and stares at you hes all yours ill do what i can steve but i think theres enough forensics to put everybody away for twenty years the law enforcers said goodbye and the feds climbed into the suburban then sped out of the cbi lot dance began to laugh so did the prisoner oneil asked so whats going on dance stepped forward and undid the cuffs securing the wrists of her associate tj scanlon he removed the swaddling revealing no injuries thanks boss and by the way thosere the first words ive said in three hours dance explained to oneil gabe paulsons in a lot more serious condition than i let on he was shot in the head during the takedown andll probably be in a vegetative state for the rest of his life which might not be that long i knew nicholsd wanted to have a part of the caseand for all we knew at that point he had primary jurisdiction i wanted to interrogate the only suspect we hadkeplarso i needed to give nichols someone tj volunteered to play paulson so you just deceived the fbi technically i know steve hes a brilliant agent id trust him with anything except an interrogation with a deadline like this three hours boss tj said rubbing his wrists did i mention not speaking for three hours thats very hard for me oneil asked wont he find out see the pictures of the real paulson in the press he was pretty bandaged up and like i said it may come back to haunt me ill deal with it then i thought i was going to be waterboarded i told him not to do that well he didnt share your directive with me i think he would have liked to use cattle prods too oh and i wouldve given you up in five seconds boss just for the record dance laughed oneil left to return to his office in salinas and dance and tj entered the cbi lobby just as the head of the office charles overby joined them here you are the agents greeted the paunchy man who was in his typical workaday outfit slacks and white shirt with sleeves rolled up revealing tennis and golftanned arms thanks kathryn appreciate what you did sure you were in the operation too overby asked tj thats right fbi liaison overby lowered his voice and said approvingly they dont seem to want a cut of the action good for us i did what i could tj said then the young man returned to his office leaving dance and her boss alone overby turned to dance ill need a briefing he said nodding toward the reporters out front a grimace something to feed to them despite the apparent disdain though overby was in fact looking forward to the press conference he always did he loved the limelight and would want to catch the pm local news hed also hope to gin up interest in some national coverage dance put her watch back on her wrist and looked at the time i can give you the bare bones charles but ive got to see a subject in another matter its got to be tonight he leaves town tomorrow there was a pause well if its critical it is all right get me a briefing sheet now and a full report in the morning sure charles he started back to his office and asked this guy youre meeting you need any backup no thanks charles its all taken care of sure night good night heading to her own office kathryn dance reflected on her impending mission tonight if overby had wanted a report on the attempted bombing for cbi headquarters in sacramento or followup interrogations she would have gladly done that but since he was interested only in press releases she decided to stick to her plans which involved a call to her father a retired marine biologist who worked part time at the aquarium she was going to have him pull some strings to arrange special admission after hours for herself and the children tonight and the subject shed told overby she had to meet tonight before he left town not a drug lord or a terrorist or a confidential informant but what was apparently the most imposing cephalopod ever to tour the central coast of california game one year ago the worst fear is the fear that follows you into your own home fear you lock in with you when you latch the door at night fear that cozies up to you twentyfour hours a day relentless and arrogant like cancer the diminutive woman eightythree years old white hair tied back in a jaunty ponytail sat at the window of her upper east side townhouse looking out over the trim street which was placid as always but she herself was not she was agitated and took no pleasure in the view shed enjoyed for thirty years the woman had fallen asleep last night thinking about the shebeast and the hebeast and shed awakened thinking about them shed thought about them all morning and she thought about them still she sipped her tea and took some small pleasure in the sliver of autumn sunlight resting on her hands and arms the flicker of gingko leaves outside silver green silver green was that all she had left minuscule comforts like this and not very comforting at that fear sarah lieberman hadnt quite figured out their game but one thing was clear taking over her life was the goallike a flag to be captured three months ago sarah had met the westerfields at a fundraiser held at the ninetysecond street y it was for a jewish youth organization though neither the name nor appearance of the two suggested that was their religious or ethnic background still they had seemed right at home and referred to many of the board members of the youth group as if theyd been friends for years theyd spent a solid hour talking to sarah alone seemingly fascinated with her life in the big apple johns phrase and explaining how theyd come here from kansas city to consummate miriams several business ventures john had set up real estate thats my game ask me again and ill tell you the same theyd had dinner at marcels the next night on madison with john dominating the fivefoottall woman physically and miriam doing the same conversationally flanking sarah in a booth in the back shed wanted her favorite table which had room for three yet was usually occupied by one at the window but the westerfields had insisted and why not theyd made clear this was their treat the two were charming informed in a midwest cnn kind of way and enthusiastically curious about life in the cityand about her life in particular their eyes widened when they learned that sarah had an apartment on the ground floor of the townhouse she owned on seventyfifth street miriam asked if it was available theyd been looking for a place to stay the mandarin oriental was miriam offered too expensive the garden apartment was on the market but was priced highto keep out the riffraff shed said laughing but shed drop it to fair market value for the westerfields deal still sarah had learned about the world from her husband a businessman who had successfully gone up against leona helmsley at one point there were formalities to be adhered to and the real estate management company did their due diligence they reported the references in the midwest attested to the westerfields finances and prior history there was of course that one bit of concern it seemed a bit odd that a fiftysomethingyearold mother and a son in his late twenties would be taking an apartment together when neither one seemed disabled but life circumstances are fluid sarah could imagine situations in which she might find herself living with a family member not a husband maybe miriams husband had just died and this was temporaryuntil the emotional turbulence settled and sarah certainly didnt know what to make of the fact that while the garden apartment featured three bedrooms when she and carmel had brought tea down as the two tenants moved in only one bedroom seemed to be put to that purpose the other two were used for storage odd indeed but sarah thought the best of people always had the two had been nice to her and most important treated her like an adult it was astonishing to sarah how many people thought that once you reached seventy or eighty you were really an infant that you couldnt order for yourself that you didnt know who lady gaga was oh my shed nearly said to one patronizing waitress ive forgotten how this knife works could you cut up my food for me for the first weeks the westerfields seemed the model tenants respectful of landlady and premises polite and quiet that was important to sarah whod always been a light sleeper she didnt see much of them not at first but soon their paths began to cross with more and more frequency sarah would return from a shopping trip with carmel or from a board meeting or luncheon at one of the nonprofits she was involved with and there would be miriam and john on the front steps or if the day was cool or wet in the tiny lobby sitting on the couch beside the mailboxes they brightened when they saw her and insisted she sit with them they pelted her with stories and observations and jokes and they could be counted on to ask questions relentlessly what charities was she involved in any family members still alive close friends new to the area they asked her to recommend banks lawyers accountants investment advisors hinting at large reserves of cash they had to put to work soon a onetrick puppy john pronounced solemnly real estate is the way to go its also a good way to get your balls handed to you son unless youre very very sharp sarah had not always been a demure retiring widow she began to wonder if a nigerian scam was looming but they never pitched to her maybe they were what they seemed oddballs from the midwest of some means hoping for financial success here and an entrée into a new york society that had never really been available to people like themand that people like them wouldnt enjoy even if they were admitted ultimately sarah decided it was their style that turned her off the charm of the first month faded miriam also a short woman though inches taller than sarah wore loud glittery clothes that clashed with her darkcomplexioned leathery skin if she didnt focus she tended to speak over and around the conversation ricocheting against topics that had little to do with what you believed you were speaking about she wouldnt look you in the eye and she hovered close saying no thanks to her was apparently synonymous with you betcha this big old town sarah miriam would say shaking her head gravely dont you get tuckered out causa it and the hesitation in that sentence hinted that the woman was really going to say dont it tucker you out john often wore a shabby sardonic grin as if hed caught somebody trying to cheat him he was fleshy big but strong too you could imagine his grainy picture in a newspaper above a story in which the word snapped appeared in a quote from a local sheriff if he wasnt grumbling or snide hed be snorting as he told jokes which were never very funny and usually bordered on being offcolor but avoiding them was gasoline on a flame when they sensed she was avoiding them they redoubled their efforts to graze their way into her life coming to her front door at any hour offering presents and advice and always the questions about her john would show up to take care of small handyman tasks around sarahs apartment carmels husband daniel was the buildings parttime maintenance man but john had befriended him and took over on some projects to give daniel a few hours off here and there sarah believed the westerfields actually waited hiding behind their own door listening for the sound of footsteps padding down the stairsand ninetyfourpound sarah lieberman was a very quiet padder still when she reached the groundfloor lobby the westerfields would spring out tall son and short mother joining her as if this were a rendezvous planned for weeks if they steamed up to her on the street outside the townhouse they attached themselves like leeches and no amount of better be going or have a good day now could dislodge them she stopped inviting them into her own twostory apartmentthe top two floors of the townhousebut when they tracked her down outside they would simply walk in with her when she returned miriam would take her groceries and put them away and john would sit forward on the couch with a glass of water his mother brought him and grin in that gotyou way of his miriam sat down with tea or coffee for the ladies and inquired how sarah was feeling did she ever go out of town did you read about that man a few years ago bernie madoff are you careful about things like that sarah i certainly am oh lord leave me alone sarah spoke to the lawyer and real estate management agent and learned there was nothing she could do to evict them and the matter got worse theyd accidentally let slip facts about sarahs life that they shouldnt have known bank accounts she had meetings shed been to boards she was on meetings with wealthy bankers theyd been spying she wondered if theyd been going through her mailperhaps in her townhouse when john was sitting on the couch babysitting her and his mother was in sarahs kitchen making them all a snack or perhaps theyd finagled a key to her mailbox now that would be a crime but she wondered if the police would be very interested of course not and then a month ago irritation became fear typically theyd poured inside after her as she returned from shopping alone carmel rodriguez having the day off miriam had scooped the food emporium bags from her hand and john had out of courtesy taken her key and opened the door sarah had been too flustered to protestwhich would have done little good anyway she now knew theyd sat for fifteen minutes water and tea at hand talking about who knew what best of friends and then miriam had picked up her large purse and gone to use the toilet and headed for sarahs bedroom sarah had stood saying shed prefer the woman use the guest bathroom but john had turned his knit brows her way and barked sit down mother can pick whichever she wants and sarah had halfthinking she was about to be beaten to death but the son slipped back to conversation mode and rambled on about yet another real estate deal he was thinking of doing sarah shaken merely nodded and tried to sip her tea she knew the woman was rifling through her personal things or planting a camera or listening device or worse when miriam returned fifteen minutes later she glanced at her son and he rose in eerie unison they lockstepped out of the apartment sarah searched but she couldnt find any eavesdropping devices and couldnt tell if anything was disturbed or missingand that might have been disastrous she had close to three quarters of a million dollars in cash and jewelry tucked away in her bedroom but theyd been up to no goodand had been rude and frightening it was then that she began to think of them as the hebeast and shebeast sycophants had given way to tyrants theyd become rasputins the beasts like viruses had infected what time sarah had left on this earth and were destroying ittime she wanted to spend simply and harmlessly visiting with those she cared for directing her money where it would do the most good volunteering at charities working on the needlepoints she loved so much a passion that was a legacy from her mother and yet those pleasures were being denied her sarah lieberman was a woman of mettle serene though she seemed and diminutive though she was shed left home in connecticut at eighteen put herself through college in horse country in northern virginia working in stables raced sailboats in new zealand lived in new orleans at a time when the town was still honkytonk then shed plunged into manhattan and embraced virtually every role that the city could offerfrom radio city music hall dancer to greenwich village bohemian to upper east side philanthropist at her eightieth birthday party shed sung a pretty good version of what had become her theme song over the years ill take manhattan that steely spirit remained but the physical package to give it play was gone she was an octogenarian as tiny and frail as that gingko leaf outside the parlor window and her mind too she wasnt as quick nor was the memory what it had been what could she do about the beasts now sitting in the parlor she dropped her hands to her knees nothing occurred to her it seemed hopeless then a key clattered in the lock sarahs breath sucked in she assumed that somehow the beasts had copied her key and she expected to see them now but no she sighed in relief to see carmel return from shopping were tears in her eyes whats the matter sarah asked nothing the woman responded quickly too quickly yes yes yes but if something were the matter give me a clue dear the solid housekeeper carried the groceries into the kitchen making sure she didnt look her bosss way yes crying theres nothing wrong mrs sarah really she returned to the parlor instinctively the woman straightened a lace doily was it him what did he do john the hebeast sarah knew he was somehow involved both marian and john disliked carmel as they did most of sarahs friends but john seemed contemptuous of the woman as if the housekeeper mounted a campaign to limit access to sarah which she did in fact several times she had actually stepped in front of john to keep him from following sarah into her apartment sarah had thought hed been about to hit the poor woman please its nothing carmel rodriguez was five feet six inches tall and probably weighed pounds yet the elderly woman now rose and looked up at her housekeeper whod been with her for more than a decade carmel tell me the voice left no room for debate i got home from shopping i was downstairs just now statements as questionsthe sign of uncertainty i came back from the store and was talking to him and then mr john just john you can call him john john comes up and just out of nowhere he says did i hear about the burglary where the neighborhood somewhere i said i didnt he said somebody broke in and stole this womans papers like banking papers and wills and deeds and bonds and stocks people dont keep stocks and bonds at home the brokerage keeps them well he told me she got robbed and these guys took all her things he said he was worried about you me yes mrs sarah and he didnt want to make you upset but he was worried and did i know where you kept things like that was there a safe somewhere he said he wanted to make sure they were protected the woman wiped her face sarah had thought her name was carmen at first as one would think given her pedigree and appearance but no her mother and father had named her after the town in california which they dreamed of someday visiting sarah found a tissue and handed it to the woman this was certainly alarming it seemed to represent a new level of invasiveness still john westerfields probing was constant and familiar like a lowgrade fever which carmel had her own mettle to withstand no something else had happened and no really just that sarah herself could be persistent too come now he i think it was maybe a coincidence didnt mean anything nothing the shebeast and the hebeast did was a coincidence sarah said tell me anyway then he said the woman offered choking back a sob if i didnt tell him he wouldnt be able to protect you and if those papers got stolen youd lose all your money id lose my job and and then he said my daughter might have to leave her high school immaculata he said that sarah whispered carmel was crying harder now how would he know she went there why would he find that out because he and his mother did their homework they asked their questions like chickens pecking up seed and stones but now threatening carmel and her family i got mad and i said i couldnt wait until the lease is up and his and his mother went away forever and he said oh they werent going anywhere they checked the law in new york and as long as they pay the rent and dont break the lease they can stay forever is that true mrs sarah sarah lieberman said yes carmel it is true she rose and sat down at the steinway piano shed owned for nearly twenty years it had been a present from her second husband for their wedding she played a few bars of chopin her favorite composer and in her opinion the most keyboardfriendly of the great classicists carmel continued when he left he said say hi to your family for me carmel say hi to daniel you know your husband hes a good carpenter and say hi to rosa shes a pretty girl pretty like her mother carmel was shivering now tears were flowing sarah turned from the piano and touched the maid on the shoulder its all right dear you did the right thing to tell me the tears slowed and finally stopped a kleenex made its way around her face after a long moment sarah said when mark and i were in malaysiayou know he was head of a trade delegation there yes mrs sarah when we were there for that we went to this preserve like a nature preserve thats right a nature preserve and there was this moth he showed us its called an atlas moth now theyre very bigtheir wings are six or eight inches across thats big sí but theyre still moths the guide pointed at it how can it defend itself what does it have teeth no venom no claws no but then the guide pointed out the markings on this moths wings and it looked just like a snakes head it was exactly like a cobra same color everything really mrs sarah really so that the predators arent sure whether it would be safe to eat the moth or not so they usually move on to something else and leave the moth alone carmel was nodding not at all sure where this was going im going to do that with the westerfields how mrs sarah ill show them the snake head im going to make them think its too dangerous to stay here and they should move out good how are you going to do that did i show you my birthday present the flowers no this sarah took an iphone from her purse she fiddled with the functions many of which she had yet to figure out my nephew in virginia gave it to me freddy hes a good man now this phone has a recorder in it youre going to record them doing that threatening you exactly ill email a copy to my lawyer and several other people the westerfieldsll have to leave me alone but it might not be safe mrs sarah im sure it wont be but it doesnt look like i have much choice do i then sarah noticed that carmel was frowning looking away the older woman said i know what youre thinking theyll just go find somebody else to torture and do the same thing to them yes thats what i was thinking sarah said softly but in the jungle you know its not the moths job to protect the whole world dear its the moths job to stay alive present day you want me to find somebody the man asked the solemn woman sitting across from him missing person the latina woman corrected solemnly body not somebody a body excuse me a body i want to know where a body is where its buried oh eddie caruso remained thoughtfully attentive but now that he realized the woman might be a crackpot he wanted mostly to get back to his ipad on which hed been watching a footballwell soccermatch currently underway in nigeria eddie loved sports hed played softball in his middle school days little league and football well gridiron in high school and then being a skinny guy hed opted for billiards pool in college to raise tuition while for the most part avoiding bodily harm but the present sport of his heart was soccer okay football but he was also a businessman and crackpots could be paying clients too he kept his attention on the substantial woman across his desk which was bisected by a slash of summer light reflected off a nearby times square highrise okay keep going mrs rodriguez carmel carmel carmel a body you were saying a murdered woman a friend he leaned forward now intrigued crackpot clients could not only pay well they also often meant gamea term coined by sportsman eddie caruso it was hard to define it meant basically the interesting the weird the captivating game was that indefinable aspect of love and business and everything else not just sports that kept you engaged that got the juices flowing that kept you off balance people had game or they didnt and if not break up jobs had game or they didnt and if not quit another thing about game you couldnt fake it eddie caruso had a feeling this woman and this case had game she said a year ago i lost someone i was close to im sorry the ipad went into sleep mode when last viewed a winger for senegal had been moving up through the markers to try to score but caruso let the sleeping device lie the woman was clearly distraught about her loss besides senegal wasnt going to score here carmel opened a large purse and took out what mustve been fifty sheets of paper rumpled gray torn actual newspaper clippings too which you didnt see much as opposed to computer printouts though there were some of those too she set them on his desk and rearranged them carefully pushed the stack forward whats this news stories about her sarah lieberman she was the one murdered something familiar caruso believed new york is a surprisingly small town when it comes to crime news of horrific violence spreads fast like a dot of oil on water and the hard details seat themselves deep in citizens memories the yuppie murderer the subway avenger the wilding rape son of sam the werewolf slasher caruso scanned the material fast yes the story came back to him sarah lieberman was an elderly woman killed by a bizarre couplea mother and son pair of grifters from the midwest he saw another name in the stories one of the witnesses that of the woman sitting in front of him carmel had been sarahs housekeeper and carmels husband daniel the parttime maintenance man she nodded toward the stack read those read that youll see what im talking about generally caruso didnt spend a lot of time in the free initial consulting session but then it wasnt like he had much else going on besides as he read he knew instinctively this case had game written all over it heres eddie caruso a lean face revealing not unexpected fortytwoyearold creases thick and carefully trimmed dark blond hair still skinny everywhere except for a belly that curls irritatingly over the belt hitching up macys sale chinesemade somewhat wool slacks a dress shirt today blue of color light blue like the gingham that infected the state fairs caruso worked as a boy to make money for cars and dates and eventually college rhubarb pie cobbler pig shows turkey wings dunktheclown that was where he came from and this is where he is not the fbi agent he dreamed of being nor the disillusioned personal injury lawyer he was but a pretty good private investigator which suits his edgy ebullient gameaddicted personality real well the actual job description is security consultant nowadays everybody cares about security they dont about investigating why should they a credit card and the internet make us all sam spades still eddie caruso likes to think of himself as a pi caruso has a scuffed boring nondescript office in a building those same adjectives apply to fortysixth near eighthdecorated office not building with close to twenty pictures he himself has taken with a very highspeed canon of athletes in action youd think he was a sports lawyer the building features mostly orthodontists plastic surgeons accountants oneman law firms and a copy shop thats one great thing about new york even in the theater district the mecca of all things artistic people need teeth and boobs fixed up their taxes paid and resumes exaggerated next door is a touristy but dependable restaurant of some nebulous middle easternmediterranean affiliation it excels at the grilled calamari caruso who lives in greenwich village and who often walks the three miles to work to banish the overhang of gut likes the fivestory bathwatergray building the location too though if the city doesnt stop digging up the street in front of the building caruso may just write a letter which hell never get around to of course now eddie caruso finished reading the account of the murder well skimming the account of the murder and pushed the material back toward carmel yep game sarah liebermans story had indeed interested caruso as mrs rodriguez here had suggested sarahs itinerant younger days a bit of a rebel her settling into life in new york city quite easily she seemed to be irreverent and clever and to have no patience for the pretense that breeds in the upper east side like germs in a fouryearolds nose caruso decided he would have liked the woman and he was mightily pissed off that the westerfields had beat her to death with a hammer wrapped the body in a garbage bag and dumped her in an unmarked grave it seemed that mother and son had met sarah at a fundraiser and saw a chance to run a grift they recognized her as a wealthy elderly vulnerable woman with no family living alone a perfect target they leased the apartment on the ground floor of her upper east side townhouse and began a relentless campaign to take control of her life she had finally had enough and one morning in july a year ago tried to record them threatening her theyd caught her in the act though and forced her to sign a contract selling them the townhouse for next to nothing then they zapped her with a taser and bludgeoned her to death that afternoon carmel returned to the townhouse from shopping and found her missing knowing that the westerfields had been asking about her valuables and that sarah was going to record them threatening her the housekeeper suspected what had happened she called the police given thatand the fact that a routine search revealed the westerfields had a criminal history in missouri and kansasofficers responded immediately they found some fresh blood in the garage that was enough for a search warrant crime scene found the taser with sarahs skin in the barbs a hammer with johns prints and sarahs blood and hair and duct tape with both sarahs and miriams dna a roll of garbage bags too three of them missing the clerk from a local spy and security shop verified the taser had been bought with cash by john westerfield a week earlier computer forensic experts found the couple had tried to hack into sarahs financial accountswithout success investigators did however find insurance documents covering close to seven hundred thousand dollars in cash and jewelry kept on her premises two necklaces identified as sarahs were found in miriams jewelry box all of the valuables had been stolen the defense claimed that drug gangs had broken in and killed her or as an alternative that sarah had gone senile and went off by herself on a bus or train juries hate lame excuses and it took the lieberman panel all of four hours to convict the two were sentenced to life imprisonment the farewell in the courtroommother and son embracing like spousesmade for one real queasy photograph carmel now said to eddie caruso i kept hoping the police would find her remains you know johns car had been spotted several days before sarah disappeared in new jersey where he was reportedly looking at real property for one of his big business deals none of which ever progressed past the daydreaming phase it was assumed the body had been dumped there carmel continued i dont know about her religion the jewish one but im sure its important to be buried and have a gravestone and have people say some words over you to have people come and see you dont you think mr caruso he himself didnt think that was important but he now nodded the problem is see this is a simple death simple the woman sat forward brows furrowing a bit not to make little of it understand me caruso added quickly seeing the dismay on her face its just that its open and shut you know nasty perps good evidence no love children no hidden treasure that was never recovered no conspiracy theories fast conviction with a simple death people lose interest the leads go cold real fast im saying it could be expensive for me to take on the case i could pay you three thousand dollars not more than that thatd buy you about twentyfive hours of my time on impulse he decided to waive expenses which he marked up and made a profit on before he went further though caruso asked have you thought this through what do you mean well it was a terrible crime but justices been done if i start searching i may have to ask you thingsyoull have to relive the incident and well sometimes when people look into the past they find things they wish they hadnt what could that be maybe thered be no way to recover the body even if i find it maybe it was lets say disrespected when it was disposed of carmel had not considered this he could tell clients rarely did but she said i want to say a prayer at her grave wherever it is i dont care about anything else caruso nodded and pulled a retainer agreement from his credenza they both signed it also on whim he penned in a discounted hourly rate hed seen pictures of her three children when shed opened her purse to get her drivers license number for the agreement they were teenagers and the parents were surely facing the horror of college expenses youre a goddamn softy he told himself all right he said to her let me keep these and ill get to work give me your home and mobile numbers a hesitation email please only email she wrote it down sure not call no please dont see i mentioned to my husband i was thinking about doing this and he said it wasnt a good idea why she nodded at the news clippings its in there somewhere there was a man maybe working for the westerfields the police think daniels worried hed find out if we started looking for the body hes probably dangerous glad you mentioned it caruso thought wryly okay ill email he rose carmel rodriguez stepped forward and actually hugged him tears in her eyes caruso mentally bumped his fee down another twentyfive just to buy her a little more of his time when shed gone he booted up the ipad just to see what hed missed sportswise the match was over senegal had won five zip five a bbc announcer beset by very unbbc enthusiasm was gushing some of the most spectacular scoring i have ever seen in all my years caruso shut the device off he pulled the stack of clippings closer to take more notesand to read up in particular on the westerfields possible accomplice he was reflecting that in all his years as a privately investigating security consultant hed been in one pushing match that lasted ten seconds not one real fight caruso did have a license to carry a pistol and he owned one but he hadnt touched his in about five years he believed the bullets had turned green he wondered if he would in fact be in danger then decided so be it game had to come with a little risk otherwise it wasnt game senior nypd detective lon sellitto dropped into his chair in his major cases office one police plaza dropped not sat rumpledthe adjective applied to both the gray suit and the human it encasedhe looked with longing affection at a large bag from baja express hed set on his excessively cluttered desk then at his visitor you want a taco no thanks caruso said the portly cop said i dont get the cheese or the beans it cuts the calories way down eddie caruso had known sellitto for years the detective was an all right guy who didnt bust the chops of private cops as long as they didnt throw their weight around and sneak behind the back of the real boys in blue caruso didnt he was respectful but not sycophantic youll guarantee that caruso asked what no beans so youre not going to fart i dont want to be here if youre gonna fart i meant i dont get the refried beans i get the regular beans black beans or whatever the hell they are theyre lot less calories fried by itself is not a good word when youre losing weight refried think how fucking bad that is but black beansre okay good fiber tasty but yeah i fart when i eat em like any tom dick and harry everybody does can we finish business before you indulge sellitto nodded at a slim limp nypd case file we will cause sorry to say the quote business aint going to take that long the case is over and done with and it wasnt much to start with out the window you could catch a glimpse of the harbor and governors island caruso loved the view down here hed thought from time to time about relocating but then figured the only real estate he could afford in this hood would come with a view even worse than his present one in midtown which was a few trees and a lot of sunlight secondhandbounced off that times square highrise the detective shoved the file carusos way the sarah lieberman homicide investigation that was one fuckedup twosome the perps sellitto winced they ick me out mother and son with one bed in the townhouse think about it caruso would rather not sellitto continued so your client wants to know where the dysfunctional family dumped the body yep shes religious you know no i dont i dont either but thats the way of it i looked through it fast sellitto offered a nod toward the file but the best bet for the corpse is jersey i read that in the daily news but there were no specifics sellitto grumbled its in the file somewhere near kearny marsh dont know it no reason to off bergen avenue the name says it all kearny sellittos round face cracked a smile ha youre funny for a private dick why dont you join the force we need people like you marsh huh yeah its all swamp serious swamp caruso asked whyd they think there ran john westerfields tags they had him at a toll booth on the jersey turnpike he got off at the twoeighty exit and back on again a half hour later security footage in the area showed the car parked in a couple places by the marsh he claimed he was checking out property to buy he said he was this real estate maven whatever maven is whats that word mean if we were in a quentin tarantino movie caruso said thiss where id start a long digression about the word maven well it isnt and i dont know what the fuck youre talking about sellitto definitely had game caruso flipped through the smaller folder inside the bigger one the smaller was labeled john westerfield many of the documents were his own notes and records and a lot of them had to do with real estate all the complex paperwork that rode herd on construction in manhattan foundationpouring permits crane permits streetaccess permissions interestinglyand incriminatinglythese were all multimilliondollar projects that john couldnt possibly have engaged in without sarah liebermans money good policing when was westerfield in jersey i dont know a couple days before she disappeared before was there a toll record of him being there after she disappeared no thats where the grassy knoll effect comes in the dallas kennedy assassination the other gunman i dont believe there was one it was oswald alone im not arguing that my point is that the westerfields probably did have an accomplice hes the one who got rid of the body in his car so there was no record of westerfield returning to jersey yeah my client mentioned there mightve been somebody else why would he be the one who dumped the body though sellitto tapped the file just after they killed hercrime scene knew the time from the bloodthe westerfields were seen in public so theyd have an alibi they wouldve hired somebody to dump the body probably somebody connected organized crime what connected means i know that im just saying sellitto said we think some lowgrade punk the westerfields had connections with mob folks in kansas city and they mustve tapped some affiliate here like baja fresh mobster franchises sellitto rolled his eyes maybe thinking caruso wasnt as clever as hed first thought the detective said the westerfields stole threequarters of a million from mrs lieberman cash and jewelry they wouldve paid this guy from that caruso liked it that sellitto called her mrs lieberman respect that was good that was part of game any leads to him no but he was afterthefact and nobody in the das office gave a shit really they had the doers why waste resources sellitto finally gave in he opened the lunch bag it did smell pretty good caruso began the couple theyre mother and son i wouldnt call em a couple the couple they say anything about the third guy sellitto looked at caruso as if hed gotten stupid himself remember it was gangbangers who killed her or she decided to take a cruise and forgot to tell anybody to the quote couple there was no third guy so i go searching in jersey where exactly is this kearny marsh sellitto nodded at the file caruso took it and retreated to a corner of sellittos office to read one thing the detective said caruso looked up expecting legalese and disclaimers the detective nodded at the bowl of black beans he was eating stay at your own risk hopeless eddie caruso stood about where john westerfields green mercedes had been parked as the man had surveyed the area looking for the best place to hide a body there was no way he could find where sarah lieberman had been buried before him were hundreds of acres of marshland filled with brown water green water gray water grass cattails and mulberry trees a trillion birds gulls ducks crows hawks and some other typetiny skittish creatures with iridescent blue wings and white bellies they were living in houses on poles stuck at the shoreline new jersey housing developments eddie caruso reflected but he didnt laugh at his own cleverness because he was being assaulted by suicidal and focused mosquitos slap and in the distance the crisp magnificence of manhattan illuminated by the midafternoon sun slap the water was brown and seemed to be only two or three feet deep you could wrap a body in chicken wire add a few weights and dump it anywhere he wasnt surprised searchers hadnt found her brutalized corpse and there was plenty of land tooin which it would be easy to dig a grave it was soupy and he nearly lost his ecco he wiped mud off his shoe as best he could and then speculated how much would it cost to hire a helicopter with some sort of hightech radar or infrared system to detect corpses a huge amount he guessed and surely the body was completely decomposed by now was there any instrumentation that could find only bones in this much territory he doubted it a flash of red caught his eye whats that it was a couple of people in a canoe new jersey meadowlands commission was printed on the side eddie carusos first thought was of course meadowlands may the giants have a better season next year his second thought was shit this was government land caruso realized meadowlands commission john westerfield claimed hed come here to look into a real estate deal but that was a lie thered be no private development on protected wetlands and using the toll road which identified him hed done that intentionally to lead people off not being the brightest star in the heavens he and his mother had probably figured they couldnt get convicted if the body was never found so theyd left a trail here to stymie the police in fact theyd buried sarah lieberman someplace else entirely where eddie caruso thought back to the police file in lon sellittos office he believed he knew the answer an hour and a half laterthank you very much new york city trafficcaruso parked his rental illegally he was sure to incur a ticket if not a tow here near city hall since it was highly patrolled but he was too impatient to wait to find a legal space he found his way to the commercial construction permits department a slowmoving clerk with an impressive do of dreadlocks surrounding her otherwise delicate face looked over his requests and disappeared for a long long time maybe coffee breaks had to be taken at exact moments or forfeited forever finally she returned with three separate folders sign for these he did can i check these out no but the thing is she said reasonably you can read em you can memorize em you can copy em but if you want copies you gotta pay and the machines say they take dollar bills but nobodys been able to get it to take a dollar bill in three years so you need change do you have we dont give change caruso thanked her anyway and returned to a cubicle to read the files these were originals of permits issued to three construction companies that were building highrises on the upper east side not far from sarah liebermans townhouse caruso had found copies of these in john westerfields police file the one that sellitto let him look through theyd been discovered in the mans desk john had claimed to be involved in real estate work so who would have thought twice about finding these folders no one did but eddie caruso had because why would john westerfield have copies of permits for construction of buildings hed had nothing to do with there was only one reason which became clear when caruso had noted that these three permits were for pouring foundations what better way to dispose of a body than to drop it into a pylon about to be filled with concrete but which building was it eddie carusos commitment to carmel rodriguez was to find out exactly where sarah lieberman had been buried as he looked down at the permits he suddenly realized how he could find out he copied the first pages of all three permits after getting change from another customer because yeah his dollarsd all been rejected by the temperamental xerox machine then returning to the cubicle he carefullyand painfullyworked the industrialsized staples from the paper and replaced the originals with the copies this was surely a misdemeanor of some kind but hed developed quite an affection for mrs carmel rodriguez he had dropped his rate by another twentyfive dollars an hour and by the by hed come to form an affection for the late mrs sarah lieberman too nothing was going to stop him from learning where the poor woman was resting in peace to his relief the clerk missed the theft and with a sincere smile caruso thanked her and wandered outside lord be praised there was no ticket and in a half hour he was parked outside the private forensic lab he sometimes used he hurried inside and paid a premium for expedited service then he strolled down to the waiting room where to his delight he found a new capsule coffee machine eddie caruso didnt drink coffee much and he never drank tea but he loved hot chocolate he had recipes for eighty different types and you needed recipesyou couldnt wing it and you never mixed that graybrown powder from an envelope with hot water especially envelopes that contained those little fake marshmallows like dandruff but the keurig did a pretty good job provided you chocked the resulting cocoa full of minimoo half and half which eddie caruso now did he sat back to enjoy the frothy beverage flipping through a sports illustrated which happened to describe the nigeriasenegal match as the game of the century in ten minutes a forensic techa young asian woman in a white jacket and goggles around her neckjoined him hed been planning on asking her out for some time three years and four months to be exact he hadnt been courageous or motivated enough to do so then and he wasnt now she said okay eddie heres what weve got weve isolated identifiable prints of six individuals on the permit documents from the city commission you brought me technicians were always soooo precise two of them negative no record in any commercial or law enforcement database one set are yours she regarded him with what might pass for irony at least in a forensic tech and said i can report that you are not in any criminal databases either it is likely however that that might not be the case much longer if the police find out how you came to be in possession of an original permit which by law has to remain on file with the city department in question precise oh eddie said offhandedly i found em on the street the permits no skipped beats she continued i have to tell you none are john westerfields this was a surprise and a disappointment but i could identify one other person who touched the documents we got his prints from military records not criminal no who is he his names daniel rodriguez it took five seconds carmels husband sometimes when people look into the past they find things they wish they hadnt whatever you call your profession security or investigation you need to be as professional as any cop eddie caruso was now in his office numbercrunching what hed found not letting a single fact wander away or distort was this true could daniel rodriguez be the third conspirator the one whod actually disposed of sarah liebermans body there was no other conclusion hed worked in sarahs building and would have been very familiar with john and miriam westerfield and they had known that daniel with three girls approaching college age would need all the money he could get he was involved in the trades and would know his way around construction sites he probably even had friends in the building whose foundation was now sarah liebermans grave finally daniel hadnt wanted his wife to pursue her plan to find out where sarahs body was he claimed this was because it was dangerous but thinking about it caruso decided that was crazy the odds of the other guy finding out were minimal no daniel just didnt want anybody looking into the case again and whatta i do now caruso wondered well there wasnt much choice all pis are under an obligation to inform the police if theyre aware of a felon at large besides anybody whod participated however slightly in such a terrible crime had to go to jail still was there anything he could do to mitigate the horror that carmel and their daughters would feel when he broke the news nothing occurred to him tomorrow would be a mass of disappointment still he had to be sure he needed as much proof of guilt as a cop would thats what game required resolution good or bad game is never ambiguous he assembled some of his tools of the trade and then decided he needed something else after all a man who can toss the body of an elderly woman into a building site can just as easily kill someone whos discovered he did that he unlocked the box containing his pistol nothing sexy just a revolver the sort you didnt see much anymore he found the bullets too they werent green which meant eddie caruso assumed that they still worked the next day caruso rented an suv with tinted windows and spent hours following daniel it was boring and unproductive as percent of tailing usually is on the surface round daniel rodriguez was a harmless cheerful man who seemed to joke a lot and seemed to get along with the construction crews he worked with eddie caruso had expectedand halfhopedto find him selling crack to school kids if that had been the case it would have been easier to report him to the police and easier to break the news to his wife and daughters caruso wondered no nothing could relieve the sting of that daniel returned home to his small but wellkept house in queens caruso cruised past slowly parked up the block and stepped outside making his way to a park across the street dressed like anybody else in the casual residential neighborhoodshorts and an izod shirt along with sunglasses and a baseball cap he found a bench and plopped down pretending to read his ipad but actually observing the family through the devices video camera apple had revolutionized the pi business the weather was nice and the rodriguez family cooked out with daniel the chef and carmel and their daughters his assistants several neighbors joined them daniel seemed to be a good father caruso wasnt recording his words but much of what he said made the whole family laugh a look of pure love passed between husband and wife shit caruso thought sometimes i hate this job after the barbecue and after the family had been shuffled off to the house daniel remained outside and something set off an alarm within caruso daniel rodriguez was scrubbing a grill that no longer needed scrubbing which meant he was stalling on instinct caruso rose and ducked into some dogpissscented city bushes it was good he did the handyman looked around piercingly making certain no one was watching he casuallytoo casuallydisappeared into the garage and came out a short time later locking the door that mission whatever it was smelled funky to caruso he gave it two hours for dark to descend and quiet to lull the neighborhood then he pulled on latex gloves and broke into the garage with a set of lockpicking tools having as he often did at moments like this an imaginary conversation with the arresting officer no sir im not committing burglarywhich is breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony im committing trespass onlybreaking and entering with intent to find the truth not exactly a defense under the new york state penal code caruso surveyed the jampacked garage a systematic search could take hours or days the man was a carpenter and handyman so he had literally tons of wood and plasterboard and cables and dozens of tool chests those seemed like natural hiding places but theyd also be the first things stolen if anybody broke in so caruso ignored them he stood in one place and turned in circles like a slowmotion radar antenna looking from shelf to shelf relying on the fuzzy illumination of the street light he had a flashlight but he was too close to the house to use it finally he decided the most likely place one would hide something was in the distant dusty corner in paint cans marred with dried drips of color nobodyd steal used paint and bingo in the third and fourth he found what he suspected he would stacks and stacks of twenties also two diamond bracelets all undoubtedly from sarahs safe deposit box this was his payment from the westerfields for disposing of the body they hadnt mentioned him of course at trial because he had enough evidence to sink them even deeperprobably enough to get them the death penalty caruso took pictures of the money and jewelry with a lowlight camera he didnt end his search there though but continued to search through all the cans most of them contained paint but not all one on the floor in the corner held exactly what he needed to figure out sarah liebermans last resting place come in come in eddie said to carmel rodriguez shutting off the tv the woman entered his office and glanced around squinting as if hed just decorated the walls with the sports pictures that had been there forever my daughter rosa she plays soccer thats my favorite too eddie sat down gesturing her into a seat across from the desk she eased cautiously into it you said you found something the pi nodded solemnly most of eddie carusos work involved finding runaways running preemployment checks and outing personal injury lawsuit fakers but he handled domestics too hed had to deliver news about betrayal and learned there were generally three different reactions explosive anger wailing sorrow or weary acceptance the last of which was usually accompanied by the eeriest smile of resignation on the face of the earth he had no idea how carmel would respond to what she was about to learn but there was no point in speculating it was time to let her know this is going to be troubling carmel but she interrupted you told me there might be things you found that i might not like he nodded and rose walking to his other door he opened it and gestured she frowned as her husband walked into the room the man gave her a sheepish grin and then looked back at the carpet as he sat next to her daniel why are you here caruso sat back in his office chair which was starting to develop the mousesqueak that seemed to return once a month no matter how much wd was involved he whispered go ahead daniel tell her he said nothing for a minute and carmel asked pointedly is this about mrs sarah is this about what happened to her the roundfaced man nodded okay honey carmel tell me the housekeeper said briskly i havent been honest with you eyes whipping toward her then away you remember last year you told me the westerfields wanted you to find mrs sarahs papers yes and when i said no they threatened sort of threatened our daughter they did the same to me they said they couldnt trust you you were too good they wanted me to help them you she whispered yes baby me only it wasnt just find the papers they what what did they want miriam told me sarah didnt have long to live anyway anyway what do you mean anyway she said sarah had cancer she wasnt sick she was healthier than that bitch miriam carmel spat out but they said she was and shed told them shed cut us out of her will wed get nothing they said if i help them now if she died now they could make sure we had lots of money helped them out carmel eyed her husband coolly you mean helped them kill her they said she was greedy why should she have so much and people like them and us have nothing it was unfair and you didnt tell me you didnt tell anybody they were dangerous i did tell somebody who not the police you didnt daniel looked at eddie caruso who picked up the remote control and hit on the tv on which a webcam sat came to life with a skype streaming image on the screen an elderly womans face gazed confidently and with some humor at the couple in the chairs and eddie caruso hello carmel sarah lieberman said its been a long time what eddie caruso had found in the last paint can in the rodriguezs garage was a letter from sarah to daniel with details of where shed be spending the rest of her lifea small town near middleburg virginia with her widower nephew frederick information about how to get in touch with her if need be where she would be buried and the name of certain discreet jewelers whom he could contact to sell the bracelets sarah had given him along with suggestions about how to carefully invest the cash shed provided too hed confronted the handyman this morning and while the letter seemed plausible caruso had insisted they both contact sarah lieberman this morning shed told them what had happened and was now telling the same story to her housekeeper the simple death hed described to carmel rodriguez was anything but im so sorry carmel im sorry i couldnt tell you you remember that day in july just a year ago i was going to take the phone freddy gave me and record them yes mrs sarah after you left i started to go down there but i met daniel on the stairs her gaze shifted slightly taking in the handyman he had me come back to my apartment and he told me what theyd just saidthat the beasts wanted him to help kill me he said they had it all planned there was nothing anybody could do to stop them why not go to the police carmel demanded sarah replied because at worst theyd get a few years in jail for conspiracy and then theyd be out again after somebody else i started thinking about what i told you remember the moth the big moth you and your husband saw in malaysia with the wings that look like a snake thats right but i decided one way to protect yourself is to disguise yourself as a snake the other way is to be the snake itself i fight back i couldnt kill them but i could make it look like they killed me i didnt ask daniel to help me but he wanted to i was so mad at them and worried about you and about rosa john hinted that hed been watching her watching our daughter sarah said the westerfields were very accommodating john already had the taser and the tape and the garbage bags she gave a wry laugh think of all the money ill waste at beacon brothers funeral home herethat damn expensive casket there are so many cheaper ways to go daniel said we pretended to forge a contract selling the building to them and then took all of the jewelry and cash mrs sarah had in the apartment she kept some and gave me a very generous amount and in my will i left freddy here sarah glanced to the side of the sun room she sat in apparently where her other coconspirator her nephew sat all my personal belongings probate took a little while but six months later everything was delivered here ah but back to the scene of the crime eh daniel he winced and looked at carmel when the westerfields were out and you were shopping we both went downstairs i put on gloves and took one of johns hammers and mrs sarah cut herself we got her blood on it and some hairs too and put some duct tape on her mouth for a minute and we added some of miriams hairs i rubbed her toothbrush on it for the dna sarah stuck herself with the sharp points on that taser we hid those things in their apartment then i tried to hack into mrs sarahs banking accounts from miriams computer i used to watch csi sarah said i know how these things work i left the city permits and maps in johns office daniel started to laugh then reined in when he saw his wife staring at him in dismay i was going to say it was funny because we thought the permits would be obvious but the police missed those entirely they thought she had been buried in new jersey but they missed it it was mr caruso who figured out about the foundations sarah said and i took the train down here ive had to lead a pretty quiet lifethey call it staying off the grid right freddy a mans voice thats right aunt sarah but i love it in virginia its so peaceful i lived here a long time ago and id always thought id come back to spend my last years in horse country daniel now turned to carmel im sorry love i couldnt tell you daniel said this was a crime what mrs sarah and i did putting those people in jail i wanted to i wanted to tell you a hundred times i couldnt let you get involved carmel was regarding her husband and the money you said you were opening an account for the girls school and you always had those fiftydollar bills i always wondered sarah said he risked a lot to save me i was very appreciative her voice faded and now i think its time for my nap id invite you to come down but its probably not a good idea for either of you to visit a dead woman im afraid oh mrs sarah goodbye carmel both women held their hands up in waves of farewell and eddie caruso a good judge of timing clicked the tv off caruso said goodbye to the family suspecting there would be more discussion of the events between husband and wife on the way home he thought about lowering the bill yet more but decided against it after all hed done the job and the case had had more or less a happy ending even if it was entirely unexpected but thats another thing about game maybe what really defines a person or event as game or not you never know ahead of time how its going to turn out speaking of which eddie caruso propped up his ipad and typed on the keyboard he was just in time to see tottenham versus everton fantastic you could never lose with premier league football well soccer paradice on one side was rock dark as old bone on the other a drop of a hundred feet and in front a ford pickup one of those fancy models a pleasant navyblue shade it cruised down the steep grade moving slow the driver and passenger enjoying the colorado scenery those were his choices rock air pickup which really wasnt much of a choice at all as a means to die john pellam jammed his left boot on the emergency brake again it dropped another notch toward the floor the pads ground fiercely and slowed the big camper not at all he was going close to sixty he downshifted low gear screamed and the box threatened to tear apart dont lose the gears he told himself popped the lever back up to d sixty mph seventy air rock seventyfive pickup choose one pellam thought his foot cramped as he instinctively shoved the useless brake pedal to the floor again five minutes ago hed been easing the chugging camper over clement pass near walsenburg three hours south of denver admiring the stern impressive scenery this cool spring morning thered been a soft hiss his foot had gone to the floor and the winnebago had started its free fall from the tinny boom box on the passenger seat kathy mattea sang who turned out the light pellam squinted as he bore down on the pickup honking the horn flashing his lights to warn the driver out of the way he caught a glimpse of sunglasses in the fords rearview mirror the driver wearing a brown cowboy hat spun around quickly to see how close the camper really was then turned back hands clasped at ten to two on the wheel air pickup pellam picked mountain he eased to the right thinking maybe he could brush against the rock and brush and pine slow down enough so that when he went headon into a tree it wouldnt kill him maybe but just as he swerved the driver of the truck instinctively steered in the same directionto the right to escape onto the shoulder pellam sucked in an oh hell and spun the wheel to the left so did the driver of the ford like one of those little dances people do trying to get out of each others way as they approached on the sidewalk both vehicles swung back to the right then to the left once more as the camper bore down on the blue pickup pellam chose to stay in the left lane on the edge of the cliff the pickup veered back to the right but it was too late the camper struck its rear endred and clear plastic shrapnel scattered over the asphaltand hooked onto the pickups trailer hitch the impact goosed the speed up to eighty pellam looked over the roof of the ford he had a fine view of where the road disappeared in a curve a half mile ahead if they didnt slow by then the two vehicles were going to sail into space in the finest tradition of hackneyed car chase scenes oh hell that wasnt all a new risk a bicyclist a woman it seemed on a mountain bike she had one of those pistachioshellshaped helmets in black and a heavy backpack she had no clue they were bearing down on her for a moment the pickup wiggled out of control then straightened its course the driver seemed to be looking back at pellam more than ahead he didnt see the bike seventy miles an hour a quarter mile from the curve and a hundred feet from the bicyclist look out pellam shouted pointlessly the driver of the pickup began to brake the ford vibrated powerfully they slowed a few miles per hour maybe the curve wasnt that sharp he squinted at a yellow warning sign the diagram showed a degree switchback a smaller sign commanded that thou shalt take the turn at ten miles an hour but theyd be on the cyclist in seconds without a clue they were speeding toward her she was coasting and weaving around in the right lane avoiding rocks and about to get crushed to death some riders had tiny rearview mirrors attached to their helmets she didnt look pellam shouted again and gestured whether the driver saw the gesture or not pellam couldnt say but the passenger did and pointed the pickup swerved to the left another squeal of brakes the camper rode up higher on the hitch it was like a fishhook as they raced past the bicyclist her mouth open in shock she wove to the side the far right and managed to skid to a stop that was one tragedy averted but the other loomed they were a thousand feet from the switchback pellam felt the vibrations again from the brakes they slowed to sixtyfive then sixty downshift five hundred feet theyd slowed to fifty danger sharp curve down to fortyfive leisurely miles an hour the switchback loomed straight ahead past the curve pellam could see nothing no trees no mountains just a huge empty space the tourist marker at clement pass said the area boasted some of the most spectacular vertical drops in colorado forty miles an hour thirtynine maybe well just bring this one off but then the grade dropped an acute angle and the wedded vehicles began accelerating fifty fiftyfive pellam took off his ray bans swept the pens and beer bottles off the dash knocked the boom box to the floor kathy continued to sing the song grand canyon was coming up soon a hundred feet from the switchback with a huge scream the pickups nose dropped the driver had locked the brakes in a last desperate attempt to stop blue smoke swirled as the truck fishtailed and the rear of the camper swung to the left but the driver was good he turned into the skid far enough to control it but not so much that he lost control they straightened out and kept slowing they were fifty feet from the edge of the switchback the speed had dropped to fifty fortyfive but it wasnt enough pellam threw his arms over his face sank down into the seat the pickup sliced through the pointless wooden guardrail and sailed over the edge of the road the camper just behind there was a loud thump as the undercarriage of the ford uprooted a skinny tree and then a soft jolt pellam opened his eyes to find the vehicles rolling down a gentle tenfoot incline smooth as a driveway into the parking lot of the overlook diner sitting in the middle of a spacious area on an outcropping of rock high above the valley floor with a resounding snap the campers front bumper broke loose and fell beneath the front tires slicing through and flattening them a hard jolt that launched the boom box and possibly a beer bottle or two into pellams ear and temple he winced at the pain the truck rolled leisurely through the lot and steered out of the way of the winnebago which hobbled on slowing toward the rear of the diner pellams laughter at the peaceful conclusion to the neartragedy vanished as the campers nose headed directly for a large propane tank shit hitting the useless brakes again couldnt help himself he squinted but the dead tires slowed the camper significantly and the result of the collision was a quiet thonk not the fireball that was the requisite conclusion of car chases in the sort of movies pellam preferred not to work on he lowered his head and inhaled deeply for a moment not praying just lowered his head he climbed out and stretched john pellam was lean of face and frame and tall with notquitetrimmed dark hair in his denim jacket noconas welltraveled jeans and a black wrinkled dress shirt converted to casual wear he resembled a cowboy or at least was mistaken for one in places like this though not in the lowrent district of beverly hillsyes they existthat was his mailing address the cowboy aura he tended to perpetuate not for image but for sentiment the story went that he was actually related to a figure from the old west wild bill hickok pellam walked stiffly toward the pickup noting the damage wasnt terrible scraped paint and hitch broken brake and taillight the driver too shut off the engine and eased the door open pellam approached look mister im really sorry the brakes the stetson came off swiftly unleashing a cascade of long chestnut hair the woman was in her midthirties petite about five two or so with a heartshaped face red lips brows thick and dark which for some reason made them wildly sensual the passengerside door opened and a young manwellbuilt in a gangly sort of way with an anemic goatee and short ruddy hairclimbed out a cautious smile on his face he looked as if he wanted to apologize for the accident though passengers were probably not the first suspects traffic officers looked at pellam continued toward the driver she took off her own ray bans he was thinking that her eyes were the palest most piercing gray hed ever seen when she drew back and decked him with a solid right to the jaw a cold colorado desert wind had come up and they were all inside the diner the cast now including the town sheriff fiftyish and twice pellams weight his name was partially h werther according to his name plate he stood near the counter talking to the cowgirl pellam was sitting at a table while a medic who smelled of chewing tobacco worked on his jaw pellam was mad at himself hed been in more fights than he could or cared tocount hed seen the squint in her eyes as he stepped close and had an idea that it was an abouttoswing squint and all the while pellam kept grinning like a freshman on a first date and thinking now those are some extraordinary eyes for christsake you mightve ducked at least the fist had glanced off bone and hadnt caused any serious damage though it loosened a tooth and laid open some skin six other patronstwo older couples and two single catcapped workerswatched with straightfaced amusement she got you good offered the medic in a low voice so the sheriff didnt hear it was the wreck stuff flying everywhere he looked out the window at the damaged winnebago the medic looked too and okay it didnt seem all that damaged things flew around uhn he grunted a boom box he decided not to mention the beer bottles were trained to look for certain contusions and abrasions like for domestic situations she barely tapped me pellam thought and wobbled the tooth again the driver stood with her arms crossed the hat was back on the brown was set off by a small green feather she gazed back as she spoke to the sheriff the beigeuniformed man towered over her and his weight not insignificant was a high percentage muscle probably the only peace officer in whatever town this was pellam had passed a welcometo sign but that had been just as the emergency brake pad had pungently melted and he hadnt had the inclination to check out the name and population of the place where he was about to die he guessed it was maybe a thousand souls as the sheriff jotted in a small notebook pellam studied the woman she was calm now and he thought again how beautiful she looked pale eyes dark eyebrows two red knuckles on her right hand she and the sheriff stood next to the cash register an oldtime handcrank model the diner itself was a real relic too aluminum trim paintspatter formica countertops blackandwhite linoleum diamonds on the floor arterial blood red for the vinyl upholsterybooth and stool the man whod been in the passenger seat of the ford stepped out of the washroom still wearing a cautious smile he was dressed in dark baggy clothesthe sort youd see in tribeca or on melrose in west hollywood pellamfor whom the line between movies and reality was always a little hazythought immediately that he could have stepped right out of a quentin tarantino or robert rodriguez flick he wore nononsense hiking boots clutching his backpack he laughed nervously again to pellam he nodded a rueful glancethe sort soldiers might exchange when theyve just survived their first firefight his hair was cut flat on the top short on the sidesthe kind of cut pellam associated with characters in the comic books of his childhood he mentally dubbed the man butch was she his wife girlfriend sister she wore a wedding ring but was easily ten years older not that that meant anything nowadaysif it ever had pellam was experienced but not particularly successful in the esoterica of romance his job didnt allow much room for relationships or thats what he told himself the medic pressed a bandage on his jaw youre good to go keep your guard up it was a then against dangerous entertainment devices the man nodded a farewell to the sheriff shoved a chaw in his mouth and left with his fixemup bag pellam rose unsteadily and walked toward the driver and sheriff who said everybody pull out some tickets for me if you would butch said evenly yessir here you go a moments pause as he dug through his wallet which was thick with scraps of paper pellam noted his license was illinois taylor was his real name pellam was somehow disappointed at this dont look much like you the sheriff said examining the license i didnt have a beard then pointing to the picture or short hair can see that i aint blind still dont look like you well taylor offered for no particular purpose this your current residence chicago for the time being where i get my mail the sheriff took pellams license too which contained a picture that did look like him still the sheriff frowned slightly perhaps at the word on the top california you saw a lot of californians in telluride and vail and aspen probably not a lot down here in this neck of the woods the door opened and a woman walked in she looked around hey sheriff everybody all right pellam squinted it was the bicyclist theyd nearly squashed frizzy blond hair massive curls the helmet was gone she was short and stocky the bicycle latex revealed serious thighs shed taken off her sunglasses and was scanning them all with green eyespellam in particular probably because of the bandage a spattering of sunenhanced freckles dusted her face somebody had come to pick her up the bike was racked on the roof of an old battered car a man in the drivers seat short hair lightish colored but pellam couldnt make out any details of the driver he was preoccupied with something elsethe camper it seemed lis the sheriff said glancing their way fine more or less that chris with you a nod toward the car thats right she explained that she was a witness not mentioning that shed nearly been run down happy to give a statement if you want good of you to come forward werther said most people wouldntve i figured youd track me down sooner or later didnt want to be leaving the scene of an accident go ahead tell me what you saw she gave a pretty accurate description he jotted a few notes every fifth or sixth word it seemed this was apparently the investigation of the year thats helpful lis thanks and why dontcha give them one of our cards for their insurance companies a little hesitation as if she hadnt counted on this level of attention she dug into a massive purse found some cards and gave them out lis and chris were the codirectors of the southeastern colorado ecological center seemed a little odd that such a group was based here since vegetation was sparse and the human footprint minimal scared the you know what out of me im sure pellam said sorry about that the driver was silent she didnt seem to care she pulled a cell phone from her pocket looked at the screen pellam was impressed hers was one of those new fancy ones where you didnt need to tug the antenna up she put the phone back thought you guys were racing at first but then i saw what happened brakes went mine yeah pellam said good thing there was nobody in the oncoming lane that was sure true though there hadnt been much traffic going in any direction on barren state route not here where it was close to a hundred miles to any kind of town lis was cute and maternal pellam guessed her first reason for coming here was in fact to see if anyone was hurt rather than cover her ass about leaving the scene thanks to you and chris the sheriff said looking out the door toward the old car a toyota had to be twenty years old the gloss was gone from the paint entirely pellam played out a scenario that the group had been threatened because they protested land use or something or because they were hippies and sheriff werther had stood up for them it would have made a bad scene in a movie and it was surely not true but that was the way pellams mind worked he wrung stories from dry rocks the earthmother left climbed in the car and they sped away she and chris without a word the sheriff stepped outside to write down vins and to radio in the details and see who was who and what was what the driver got a coffee not asking if anybody else wanted any she paid with steady hands look she said softly im sorry i hit you i wasnt thinking the pickup was a birthday present just last week its got eight hundred miles on it pellam thought about making a joke that out here that meant two trips to the grocery store and one to blockbuster but he didnt mostly because she didnt sound particularly sorry shed slugged him sokay he said automatically as his tongue poked a loose tooth i didnt really get the impression you were out for blood though he happened to be tasting some at that moment he added it was a boom box hit me thats what happened he nodded toward the sheriff thanks i get carried away sometimes the pain was starting now probably more than boom box pain then the issue of assault was gone and she looked impatiently at her watch it seemed an appropriate time for intros her name turned out to be hannah billings with an h a backend h im john pellam this isnt a linebut i have to say ive never met a hannah before pretty name it conjured up a heroine in a world war ii film a resistance fighter wearing a tight frock whatever a frock might be taylor brushed his butch hair and said its a palindrome her name a a word thats spelled the same backward and forward madam im adam he said i wrote an entire poem in palindromes once poem hannah said and this is taylor the poet filled in duke more relationship mystery as in the duke being out here makes you think of oldtime westerns doesnt it hannah had no clue what he was talking about how could somebody not know john wayne so everybody okay taylor asked that was freaky i mean seeing the road doing that turn whats it called a switchback hannah offered and dumped sugar into her coffee yeah im fine ive had worse as if pellam were an afterthought you i used to be a stuntman ive had worse stuntman she was curious taylor too wow hollywood yep fascinating he dug into his massive backpack for a notebook and wrote something down on the stained limp pages hannah muttered to him didnt quite work out the way youd hoped looks like he shrugged not your fault taylor had a bulky presence but he seemed like a pretty softhearted guy there was a formality between the two of them pellam just couldnt figure out their relationship she had a colorado license hed noted and taylor illinois was he a distant relative taylor looked around offering a faint laugh this place is something a real diner it oughta be in black and white like an old tv show pellam quoted youre moving into a land of both shadow and substance of things and ideas youve just crossed over into the twilight zone controlling the vertical and the horizontal taylor replied pellam believed that was a different show but nodded anyway the woman completely ignored them she took her coffee outside to make another cell phone call taylor the film and tvloving poet went for some coffee too sitting down at the counter he smiled more friendly than flirtatious at one of the waitresses the younger of the two a slim woman in a white uniform which was only slightly jellymarred rita if pellam read the scripty typeface above her left breast correctly taylor ordered adding how bout this diner isnt it totally authentic and man a real piece of america she glanced at him as if hed told her hed just seen elvis mountain biking through the pines and went off silently to pour his coffee it arrived in a chipped white mug that mustve weighed close to a pound pellam watched hannah smoking half a cigarette quickly she returned inside waving her hand about her to shoo away the smoke as if trying to get rid of the evidence it told pellam her husband or some other family member wanted her to give up the habit and while she was courteous about the practice she wasnt going to stop she seemed more impatient yet staring out toward the sheriff hunched over his cruiser calling the incident in to points unknown finally she joined pellam i tried to get around you he said i know i saw again studying the sheriff pellam reflected pale eyes but a great tan dark and rich without a single crows foot to show for it taylor was tan too but only hands face and part of his neck the rest was pale as paper it told pellam he spent a lot of time outside but wearing most of his clothes ah he deduced hitchhiker made sense that tan and the backpack and those boots really serious boots but would a single woman have picked up a man who outweighed her by seventy pounds or so a woman with that right hook like she had was clearly somebody who could handle herself and as for her tanit seemed to be everywhere which was to john pellam an interesting matter for imaginative speculation the sheriff returned and looked over the threesome without suspicion or disdain still he was a pro and there were questions to be asked he asked pellam you been drinking sir ah welcome to gurney pellam finally scored the name of the town it was on the sheriffs shoulder hell of a name for a place wasnt that some kind of medical stretcher brakes went so you say didnt answer my question then the answer is no last drink i had was a beer sure it wasnt two the law enforcer asked wryly hows that sall anybody ever drinks two beers a fellall tank down a fifth of old crow and when we pull him outa the wreck he says hes only had two beers what they always say now how manyd you really have this was pretty funny pellam thought as a follower of cops it was true one beer and it was yesterday yessir well just have you breathe into our little magic box you object to that not at all he hasnt been drinking taylor said you could tell it was a lands end knapsack he held he kneaded it with long fingers that could have used a good scrubbing the backs of his hands were tanned the palms pink doesnt really matter what he seemed to you sir well let science string him up or not as the case may be then lets do it pellam said agreeably in the end the sheriff settled for a little heel and toe walk along the checkerboard of the diner floor and the law enforcer was satisfied with the result i just dont want to see any empties in the front of a vehicle you understand me i they even if they got themselves propelled there by the quote force of the impact pellam kind of liked this sheriff andas a stranger in a lot of townshed come under some scrutiny in his day and your jaw howd that happen pellam looked him in the eye boom box rap what you were listening to rap on a boom box and you fell you can listen to anything on a boom box i was listening to country and he pointed to the bandage it hit me in the face when we went off the road okay said in the way that cops always say okay like they dont exactly believe you and they dont exactly not believe you then he took in the driver youre from hamlin and billings you ed billingss wife thats right you know ed not personal know some folks whove retired to one of his developments paso verde thats a big one yeah she looked at her watch popular and whats your story sir taylor said im headed to berkeley colorado california taking a poetry course there okay im hitching from denver to hamlin hannah said i was driving back from some meetings in colorado springs the ford had a flat and he fixed it for me you have business in hamlin the sheriff asked im getting the amtrak there to oakland rather than from denver yup you got money for the train whyre you hitchin the sheriff asked pellam thought these questions while delivered pleasantly were a bit intrusive directed as they were to a man who in this particular scenario was an innocent bystander but taylor was happy to talk the experience of it he gave his enthusiastic little laugh again id hitch all the way if i had time i mean the whole point of life is experience right youre not thumbing on the interstate are you ramps only taylor said automatically with a grin hed been through this before the sheriff looked at hannah who didnt know the drill ahead of time but caught on she said sourly i was on fourteen when i had the flat route the highway where the pickupcamper runin occurred okay now im not writing anybody up thank you officer taylor said though once again pellam had no clue what he might get written up for he was acting so easygoing that pellam knew his pack had to be drug free hannah didnt say thanks her beautiful but severe face gave off the message i got rearended in my birthday truck why the hell was a citation even an issue licenses and registrations were redistributed except pellams which the sheriff thumbed slowly now you sir the brakes went i said im not citing anybody but on that you know you have an obligation to check your equipment pellam didnt think hed ever looked at a brake line he doubted he could recognize one what im curious about is are you making movies here when the sheriff had checked the vin on the winnebagos dash he must have seen the colorado film boards location permit thats right im a location scout for a film company based in la really hannah asked her curiosity piqued for the first time and sour attitude on hold pellam got this a lot he wondered if shed ask for a walkon part he had an amusing image of her as a femme fatale she had the right look and spirit to be a really good bad girl sexy too which was another requirement in fact he was scouting for a film noir at the moment an indie titled paradice and youre setting it here she asked well i was going to recommend it came across this place east of here fifteen miles or so whats it called devils playground hannah said shaking her head be a good setting for a stephen king movie thats about all taylor asked thats near where you picked me up right spooky it was the place was nestled at the base of two mountains a huge craggy plain of pits and arroyos bleak as could be but extremely photogenic but i called the county supervisor this morning he wont issue film permits derek westerholm that was him hey hube you just bought some land up near there didnt you rita the young waitress piped up near that lake hube pellam reflected hubert no wonder he went by a solitary h the sheriff didnt answer let him make his movie on your property rita continued and mister im available you need a leading lady taylor said earnestly ill put you in a poem again the elvishasbeenspotted look taylors hitchhikingweathered face blushed okay thats all i need werther said just get those vehicles up to the law whatta you mean hannah asked no brake light no turn signals no backup you cant drive without em youre kidding its still daylight still where she asked her eyes going for some reason to pellam the sheriff answered rudys bout four blocks thataway best mechanic in town that the only one in town pellam found himself asking thats right the sheriff gave him the phone number from memory pellam asked he by any chance related to you hah thats funny the sheriffs smile might not have been real and pellam reminded himself to watch it he couldnt afford to spend the night in jail on suspicion of fraternizing with empties in the front seat of a vehicle ten minutes later pellam and hannah walked into the repair shop with the worlds most beautiful view the windows looked out over mountains to the west and north and craggy flatssalt or sandto the east now early afternoon the peaks were lit brilliantly the stunning light firing off the late spring snowcap way in the distance he noted a particularly impressive elegant mountain was it pikes peak probably not hannah had driven them both here in her rearlightchallenged ford with an okay from sheriff werther the winnebago was gingerly towed to a spot in front of the service station and lowered to its damaged front paws the garage was filthy and cluttered the owner rudy came out of the bays smiling he nodded but from habit didnt shake hands his fingers were black he wore a carhartt brown jacket stained beyond saving he smiled at them in a way that was only a bit like a cat regarding a plump mouse and started talking like they were old friends he was rambling on about life here in gurney his family one boy in the army one girl in nursing school and assorted relatives hubes a good man you know hes got a grandkid with that autism problem its pretty bad needs special help a lot hube works two jobs sheriff and security at preston assembly plant his wife my sister pellam was content to let him go because he figured the more like friends and family this seemed the less the chance of getting robbed blind but hannah wasnt in the mood she interrupted curtly you mind getting to those estimates the pickup first well now ill do that with a crinklyeyed look that meant hed just added a hundred or two onto the bill he headed outside so did hannah setting the stetson firmly on her head against the upandcoming wind she pulled her cigarettes out of her pocket but then looked at assorted open containers of liquids that might or might not be flammable she grimaced and put the marlboros away she made some calls pellam did too pulling up his antenna and finding an acceptable signal he told the director that hed been in an accident which the man responded to with more or less genuine concern when he learned that the county would not under any circumstances issue permits the director had a more intense reaction fuckers why fragile eco system fragile you told me it was rocks and sand joe thats what they said what they mean is that they dont want horny actors and slutty actresses carousing around in their county were behind schedule john ill get the camper fixed and head south tomorrow a sigh okay thanks the voice grew grave you okay for sure concern in tone not in spirit fine joe he disconnected and happened to be looking at a map of the area the devils playground area seemed to be the best locale for paradice the fictional town where the movie was set as well as being the films title and pellam laughed to himself realizing that damn the indie was about a stranger coming to a small desert town like gurney and getting into all sorts of trouble there wasnt much of a story to go with it but sometimesespecially in noirall you needed was a misspelled word in the title some hunky lead and a sexy babe and betrayal oh and a fair amount of gunplay hannah finished her own call walked farther away from conflagration risks and had a portion of a cigarette then she returned to the waiting room staring out the window too she flopped down in a cracked fiberglass chair i told ed he wasnt happy pellam got the impression she didnt much care your husband the real estate man she looked at him as if asking you heard that before why ask wheres butch pellam asked who oh right taylor headed to this little park in the middle of town he wanted to write a poem a poem hes serious about that hannah continued said hed felt inspired by the experience of being out here in a small western town she shook her head meaning i dont get it theres nothing to experience not here dust maybe rednecks losers coyotes hamlins got a mall pellam wondered if the shopping center comment was delivered with the irony that seemed warranted apparently not a few minutes later the huge bearded mechanic lumbered into the office rearranging the grease on his fingers with a filthy rag damn shame bout that pickup needin bodywork when you can still smell the new leather thats always the way aint it now miss i got two options firstll get you home sooner i can remove the old bulbsthats tricky since theyre bustedand then screw in new bulbs and mount the lenses thatll be four hundred eighty dollars number two which id recommend would include all that plus the body work and replacing the hitch you dont want to tow nothing with it in that present condition paint too and how much is that twentyeight fifty hannah squinted really i can have my guy in hamlin do the bodywork for a thousand the hitch is fine ill buff off the scratches myself and whys that even an option didnt your brotherinlaw tell you i was in a hurry i so were down to option one and lets think it through hows that she continued patiently you can get bulbs for six bucks a pop at napa cheaper at walmart i need four of them the lenses lets be generous fifty bucks each just need two thats a grand total of one twentyfour in parts labor now the bulbs arent screwmount like you said theyre bayonet rudys face had gone red beneath the smudges well i meant screw you know in a like general sense im sure you did hannah muttered which was really a very funny line even if she didnt seem to realize it you put a glove on right stick your finger into the broken base and push and twist you can do all four in a minute or two takes you another five minutes to mount the new ones so youre basically charging me four hundred dollars for twenty minutes work thats a thousand dollars an hour my lawyer doesnt charge that does yours a look at pellam i dont have a lawyer he did but he wasnt going to get involved in this he was enjoying himself too much silence for a moment i have overhead was the only defense rudy could mount from beneath her dark silken eyebrows she gazed unflinchingly into his evasive eyes two fifty he muttered one fifty two fifty one fifty hannah said firmly cash came the uneasy riposte cash okay jesus the mechanic sullenly retreated into his garage to fetch the tools pellam glanced at the winnebago he had no talent whatsoever when it came to motor vehicles except for the uncanny ability to attract state troopers when he was speeding rudy was going to hose him maybe he should have hannah go over the estimate he walked to the vending machine and bought a moon pie pellam noted the complimentary coffee and thought about making a joke that it better say nice things about you because it looked like sludge but hannah just didnt seem to be the sort to share clever comments with he bought a vending machine instant coffee which wasnt terrible with the double milk powder you really picked that fellow up pellam asked her after a moment i clock a hundred thousand miles a year but i never pick up hitchers even pretty women especially them though ive been tempted a glance into her pale eyes then he grazed her tan she chose not to flirt back i normally wouldntve but he did help me out and i mean really a poet or grad student hes about as harmless as they come still could be pretty dangerous pellam said gravely she looked at him with consideration what if he started reciting poetry at you a blink actually he did and it sucks you ever been to berkeley no i dont travel much not out of the state pellam had scouted for a film there the movie was about the regents at a fictional school which happened to look a lot like ucb teargassing protesting students in the sixties and the rise of the counterculture all very politically correct the critics liked it unfortunately most of the people who went to see it which was not very many did not pellam thought the concept had potential but the director had ignored his suggestionsbecause he was jtlc and even though hed been a successful director himself years ago anyone who was justthelocationscout like justthegrip or even justthescreenwriter was bound to be ignored by god he seems old to be a student a shrug a glance toward pellam as if she was noticing him for the first time maybe one of those perpetual college kids doesnt want to get into the real world afraid of making money the moon pie was pretty good he thought about offering her a bite but he liked it more than he liked her despite the glance from her cool gray eyes pellam eyed a gremlin painted an iridescent green that existed nowhere in nature now that was a car with personality whatever else you could say about it from the tiny engine to the downright weird logo of yes a gremlin he stuck his head inside it smelled like what must have smelled like rudy finished the job in jiffy time and even washed the windshield for her though the water in the pail didnt leave it much cleaner than before she paid him and the big mechanic went on to look over pellams winnebago two flat tires wrecked bumper probably frontend work maybe the fan if a bit of paint and fixing some dents was going to cost ms hostility nearly three grand what the hell was his estimate going to be at least he had the production company credit card though that would entail a complicated and thorough explanation to the accounting powers that beand in the film business those were formidable powers indeed rudy went off to do his ciphering pellam expected him to lick his pencil tip before he wrote but he didnt where the hells taylor hannah looked around with some irritation i told him to meet me here pellam decided that with her impatience edge and taste for authentic jewelry in quantity a poet would not make the cut in a relationship good luck to you ed you have taylors number pellam asked no phone he doesnt believe in them one of those he didnt know exactly what that category was but he could figure it out how big can gurney be pellam asked too big she said she was tough but pellam had to give her credit for some really good lines rudy came back and maybe it was hannahs presence but the estimate was just under three gs not terrible he said okay rudy explained hed call for the parts theyd be here in the morning youll need to get a room for the night i have one you do the camper oh right the mechanic returned to his shop pellam ate some more moon pie and sipped coffee she looked around the repair shop office and didnt see anything to sit on she started to ask pellam you but she was interrupted when two law enforcement vehicles different jurisdictions to judge from the color pulled into the lot in front of the station they parked werther got out of the first and was joined by the second cars occupant a young colorado state trooper in a dark blue shirt leather jacket and smokey the bear hat pellam and hannah left the shop stepping into the windy afternoon and joined them ms billings mr pellam thiss sergeant lambert from the colorado state patrol hed like to talk to you for a minute heads were nodded no hands shaken lambert wasnt as young as he seemed looking into the weathered face up close though he was still a decade behind pellam his dark eyes were still and cautious you were both near devils playground around am today is that correct i was pellam said around then hannah probably yeah and the sheriff says you werent alone no a man was with me taylor duke was with me i see well seems a man was murdered about that time near the playground on some private land near lake lobos really hannah said not particularly interested his name was jonas barnes a commercial real estate developer from quincy pellam pitched out the remaining moon pie for some reason it just seemed like a bad idea to eat junk food pastries while being questioned about a homicide the coffee went too the trooper continued he was stabbed to death we think the killer was surprised he started to drag him to one of the caves nearby but somebody showed up nearby and he fled that tells us there was a witness either of you happen to see anyone around there then parked vehicles hikers fishermen anything out of the ordinary hannah shook her head pellam thought back this was in the devils playground south of there the victim was looking over some land he was thinking of buying where that spur to the interstates gonna go this was from rudy whod wandered up doing more grease rearranging he nodded a greeting to his brotherinlaw thats the place yeah the trooper offered werther said he didnt know well thats what i heard connecting fourteen to ififtytwo ah the infamous state route he looked at hannah billings again her cool eyes and grim mouth didnt make her any less attractive hed never see her again after today of course but he wondered just how married was she women like that that was a natural question it asked itself hannah said i wasnt in the park i had a flat about a half mile south it was near a café duncan schaeffers place she looked at the mechanic with a gaze that said and why the hell would i know who owns it the trooper said and the fellow who helped you with the flat the hitchhiker he mightve seen more since he was on foot could be she offered where is he now he was downtown hes supposed to meet me shouldve been here by now id think the trooper took down their information and said hed get an update while he waited until taylor duke returned with ramrodstraight posture he returned to his car sat down and began to type onto his computer sheriff werther finished a conversation with rudy who headed back to the shop the sheriff started up the cruiser and headed off pellam spotted a convenience store fifty yards up the dusty road he could get a frozen dinner to nuke and curl up with a whiskey and a map of southeastern colorado to find a shooting location for paradice hed get something but he was pissed hed been denied devils playground it was perfect stepping away hannah lit another cigarette having some trouble getting the tobacco lit in the stream of wind he caught a glimpse of her pale eyes her dark eyebrows jeans tight as paint as the flame flared she snapped the lighter shuta silver one not disposable madam im adam she ambled in his direction as a fierce gust of wind pushed her starboard a few inches as she closed in she hung up dont get married she muttered ever this intelligence about ed was interesting so was what she said next we go inside a nod at the camper but when he responded you bet we can he wasnt flirting the damn wind had chilled him to bone once they were in the confined space pellam noted immediately that they both smelled of service stationa sweet and ultimately unpleasant astringent smell courtesy of rudy and gurney auto service we fix all makes and models foriegn too dump your oil here hannah noticed this as well and smelled her leather sleeve jesus she settled into the bench seat behind the tiny kitchenette table kind of homey i like it eyeing her beautiful face to gauge if she was bored by his narrative he told her about life on the road what appealed to him she did seem more or less interested she rose went to the cupboard vodka whiskey headache she seemed to pout pellam was amused hurrying off into the windy afternoon to buy her vodka was just the sort of thing that the straight guy the innocent the mark would do for a femme fatale in a noir movie like paradice and it was generally a bad decision on all fronts hannah looked him over carefully once more and then sat down on the bed rather than the banquette her head dipped her eyes locked onto his he asked grey goose or belvedere ten minutes later hed shelled out big bucks for the premium and bought himself an extra fifth of knob creek just to be safe two stouffers frozen lasagnas too they were both for him he didnt think hannah would stay around for dinner dont get married ever at first hed thought that was a warning not an invitation but seeing her on the bed he wasnt so sure the wind kept up its insistent buffeting and pellam walked with his head down eyes squinted to slits hed spent a lot of time in deserts and it seemed to him that the grit in colorado gurney in particular was the sharpest and most abrasive imagination probably he lifted his head and oriented himself then adjusted course pellam walked past an abandoned onestory building that had been a video store there were fewer than there used to be talk in the industry was that soon cable tv was going to be offering nearly firstrun films on special units that duplicated the clarity of theater screens you could even watch movies on your computernot with discs which were soon going to take over the market from vhs tapes but through your phone line or however you connected to the internet pellam was skeptical of all this technology and in any case he didnt like it there was an intimacy about going to a theater to watch a movie lights going down the hush of the crowd then experiencing the images big and loud and awash with the reactions of everyone else he couldnt imagine whatever hit him weighed fifty pounds easy it shattered the vodka and whiskey and sent pellam tumbling into the street but stuntmen instincts never quite go away he rolled rather than impacted diffusing the energy and in a smooth motion he sprang up flexing his right hand to see if it was brokenit wasnt two fists and he was ready to fight the assailant however wasnt he was already sprinting away from the attack through the brush pellam couldnt see him clearly but he noted that it seemed the man had a backpack on interesting pellam was about to go after him but glanced toward the camper about a hundred feet away and saw the body lying on the ground in dark clothing hell was it hannah he ran forward and stopped fast no it was the state patrol trooper he was lying on his back one leg straight the other up knee crooked his throat had been slit deep a lake of blood surrounded his head and neck his holster was empty bootprints led from the body into the woods behind the service station then a mans voice from nearby help me pellam spun around from the repair shop rudy staggered toward the street hed been stabbed or struck on the head and blood cascaded down to his shoulder he was staring at his hand covered with the red liquid whats this whats this he was hysterical pellam ran to the mechanic the wound wasnt deepa blow to the back of the head it seemed he eased the man to the ground and found a rag filthy but presumably saturated with enough petrochemical substances to render it relatively germ free he pressed it against the wound hannah pellam ran to the camper and flung the door open any sign of hannahs question skidded to a halt as she looked him over covered with the aromatic dregs of whiskey and vodka which glued dust and dirt to his body jesus whats going on pellam opened the tiny compartment beside the door he took out his antique colt peacemaker a cowboy gun and loaded it slipped it into his back waistband troopers dead rudys hurt somebody decked me i think it was your hitchhiker i couldnt see for sure but i think so the poet yep you have a gun whered you get a gun wait here recalling that taylor would have the troopers weapon he opened the camper door slowly and stepped into the wind no shots and no sign of the man where would he have fled to he pulled out his cell phone and hit he got the operator but five seconds later he was patched through to the sheriff himself pellam didnt think that was the sort of thing that ever happened in the big city ten minutes later hannah joined him outside as werther showed up hannah billings was not the sort of person who stayed inside when she didnt want to stay inside whatever threats awaited the sheriff jumped out fast and ran to the trooper first then saw there was nothing he could do for the man he went to his brotherinlaw sitting on a bench in front of the service station after a word or two with the man he returned to hannah and pellam he made a radio call to see about the ambulance and to call in several other state patrol cars and then he pulled his weapon out and pointed it toward pellam he arrested him for murder pellam blinked youre out of your mind werther was his typical calm the statue of reason you told me you werent where jonas barnes was killed this afternoon well i didnt know where he was killed i told you as best i could witness saw you standing over the body pellam closed his eyes and shook his head no i didnt see a body and it looked like you were holding a knife which is how barnes died you started to drag him away into a cave and then you realized somebody was nearby you ran who is this witness it was anonymous but he described you to a t hannah said it was taylor it had to be pellam pointed to the ground those footprints thosere just what he was wearing and he attacked me you say that i didnt see it he looked to hannah did you see it she hesitated he couldntve done it was he with you before she spoke pellam said no i was just coming back from the store up there and i got jumped then i found them why would i call if i was the guilty party so you wouldnt look guilty of course jesus christ taylors getting away turn around and put your hands behind your back pellam turned around and gave it ten seconds for werther to holster his weapon and get his cuffs out he fastdrew the colt from his waistband and touched the muzzle against the sheriffs belly pulled out the mans glock and flung it into bushes across the road the man gasped oh lord please i got a family and if you want to see emyoull hand the cuffs to your brotherinlaw i pellam stepped back and now aimed at rudy sorry but do it the big man hesitated looked at the gun then at the spreading lake of blood around the trooper he took the cuffs cuff him pellam then barked now i dont have time to wait the big man said i dont know how they work mister thiss going to mean nothing but trouble for you for a long long time pellam ignored the law enforcer and explained the cuffs to rudy everyone hannah included probably wondered why he knew this esoteric skill motioning rudy back pellam frisked werther and found plastic hand restraints he bound rudys wrists behind him then pointing his colt hannahs way he said im taking your car and you youre driving listen no im tired of listening pellam snapped move now pellam werther called you wont get but a mile troopers already have roadblocks up but he was gesturing hannah into the truck the big engine fired up and she skidded into the road the fixyourseatbelt light flashing but the chime disconnected hannah seemed like the kind of woman who couldnt be bothered with things like safety restraints pellam slipped the gun away sorry i didnt have any choice no she said the word mightve been a question i didnt kill barnes he said or anyone i didnt think you had whyd you kidnap me its not a kidnap its a borrowing i need your car and okay i needed a hostage she snickered bitterly he continued the only way to prove im innocent is to find your goddamn poet hes not driving out of here either hell be hiding out someplace the copsll be checking all the motels hell camp out somewhere caverns or someplace like that id guess you have any ideas me she snapped sounding insulted im not from here i was just passing through this fucking place when you rearended me most ive ever done in hamlin fore todays bought overpriced gas she took a turn at nearly fifty inducing a slight skid which she controlled expertly pellams knees banged the dash so she could reach the pedals shed moved the seats all the way forward she was staying off the main roads pellam thought for a minute ive got an idea he dug in his pocket for a business card the office of southeastern colorado ecological center was outside of gurney in an area that looked more like ski territory than desert pines brush grass and scrub oak or low trees that looked like they ought to be called scrub oak even if they werent the building seemed to include offices a small museum and an even smaller lecture hall a sign announced that people could learn about the relationship between carbon dioxide and our green friends next tuesday at pm pellam supposed the audience would be local he didnt know whod drive from mosby the next town north let alone denver three hours away for entertainment like this no troopers thats the good news pellam was looking over the three cars parked in the employee lot none of them were hybrids that was one of the ironies about the eco movement even many people in the field couldnt afford to practice what they preached he counted four bicycles though inside at the desk he found the woman whod been bicycling along route when pellam had slugged the rear of hannahs truck lis of lis and chris she looked up with her official visitorgreeting grin then blinked as a wave of recognition descended over her today the accident hey and no other reaction pellam looked to hannah and the meaning was so werther hasnt been in touch asking her to report a kidnapper and kidnappee sorry i forgot your names john and hannah pellam offered sure what can i do for you is this about the insurance no actually hannah said delivering the spiel theyd come up with in the car were trying to find that friend of mine was in the diner with me with the crewcut right he was talking about camping out maybe around some caverns in the area but my truck got fixed up sooner than i thought i want to get back to hamlin now hell want to come with me camping hm hope he brought his long underwear gets cold there so theres a place you think he might be lis pulled a map out of a rack on the edge of her desk she consulted it and pointed here id bet just past the old quarry it was about three miles or so from where they were appreciate that thanks pellam took the map he noted the price was two dollars he gave her a ten consider the rest a donation hey thanks she gave him a button that said earth lover this time pellam drove fast and just a bit recklessly hannah didnt mind one bit if anything she seemed bored she fished under the seat and found a small bottle of screwtop wine the sort they give you on airplanes she untwisted the lid with a cracking sound she drank half you want some pellam wouldnt have minded a hit of whiskey but his knob creek was history and there was nothing worse than airplane wine pass she finished it in ten minutes they were at the quarry a chainlink fence attempted to seal it off but even a sumo wrestler could have squeezed in through the gaps pellam looked at his watch it was nearly sixthirty he checked the gun once more thinking he shouldve brought more shells but too late for that you head on back tell em you escaped howll you get out ill have to call our friend werther whatever happens whether i find taylor or not im going to get busted the only differencell be how long it takes to recite the charges against me eerie as hell devils playground had been plenty spooky but the gurney quarry at dusk on a windy day ran a very close second of course some of that might have to do with the fact that there was possibly a killer wandering around here thered been one at the playground too it seemed but pellam hadnt known it that made a big difference in the failing light he could just make out the austere beauty of the place the chalky bonewhite cliffs the turquoise water at the base of the quarry going from azure to gray the sensual curves of the black shadows of the hills soon in the dark it would just be a maze of hiding places and traps the wind howled mournfully over the landscape thinking about taylor sheriff werther and about hannah he thought about ed some too he moved forward slowly nervously thumbing the hammer of the colt and not hearing a single boot on rock as a killer snuck up behind him an owl swooped low and snagged somethingmouse or chipmunkthen veered off into the sky the squeak had been loud and brief for half an hour he tracked along the ground here looking for suitable hiding places with the cowboy gun and the ambiance here he was thinking of his ancestor wild bill hickokjames butler no william was involved in any part of the name the gunslingermarshal had been murdered shot in the back of the head by a man hed beat at poker the day before but what specifically pellam was recalling was that hickok felt bad for jack mccall the murderer and gave him back some of what hed lost but mccall had thought the gesture condescending and that was the motive for the murder not cheating not arrogance a good deed pellam shivered in the wind he moved more slowly nowdusk was thick and moonlight still an hour away but he saw no signs of anyone but then a hundred yards away the flicker of light from one of the large caverns near the edge of the quarry pellam moved quickly toward the cavern where hed seen it dodging rocks and scrub oak and wiry balls of tumbleweed the cavern was in a cul de sac on one side a sheer wall rose fifty feet into the air its surface scarred and chopped by the stone cutters on the other side the quarry fell into blackness twenty feet from the entrance to the cavern the light seemed dimmer now moving closer listening moving again hell it was noisy this persistent wind like the slipstream roaring through the window of the winnebago that afternoon mountain truck or air he saw nothing other than the dancing light was it a fire or a lantern and then what the hell am i doing here a question that was never answered because at that moment a man stepped from the shadows beside him and aimed his pistol at pellams head drop that can i set it down no pellam dropped the gun it wasnt taylor the man had saltandpepper hair he was in his fifties pellam estimated and he was wearing khaki hiking clothes he gestured pellam back and retrieved the peacemaker into a cell phone he said hes here where is he that being the hitchhikerpoet though pellam knew the answer to the question the ramblin man was either dead or tied up somewhere nearby was this fellow in front of him with the gun chris the husband or partner of greenminded lis who had murdered jonas barnes near the devils playground todaypresumably because barnes was going to rape the earth by putting in a shopping center along the spur to the interstate if that was the case then he reflected that it was rather ironic that theyd nearly run her down as she was returning from her deadly mission and sure enough he heard a womans voice im here its me glancing toward the sound pellam realized that his theory about barness demise while logical was in fact wrong the murderer was not earthloving lis it was hannah billings pellam turned to the man with the gun and said so you must be ed does that thing work she asked her husband the man was looking over pellams peacemaker with some admiration nice i have a collection myself pellam had the bizarre thought that ed billings was going to start a genial conversation about antique firearms with a neutral glance pellams way ed walked into the cavern and hauled taylor to his feet he was tiedthough not ducttapedwhich would presumably leave a residue that crime scene folks could detect they were good at that pellam had served time the police were all over the evidence pellams extremely expensive defense attorney hadnt bothered to try to sever the head of that testimony what the hell is going on here he pleaded who are you pellam could picture clearly what these two had planned oh damn we got it wrong the sheriff would announce that pellam fellow wasnt guilty after all it was that weird poet who killed jonas barnes a hitchhiker what did you expect pellam tracked him downto prove he was innocentand the man jumped him they fought they died a shame the poor hitchhiker was as baffled as he was terrified pellam nodded was it the real estate hannah was ignoring him she was looking over the scenery approaches backdrops hell she looked just like a cinematographer blocking out camera angles but ed was happy to talk barnes had an option to buy the five hundred acres next to devils playground worth millions to whoever owned the land pellam said when the spur was finished ed billings nodded fast food gasoline and toilets that kind of describes our country doesnt it pellam was distracted since the mans guna very efficient glockmoved toward his abdomen now his groin theres no traditional safety on a glock you simply pointed and shot and the trigger pull was pretty light pellam felt certain parts south contracting but his estate could exercise the option no we know the wife she wasnt interested in real estate pellam said to hannah you killed barnes but you needed a fall guy so picked up the hitchhiker who wouldve taken the blame it was going to be easy kill the real estate guy plant some of his things on taylor a little dna it probably wouldve worked but thenah got it now then came the monkey wrench me hannah said after barnes was dead i saw you with that fancy video camera of yours i was afraid youd got me on tape and you undid my brake line he gave a brittle laugh sure you know carsthe way you talked rudy down with the brake lights incident you were going go through the wreckage and find the camera and tapes except you got to the switchback faster than i thought you would and rammed into me pellam understood change of plans sure you decided to go for cocktails in my camper you get the tapes when i went to the convenience store i got em she nodded presumably at the truck parked nearby but you still needed the fall guy pellam looked toward ed billings and you showed up to kidnap taylor dress up in his clothes and kill the trooper right and now i kill taylor and he kills me end of story hannah had lost interest in the narrative yeah she said shoot him im bored with all this crap i want to get home hamlin has a mall just like the end of a quentin tarantino film the filmmaker tended to fall back on the good old mexican standoff everybody pointing a gun at each other only one thing pellam said buying time whats that ed asked when does she shoot you me thats the scenario situations like this the girl sets it all up and then shifts the blame to her husband he takes the fall and she rides off into the sunset with the money a brief pause ed said you know the flaw in that you can only do it once and so far were worth more to each other alive he lifted the glock which was when a series of lights came on and voices started shouting police police on the ground drop the weapons and similar assorted cop phrases all enthusiastically punctuated pellam supposed that sheriff werther and the others were charging forward with their assault rifles and executing some nifty arrest procedures he couldnt say at the first flash of spotlight hed dropped to his belly and ducked another aspect of noir stories is that everybody has a gun and is always real eager to use it fifteen minutes later pellam was leaning against the side of sheriff werthers car he handed back the tracking deviceit looked like a garage door openerthat the man had slipped into his pocket at the sham arrest two hours ago in front of the winnebago worked pretty good pellam observed werther though winced looking at it truth be told seems there was only five minutes or so of battery left meaning pellam assumed that if they hadnt tracked him to the quarry in that time hed now be dead ah but considering that the sheriffs plan had been thrown together quickly it was understandable that thered been a glitch or two when pellam had been patched through to werther after finding the trooper dead and rudy injured the sheriff had explained that the medical examiner had given the opinion that the man had been stabbed by someone who was shortfive five or less given the angle of the knife wounds and remember somebodyd tried to drag the body to a cave the trooper thought it was that theyd been spotted fact is i decided they just werent strong enough those facts suggested the killer might be a woman he explained well there were two women having something to do with the case werther had said hannah and lis and each of them had a male partner who could be an accomplice so the sheriff decided to set up a trap to find out if either of them was the killer but he needed pellams help the location scout was supposed to let both hannah and lis know that he was searching for taylor turning himself into a fall guy whoever showed up at the quarry to kill him would be the guilty party taylor was at the hospital in redding for observation ed billings had whaled on him pretty bad when hed said goodbye to pellam a half hour before hed smiled ruefully and said hey quite an experience hm good luck with the poems the location scout had told him as he walked to the ambulance say werther now asked pellam did you get anybody on tape at devils playground pellam gave a sour laugh not a soul hm too bad though i dont suspect we need the evidence youve got property around there too dont you sheriff pellam asked wryly oh what rita was saying yeah i do vacation house that i rent out helps for some of the expenses my son has for his autistic grandchild pellam recalled you suspect me werther asked no sir never occurred to me it had okay now about that little matter you and i horse traded on its all taken care of the sheriff said thanks you earned it pellam then asked for his brotherinlaws phone number rudy he cant get your camper in shape until tomorrow this is about something else motion in the corner of his eye hannah billings was being led across the parking area in front of the quarry to a squad car she glanced his way a phrase came to pellams mind if looks could kill heres rita at the diner her name proudly stitched on her impressive bosom shes doing what she does best with diligence and polite mien and with no tolerance for nonsense from former movie directors turned location scouts from flirtatious poets from killers noir at heart from saints anybody she takes waitressing seriously pellam wasnt in the mood for frozen so hed arranged a private vehicle rental from rudy yes the bilegreen gremlin which was he knew a very underrated vehicleit could beat the pinto and vw beetle hands down at least with the optional fourspeed borgwarner hes finished a meatloaf dinner and orders pie with cheese he didnt used to like this combo but really who shouldnt it doesnt get any better than sweet apples and savory kraft hed go for a whiskey but thats not an option at the overlook so its coffee which is exemplary he gets a call on his motorola cell phone the director of paradice is ecstatic that pellam has secured a permit to shoot in devils playground after all howd you do it put my life on the line to catch a femme fatale he thinks earning sheriff werthers friendship and assistance in all things governmental here just pulled some strings ah i love stringpullers the director says breathily pellam thinks about suggesting a new name for the film devils playground but he knows in his heart that the director will never buy ithe just loves his misspelled title fine its his movie not mine as he ends the call pellam feels eyes aimed his way he looks up and believes that rita is casting him a flirt which is not by any means a bad thing then he glances at her with a smile and sees she is in fact looking a few degrees past him its toward a young man standing beside a revolving dessert display featuring cakes that seem three feet high hes looking back at her the nervous boy is handsome if pimply he sits down at the end of the counter isolated so he can gab a bit with her in private he also will pellam knows leave a fivedollar tip though he cant really afford it on a tendollar tab which will both embarrass and enthrall her aint love grand the pie comes in for a landing and pellam indulges its good no question his thoughts wander hes considering his time in paradice wait no in gurney and he decides that just like state route life sometimes is a switchback you never know whats going to happen around the next hairpin or whos who and whats what but other times the road doesnt curve at all its straight as a ruler for miles and miles what you see ahead is exactly what youre going to get no twists no surprises and the people you meet are just what they seem to be the environmentalist is simply passionate about saving the earth the hitchhiking poet is nothing more or less than a selfstyled soulmate of jack kerouac rambling around the country in search of who knows what the sheriff is a hardworking pro with a conscience and a grandkid who needs particular looking after and the sexy cowgirl with red nails and a feather in her stetson is exactly the bitch you pretty much knew in your heart shed turn out to be
