alex scarrow the eternal war prologue new york joseph olivera looked out of the small round window at the flooded cityscape of new jersey below the atlantic was gradually biting chunks out of the east coast of america leaving tall city blocks emerging in orderly rows from the glistening sea but ahead of him where the dropcopter was taking him he could see manhattan the island was still keeping its head above water levees built all the way round were going to keep it dry for a decade more or so the experts were saying the copter swooped in over the skyscrapers of manhattan and headed towards the distinctive convergence of streets that was times square on his left he spotted central park filled with abandoned cars stacked one atop the other and rusting like a childs forgotten toys joseph cursed his nerves he was trembling like a woman at the prospect of a facetoface meeting with the enigmatic man the legend roald waldstein i will not stutter i will make a good impression joseph vowed to himself once again that he wasnt going to stammer as he normally did under pressure he was going to avoid the tricky words those that started with a strong s joseph had rehearsed his greeting over and over it involved no s words he almost sounded normal the copter was now circling above the flat roof of the tallest building overlooking times square circling the helipad like a dog preparing to settle in its basket times square was a lifeless ghost of itself he could see pedestrians one or two electric buses a lot of places boarded up the levees may have been holding back the rising sea but joseph realized it was a futile endeavour this citys dying already the copter touched down gently and the pilot shut off the engine letting the rotors spin themselves out before pulling open the slide door and gesturing for joseph to follow him mr waldssstein is ssstaying here he uttered the marriott hotel mr waldstein lives here now he bought the hotel last year the pilot ushered him inside the building down a breezeblock stairwell to a small foyer a pair of swing doors ahead of them through those doors are his private quarters he lives entirely alone the pilot looked at him curiously you know youre very privileged to see him face to face he doesnt do that ever he lives in this hotel all on his own the pilot ignored his question a little word about meeting him he can come across as quite abrasive and rude that isnt his intention he just has no time for small talk ook dont try and flatter him either i wouldnt bother telling him hes a genius or a visionary or a a wonderful guy hes heard it all before about a billion times over youll just irritate him great there goes my rehearsed greeting most important of all do not discuss the incident with him the incident chicago joseph nodded of course he was talking about the chicago incident the day waldstein first came to public attention right ok joseph was trembling be polite and honest the pilot offered him an encouraging smile and youll do just fine he pressed an intercom button beside one of the doors mr waldstein i have dr joseph olivera here for you joseph looked in a small mirror on the wall beside the door he straightened his tie patted down a wayward coil of black hair and wished hed done a better job of trimming his dark beard this morning a small green light winked on above the double doors you can go through said the pilot joseph pushed the doors inwards and his feet clacked off linoleum on to soft carpet daylight flooded into a circular room from all sides joseph found himself squinting back at the glare he could just about make out a head and a pair of shoulders silhouetted against one of the large floortoceiling panels of glass that made up the walls of the penthouse joseph shaded his eyes with a hand as he walked slowly over mr waldssstein the room was large forty perhaps fifty feet in diameter his eyes beginning to adjust joseph noted a bed on one side a desk several cardboard boxes full of papers but nothing else a very empty space closer now he could see a little more detail the distinctive shock of wavy wiry uncontrollable hair the narrow shoulders it is an honour to meet you mr waldstein the silhouette shifted and turned hed been gazing out of the window at new york they say lady liberty walks on water now joseph had no idea at all what he meant by that his dumbfounded shrug gave him away waldstein chuckled sorry i confused you im referring to the statue of liberty liberty island and the plinth she stands on are all below sea level he spread his hands so it looks like shes actually walking on water ahhh joseph nodded i undersss s s joseph struggled with the infernal word he felt his cheeks burn hot as he wrestled with the s and shook his head angrily the word was left unfinished i am ss i apologize i have a problem with stammering waldstein gestured to a chair dont worry about it its not important take a seat joseph sat down waldstein flipped open a folder and flicked through some pages of printed paper dr jose olivera i anglicized my name to joseph mr waldstein it uh people assume theres a language barrier if your name sssounds foreign he scratched his chin selfconsciously i talk in english just as easily as my native spanish joseph nodded gratefully at being saved the trouble of speaking the word dr joseph olivera youre arguably one of the most knowledgeable people on genetically imprinted artificial intelligence be confident joseph i am it seems youve done very impressive work for some leading military contractors working on genetically engineered combat units being trialled right now by the us military right and it says here that you are a firm supporter of the antitimetravel movement i am waldstein sat forward his eyes unblinkingly on his id like you to tell me why waldstein was testing him anyone with a ssscientific background undersstands this temporal disss s joseph abandoned the word he took a breath to steady his nerves to settle his stammer time travel theory is potentially the most lethal technology ever invented theoretically it has the kinetic energy to be the end of well of everything waldstein said nothing he obviously wanted to hear more from him i believe mr waldstein very much sso that there are sssome things that should never be fooled around with in the pursuit of knowledge there are ssome doors that should remain firmly closed if there is a god if there is a god then this technology this knowledge should be for him and him alone i believe this he paused and realized the next thing he was planning on saying would be tremendously stupid hadnt that pilot specifically warned him not to mention this and now i am going to do just that his heart flipped in his chest what you did what happened in chicago in was very dangerous but all that you have done ssince that mr waldstein has been the right thing i believe your campaign to prevent further experimentation is all literally all that ssstands between mankind and joseph spread his hands as he fumbled to finish what word to use what word the end waldstein offered joseph nodded yes that is it yes the end waldstein was perfectly still his rheumy eyes giving away absolutely nothing a tableau of silence that seemed to be lasting forever joseph was beginning to wonder whether hed completely blown it by mentioning the chicago incident when waldstein finally stirred joseph he began i have a what shall i call it a project that i am working on and i would like you to be a part of it a project waldstein nodded something that requires absolute secrecy a project that is of immense importance josephs jaw dropped open work with you i i would be honoured to his mouth was flapping uselessly dont be so quick to accept joseph this is a oneway ticket absolute secrecy you would never be able to talk about this project to anyone ever you will be working with me in complete isolation waldsteins intense gaze was on him watching him closely searching his face for the slightest hint of doubt joseph once youre in on this if i decide i can completely trust you you must understand that therell be no walking away from this joseph wasnt entirely sure what no walking away actually meant an implied threat of some sort waldstein was a billionaire a powerful man not someone to cross not that it mattered betraying confidentialities stealing secrets for a commercial rival was of absolutely no interest at all to joseph his passion was his science a hunger for knowledge and this man waldstein the visionary the genius to have such a privilege to meet the legend himself and now the possibility of actually working alongside him there was never going to be a moments doubt not in dr joseph oliveras mind absolutely no doubt and yet burning curiosity prodded him to ask one last question is there anything you could tell me mr waldstein about this project the general nature of the work perhaps waldstein steepled his fingers beneath his chin and closed his eyes in silent contemplation joseph took the moment to look around the enormous room glowing from the flood of daylight streaming in through almost threesixty degrees of panoramic spotless glass this man with his portfolio of technology patents was fast on his way to becoming one of the richest men in the country and yet there was a simplicity to this room and its comforts a bed a desk a couple of chairs no more than that after all what more does a true genius want the mind itself is the palace where all the real treasures the works of art the indulgences exist presently waldstein lowered his hands and opened his eyes the work joseph is really quite simple it is the business of saving mankind from itself beyond waldsteins narrow shoulders joseph caught a glimpse of the mintgreen outline of the statue of liberty so faint she wavered and undulated in the distance what a mile away and yes waldstein was right she really did look as if she was standing directly on the water like jesus walking on water so tell me joseph will you help me help me save mankind from itself from the first moment hed stepped into this room and come face to face with this brilliant man there really was only ever going to be one answer joseph could give yes chapter new york sal stared at it through the grubby shop window she was standing outside weismans stage surplus on a pavement filled with bricabrac that the owner had allowed to spill outside an old fivefoot dimestore indian carved out of mahogany a treasure playchest full of childrens dressingup clothes dusty books stacked in greengrocers crates it was the store fifteen minutes away from their archway that shed used to find suitable clothes for liam bob and beckss recent mission that last visit she hadnt been sure this little place would have what theyd need to go about their business anonymously in the twelfth century but surprisingly among the laden racks of clothes reeking of mothballs and lavender soap shed managed to find enough bits and pieces for them to pass unnoticed as three grubby peasants a good place to use again shed noted as theyd made their way home through the backstreets of brooklyn with their medieval costumes in plastic bags but today she wasnt here looking through the dusty window at the pitifully sadlooking store display to find something for the others to wear she was here because of the thing she was looking at now the thing sitting on the rockingchair just inside the window a row of soft toys and dolls sat together on the worn wooden seat side by side like they were posing for a family photo several dolls a clown that would give any child nightmares an elephant with big ears a frog with stuffing bursting from a torn seam and one small skyblue teddy bear with a single button eye and the loose strands of stitching where another button eye must have been once i know you she whispered shed spotted this teddy bear the last time she was here but with one thing and another shed forgotten about it let it go now here she was drawn to the shop drawn to gaze at this sadlooking bear it reminded her of something a digistream show from her time maybe a character in an old cartoon something a wisp of a memory that vanished from her mind like a curl of smoke as she reached out to grasp it last night shed had that dream no not dream nightmare again the moment the old man foster had pulled her out from certain death to be recruited to the agency their apartment block one of the supertall glass and steel tenement towers that you saw everywhere in mumbai nowadays was on fire and its steel superstructure had been buckling preparing to collapse in on itself nowadays she checked herself she came from nowadays was where she was based her new home of sorts foster had plucked her from the very last seconds of her life given her a choice to work for the agency or join her family and die in the flames of the collapsing building some choice not that she actually got to choose dadda had chosen for her thrusting her towards the old man mama screaming and crying to hold her one more time stop it stop it sal bit her lip she didnt need to replay the memory again in her head it was all still fresh enough thanks that awful moment was done her parents gone dust and she was here in new york instead of mumbai all done or more accurately yet to be done yet to happen twentyfive years from now yet to happen that at least stole some of the sting of losing her parents of knowing that they died along with everyone else when that tower block collapsed in on itself because and this is the bit that really messed her head up they were alive right now at this moment in time they were children her age and they were yet to even meet each other that was going to happen in twelve years time they were going to meet at a consumer electronics show in new delhi both their families were going to thoroughly approve of the match and within the very same year sal was going to already be a bump growing in her mamas tummy and now she was looking at a small blue teddy bear that had absolutely no logical reason to be sitting here in new york in a bear unmistakably the same bear that shed seen her neighbours mr and mrs chaudhry youngest boy rakesh always clinging on to and slobbering over unmistakably the same teddy bear it was the very last thing shed seen from the final second of her old life of that teddy bear spinning head over heels into flames as the floor had suddenly collapsed beneath their feet and the building shuddered in on itself then shed awoken here in new york its the same im sure she whispered to herself a confused frown stretching from one brow to the other her eyes had never let her down she saw little things the tiny details the way the button eye drooped at an angle the stitching through only three of the four holes the bears pale blue material threadbare on the left arm but not the right as if the right had been replaced at a later time the tiny details her eyes and her mind were compulsively drawn to those sorts of things an obsessive habit she tucked her drooping fringe back up behind one ear and leaned forward until her forehead thudded softly against the shop window shed always been able to spot the little things that others missed seen patterns in a seemingly random mess thats why shed been so good at playing pikodu its the same she whispered how the shaddyah is that even possible her mobile phone suddenly vibrated in the pocket of her jacket she fished for it and pulled it out yeah had you forgotten maddy sighed impatiently forgotten what today this morning trip to the museum remember sal winced then bumped her head against the window again yes of course theyd been discussing it last night before turning in but with her dream no nightmare that horrible memory shed completely forgotten she cursed under her breath im on my way back meet us there if you like on the front steps of the museum right about an hour ok sal snapped her cell closed once again faintly amused at how oldfashioned it looked compared to the tbuds almost everyone back in mumbai had looped over their ears she looked once again at the blue bear the blue bear that shouldnt be there it stared back at her with one button eye almost challenging her to explain why not chapter new york maddy led the five of them through the swing doors into the museum of natural historys main entrance hall foster had brought them all here once before not long after hed recruited them maddy from a doomed passenger plane moments before it was due to disintegrate midair and liam from the sinking titanic it had been a field trip a reward for them a change of scenery a chance for them to see to reach out and touch the history they were now responsible for preserving both support units bob and becks eyed the enormous looming brachiosaurus skeleton stretching along the entrance hall with a detached cool their silicon minds categorizing the sights sounds and smells of the museum as either useful or irrelevant data liam by contrast chuckled with delight at seeing the dinosaur once again a class of elementary schoolkids was clustered around the long plasticbouldercovered display plinth on which the skeleton stood all carrying their activity clipboards faces craned upwards to look at the towering dark bones every mouth drooping to form a little o for orrrrrsome liam nodded a greeting at the old security guard standing beside the visitors book hey sam hows it going whuh the guard scowled at him bemused hang on how do you know my its all right said liam grinning we met a long long time ago so maddys eyes rolled behind her glasses oh grow up liam she whispered jabbing him in the ribs and steering him away from the guard who was still regarding them with an expression that was an even split between surly suspicion and genuine confusion last i heard we were meant to be a topsecret organization you know aww he wont remember i was dressed as one of em nazi fellas then and the timeline was erased added bob helpfully the guard will have no memory of the encounter because maddy raised her hands to shush them all right yes youre right bob she shook her head lets just generally try to be secret ok and while were at it liam try to behave like adults here liam nodded aye youre right sorry ok she sniffed wiping her nose shed picked up a cold from somewhere quite probably the dude whod been hacking and wheezing over the counter at pizzaland the other night giving them a little extra unaskedfor topping on their four seasons she felt like total crud ok todays about learning a bit more history she said snottily and we can all do with knowing a bit more but its meant to be fun too right we could all do with some time out of the arch sright said sal and you guys she said to bob and becks split up i dont want you two support units bluetoothing binary jibberjabber to each other all morning you should use this morning to do some more peoplewatching look and listen watch how people talk and move and stuff she glanced up at bob particularly you bob you still come across as a bit stiff and unnatural you need to learn how to chillax maddy watched bobs sevenfoot frame hunch uncertainly his thick brow arched and his mouth opened beauty and the beast he was seven foot tall three hundred pounds of muscle and bone a panzer tank in human form becks by contrast was half a yard shorter athletic and slight yet both had started out once upon a time as identicallooking foetuses growing in a tube of murky gunk bob was cocking his head like a dog puzzling over the term chillax never mind maddy shook her head just mingle a bit ok both support units nodded sternly right said maddy honking into a hankie right then meet in the cafe up on the first floor in say like two hours she tried a weary fluridden smile and hey you know have fun everyone maddy watched them disperse liam drawn towards the entrance of the naturalhistory hall and the dinosaur dioramas sal hovering a moment undecided before choosing to go to the history of native americans exhibit on the third floor and bob and becks looking for a moment like abandoned children before picking directions at random in which to saunter away she watched both go with the oddest feeling of motherly instinct for the pair of them bob still moved around with a machinelike gait and stonyfaced concentration that made him look like a neanderthal with an angermanagement problem while becks moved with ballerina grace equally lethal as a killing machine in an understated way weird how different they both were their bodies drawn from the same genetic material their minds both running the same ai operating system and yet their experiences their memories were varied enough to evolve two very different simulated intelligences it was a bit like being a parent maddy supposed watching both support units slowly grow up and become different personalities over time she watched becks as she paced thoughtfully down the hallway pausing every now and then to study an exhibit more closely you really have no idea how important you are do you becks the female support unit had data embedded in her silicon brain a minor sector of her miniature hard drive devoted to holding a secret their last crisis had involved being led to a medieval document the holy grail no less containing an encoded secret that dated from somewhere around the time of christ becks had been able to successfully decode the secret which it seemed had also rather annoyingly included a protocol that prevented her from revealing the message shed managed to decode and now whatever this big secret was it was locked away in a portion of her silicon mind maddy had tried asking her about what was in there but poor becks knew nothing she too was locked out of that portion of her own mind all she knew was that at some point a correct condition would arrive that would unlock the truth what maddy did know was this whatever truth was lurking in there it wasnt good news not good at all and it had something to do with a particular word pandora secrets and lies she hated them there was never any good that came out of a secret they were corrosive like another one a secret she was having to keep from liam and sal but liam in particular hes dying time travel was killing him every trip through the portal was corrupting his bodys cells ageing him before his time in a far more aggressive damaging way than the forcefield that looped them and their old archway field office back around those two days in that they were stationed in she sighed even in their eternal twoday bubble world the same cars the same pedestrians the same yellow cabs passing the end of their little backstreet at the same time every day even in this world frozen into two endlessly looped days time was passing for them shed noticed it and wondered if sal and liam had noticed it too not that either had said anything to her were all ageing she could feel it very subtly it didnt show not yet but she could feel it maddy had studied her face in the mirror of their latrine stared at her face wondering if she might detect the first faint signs of hairline creases in her skin but so far to her relief no as for sal she was perhaps a shade taller after all measuring the time theyd been in the archway together in a normal way they must have been living there now for what five months was it as long as that already five months and like any thirteenyearold sal still had a few more inches of growth left in her perhaps being the youngest of them the corrosive ageing effect of the archways displacement field would be kindest of all on her take the longest to make itself felt but liam poor poor liam she could see the signs of accelerated ageing in his face even if he hadnt noticed it yet or perhaps he chose not to his jaw and cheeks were less rounded now longer and leaner and around his eyes eyes that always seemed to be wide like saucers with genuine awe at something or pinched tight midlaughter laughing at the oddness of this bizarre life they were living those eyes eyes that had seen more than any one person should ever hope to see around them in his soft pale skin maddy could see the first hairline traces of age the very same hairlines that would one day be the folds of wrinkled skin on fosters ancient face yes another freakin secret liam and the old man who had recruited them they were one and the same person thats what foster had let slip to her she couldnt even begin to figure out how that worked was foster a version of liam from the far future his older self or some other parallel timeline oh god it made her head hurt thinking about it chapter new orleans abraham lincoln scowled at the flatboat captain but but this is no more than half the pay you promised me sir the captains darkskinned face buried beneath an even darker beard wrinkled up with amusement at the young mans indignant rancour his eyes glinted under his faded red woollen trappers hat and he laughed offering the young man a glimpse of half a dozen tobaccostained teeth you are too lazy monsieur no good to me abrahams jaw hung open curse you sir i worked my fair share non he shrugged you lazy no good to me not very good worker now listen here abraham balled his fists in frustration taking a step off the wooden dockside on to the bobbing prow of the flatboat piled high with bundles of beaver pelts the captain jacques short and stocky remained unfazed at the young beanpole of a man towering over him you get half no more he said calmly abraham felt his temper get the better of him he reached out and grabbed the collar of the little frenchmans chequered shirt in one bigknuckled fist curse you i earned the little man was quicker and more agile than his stocky frame would suggest and with a deft flick of his strong arms he pulled abraham off balance he stuck a booted foot behind his heels and shoved him backwards abraham pinwheeled with his arms his feet unable to step backwards to recover his balance he toppled over the side of the flatboat and into the mississippi river surfacing from the muddy water coughing and spluttering to hear the rest of the flatboat crew half a dozen lads his own age or thereabouts guffawing with laughter jacques bellowed at them to get back to work and they resumed tossing the bales of pelts from one to the other ashore on to the busy dockside abraham pulled himself dripping and still spluttering on to the wooden planks of the dock his hot temper doused for now by the cool river he turned to jacques the mans broad shoulders shaking with poorly concealed laughter it aint fair i tell you he pushed a tress of dark sopping hair out of his eyes and glared back at the captain hells teeth sir you are even paying a negro more than i jacques turned to look at the one darkskinned member of his crew he shrugged at that he a better worker than you boy abraham realized by the frenchmans undaunted wrinkled smile that he was not going to get anywhere with him well to hell with you then he spat crook you thieving piratical parasite he stood on the edge of the wooden jetty standing as tall and defiantly as his sixfootfourinch frame would let him i shall i shall go find other work then captain jacquess bearded smile only widened further as you wish he waved a hand at him good luck mon ami you will need it chapter new york liam found himself drawn back to the main hall and that splendid brachiosaurus skeleton erected in the middle of it he was staring up so long at the long arch of vertebrae that comprised its neck that he failed to notice another bustling class of elementary students gather round him just like the other class all carrying bright orange activity clipboards they cooed and orrrrred as the others had craning their necks to look up at the cretaceous leviathan a teacher or perhaps it was a museum tour guide was giving the children the vital statistics of the beast or as maddy would say they were getting a factup roamed the plains in small family groups of no more than a dozen well thats not true grunted liam under his breath a tiny boy beside him with thickframed spectacles and a buzzcut of blond hair that stood erect like a toilet brush looked up at him curiously their thick green hides most probably as thick as rhinoceros hides probably helped to keep them brown actually liam muttered again they were brown the boy tugged gently at his shirtsleeve and liam looked down at him he whispered something liam couldnt hear he squatted down beside the child whats that again fella the boy eyed the guide warily she was still addressing the assembled children i said he whispered again are you a a real dinosaur man liam laughed softly he realized the little chap was asking whether he was an expert a palaeontologist he stroked his chin thoughtfully for a moment well now yes i suppose you could say i am he whispered softly pointing up at the towering bones i seen these fellas in the flesh so i have and i can tell you theyre certainly not green behind thick milkbottle lenses the boys eyes widened you you seen dinosaurs for like real liam nodded his face all of a sudden very serious aye went back in a time machine so i did saw all sorts of dinosaurs including this big beastie he tapped his nose with his forefinger but thats super top secret young man all right the boy nodded so vigorously his glasses almost fell off his face ill tell you something else too we saw em in huge herds hundreds of the fellas all together in one place incredible sight so it was he winked at the boy not small groups like your teacher just said wow the boy gasped and like i said they were brown like dust you see because there wasnt such a thing as grass back then they were brown as camouflage against the dirt not green against grass see what i mean the boy nodded should i put that down on my activity sheet mister brown liam glanced down at the boys clipboard and saw a pop quiz one of the questions was about the supposed colour of their hides he nodded sure put down brown the boys forehead furrowed with a difficult dilemma but er i might not get a tick for that liam shrugged aye maybe so but at least youd be right eh he felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up to see becks standing over them her hair tied back in a tidy ponytail and wearing a plain dark woolly jumper that covered the still very visible scar tissue up her left arm liam you are aware maddy would not approve of this she cautioned ahh and you see this girl whispered liam to the boy the boy looked warily up at her stern expression she saw these dinosaurs too smacked one of em right on the nose so she did actually started a stampede this person does not have security clearance to know about our operations becks uttered firmly i recommend that you stop liam smiled right yes of course he glanced at the boys clipboard brown ok he flicked him a conspiratorial wink and stood up whats up becks it is time now she replied uh she nodded at a large digital clock above the entrance it was a couple of minutes to eleven time for us to drink coffee chapter new orleans abraham lincoln staggered across the bar knocking several tables along the way leaving a trail of spilled whisky and snarled curses behind him as he stepped outside into the evening the paltry sum of money with which that bloodsucking little french trapper had paid him off was all gone now tossed down his throat during the afternoon the evening was still busy with dock workers hefting bales of hides and pelts off a row of flatboats little more than rafts made from logs lashed together with a rudimentary shack in the middle across the river he could make out the chimney stacks of several paddle steamers impatiently puffing clouds into the crimson sky their several decks were lit by gas lamps to his whiskysoaked mind they looked like giant wedding cakes lined with candles floating on the glistening mississippi quite something to behold new orleans was alive and bustling with activity even now with the sky smearing from afternoon to evening to night by contrast back in new salem the hearth fires would be burning and thick log doors battened firmly shut for the night this is the place he wanted to be needed to be a young man like him with a keen mind and a quick wit could make his fortune right here among all this this opportunity that was it even the air in new orleans tasted of opportunity if a fellow was clever used his mind he could make his fortune on these streets along this dockside abraham knew he had the kind of instinct and smarts to make himself rich rich beyond the dreams of a backwoods boy he just needed that first little chance to get him going enough money to get his first enterprise under way not that he knew yet what his first moneymaking scheme was going to be and of course hed just gone and spent all the money he had on an illtempered afternoon of drinking now he was no better than the dozen other drunks tottering up and down the busy twilit thoroughfare crossbreed trappers and frontiersmen in tattered deerskins even one or two pawnee unused to the bottled whitemans curse sprawled unconscious amidst stacked sacks of grain and now him too swerving to and fro among businessmen wearing stovepipe hats and their purselipped wives in shawls and bonnets their bags and possessions behind them on the backs of silent sullenfaced slaves thatll be me one fine day he mused drunkenly a gentleman a rich successful businessman maybe even a politician one day he grinned like a fool as he considered that prospect stepping off the woodenslat pavement on to the dirt of the busy street lined with deep ruts carved by the cartwheels of an almost constant train of heavily laden wagons perhaps even president one day he belched a long and loud croak that made heads up and down the thoroughfare turn it was in fact so satisfyingly loud that he heard the lady in her lace bonnet cry out in disgust so loud he didnt hear the thundering of hooves bearing down on him nor the clatter of beer barrels rolling off the back of the riderless cart nor the scream from another woman as she realized what was moments away from happening abrahams whiskyaddled mind had just about enough time to process one final thought as the enormous delivery cart careering down powder street behind a team of wildeyed and terrified horses loomed up behind him and sadly his last thought wasnt anything noble or profound nor farseeing it was nothing more than this well now sir that was a mighty fine belch chapter new york so how does foster look maddy rephrased sals question yes sal nodded i mean is he really dying foster looks no different to the day he walked out on us maddy took a bite out of her bagel still chewing she continued not a single day older which of course he isnt because for him every time i go see him in central park its the same day he walked out she finished chewing and swigged some coffee itll be us that look different to him i guess not the other way round aye nodded liam weve been together a while now seems like weve been together an eternity though seventyfive cycles said bob one hundred and fortynine days five months added sal she looked up at liam and maddy jahulla that makes me fourteen now my birthday it was only four months away when i i was meant to die she didnt need to elaborate on that they all knew each others recruitment tales i missed my fourteenth birthday she added quietly becks cocked her head and the appropriate smile for the occasion flashed across her face as sincere as a screensaver many happy returns sal vikram liam put down the chocolate muffin hed been peeling out of its paper cup hang on ive missed my seventeenth birthday he reached out and squeezed sals hand so a happy birthday to us both so it is yeah she mumbled yay for us uhh so maddy sighed this was meant to be fun not a freakin funeral she turned to sal well get a cake on the way home get some candles on it and you can blow em out and and well play some party games or something when we get back how does that sound she nodded the start of a smile back on her face id like that party games said bob please explain how to subcategorize party games in reference to games maddy shrugged theyre just stupid games you dont play to win you just play because its a laugh like i dunno like charades or guess who or twister the more you mess things up the more fun it is the support units looked at each other silently discussing how to make sense of that maddy chuckled twister oh man you two meatbots havent lived until youve played a game of twister she realized sal and liam were giving her the same bemused look seriously you guys never heard of it either liam pursed his lips is it a bit like chess what no fidchell brandub whuh never heard of it no its kinda like tafl macrae no no nothing like that its like pog ma gwilly will you shut up a sec she said exasperated im trying to explain it her eyes suddenly narrowed with suspicion hang on pog ma gwilly you you just made that up didnt you liams goodnatured smile widened to a confessional grin she was about to reach across the small round table and playfully cuff his ear when she noticed sal staring far too intently at the cafes hot snacks menu card sal you ok her brows were locked firmly together liam tapped her arm you that hungry she shook her head slowly thirtyseven items on the snack menu uhh all right liam looked at maddy she shrugged okaay that was a minute ago now sal continued there are only thirtysix she looked up at them something just vanished off the menu just like seconds ago liam looked down at the menu card hed been studying earlier hey hang on its not there any more maddy leaned over what isnt he shook his head i was going to order it and its well its gone sal had the menu memorized almost word for word the lincoln burger thats the very one beef patty she continued her eyes closed reciting the missing description cheese slice covered in thick patriot sauce with freedom fries on the side aye thats what i was going to order sal maddy reached out for her arm did you just feel a time ripple she nodded i uh i think so i wasnt sure i thought it was just me feeling sick or something no breakfast but then i saw the burger was gone they looked at each other in silence for a moment until finally maddy bit her lip we should head back to the arch check on this the other end of a minute later the five of them were hurrying down the north american history hall weaving their way past elbowhigh clusters of noisy children babbling with excitement clipboards underarm as they raced from one exhibit case to another on a fact hunt could we not get one of them yellow taxis back liam called ahead his jaw still working hard on the last of his triplechoc muffin i got a stitch in me side already subway maddy replied over her shoulder itll be quicker come on they were near the end of a long glass display case containing mannequins wearing uniforms from the civil war when bobs voice boomed down the hall attention maddy stop she stopped in her tracks and looked back down the hall along with every last child now frozen midhunt silent eyes locked on bobs towering form he calmly raised an arm and pointed towards sal standing beside the glass case staring in at something among the mannequins in civilwar costume maddy quickly made her way through the confused children and an elementary schoolteacher regarding them with a bemused expression whats the matter sal she said drawing up beside her what do you see sal slowly raised her arm and pointed at the back wall of the display between a mannequin wearing the braided and buttoned darkblue uniform of a union general and one wearing a similarly ornate tunic in grey she was pointing at an oil painting hanging on the back wall and thats changed too she uttered maddy looked at the face in the painting the famous painting every schoolkid in america knew by sight no longer was there that gaunt face the dark eyes hidden beneath a thunderously brooding brow and that distinctly mennonite beard instead she could see a forgettablelooking balding and portly man with a salt and pepper moustache and a rosy bulbous nose beneath the painting was a plaque president john bell oh my god she uttered wheres president lincoln chapter new york they were back in the archway less than half an hour later still huffing and puffing after the jog from marcy avenue subway station liam whimpering about his aching side i shouldnt have rushed that muffin he groaned pitifully to himself on the screen in front of them computerbob their fieldoffice system ai was already spitting out the data pulled in from the external internet feed hes just vanished from history said sal well from civilwar history maddy replied as she skimread the dossier being assembled fact by fact on the screen nothing in there nothing at all about him this lincoln fella was quite important wasnt he maddy turned to liam only the most important figure in the war the most freakin important he held the union together she saw one of his eyebrows flicker upwards a sign that he hadnt a clue and was hoping she was going to elaborate cmon youve been reading up a lot recently right hitting the history books she glanced at a pile of books stacked high beside his bunk bed so please tell me you know which guys im talking about liam frowned for a moment then grinned the northern fellas them people in blue right yes abraham lincoln was the president of she sighed them people in blue otherwise known as the north the union the point was he kept them together kept them fighting led them to victory but now hes gone from civilwar history sal chewed a fingernail absently thats going to mean a big wave then uhhuh five minutes from now we could be looking out at a world in which the confederates won she glanced sideways at liam them fellas in grey computerbobs dialogue box appeared on screen maddy i have completed a scan of all the civilwar data retrieved and there are no references to abraham lincoln in this time period to maybe he died said sal you know before he shouldve hmmm thats a possibility ok then computerbob look earlier go earlier she rubbed her eyes already irritable and red from her cold beneath her glasses we have data on him from our own internal historical database right of course so when and where was he born february hardin county kentucky do we have a proper detailed biography all his movements from childhood right up to becoming president yes maddy i have detailed files she had a pretty foggy highschool memory of lincoln theyd studied him and the civil war for a semester boring stuff some of the time but it got interesting when the country started to pull itself apart over slavery and the war began he travelled around a bit if i remember correctly right bob correct his family moved several times then when he was a young adult he left home and she waved her hand at the webcam to stop him right then all right ok this is what we do she pushed her glasses back up her nose i want you to search every external database from his birthdate onwards i want you to focus your datatrawling on the places he was supposed to have lived in kentucky wherever else he went dig into their newspaper archives a lot of that old stuff is digitized hold on liam sat back in one of the office chairs dug his heels into the concrete floor and pulled himself on squeaking castor wheels closer to her the world out there doesnt care a jot for mr lincoln now hes a mr nobody right were now in a timeline where he never became a famous president so thered not be detailed biographies an the like out there on the man surely true maddy pulled on her lip but i remember reading he was quite i dunno quite driven he had an uneducated father and lived quite poor if i recall in a log cabin and sort of hated all that wanted to better himself so all right somethings happened things have changed and he never got to be president but maybe he managed to become a local mayor or something or a successful businessman something that might have left a small mark on the world she looked up at bob and becks in hope of a word of support but both of them were silently blinking networking with computerbob and helping the system with the data shovelling so she continued if he became a local bigwig somewhere maybe he opened some sort of i dunno some shopping mall shopping mall ahhh you know what i mean trading post she shook her head irritably or opened some hospital wing or some charity school for orphaned kiddies or made some small town independence day speech or something point is these places all had their own little twosheet gazette their own newspaper and these days all that kind of stuff is up on the net as scanned data she turned towards the webcam you got that bob yes maddy we are already searching do you think well have any more changes asked liam the world doesnt look so different to me well actually it looks no different to me maybe that missing beefburger and the changed painting is all were going to get she shook her head that cant be all liam you cant just remove a guy like lincoln from history and it amounts to no more than the change of a snack menu therell be more changes she stopped midsentence just a sec she dug a hand deep into her jeans and fumbled for something she pulled out a crinkled ball of paper and quickly unfolded it liam recognized it as a fivedollar bill look hes still on there she said turning the note round so that he and sal could see lincolns face staring out at them with a surly scowl theres your answer liam she said therell be more ripples history hasnt finished fidgeting around to get rid of lincoln yet fidgeting around maddy realized how oddly human that sounded as if time itself was some curmudgeonly old college lecturer who grumpily decided when he was good and ready to sit down to rewrite the history books this means another someone trying to mess things up said sal doesnt it liam nodded another kramer maddy shrugged not necessarily another kramer not long after theyd been recruited theyd been thrown in the deep end having to deal with a nutjob from the future whod thought it a great idea to help the nazis win the second world war but if lincolns destiny has been mucked up said liam thats changed history that means i know maddy sniffed i know it means another idiots fooling around with time travel she puffed her cheeks all right so heres our plan then well find him out there somewhere a driven character like lincolns going to have made his mark one way or another he may not have ended up being the president but a guy like that will have made his mark in some other way we find him then maybe well find whoevers just stepped back into the past and changed lincolns destiny she looked at liam even managed a laugh not bad really given she felt like death warmed up and you can tell whichever timetravelling moron it is whos done this that theyre in big trouble chapter new york it took three hours before computerbobs dialogue box blinked on to the screen and becks and bob eventually stirred from the motionless trance theyd been in liam came and shook maddy awake she stared up blearyeyed at liam fumbling for her glasses they done aye wheres sal viewing bobs with her viewing maddy knew what he meant sal was sitting out in the middle of times square watching for the subtle further ripples of a time wave any more changes she asked sitting up and swinging her legs wearily over the side not that me or sal have noticed she shuffled over to the computer desk feeling worse than ever if it was even possible despite having managed to grab some quilttime she squeezed past becks still standing like a sentinel her eyelids flickering and twitching like the wings of a hummingbird she slumped down at the desk just as she heard the echoing hiss of their kettle stirring to life liam bless him was making maddy her wakeup brew coffee black strong and treaclesweet hey bob what have you got for me hello maddy we have collated all the data hits for abraham lincoln dating from february there are data references to the name most of these will be in reference to other people of the same name right so can you filter it down to occurrences in places where lincoln was supposed to have lived affirmative i have done this there are data entries in relation to the following locations hardin county kentucky perry county indiana macon county illinois coles county illinois new salem sagemon county illinois new orleans springfield kentucky washington dc springfield kentucky washington dc right and some of those hits will be him some will be other guys of the same name affirmative there is one data entry i calculate to be of particular relevance do you wish to see it yeah put it up one of the monitors on her right suddenly stopped relaying a realtime feed of wall street stock values and instead displayed the sepiacoloured scan of an old newspaper she saw the papers title banner the new orleans bee wednesday april so which bit am i looking at liam placed a steaming mug of coffee on the desk and settled in a chair beside her thanks she wheezed i will enhance the image the scanned image zoomed in on a short article at the bottom of the page no more than half a dozen sentences in print that was almost as faint as a watermark the magnified image was horribly pixellated like trying to read words cobbled together out of lego bricks sheesh can you do anything with the image maddy wrinkled her nose as she squinted at it its just pixel garbage just a moment i shall aliasaverage the pixels and apply character analysis there will be a significant margin of error which i can attempt to contextually interpret for you just do what you can bob she said holding a tissue to her face and honking noisily again into it oh crud i hate feeling all blocked up an rough she muttered the scanned image blurred softened then hardened again as if a cinema projectionist was messing around with the lens then a small highlighted green square appeared in the top lefthand corner of the image grabbing a portion analysing it then moving along and highlighting another portion to the right step by step it moved right across the image stepped down a row and began on the lefthand side once more on another screen a document opened and words began to appear liam leaned forward and began to read it aloud yesterday in the evening a second fatal collision occurred on powder street in as many weeks a delivery cart belonging to costen brothers distillery was responsible for crushing to death in a most horrendous manner a young dock worker the ravaged body was identified by a flatboat captain as a crewman he had discharged earlier in the afternoon abraham lincoln of new salem there was a little more to the article an editorial rant about the increasing business of the thoroughfares beside the landing docks and the need for some order to be brought to the chaos of foot and horse traffic sharing the same avenues liam looked at her do you think she honked again into a handkerchief shedding shreds of tissue on to the desk i fig we definubbly got a winner liab she huffed breathlessly her blocked nose whistling unpleasantly like a flute bost definubbly midday in times square sal sat on her favourite bench spattered with a pebbledash of pigeon droppings and pink globules of discarded gum bob sat beside her taking up the space two other people could easily have used you are different though bob different from when you were first birthed she turned to him do you feel different in there in your mind she said pointing to his bristly head maddy had insisted on shaving his head back down to the nut the other day to be fair she was right bob was beginning to look ridiculous coarse and dark his hair should have been weighed down by its length instead it seemed to perch on his head like a large spongy muffin no way he was going to be able to go on missions looking like a sevenfoot mushroom bob was giving her question some thought i have accumulated large amounts of sensory data this has altered my operating parameters he looked down at her these are my memories memories huh she smiled memories you sound sort of almost proud of them he cocked his head they are my mission log they are performance data they are you she finished for him they are you they are what make you you thats what my dadda used to say what makes us who we are is all the things we experience she reached out and patted one of his thick arms affectionately youre so much more now more than you were you big lump more than my operating system she nodded does that make you feel proud do you feel different she shrugged do you even feel i have sense receptors in my dermal layer no i mean in your heart i mean emotions do you ever feel things like scared or happy or sad things like that he scanned his memories sorting through trillions of bytes of data fleeting images of stormtroopers and giant airships prison camps and castles and a million little interactions with liam oconnor i have experienced sensations of attachment attachment do you mean affection what for liam affirmative he is my mission operative what about us me and maddy you like us his expressionless cold grey eyes burned down at her as he sorted through data to find an answer i also feel similar sensations for you and maddy carter she hugged his arm oh you big chutiya bakra a thought occurred to her what about becks he frowned now there was a challenging question for him to chew over his eyes blinked as he worked hard for an answer finally he spoke she is a part of me and i am a part of her but do you like her do you have sensations of attachment to her i figure shes like a sister or something sister he considered that for a moment a sibling yes i will consider the question he said she suspected that was probably going to keep him occupied for the rest of the day sal shook her head and giggled at him then hunkered down cradled her chin in her hands and resumed watching the world going by and then it happened just as she was looking right at it before her very eyes the sign above a fastfood restaurant flickered and changed for a moment she thought she might have been gazing at an led screen that had finally decided to move on to the next picture in its image list but it was just a scuffed plastic sign above the glass windows of a fastfood bar one moment it had said kentuckystyle fried chicken the next it simply read fast fried chicken she cursed under her breath pulled out her mobile phone and dialled maddy yeah she answered on the third ring i think i just saw a no im certain i just saw another time ripple maddy a small one you want to know what it was its ok sal its ok we think weve got it nailed abraham lincoln went and got himself squished by a cart in you better get yourselves back here asap if thats another change you just spotted then maybe the big time wave is coming right on its tail ok she snapped the phone shut and stuffed it back in her pocket back home bob she punched his arm time for us to get busy again chapter new york can i go this time maddy looked at sal no thats not your job but i always end up in here i never get to see anything interesting maddy shook her head but why too dangerous maddy mentally winced at that that was a lame reason the poor girl had been in almost as much danger here in as she might have been with liam in the past and sal could see that too come on maddy its just as bad here weve had mutants soldiers those weird dinosaur things youre telling me here is safe she shook her head that is totally shaddyah liam and the two units were listening to the row as they were getting dressed maddy closed her eyes tiredly she didnt need this how could she explain to sal that every trip through a portal could quite possibly strip another year or five off her natural lifespan that the bombardment of tachyons the immeasurable forces of chaos space had a lethal effect on the body aged it corrupted it eventually killed it how could she explain that to her with liam just yards away unaware that soon far too soon he was going to be a dying old man but then she and sal were experiencing a milder form of that contamination themselves living as they did in the archways resetting temporal bubble werent they it was coming for all of them one day death something her cousin julian had once said were all dead the moment were born just some of us get there faster than others prophetic really since he died not so long after lost in the rubble of the world trade centers north tower please said sal i want to see some history too were all dead at least this wasnt a huge jump a hundred and seventy years nothing really in the grand scheme of things she supposed the shorter the jump the less the damage their jump to sunday a while back had probably been little more a dose of poison than the normal tuesdaynight bubble reset she sighed why not living here in this archway like mole people wasnt really the sort of dream life a person would want to last forever anyway one trip into history this trip a relatively safe trip why not all right she sighed sal yelped and clasped her hands together with excitement they had some clothes in the archway that they used to travel back to their drop point in san francisco the drop point was a stash of supportunit embryos held in suspended animation in the safety deposit box of a bank that was due to be reduced to rubble and ashes by the infamous and imminent californian earthquake with a little customization and by losing the headgear hat fashion seemed to move along far more quickly than other wear they could pass as s clothes maddys corset and skirts might be a size too big for sal but nothing that would attract any attention liam was already nearly good to go in his brown jacket and waistcoat bob wore a striped linen shirt and scruffy cotton trousers becks was almost in the corset becks you can stay sals taking your place she stopped fussing with the ties at the front is this advisable maddy shrugged its new orleans whats to worry about anyway shes got bob and liam with her the support unit dutifully nodded and began to undress maddy pointed towards the small archway where their bunks stood there was a drape that could be pulled across for a little privacy best you do that over there becks last thing she needed was liam getting all hormonal sal you understand this is yuh maddy bit her lip crud this is going to be awkward this is a time of slavery sals eyes were drinking in the details of the dress and its corset eager to get her hands on it to try it on yeah i know she replied absently well your uh you know your skin is like dark sal looked up at maddy what maddy shuffled uncomfortably im just saying you may be treated you may be called im not black if thats what youre saying no but what im trying to shaddyah dark means im african now you can lump us all together simply because were not white her brow furrowed with irritation im asian she shook her head and rolled her eyes and turned to follow becks over towards the bunks the drape swished across the archway behind them i just meant people back then might not make the same distinction replied maddy her voice fading to nothing nice one maddy uh ok she said stepping back towards the computers right liam bob the candidate timestamp is april and im going to drop you in a few hours before the abraham squashing incident the paper said evening so i guess that means about five or six youll arrive at four in the afternoon and ive found a street map of new orleans dockside area circa which i guess is close enough were opening a window in what looks like a storage warehouse of some kind she checked one of the screens they had a density probe testing the location for obstructions anything on the density probe computerbob negative nothing has passed through the timestamp location she nodded satisfied with that it seemed a quiet enough spot young abe lincoln gets flattened on powder street which according to the map weve got here is just a minute or two from your drop location its one of the main streets im sure youll find it easy enough just follow the smell of horse poo liam chuckled even in his time every busy thoroughfare in cork was dotted with little molehills of manure waiting to be flattened by a cartwheel or eventually scooped up by a streetsweeper how do we know which fella to save he asked i mean i think i know what he looks like as an old man a beard and big bushy eyebrows an the like but hes young now aye we got a picture of him as a young fella no theres none not at the age he is now information said bob flexing inside his shirt it should have been loose on him but in fact he barely fitted inside it celluloidbased portraits were not in common use at this time even though photographic technology existed right said maddy and at this point in time no ones gonna think this guy is going to be someone important hes a total nothing not worth a picture she shrugged well not yet anyway she glanced at a page of data that computerbob had compiled what we do know is he was described as very tall and thin and scruffy she pointed to a screen showing a jpeg image of lincolns presidential portrait and check out those freakin brows i mean it looks like hes got a small mouse living above each eye even as a young man thats got to be a feature to look out for right bob nodded information cranial growth variation around the orbital sockets is limited after a human skull reaches maturity whereas certain other features nasal cavity and cartilage tissue soft tissue around the ears the lower jaw continue to maddy waved him silent which means even as a kid he probably always looked miserable she wiped a runny nose anyway just keep your eyes peeled for a large cart loaded with barrels of booze and costen brothers distillery painted on the side any tall miserablelooking idiot looks like hes going to step out in front of it you grab him simple liam lifted his chin to adjust his collar button sounds easy enough eh bob bob rumbled an acknowledgement howre you doing sal maddy called out almost her voice came back brightly through the drape the unintended racial slur already completely forgotten by the sound of it its just a bit big on me i am tightening the corset to its smallest setting to compensate added becks hey maddy frowned hey no dont say it like that like im a buttertroll or something she caught her reflection in the perspex displacement tube ok so im not just some skinnbones clothes hanger she muttered to herself completed said becks and pulled the drape to one side liam held back a gasp and maddy found herself nodding approvingly now that looks better on you than a hoody right sal ran her hands over the corset and skirts feels so weird she grinned i feel like a ugh jahulla i know this sounds pathetic but i feel like a princess maddy clapped her hands i know its kinda cool isnt it she cast a glance at liam and bob good you all look the part now undress and bag your clothes its a wet departure ten minutes later liam sal and bob were treading water in their underwear together in the displacement tube so a nice and easy mission this time said maddy huddled on the top step of the ladder just find young abe and grab his collar before he gets himself turned into lincoln ketchup you ok in there sal she nodded her teeth chattering guess im ggetting a bit nervous nnow youll be just fine remember youve done this before its no big deal its the white sstuff that sscares mme chaos space liam shook his head ahh youll be through it in a heartbeat so you will nothing to it could you hhold mmy hand liam nodded i spose sure if you like uhh its probably best if you dont said maddy her eyes quickly met liams and after a few seconds he nodded he knew what she was thinking after all he was the one whod seen it up close fused bodies bodies turned completely inside out very messy hed told maddy about it but not sal it was a grisly detail she didnt really need to hear and anyway it only happened rarely maddy had no idea what caused it but when foster had insisted liam had to float on his own first time round well there was almost certainly a very good reason for that works best if youre all floating freely sal but look she said before sal could ask why youre going together the other two will be right next to you and as liam said its like a second no more ill sing you a ditty said liam so youll hear me in there in the chaos soup there you go maddy smiled that is if you can bear to listen to his howling she started to descend the ladder right we should get going guys weve been more than lucky with only small ripples so far lets not push our luck at the bottom she checked to confirm the displacement machine was green right across the board then called across to becks punch in a thirtysecond countdown yes maddy thirty seconds as of now return window at seven in the evening she reminded them and remember the usual backup windows after that if you miss it she could see sals face through the scuffed plastic wideeyed with growing panic beside her kicking water and still holding on to the top of the tube was liam saying something encouraging to her and then bob keeping afloat with strong powerful kicks all three of them holding ziploc plastic bags containing their clothes itll be fun sal she called out over the increasing hum of the displacement machine enjoy seeing with your own eyes sal flashed her an uncertain smile and a wave she stepped back into the middle of the floor as beckss countdown reached ten right hands off everyone she shouted liam reluctantly let go and began thrashing furiously and ineffectually to keep his head above water the other two let go and managed to tread water calmly on five seconds maddy bellowed over the rising pitch of the machine for them all to grab some air and duck their heads under the water and on one they were all completely submerged a crescendo of channelled and suddenly released energy merged with the boom of flexing perspex and in the blink of an eye the three of them were gone chapter new orleans they were standing on powder street nearly a whole hour before six watching the dock workers industriously unloading boats of all different sizes watching horsedrawn carts clattering up the busy thoroughfare although that snippet of digitally archived news from a longdead new orleans newspaper had claimed the event had occurred in the evening it would be foolish to assume that meant for certain it happened after pm liam told them that in his time people still generally didnt carry clocks or watches time was less specific youd arrange to meet someone in the afternoon not at pm precisely as he noticed most modern new yorkers seemed to do just keep looking said liam craning his neck to look up and down the busy street tall grumpylooking fella affirmative sal nodded but then it was far too easy to be distracted by the sights and sounds going on around her nothing can prepare you for what its like sal actually standing in the middle of a piece of history thats what maddy had told her after her trip to san francisco and she was right she and dadda had once gone along to a technology expo while theyd been in shanghai on one of her pikodu tournaments one of the last as it happened international relations between china and india were beginning to chill then a sign of the troubled times ahead at the expo she had tried out a prototype of a thing they were calling a reality hat it looked like a shower cap with marbles stuck all over it shed put it on and almost instantly she found herself smelling things hearing things that werent there and then finally seeing herself in a roman street of course nothing was quite right the scene was computer graphics very realistic but still there were little jerks in the animation here and there that gave it away the visuals the smells the sounds were being transmitted into her head stimulating the senses she had been stunned by how convincing an experience it had been but standing here now in history for real the reality hat seemed like a shallow experience by comparison hold your horses muttered liam look at that fella over there he said pointing along the street on the far side bob and sal turned to look across the thoroughfare they could make out a tall thin man in a scruffy threadbare coat a battered felt hat stuffed thoughtlessly askew on a mop of dark unruly hair he had emerged from a tavern quite clearly the worse for wear he stood or more accurately swayed outside the door surveying the busy street in front of him jayzus hes had a few liam turned to bob do you think thats our fella bobs eyes narrowed for a moment i have an approximate height match and he does look a bit like the lincoln in the painting said sal he certainly had the thunderous scowl the dark brooding eyes hooded by a frown that all but hid them in the fading light of the afternoon right good enough for me said liam lets go grab him before he does something foolish liam hopped off the storefront porch theyd been standing on he waited until there was a gap in the horsedrawn traffic before leading them cautiously across the muddy street lincoln hitched up his trousers hanging loose round his waist he should have spent his money on some decent food not on drink he shrugged at that he could find something to steal to eat the docksides were an easy place to forage for food there was usually a dropped sack here or there a man could always work for a cooked meal even if he couldnt find paid work a man might find himself sleeping rough under the stars here in new orleans but hed never find himself starving lincoln belched a real howler that turned heads up and down the street and solicited tuts and muttered disgust from a portly gentleman and his sourfaced wife as they walked past him he tipped his hat and grinned at them before congratulating himself on a worldclass burp he ambled drunkenly into the street his long legs feeling as unstable beneath him as a pair of circus stilts he was just about to take another stride forward when he felt something grasp the back of his coat collar and suddenly found himself lurching backwards flying through the air and landing heavily on the ground it took him several moments to comprehend the fact that he was lying on his back in the dirt and looking up at salmonpink clouds lit by the setting sun and three silhouetted heads peering curiously down at him what in tarnation who the he started to blurt mr lincoln asked one of them an irishman by the sound of his accent lincoln groggily struggled to get himself up on to his elbows now who who ishhh the infernal ffool of a halfwit that that are you abraham lincoln lincolns eyes struggled to focus on the face that had said that and and who the ddevil wishes wishes to know a much deeper voice rumbled please confirm your name lincolns eyebrows arched as he took in the sight of bob good ggrief ssshir are you a man or a some sspecies of a grizzly bear shaddyah liam check out the mess that wagons making jayzus thats a pretty pickle cmon lets get him up lincoln heard the irish voice say he felt a strong pair of hands grabbing him roughly i am ferpectly i mean p puh perfectly capable of shhhtanding up by my by myself yesh indeedy now unhand me ddirectly he felt the hands release him slowly with a lot more effort than hed originally thought hed require he managed to pull himself back on to his wobblingstilt legs the twilight world of new orleans was spinning round him like a cartwheel and those three faces none of which he could quite focus on still seemed to be looking at him are you all right the irish voice again i am fine lincoln bellowed hoarsely fine as a a a fine as a goat in a briar patch fine as an oil painting he managed a grin ahm asssh fit asssh a a as a he opened his mouth he was thinking of saying horse but instead what came out was something that sounded a bit like bleurghhh the last thing he heard before the world spun on to its side and he passed out was someone saying oh gross all over my shoes charming chapter new orleans hes a pitiful sight so he is it was wholly dark now lincoln could hear the gentle lapping of the mississippi against the hull of a boat nearby and somewhere deep inside his throbbing mind he figured out he was slumped along the docks somewhere the sky above was clear and the moon high among the stars casting a surprisingly strong silver light across the river and the city now finally settled and still for the night you think hell be ok if we just leave him here like this hell be fine im sure hes a big boy the voices were speaking quietly not quite a whisper but almost well now since we missed both our return windows weve got all of tomorrow to wander around and explore new orleans a pause so sal what do you make of totally bindaas its so real but it feels unreal too do you know what i mean like i cant really be back here that particular voice the female voice had an odd accent lincoln couldnt quite place it hed once met a welshman whod had a similar singsong way of talking aye i still have to pinch myself sometimes i wake up on me bunk still thinking im in the stewards quarters and all this timetravel nonsense has been a dream me too a pause so do you want to see if we can find rooms somewhere to sleep im too excited to sleep we can walk around a bit or wait here until sunup and explore bob how long until the return window opens a deep voice the twentyfourhour window will open at four the time is now six minutes past one in the morning you have fourteen hours and fiftyfour minutes until the portal opens in the jenkins and proctor warehouse well i could do with a walk its a warm night its nice to be out of the archway for once lincoln heard movement and closed his eyes a moment later he felt a gentle nudge the grain sack beneath him shifting and the warm breath of someone leaning over his face he still asleep dead to the world i think a chuckle jahulla its hard to imagine this drunk being the president of america isnt it hes still got a while to sort himself out so he has information the american civil war begins in april well there you go hes got exactly thirty years to sort himself out loads of time a pause what do you think bob reckon weve patched up history the target person is alive history data files show that he will embark on a career as a lawyer in the next few years then go into politics lawyer shaddyah youre joking negative not joking a pause hmmm i could imagine him as a lawyer hes got the temperament argumentative so he is anyway he heard a footstep come on sal lets go and explore new orleans while we got the chance hell be fine we should leave before he wakes up with a bit of luck he wont even remember us movement again lincoln heard the swish and rustle of cotton skirts then the receding sound of footfalls down the wooden planks of the dockside he opened his eyes once more and watched the three dark shapes one a giant of a man another a slender young man and the third a young woman his mind was still foggy from the whisky hed been drinking earlier in the afternoon foggy but still able to function in the last couple of minutes hed heard enough to make a feeblerminded person than him question their very sanity time travel as a boy lincoln had once discussed such an absurd idea with a friend what if a man could speed up the turning of a clock or slow it or stop it or even wind it back the wrong way what if a man could walk in days past meet great men from history and talk to them an absurd idea a fanciful notion for their imaginative young minds yet here it seemed to be the very idea he and his childhood friend had playfully considered while resting in the branches of a sycamore tree is this possible perhaps in some faroff future time for example it could be possible the ingenuity of man seemed to know no bounds every year it seemed a new device was being invented new knowledge of how gods earth functioned uncovered who knows what science men would be wielding like magic in the year he eased himself into a sitting position his head pounded as if some small gold prospector was at work in there with a rock hammer and what was it the much deeper voice had said that he would be a lawyer and one day did the girl actually say it did she actually say the word president he felt a shudder of excitement course through him blowing away the cobwebs of his hangover president if that was true really true if those three strangers did actually come from a time beyond his own and could know such things know his destiny then they would know how it would be possible that a poor fellow like him would one day lead this country as its president his skittering mind reached out further perhaps there was an even greater goal a greater destiny for him than a life of politics he realized it would be a far greater thing to be the only man from to visit the future to actually see with his own eyes all the wonderful devices on air sea and land that mans ingenuity could create he imagined the cities of this time full of towers of glistening crystal that prodded the very heavens i would truly like to see this future chapter new york maddy sat with her feet up on the computer desk her trainers resting on a stack of pizza boxes she watched the monitor in front of her a looping display of tragedy unfolding in painful endless repetition the flickering shaking camcorder footage of a passenger plane swooping low across the skyscrapers of manhattan and in those precious heartbeats of time before it finally crashes into the side of the north tower a hope even though you know what happens isnt there always that fleeting moment of hope a possibility that it might actually miss this time that it just flies between them that julian and nearly three thousand other people might return home that day and tell their families of the near miss that terrified them all for a few moments but the loop of footage never changes she watched it in slow motion it ended as it always did with an orange fireball a quickly growing pillar of black smoke and a million sheets of paper raining down like confetti like snow to the streets of manhattan maddy remembered that day as if it was yesterday shed been nine shed been at school an ashenfaced teachers assistant had burst into their classroom and blurted out the news the television set in the corner had been switched on and there it was the smouldering north tower she remembered her teacher sobbing and other girls in her class following suit or maybe there was a chance that this world with its subtly altered reality no president lincoln was going to be different enough for the american airlines flight to take off and arrive at its destination and no one was going to die tomorrow it had only been one tiny ripple of change so far but not for the first time she wondered how nice it would be to preserve an alternate world changed just enough to spare julian and three thousand others their lives maddy she looked up at becks standing beside her uh hey becks i have finished maddy had given her the task of checking on the growth tubes in the back there were six foetuses hanging in that awful murky smelly growth solution being fed a mix of nutrients that kept them in stasis none of them would grow any larger until they activated the growth mode and cut the mix with steroids as long as they had power feeding the tubes the foetuses future bobs and becks took care of themselves although occasionally the filters needed to be pulled out cleared of gunk and put back in a quite horrible job even worse maddy mused than pulling rotting hair and skin and whatever else was in there from a blocked plughole even worse if it was possible than emptying their chemical toilet all of the growth tubes are performing optimally she said drily all the invitro clone candidates are fine good do you wish me to make you some coffee maddy could still smell that gunk on beckss hands uhh no thats ok she picked up a remote control and switched one of the monitors to show a cable channel the simpsons was on she recognized it as an old episode shed seen too many times over the years but of course here in for every kid just coming in from school and watching it now it was a brandnew episode and one of those kids is was me she had to be out there right now a nineyearold madelaine carter sitting in the kitchen having an afterschool bowl of nugget crunch most probably watching the very same episode and mom sitting at the kitchen table beside her asking her about her day and maddy grunting answers back what shed give to just grab her coat her wallet walk out of the arch and get the first flight from jfk to boston what shed give to walk up the front yard on to the porch and ring the doorbell to say hi mom when she opened the front door im your little girl all grown up hows tricks most of all what shed give to step in past her mom cross the hall into the kitchen hunker down in front of that little girl with her frizzy hair tied in a ponytail her hands dirty her jeans scuffed from playing soccer with the boys hey there maddy wanna know who i am becks sat down beside her silent studying her face intently before she cocked her head curiously maddy carter why are you crying uh she shook her head her mind once again back in the archway her eyes once more on the screen watching homer trashing ned flanderss lawnmower dirt she mumbled dirt in my eye she rubbed them dry under her glasses becks yes maddy you recall our last conversation with foster when we went to central park thats right thats where she could find him same time same day for him a moment that passed once for her looping back in their fortyeighthour bubble it could be a repeated encounter out there in the park beside the duck pond i recall your conversation with foster you remember we asked you when you could unlock that data the decoded message in the grail yes maddy i remember that you replied the data would be unlocked when it is the end yes the end what did you mean by that becks cocked her head on one side it is the only answer the protocol permits me to offer but what do you think it means what is it referring to the end of what becks shrugged i have no data on that the end of me you the agency the world the support units grey eyes locked on hers i repeat i have no data to interpret that message is there no way we could dig that hard drive out of your head and access that locked part of the drive scan it somehow siphon the data becks studied her coolly no offence meant becks but hacking open your skull and digging out your brain seems like the only way were going to find out what the end actually means tampering with my onboard computer would trigger the selfdestruct mechanism there is no viable way to bypass this protocol the information will be revealed to you when certain conditions are met but you dont even know what those conditions are i will know when it happens she replied calmly then you will know the contents of the message maddy shook her head with frustration argghh youre so annoying i apologize she sighed go and make yourself useful make some toast or something yes maddy becks turned obediently and headed towards their kitchen area and wash your hands first maddy settled back into her chair and watched the world outside through her bank of monitors the subtly changed world that now no longer recognized the name abraham lincoln secrets and freakin lies she resumed her little daydream of going home seeing mom seeing herself and kissing all this insane nonsense goodbye chapter new orleans the jenkins amp proctor warehouse was quiet around them casks of wine and canvas sacks of cornmeal were piled high outside through the wooden slat walls they could hear voices of several dozen men the bray of a pony the smack of heavy oatmeal bags being dropped on the docks the faroff hoot of a steamboat the life of the day indulging in one last surge of activity before the sky lost its sun sal sat on a pile of sacks exhausted from hours on her feet but exhilarated by the world shed witnessed information three minutes until the twentyfourhour window is due to open liam got to his feet and checked over the top of a stack of cargo to make sure once again that they were alone in the storehouse i do hope our friend mr lincoln has sobered up theyd checked back where theyd left him earlier this morning he was gone not that that was surprising the docks were a busy place from dawn and more than likely hed crawled away holding a sore head for somewhere quieter to nurse his hangover ah well said liam well soon know if alls better when we get back maybe he isnt so important to history after all said sal i mean it was only a little change we saw wasnt it maybe thats all thats going to happen bob retrieved data historical accounts from the unaltered historical database indicate his strong leadership and the announcement of the emancipation proclamation in were critical to the north winning the war the whuh bob turned his gaze to sal the emancipation proclamation was an executive order by president lincoln that all slaves were to be given their liberty it was an order enacted in the third year of the war and applied only to some of the shaddyah said sal third year of the war affirmative but are you saying for the first three years the north had slaves too affirmative there were slaves in the union states but i thought that war was all about slavery started because of slavery said sal the north the blue soldiers were fighting to end it and the south the grey ones wanted to keep it there are a number of listed reasons for the war slavery was considered a secondary or contributory issue at the beginning of the war but became a primary issue towards the end liam sat down on a bag next to sal ive been reading up on the civil war i remember this some historians said this proclamation was a tactical decision to weaken the south it was designed to cause unrest but more important than that the british government was sort of thinking of coming to help the confederate south why because they saw the north the union as a growing threat they were becoming too rich too powerful becoming too big for their boots threatening british dominance so the british government thought it might be better if america was divided so they wanted to help the southern states the confederates split off and form their very own nation thats right isnt it bob bob shrugged i have some conflicting data files on this historians disagree but here was the problem sal the british people were against the idea of slavery so it wasnt going to be easy for the government to convince their people to go along with helping the south and this fella president lincoln was a smart chap he realized if this wars headlining issue was all about slavery if the british people could see more clearly that one side the north side was totally against it then there was no way theyd let their government support the slavemasters in the south he shrugged it was the right thing whats the word the moral thing to do to free all the slaves said liam but the way i see it it was also very clever like a chess move to make sure the confederates didnt have britain come into the war on their side sal shook her head i thought it was much simpler than that right versus wrong liam hunched his shoulders wars are never about right and wrong always seems to be they end up being about power money something both sides want for themselves information i am detecting the density probe liam got up from the sacks of cornmeal wearily theyd been walking through the early hours of the morning and most of the day and his legs ached he turned and offered sal a hand maam she was struggling with the layers of linen and cotton petticoats and the tightly laced bodice to get to her feet whuh she said looking at his hand utterly bemused what do you want he sighed grasped one of her gloved hands and yanked her up on to her feet jayyyz dont gentlemen offer ladies a polite hand any more in your time she shook her head uhhh no not really id probably run if a stranger reached out for me like that one minute left until extraction said bob liam suddenly snapped his fingers were probably going to have to come back here again once were sure historys been corrected sal looked at him really why liam is correct said bob the distillery wagon represents altered history and well need to trace it back and find just who caused them horses to bolt liam looked at bob we shouldve followed it up last night straight after saving lincoln liam cursed frustrated with himself for having been so dense why didnt you suggest that bob it was not a stated mission priority liam cursed again well need to come back once more and trace back the way that wagon came see where it came from find out what spooked them horses he fumed in silence for a moment jayzus that was stupid of me they waited for the window listening to the bustling activity outside bob counted down the last ten seconds and then with a puff of air that sent sals bonnet fluttering the shimmering orb of displaced time hovered darkly in front of them sal took a final look around the storage shed savouring one last time the smells of woodsmoke leather and horse manure i enjoyed my trip she said a little wistfully i wish she started to say but didnt finish she didnt need to liam knew exactly what she was going to say i wish we could stay he nodded just to let her know he felt the same best get going he said finally goodbye she uttered then reluctantly stepped through liam looked up at bob well better get back home then bob nodded correct they stepped into the displacement window one after the other new york a moment later liam emerged from the milky void into the archway to see the three girls standing beside the computer desk awaiting his arrival heyho he chirped as he strode towards them world saved yet again bob emerged from the portal behind him with a heavy grunt as his feet found the firm concrete stand clear said maddy as she turned round to the desk to instruct computerbob to close the portal liam stepped towards maddy me an bob need to go back again maddy we didnt manage to he stopped saw sals eyes suddenly wide a whitegloved hand raised to her mouth whats up behind him the crackling burr of energy around the portal suddenly ceased as it snapped out of existence and the archway was its normal quiet hum of computers and the fizz of tube lights flickering a cool clinical glow down from above good god what is this devilry liam spun round on his heel to see a tall young man crouched and cowering in panic and confusion in the middle of the floor eyes as wide terrified and startled as a bull in an abattoir oh great sighed liam chapter new york the man recoiled fearfully at the sight of bob taking several quick steps away from him what is this pplace he bellowed anxiously his eyes darting from one of them to the next it was maddy who reacted first she took several steps forward liam is that oh crud thats not yes im afraid it is mads its lincoln her jaw hung slack oh my god she advanced slowly mr lincoln abraham lincoln lincolns manic eyes settled on her his shaggy eyebrows scowled covering his fear with suspicion you you know me maam maddy nodded she even offered him something that looked like a polite curtsey yes mr lincoln yes we do lincolns voice softened from an outraged courthouse bellow to something quieter and altogether more agreeable then please maam tell me where in tarnation i have suddenly ended up he looked around the brick archway just a moment ago i was in the jenkins storehouse his eyes fell on liam listening to you sir and your two friends talking about things incomprehensible to me liam cursed his carelessness jayzus he must have been following us lincoln carried on and then i saw that that round doorway appear out of lincolns deep growl of a voice became a breathless whisper and his mouth snapped open and shut like a fish caught on a hook and landed on a riverbank it arrived out of nothing like smoke like like a vision of angels like sal chuckled at that fool that i am i dared to step through he glanced at liam to follow you through sir through the that that doorway and find myself in a an unearthly whiteness he scratched anxiously at the thick bristles of his beard then i find myself here in this strange place maddy took another step forward now only a yard from him you can relax mr lincoln please its all right its ok youre perfectly safe here lincoln studied her in suspicious silence for a moment you maam you sound less foreign to me than the others he nodded at bob particularly that ugly ox of a man there good god if i had a dog as ugly id shave its posterior and teach it to walk backwards lincoln chortled drunkenly at his own joke maddy shook her head hes been drinking now you maam he said eyeing maddy warily you have the sound of new england in your voice boston she replied im from boston lincoln nodded slowly and i trust you have a name maddy maddy carter she offered her hand to him we mean you no harm in fact we came back in time to save you for several moments he regarded her hand as if it was a snarling dog ready to snap at his fingers save me she nodded you nearly stepped right in front of a speeding wagon aye it was bob here said liam slapping his meaty shoulder that yanked you back out of the way do you not remember lincoln remembered that remembered being winded and lying on his back but then it was all a confusing mixture of things he might or might not have seen or heard the only thing hed been sure of was the whispered conversation in the dark of the dockside the mention of his name the mention of a destiny the mention of the jenkins storehouse and the specific time of some mysterious rendezvous yes perhaps i do remember something of that uttered lincoln he cocked a bushy eyebrow narrowed his eyes as he struggled to make some sense of his whiskysoaked recollection a big fast wagon barrels on it was it liam nodded aye a distillery wagon the horses were running wild so they were there you see said maddy liam and the others went back to save you back lincoln nodded thats some of what i heard these three say to each other back they came back in time maddy shot a look of irritation at liam and sal careless talk they shouldve been much more cautious in what they were saying and where they were saying it yes mr lincoln she admitted yes they actually came back in time lincolns scowl vanished and was replaced in an instant with a smile that looked horrifically out of place beneath his dark brooding eyes incredible he suddenly grasped her hand firmly and shook it most incredible he let her hand go and advanced towards the others sir he said reaching out for one of bobs large paws sir as unsettlingly strange as you look i am indebted to you for saving my life as you did lincolns energetic voice filled the archway as he pumped bobs arm furiously bob looked at liam for help just say no problem bob no problem he rumbled and you sir he greeted liam you sir i suspect by the way you talk are from ireland cork in ireland aye liam oconnor at your service a pleasure to make your acquaintance mr oconnor he let liams hand go and then graciously bowed in front of sal taking a gloved hand and kissing it young madam sal giggled as if his kiss had tickled im saleena vikram uhh just call me sal he glanced at becks reaching for her hand she eyed him distrustfully as he grasped it and then about to kiss it he hesitated taken aback by the livid ribs and swirls of scar tissue running across her hand her forearm all the way up to her elbow he quickly released his tight grasp you you have been in a fire i am sorry i hope i havent hurt you maam i am called becks she said coolly she looked up at maddy who offered her a subtle nod yes thats right a fire but i am all better now he nodded politely finally he turned back to maddy and you miss carter i presume you lead this small and remarkable group of mysterious heroes and heroines she shrugged selfconsciously i muddle through somehow i guess mr lincoln he stood back hands on hips to study them all quite remarkable he uttered again and am i to truly believe that i am standing in a time that is in my future yes said maddy lincoln looked at the row of computer monitors on the desk different sizes displaying different news feeds from around the world and those pictures those moving pictures they are of this time yes live cablenews feeds she replied realizing as she did that there was little in that answer hed understand he leaned forward studying them closely one after the other remarkable like like little windows looking out upon every corner of this world of his words died as he pulled in a gasp good lord he yelled stepping towards the monitor on the end these buildings are they as giant as they appear he said pointing at one screen maddy turned round on one screen msnbc was doing a news story on wall street there was a library image taken from a news helicopter of manhattans skyscrapers oh yeah thats new york where we are right now new york you say lincoln bent over the messy desk peering closely at the monitor that is new york remarkable liam gently nudged maddy as lincolns gaze wandered from screen to screen muttering with everincreasing incredulity are we not causing contamination here maddy he whispered i mean he has to go back so to be the president of the union states yes youre right she replied surely we cant send him back to his time knowing about all this she cursed quietly he already knows too much i need to think what were good god lincoln suddenly exclaimed a disaster what now maddy pulled away from liam and rushed forward what is it lincolns pointed finger was shaking a calamity miss carter a calamity i tell you right there through this window look she followed his goggleeyed gaze and saw he was watching the looping footage of tomorrows trade towers disaster no no see relax this isnt live she shook her head wondering how she was going to explain the difference between live footage and recorded footage to a man whod never seen a moving image before are there people living in that structure that tall tower he turned to her in what city is that explosion happening new york tarnation you mean here this very place lincoln turned to the others is this future of yours in the middle of some war maddy shrugged well sort of then we must join the fight lincoln turned and rushed into the gloom towards the far end of the archway mr lincoln called maddy there was no answer but she could hear the corrugatediron shutters rattling under the impact of his fists oh crud hes a real pain she groaned and made her way across the floor to join him mr lincoln where is the door miss carter we must join this fight and defend our mr lincoln will you please calm down she pressed the green button to one side of the shutter door and with the whine of the motor and the clank of chains the shutter lifted spilling evening light across the archways floor through the slowly widening crack theres no war going on right now no invasion of america but i saw it just then miss carter with my own eyes a vast explosion its just an image of something thats going to happen thats all nothing you need to get all upset about ok look everythings fine outside right now the shutter rattled to a halt for a moment she was unsure whether to show lincoln the world outside the more details he learned of the future the more contaminated his mind was going to be for an anonymous man with little or no influence on history that might be an acceptable contamination but for a man destined to be president well like shed said he already knew too much a little more wasnt going to make any difference either way take a look everythings just fine she gently ushered lincoln forward stepping into the cobbled alley she grabbed his shoulders and turned him to his left so that he faced the end of their backstreet and the dirty rubbishstrewn quayside beyond above them the williamsburg bridge swept across the east river towards the glowing lights of manhattan it boomed and rumbled as a train went over above drowning out the tooting of bridgeborne traffic above and the distant wail of a police siren see now nothings going on theres no war god help me this is quite rem let me guess remarkable she finished for him lincoln didnt reply instead she heard a gurgling sound she turned in time to see lincolns eyes rolling drunkenly until she could see only the whites his head lolled to one side his body slackened like a rag doll but remained upright and standing it was then she noticed the thick fingers of bobs hand round his throat and bob standing behind my god you just killed him you just snapped abraham lincolns neck negative said bob he is unharmed and unconscious i have compressed a nerve cluster in his neck sal liam and becks emerged into the flickering amber lamplight of the backstreet im sorry it was my suggestion said liam i gave bob the order to do that maddy looked anxiously at lincolns body slumped in bobs arms you sure hes not you know dead he will be fine said becks information he will experience some bruising and some minor swelling only maddy pulled on her bottom lip for a moment then finally nodded right yeah in that case good idea liam with any luck hell wake up back in new orleans thinking this was all some sort of a drunken dream hell blame it on the whisky she stepped back inside the arch quick lets get the displacement machine charged up before he comes round chapter new york it took ten minutes to get threequarters of the leds on the charge display lit up maddy was certain that was going to be enough she only needed to send the unconscious form of lincoln and bob perhaps liam too back to she turned round to check bob and sal were still keeping an eye on the man curled up on one of the armchairs how is he still out replied sal looking up from reading something on the table ok computerbob well use the same droplocation data as the last trip punch them in to just before they rescued lincoln from that wagon affirmative maddy when he wakes up hell think he passed out right outside that inn you mentioned liam right then me an bob need to sniff out what caused that wagon to go hammer and tongs you got it she turned to the webcam oh and get a density probe running last thing they needed was a dock worker in there witnessing the arrival of lincoln and heralding him as some kind of prophet from god density probe is activated liam was standing beside her hes a character so that lincoln fella a regular firebrand she tutted too much energy for his own good like a freakin toddler on a sugar rush she pulled up the densityprobe display bar and nodded with satisfaction that nothing so far had stepped through their drop space if hed been alive in my time i guess hed make a pretty good childrens tv presenter except for the fact hed scare the kids with that monobrow liam laughed he got the gist of that still i suppose its energy like that that makes a poor farmers son a president she nodded i guess so id like to think that the msnbc news feed flickered both of them caught the sudden change out of the corner of their eyes the news reporter standing outside the white house and reporting on president bushs sliding approval ratings had been wearing a pale blue shirt and a black tie all of a sudden he was now wearing a white shirt with a dark red tie did you see that said maddy more than the shirt and tie a second ago his skin had been a coffee colour now it was white the same face the same dark hair slicked back but the skin had lightened a tone as if some studio engineer had adjusted the contrast setting on a camera maddy turned in her chair sal i think we just had another wave bigger one this time sal was on her feet ill go look outside theyd left the fivedollar note just outside the shutter hidden beneath a discarded mcdonalds carton on one side was the abraham lincoln image she wondered if this time wave would have wiped his face off the note and replaced it with another scowling president maddy turned in her seat back to liam ok i think we need to put abe back pretty fast she winced at the sight of the empty perspex tube it would take too long filling it up again you guys are going back dry she looked at liam still wearing his morning coat and cravat and bob still dressed like a dock worker and youre still all dressed right so were good to go the noise of the shutter cranking up echoed across to them sal stepped outside into the evening looks the same she called in manhattans still there maddy sniffed and wiped her nose well thats something then jahulla sal came rushing back in what she ran over to the computer desk look see she spread the fivedollar note out on the desk lincolns face was gone and just as maddy had expected in his place was another elder statesman with muttonchop whiskers and a joyless frown becks joined them looking down at the note lincolns presence has been completely removed from this timeline maddy nodded no lincoln memorial in washington then or stop bobs voice suddenly boomed they all turned just in time to see the heels of bobs boots disappear out of sight through the open shutter door and out into the alley becks responded immediately and sprinted across the archway to join him liam looked at the armchair where lincoln had been slumped unconscious just moments ago hes only gone and done a bleedin runner lincolns long legs carried him swiftly down the cobbled backstreet the soles of his boots slapping the ground like an audience clapping applause at his deathdefying escape into the darkness behind him two dozen yards and no more he could hear the heavier footfall of that giant of a man moving with a quite unbelievable agility lincoln was a fast runner as a boy in coles county illinois he had won every race with his friends legs like a stallion his father used to say the busy end of the street opened up in front of him he could see mesmerizing lights of all kinds and all colours lights on horseless carriages lights down the sides of buildings distant winking lights far up in the sky he passed a large barrelsized bucket of rotting garbage and yanked at it in his wake he heard it fall spilling a small avalanche of stinking refuse across the cobblestones he chanced a glance over his shoulder just in time to see the giant man slip in the rotten mush and lose his footing ha haaaa he yelled triumphantly as his pounding feet now found firm tarmac and instinctively he turned left on to the busier street resolving not to allow the bewildering sights of the future tempt him to hesitate and lose the hardearned lead on his pursuer but even with his sprinters legs carrying him fast and away from those mysterious travellers in time who quite clearly were intent on taking him back to his hopeless backbreaking and deadend life in new orleans his mind continued to spin like a yarn wheel at the incredible sights and smells and sounds all around him this is the future of america he told himself the future the future the future his feet slapping pavement to the rhythm of his mantra he felt as excited as a dog with two tails this is the future and by jove i think i like the look of it chapter new york oh come on youve gotta be kidding maddy slammed her hand on the desk exasperated you lost him both of you you actually lost him becks and bob stood side by side both still gasping from the aborted pursuit abraham lincoln is very fast said becks a hint of shame in her voice yes and you and numbnuts here are both meant to be superhumans you know superstrong superfast that kinda thing his sudden departure was not something that could be predicted muttered bob like a scolded schoolboy he appeared to be unconscious perhaps he was faking it said sal listening to what we were saying liam nodded and didnt fancy going back home well duh sighed maddy removing her glasses and pinching the bridge of her nose you really think liam missed the sarcasm in her voice yup thats what i think oh crud she slumped down in one of the office chairs so howre we going to find him now he could be anywhere in new york the five of them stood in a silent tableau for a while in the background several tv stations quietly babbled the evening news to themselves why are we so completely rubbish maddy muttered rhetorically supersecret timetravelprevention agency ill tell you what we are a freakin joke thats us three clueless kids and a couple of trained monkeys she leaned back in her chair closed her eyes and started massaging away an emerging migraine with the tips of her fingers well to look at it this way said liam presently hes a tall mouthy fella so he is wearing clothes from the last century someones going to notice him soon enough and your point is liam shrugged he might cause a scene and end up on one of em news stations or get himself arrested added sal weirdo like that maddy shook her head irritably this is new york sal its all weirdos but hes got a mouth on him so he has said liam i fancy thatll land him in trouble with a policeman soon enough an attitude he has that all right maddy suddenly opened her eyes oh god and lead the police right here right to our door information we can establish an unencrypted and open link to the nypd incidentreport database said bob we could monitor this and respond to any relevant coms traffic added becks quickly the pair of them were like two chastised children both desperately seeking to redeem themselves maddy sat forward the chair creaking with the sudden lurch of movement ok yeah thats thats something we can do she turned towards the computer monitors and saw computerbob was already in the process of establishing a handshake link to the new york police departments computer system good boy computerbob she turned back to the others and maybe well find him anyway right i mean hes got no money so he cant get a cab or a bus or a train and he isnt going to get a room anywhere looking the way he does thing is where might he head over the bridge said sal towards manhattan towards the bright lights liam nodded its what i wouldve done on me first night you just want to see all that up close yeah maddy pursed her lips thoughtfully he really did seem to like the big buildings ok then right heres what we do well split up and search for him bob and sal you two head over the bridge and go north up bowery fourth and broadway towards times square liam and becks you head down towards wall street those are the two glowiest shiniest parts of town right hopefully hell make like a big dumb moth and head to one of those two places if were lucky she fumbled among the detritus and rubbish on the desk and found what she was looking for she tossed liam and sal a mobile phone each ill monitor the police callins here if we get a likely candidate ill dial it in liam frowned dial it in call you on the phone the thing in your hand ill call you on that ahh he nodded right you are so is that clear everyone four nodding heads and sal liam bob get changed back into your normal clothes quick as you can you look like a convention of quakers or something chapter new york lincoln stood in awe at the confusion of blinking fizzing flickering multicoloured lights the neon signs in chinese pedestrian crossings blinking walk and dont walk the cars and cabs looking to his eyes like impossible devices that shouldnt be able to move on their own without the aid of horses in front and yet they did his ears were filled with a riot of alien sounds sounds he couldnt begin to make sense of a rhythmic pounding that spilled out of the back of a vehicle as it rolled past him a noise so deep he felt his chest shuddering in synchronicity the pavements and street filled with people speaking languages from all over the world so it seemed every one of them holding slim and shiny pebbleshaped contraptions to their ears and talking into them or alternately looking intently at their tiny glowing surfaces languages so many of them but the most perplexing ones were those he had an inkling were some form of unidentifiable english he could make sense of fleeting bits and pieces said phrases shouted out from one side of the street to the other and peppered with words he couldnt begin to try to decipher it was awe at first and pride that almost had him crying pride that his nation his fellow americans ambitious and brave men and women pioneers adventurers and entrepreneurs all of them would one day build something so magnificently toweringly spectacular and ingenious and colourful as this incredible city of glowing cathedrals hells bells and tarnation he gasped out loud even his thunderous voice was lost amid the bustling din of chinatown this is a truly remarkable place he shook his head with utter incredulity truly remarkable it was then a short woman standing directly in front of him said something he cupped an ear realizing she was talking to him i beg your pardon maam she looked to him to be oriental and giggled shyly as she spoke he bent down low almost doubling over to hear her better it is very noisy maam pray you might speak a little louder she spoke again like yoo hat very much my hat he selfconsciously touched the brim of his battered felttopper why thank you then without warning the woman whipped an object out from her handbag it glistened gunmetal grey square like a tinderbox with one glassy eye that glinted dully at him maam what may i ask are you she pulled the small device up to her face and said you smile now please a blinding flash of light suddenly exploded from it and lincoln staggered back screaming in abject terror quite certain the device was some sort of weapon and that hed been shot at he collided with someone else and a moment later they were in a tangle of limbs on the ground what you doin fool a young darkskinned face beneath the peak of a spotlessly white yankees cap lincoln grimaced awkwardly patting himself down to be sure he wasnt bleeding from the chinese womans gunshot wound my apologies i i must have i thought the young black man angrily pushed lincolns gangly legs off him he uttered a stream of words lincoln couldnt begin to fathom like i say i am sorry i thought i had been shot by a a small woman with a well with some curious weapon the young man looked at him as he got up dusting himself down he shook his head in half irritation half bemusement you wanna jus watch out aight lincoln looked at the young black man noticed a ragged tear along the knee of his pale denim trousers good lord i appear to have ripped your clothes i beg your pardon uh what no hey thats jus meant to be like lincoln shook his head looking the young man up and down i have some small coin on me you must allow me to at least recompense no hey thats fine waved the young man jus watch out next time aight no i insist said lincoln digging into his own threadbare trousers wheres your master ill give the money to hi hey what did you just say lincoln froze cocked an eyebrow ahh i see my mistake young man you must be a freed negro then both police officers heard the call on the squad cars radio we got a disturbance corner of mott street and canal street caller said we got a pair of guys tangling like a pair of fighting cockerels bill picked up the mic ok we got it were just round the corner he stubbed his cigarette out placed his cap on and straightened the peak in the cars wing mirror damn funs startin early tonight aint that right jim replied tossing the uneaten half of his saltbeef bagel back in its paper bag and stuffing it into the car doors side pocket the beef was going to be cold by the time he got back to it and the mustard all soaked up into the bread great he slapped on the siren and took the next left and sheesh its only monday fer cryin out loud bill chuckled in his seat as the squad car sped down the busy street the siren clearing a gap between both lanes of sluggish traffic chapter new york see anything becks shook her head i see no one who matches his identity or similar liam shucked his shoulders to be honest i cant imagine us spotting anyone similar hes an oddlooking fella so he is although he seemed to liam to be an utterly peculiar individual one moment manic and excitable as a child the next curmudgeonly and as badtempered as a mule there was something about him he found vaguely likeable perhaps it was because he seemed so honest his overthetop mannerisms his loud voice his thoroughly expressive face seemed utterly incapable of masking whatever happened to be going through his mind lincoln appeared to be one of those people completely incapable of deceit or as liams auntie dot used to say the poor fella wears his heart on his sleeve he recalled one of the other lads on the titanic being a bit like that one of the junior stewards liam remembered thinking the lad wasnt going to last long on the ship too ready with a muttered curse if he failed to get tipped the chief steward said the lad was a bad penny trouble certainly not the kind of young man they wanted wearing a white star uniform liam gazed at the winking lights of traffic backed up at an intersection and wondered if that lad was one of the lucky few whod made it off the ship alive to be picked up later by the ss carpathia maddy yes she groaned her cold had chosen the last half an hour to get worse her head was pounding her throat was rough her arms felt like shed been benchpressing hundredpound weights and her legs like theyd run a marathon there has just been an incident logged on the new york police departments internal intranet system that i calculate as having a high relevancy factor she pulled her chair along the table to face the webcam whadya got hours disturbance on corner of mott and canal street one male caucasian approximate age possibly a vagrant booked in using probable alias abraham lincoln oh boy we got him whats he gone and done now data entry originates from precinct police station any idea where that is just a moment searching she snatched her inhaler off the desk and took a wheezy gasp from it asthma and a cold no strike that flu oh and a whole pile of unwelcome stress on top of that she wondered how much punishment her frail body was supposed to be able to take elizabeth street sal and bob were probably closer she dialled her number sal yes weve got ourselves a winner hes only gone and got himself arrested already surprise surprise hes being held at the precinct station over on elizabeth street no more than five minutes from you i think you want bob to go in and break him out or something god no thatll kick up a mess we can do without no just go in and ask about him doesnt sound like hes done anything too serious say hes your eccentric cousin or something and youre there to take him home and give him a frikkin good talking to she shrugged we might get lucky and they release him into your care ok ill give it a try maddy hung up settled back in her chair and groaned into a hankie before dialling liam it took him about two dozen rings before he finally answered ah so you managed to figure out how to answer it then liam aye them silly little buttons on the front all look the same to me so they do her patient longsuffering sigh rustled down the phone line before she proceeded to explain as quickly as she could where lincoln was and that theyd best come home to the arch she figured sal wasnt going to have much luck talking the police into releasing lincoln chances were theyd probably let him out first thing tomorrow morning with a verbal warning if he hadnt done anything too bad on bail if he had she hung up and aimed a hangdog look at the webcam can i go get some bunktime now do you think bob recommendation minimum four hours sleep you are not functioning to your full ability you

as he grabbed his coat and kitbag now i got a goddarn picture in my head gonna give me nightmares tonight chapter new york the sound of the cell door being unlocked and wrenched open roused lincoln from his sleep blearyeyed he blinked back the glare of morning light spilling in through the slit window and looked up from the bunk at three men in dark suits crowding into the cell and staring down at him abraham lincoln he rubbed his tired eyes and lifted himself off the pillow on to one elbow yes that is i you will come with us please a dry emotionless voice lincoln pulled himself up to a seated position and swung his legs off the bunk his bare feet touched the cold floor gentlemen he started i have done nothing to deserve being incarcerated like this being treated like a sir you will put on your shoes and come with us now lincolns face clouded with anger i will do no such thing sir not until i receive at the very least an apology for all right said one of the suits his lips barely moving cuff this scumbag the other two fell on him like a ton of breeze blocks pinning him down on the bunk as he squirmed and thrashed beneath their weight this is an outrage he barked how dare you save it for later pal grunted one of the men lying on top of him fumbling for his wrists youre in for a world of hurt buddy said the other you filthy murdering terrorist sc agent belling best keep your feelings to yourself son while youre on fbi time i expect a certain level of professionalism sorry sir now get him up between them the two men in suits hefted lincoln off the bunk and turned him to face the third this is a travesty id advise you to keep your mouth firmly shut mr lincoln emotions are running very high this morning and the last thing me and my boys need to hear coming out of your mouth right now is a whole load of attitude i insist you tell me a few minues ago a second plane just impacted with the other tower last night you were logged making a claim the world trade center was coming down this morning lincoln frowned those two tall towers yes i a few minutes ago a second plane just impacted with the other tower the fbi agents jaw set firmly youre either a prophet or a terrorist either way weve got a whole bunch of questions for you he stepped backwards from the cell into the corridor the other two men shuffled out of the cell with lincoln wedged between them youve just been signed over to fbi custody he smiled coolly your sorry murdering terrorist scumbag butt is ours now maddy turned to the others standing together on the forecourt outside the precinct station all right its half past nine i guess therell be some police clerical staff at their desks by now who can sign a release form for us she looked at liam sal bob and becks so liam you come with me the rest of you just just stay here but what if they wont let him go asked liam he opened his mouth again and was about to point to both support units bob reaching inside an old mackintosh he was wearing to pull fosters old shotgun from the waistband of his trousers quite clearly eager to bring the thing out of retirement and use it once again no were not shooting this place up i said that already if they say no then well just have to figure something else out she pointed up at the sky where a solitary column of dark smoke arced across the cloudless blue morning see that everyones watching the news everyones watching nineeleven unfold people are angry and very very frightened and that includes the cops as far as they know right now this could be the first of a whole wave of terrorist attacks she took a fluttering edgy breath nervous the last thing we want to do this morning is kick up a disturbance ok liam shrugged all right she reached out and grabbed his arm come on they climbed a couple of steps off the pavement and crossed a small forecourt that would normally have been filled with patrol cars and police bikes pretty much all of them were out this morning crowd control panic control they stepped in through swing doors and ahead of them was a counter and a thick panel of perspex behind which two female uniformed officers and several plainclothes officers stood all of them staring at a small portable tv perched on the corner of one of the desks beyond maddy stepped up and wrapped her knuckles lightly on the barrier excuse me maybe they heard maybe they didnt excuse me one of the women in uniform managed to tear herself away from the screen maddy could see her eyes were red with tears oh my god she whispered to maddy as if they were old friends its awful isnt it maddy nodded right now she felt disconnected from the disaster slowly developing at the south end of manhattan but she certainly remembered the emotions all around her back at school while they like these police officers had sat and gasped and cried as they watched the flames climbing the sides of both the north and south towers were here to collect our uh well our cousin he was brought in last night and cautioned i think the woman on the far side sniffed and dabbed at her eyes right yes she seemed a little relieved to have something to put her mind to gonna need a name please madelaine carter and this is liam oconnor no i need the name of the arrested oh right its abraham lincoln the woman nodded pulled out a clipboard with a computergenerated event log clipped to it lemmesee lemmesee her finger ran down the printed page abraham lincoln a d ampd she looked up at them drunk and disorderly looks like he was booked in at ten fifteen last night thats him sighed liam he uh he does like a drink every now and then gets him into all kinds of trouble added maddy were going to give him a right telling off so we are liam shook his head sternly i wouldnt want to be him when we get the fool home the woman nodded absently she picked out a reference number and began entering it on to a computer going to need you to sign a release form are either of you members of his immediate fam she stopped dead her mouth slung open her eyes on the screen it says the fbi came for him this morning the policewoman looked up at them you just missed him we transferred jurisdiction to them about ten minutes ago maddy swallowed nervously that doesnt sound good she stared uncertainly up at maddy and liam a look of growing suspicion in her eyes i uh you say you know this abraham lincoln youre associates of his associates that made them sound like criminals were like family sort of she said with a faltering smile uh is there a problem the policewoman ignored her question just one moment she turned away from them hurried across the front office to where the others were gathered still staring at the small tv set liam somethings really wrong hissed maddy the woman was saying something to the others then suddenly all five heads turned from the tv to look their way oh crud i think we should leave said maddy i think youre right liam waved his hand and called out to them hey you know what fellas well come back another time i can uhh see youre all rather busy he backed up a few steps from the counter and the plexiglas shield stay right where you are called out one of the plainclothes officers his hand absently reaching under his jacket oh crud hissed maddy sal stood between both support units outside on the pavement feeling strangely conspicuous she noticed the same eerie stillness here as shed seen on countless occasions in times square people standing motionless gazing up at the sky most of them with a mobile phone to one ear sharing these moments of horror with a loved one somewhere else in the city even some cars were still stopped at intersections though they had a green light their driverside doors open or window wound down to see better the thick pall of smoke filling the sky with all eyes tilted upwards it was only sal seen the sky far too many times already who noticed the black van smoothly rolling out of the precincts forecourt as it turned left on to the intersection and rolled past them she thought she spotted the ghost of a familiar bearded face through the grilled window in the back of the van uh was that becks looked back down what is it sal that van she pointed becks followed her finger the black van registration washington bll yeah i thought i just saw her uncertain voice faded to nothing as the van calmly weaved its way around the stopped traffic took a right and disappeared from view liam grabbed hold of maddys hand turned and ran out through the swing doors outside down three wide steps on the pavement sal and the other two looked up maddy called out sal i think we think we just saw abraham being driven away in a she stopped hey whats up maddy grasped her shoulder struggling to fill her wheezing lungs with air maddy you all right we wheeze we got a new plan what is it at that moment the double glass doors of the precinct swung open and several uniformed police emerged hands resting on their gun holsters looking around at the passing foot traffic on the pavement run chapter en route to quantico virginia lincoln glowered at his three captors in silence for the best part of an hour the horseless vehicle they were travelling in was uncomfortable and bare there were no windows that he could see out of clearly and the occasional lurching motion was beginning to make him feel sick he had no idea how long they had sat like this a man either side of him and one sitting opposite returning his glare through round wireframed glasses with cool professional contempt to his left a hatch suddenly snapped open revealing wire mesh and two more men in a cabin in front lincoln had the distinct impression that he was seeing the drivers the operators of this curious vehicle agent mead sir the man who had been silently staring at him turned and shuffled up the bench opposite what is it message from the new york field office sir the mans voice was hesitant well what is it what was muttered lincoln couldnt make out but for the first time he thought he saw a flicker of emotion on the bespectacled mans face the conversation was quick and the trapdoor snapped shut again the man shuffled back down the bench to look at lincoln once more his jaw was grinding away his lips pressed tightly the knuckles bulging on his fists as he silently clenched and flexed them finally in a voice clogged with emotion he spoke jesus he shook his head god knows how many innocent civilians just died one thousand five thousand ten thousand we may never know whats happened sir asked the agent to the left they came down both agents cursed north and south both of them the whole damned thing gone lincoln frowned for a moment and then realized the man was talking about those two magnificently tall buildings hed seen exploding back in that brick archway the two straight towers are completely destroyed now lincoln could see the man with the spectacles wanted so much to throw a punch at him but was doing his best to contain that urge nonetheless he decided it was worth another go explaining his bizarre circumstances now you must listen here sir i told those two rude gentlemen last night all about this i was trying to explain to the foolish ignoramus that i have somehow managed to travel in time id shut up if i were you good god sir this is a free country lincoln puffed his cheeks angrily i have a right to speak my mind sir right now no you dont do you know who i am sir sure i know who you are youre some scumbag whackjob terrorist some messedupinthehead fanatic who believes in killing innocent civilians to make some sort of screwedup point lincoln leaned forward and narrowed his eyes now you will hear me sir i shall be president of this country one day and the man wearing spectacles moved with a blur and lincoln found himself doubled over gasping for breath winded by a blow to his solar plexus he tried his best not to vomit on the metal floor between his feet agent belling you saw what just happened didnt you yes sir the vehicle lurched violently and the detainee fell on your fist sir precisely lincoln looked up at them what no that man just punched me like i said abraham said agent mead probably best if you shut up right now chapter new york he must have blabbed about nineeleven said maddy he must have said something about the twin towers being blown to pieces when he was arrested last night she looked at the others pointed to one of the computer screens he saw it all on there didnt he it is logical that with foreknowledge of the event the authorities will think he is involved said becks exactly i remember when nineeleven happened there were arrests going on all over the country you know like within hours of it all happening if the fbi have just whistled him away somewhere in the back of a van then they must believe hes some terrorist that hes involved in nineeleven somehow but if he is also telling them hes abraham lincoln said sal maybe they will just think hes a total crazy and let him go information this is an altered timeline said bob maddy nodded exactly bobs right its a timeline remember where there was no famous abraham lincoln he can tell them till hes blue in the face that hes the abraham lincoln it wont mean a frikkin thing to anyone she got up from her armchair and paced up and down the length of the kitchen table weve got to work out where theyre taking him and snatch him back before we get another wave coming along the next change could be a big one we need to find him quickly whats the fbi asked liam federal bureau of investigation said maddy special police if you like they investigate terrorists and criminals in fact theyre like extraspecial police like scotland yard maddy shrugged i guess liam nodded all right then and do they have a place they work from like us like our archway a base washington dc i think replied maddy quickly thats the fbi headquarters if i remember the x files correctly the x an old tv show its not important she replied look thats got to be where theyll have taken him thats what happened in the aftermath of nineeleven i remember reading about the fbi rounding up every suspiciouslooking character they could and processing them and the fbi holding them until the camp at guantanamo bay was up and running a few months later and ready to take them she turned to becks can you get computerbob to put together a data package on the fbi their hq layout location that kind of thing also any information on the suspects rounded up after nineeleven where precisely they were held yes maddy she turned to the others it doesnt seem like weve got a lot of choice i cant think of anything else we can do we need to make our way down to the fbis hq and she looked up at bob and if worst comes to worst bob youre going to have to do your onemanarmy thing and bust him out for us that will require extreme violence said bob i will need more weapons maddy nodded oh you can be sure of that this is going to get messy where did you say this fbi place was asked liam washington youve already done that journey liam remember liam frowned for a moment then recalled aye he and bob had travelled by truck from washington to new york through a very different america back in an america overrun by an occupation army of nazis were going to need a car then said sal a car and some big guns for bob liam glanced up at the support unit and grinned he does like rather big guns affirmative maddy planted her hands on the table and we need to get going soon i mean like in the next hour whos going asked sal we cant all go can we doesnt someone have to stay here maddy nodded sal was quite right somebody needed to stay right here to coordinate the opening of a return window well obviously you need to stay mads said liam we need you here to organize it all me bob and becks can do this the pair of em are an army between them more than a match for anyone so they are let me come with you said sal liam shook his head itll be dangerous youd be best staying here im always here im always safe i never get to do anything she turned to maddy looking to her for support this time please let me do something more than just watching for things liams right there may be shots fired if they have to i should be dead anyway right said sal all of us should be i should have been burned to death in mumbai with my family but im here now so every day is an extra every day is bonus time and whats the point if all i ever do is sit here and do nothing useful you are useful sal youre very useful youre our early warning system said maddy i want to do more sal folded her arms i need to do more maddy gazed down at the wooden table in silence glanced at the time on her wristwatch it was gone twelve oclock throughout today things across america were going to happen quickly right now somewhere amid the panicking corridors of power a femadirected order was being issued to suspend all aeroplane flights across the entire nation president bush was in airforce one in a holding pattern escorted by two f fighters the pentagon was on fire vice president dick cheney was sitting out the unfolding crisis in the presidential emergency operating center in the basement of the white house and abraham lincoln was if sal was right if she had seen him in the back of that black van undoubtedly being taken down to the fbis headquarters in washington to be interrogated he was probably already on the interstate heading south through new jersey ok she said presently ok this is what were doing no need to drive down there were going to open a window down there right now right outside the entrance to the fbis place not a time jump just a location jump she looked across the archway towards the computer desk becks was standing beside it motionless and engaged in a silent bluetooth conversation with computerbob just as soon as weve got information on the layout and some coordinates we can use she turned back to look at the others liam you and bob and ok you too sal youre going down there and can watch the traffic going in if you spot him if you actually see this black van and lincoln gawping out of the back window and think theres an opportunity to snatch him then you just go for it ok the three of them nodded meanwhile me and becks and computerbob we need to pool data we need to get every piece of information we can on how all the terror suspects were moved around in the first week after today where theyre being held how theyre moved so on and so on she shrugged if you guys miss him then were going to need to build up a picture of where all the terror suspects are being held during today if we lose him if we let the trail grow too cold we may never find him again i hate to think where thats going to take us i suspect were lucky that historys only tweaked itself so far she pulled out a handkerchief and blew her nose noisily sheesh and god knows how long thats going to last chapter new york half an hour later bob liam and sal stood in the middle of the archways floor just outside a faint handdrawn circle of chalk four foot in diameter within the circle the concrete floor was gone or more accurately scooped out leaving a shallow crater as if an impossibly large bowling ball had been dropped from the ceiling maddy hated the sight of it theyd refilled the small crater several times shed even bought a cheap throw rug to cover it but several times now theyd had to open a portal in the middle of the archway going dry that was their term for it going dry because thered not been enough time to fill the displacement tube with water now lets see maddy looked at her watch its nearly twelve thirty now if the fbi grabbed lincoln just after ninethirty its what a three maybe fourhour drive down interstate all the way south into virginia correct said becks that would be my calculation so ive set the coordinates for the slip road off interstate that leads to the grounds of the fbi academy at quantico its a pretty discreet quiet spot russell road theres a checkpoint where every vehicle has to slow down and stop you gotta show some id and stuff thats maybe the best place for you guys to keep watch she hunched over the desk and tapped at the keyboard as she spoke im not bumping you backwards or forwards in time its just a straight spatial transposition you should be there at that checkpoint before the van arrives she glanced back at sal if that is youre absolutely sure you saw lincoln in the back of it sals hesitant nod wasnt entirely reassuring ok then she clicked the mouse on a dialogue box and tapped in a oneminute countdown what about a return window asked liam do we not need to agree on a maddy rolled her eyes see the mysteriouslooking contraption sals holding liam turned to look at her she grinned as she held out her hand the mobile phone sitting on her palm just gimme a call ok and ill bring you right back home no need for funky fossils or ancient parchments this time oh liam looked sheepish right yes of course and look bob if that van looks like its full of swat guys wearing kevlar vests and packing big guns then dont be a dummy you may be a tough brute but youre not invincible i will operate within acceptable risk parameters she looked at liam its your decision to make ok if you feel its too dangerous then we can figure out something else at the very least well know where theyre holding him and we can work out some other plan of action aye ok so everyone good to go she checked the screen twenty seconds the displacement machines hum began to rise in pitch and volume careful guys ok particularly you sal let the boys do their work sal sucked in a tremulous breath clearly excited by the prospect of doing something more proactive than sitting idle and intently watching the world for subtle changes i will a draught swept across the archway sending sweet wrappers flying and pizza boxes shifting across the desk before them a shimmering sphere of daylight had suddenly pulsed into existence see you soon maddy called out above the hum of energy sal waggled her hand as liam took the first step into the portal she watched him vanish then a moment later sal gritting her teeth and wincing as she stepped in then finally bob close the window please computerbob obliged and the spherical field collapsed into a single point and vanished she sat down beside becks facing the dim glow of a row of monitors all of them showing news feeds from different channels a variety of livefootage angles of the same thing the smouldering ruins of the world trade center and the dustcovered ghostly faces of a thousand firemen paramedics and police officers staring in stunned silence a frozen tableau the only movement seemed to be the stillfluttering sheets of paper circling restlessly in the sky like a flock of birds taking flight to seek a new home chapter quantico virginia liam bob and sal squatted down amid the tall grass beneath the shadow of a red cedar tree at the bottom of the freshly clipped sloping lawn was a singlelane road winding its way anonymously through the woods towards the grounds of the fbis academy fifty yards in front of them a small portakabin all scuffed plastic windows and corrugated iron housed a pair of security guards both of them were staring at the glow of a tv on a desk inside where they were crouching at the edge of the tree line on a normal day the guards would probably have spotted them by now but today both of them were glued to their television set a brass band couldve marched past them and they wouldnt have noticed bob said liam if that van does turn up and i give you the order to go and rescue mr lincoln whats your plan bobs eyes narrowed in consideration for a moment incapacitate the vehicle first then incapacitate any armed guards and proceed with extracting the target from the van we want to get our fella out of there unharmed so we do affirmative he grunted i will assess the threat of harm to lincoln and proceed only if the percentage is favourable but youre not going to kill those guards in that hut are you said sal looking at them theyre just old men bob frowned at her if they are an obstruction to the mission objective they will be a valid target just give em one of your battleroars bob said liam he nudged sal gently you should hear him hed seen men recoil from it before a fleeting recollection filled his mind the front few ranks of an army of veteran knights and grimfaced mercenaries had faltered albeit for a moment at the monstrous sight of bob standing astride a mound of rubble at the base of the breached wall of nottingham that heartbeat moment before the clash of arms the thundering of thousands of boots the jangling of a million rings of chain mail the rising crescendo of every charging man screaming a noise of hate rinsed with fear but above all that thered been the deep bellow of bobs roar like some sort of grizzly bear calling from one valley to the next thatll scare the bejayzus out of them two poor fellas theyll scarper like rabbits so they will my size can be intimidating said bob matteroffactly that is a factor that works in my favour do a scary face bob said liam something really gnarly scary face yeah sort of like your angry face but much more so bob pulled up a file from memory his brows suddenly rumpled and joined into the menacing ridge of a monobrow his thick horselips pulled back to reveal a row of teeth that looked like they could stamp holes through sheet metal you remind me of a big badtempered dog thats had its chewy bone taken away said sal liam shrugged perhaps but would you hold your ground with a face like that bearing down on you actually she imagined she probably wouldnt the three of them were silent for a while the only sounds the restful faroff hiss of interstate traffic the muted burbling of the tv set and the turfwar chirping call of jays and thrushes in the thick branches above them so tell me im interested are you happy with how todays gone lincoln looked up from his feet at agent mead sitting opposite is that what makes your day hmmm killing innocent american civilians lincolns jaw set i am an american sir oh yeah but what you dont like the way america is is that it this is your way of changing it for the better is it i have no knowledge of your two towers or who it is that has decided to destroy them right nodded the agent sarcastically youre still going with the ive come from another time story that is the fact of the matter sir yes the agent shrugged so then lets run with the ball shall we run with the ball why dont you tell me your timetravel tale again it is no fiction sir i live in the year eh i bet this is all pretty weird then huh lincoln sensed the man was mocking him of course he answered drily as it would be to you if you had journeyed across one hundred and seventy years of time so you must think its pretty far out huh spacey futuristic the other two men were quietly laughing along with their boss well since you ask i think this world is decidedly rude what i have seen of it rude the agent shook his head thats priceless he grinned amused by that go on youre almost convincing lincoln was happy to although what i have seen of its constructions and devices are quite beyond my comprehension i do see clearly it is an amoral selfish world really quite so sir and lazy why is it that everyone is so fat the van leaned into a turning and then began to slow down ah looks like were nearly there said the agent he smiled coldly at lincoln the next bunch of fellas wholl be asking you questions arent going to be quite so indulgent abraham youre soon going to be thinking of us as the nice guys trust me through the partition at the front they could hear the driver talking to someone a crisp professional exchange youre going to vanish into a dark cell somewhere abraham every day of the rest of your life is going to be an extremely unpleasant one and while all thats going on i want you to think long and hard about what you and your terrorist buddies have done all the innocent people youve wiped out today there was the muffled sound of a voice raised as a challenge a moment later the crack of a handgun what the they heard a loud thud against the van making the whole vehicle rock and a side panel bulge inwards all three agents began to fumble inside their jackets for their weapons the rear door of the van was suddenly wrenched open blinding daylight spilling inside lincoln looked up his eyes narrowed against the glare and recognized the outline of the giant hed seen in that archway yesterday the men in suits had their guns out aimed and were all shouting in unison at the giant man to raise his hands when as one they simply stopped jumping jeezus what in gods name is that gasped agent mead the giant man paused and turned to look round at what they were staring at finally lincoln did the same looking out of the back of the van he saw it for himself an impossible sky chapter quantico virginia liam and sal stood up together and emerged from beneath the low branches of the cedar tree to get a better look at the rapidly advancing wall of reality chasing its way towards them across the virginian countryside at first it looked like a whole continental shelf was filling the blue sky as if the earths crust had split and broken and one half of north america was sliding across and engulfing the other but it wasnt solid it churned and changed like a liquid reality as it raced towards them like brewing stormcloud formations filmed and then played in fast forward in among the looming darkness faint watermarks of fleeting possibility appeared fantastic buildings that had never been twisted creatures that had no place on this earth and a sea of tormented faces lives glimpsed momentarily people that could have been but never would be oh boy gulped liam its going to be a big one right sal nodded yes a big one then it was upon them the slam of a tornado moment a maelstrom of thrashing energy and darkness liam kept his eyes open absolutely determined to witness it all this his first time to see a time wave up close to be outside the archway and see for himself what reality replacing reality actually looked like in the few seconds of it he thought he glimpsed a roman soldier morph into something half human half mechanical the screaming tormented face of a newborn baby become a girl a woman an old woman a decaying skull a complete life lived in no more than a second then it had passed over them liam turned to watch it go a twisting undulating serpentlike ribbon of black across the sky receding away from them like a freight train jayzus breath failed him he sucked in a lungful and tried again jayzusmarynjoseph did you did you ever see anything like that he gasped he looked beside him sal was on the ground all of a sudden kneeling amid rows of shinhigh stalks of something a harvested crop of wheat or corn maybe liam helped her up that was incredible he grinned manically at her sal looked around them this is very different liam liam hadnt even bothered to take the new reality in yet his mind was still on the infinite possibilities hed glimpsed in the time wave he turned round to look where bob and the van and the guard hut had been only moments ago they were in a large rolling field the woodland behind them was gone fifty yards away he was relieved to see bob standing perfectly still nonchalantly studying the new world around them and then a moment later the tousled brush hair of lincolns head emerging from the stalks as he began to sit up come on said liam they wandered over towards bob and lincoln lincoln was on his feet now he saw liam approaching that that storm that hurricane we we aye liam nodded thats the sort of thing you get when you remove something from history that shouldnt be removed you you are talking about me are you not aye lincoln looked around at the field goggleeyed i are you telling me sir that i make this much difference to the world so it seems good god liam said bob quietly i cannot conceive of of lincoln continued to bluster of of anything i might do in my life that could so alter a world as much as this he looked down at his big hands what could these do that could change a world so liam said bob again his eyes on the sky yeah said sal liam her eyes were on the same thing as bobs she patted his arm insistently as a shadow fell across the field liam turned round and looked up oh was all that rolled out of his mouth lincoln managed more gods teeth he boomed what in tarnation is that a gigantic copper boiler hung in the sky slowly drifting across the fields perhaps three hundred four hundred feet long the afternoon sun glinted warmly on its copperplated side slung beneath it was what appeared to be a building of some sort a confusion of pipes and chimneys silos ladders and gantries round portholes and hatchlike doorways on several floors it seemed to be held beneath the copper behemoth by four immense cranelike arms holding the building like a mother cradling a child they watched it slowly drift above them across their field of ragged stalks to another field rolling over a hill in front of them it moved silently no roar of engines just the sound of wind rustling through the gaps in the building suspended beneath thrumming taut cables clinking chains loose and swinging eventually it began to settle down to earth a quarter of a mile away from them nearing the ground the large crane arms hissed steam from their elbows and gently flexed lowering the building between them to the ground it settled on thick stilts that adjusted to the uneven tilt with the audible hiss and thud of compressed air until it was level shaddyah now that sal nodded that is really really cool the enormous airship rose slowly its crane arms retracting to leave the building standing free in the middle of the field after a few moments they began to see some activity a large door opening and a wide ramp emerging extending down to the ground then finally something that looked vaguely familiar to liam a tractor belching steam rumbled out on caterpillar tracks and down the ramp followed by another and another and finally a stream of figures the buildings chimney stacks started puffing tendrils of smoke and they heard the clunk and whir of machinery starting up in the field its a portable farm thats what it is liam laughed a bleedin pickmeup and putmedown farm lincoln shaded his eyes with a hand am i to presume such a fantastic construction as this is not normal to your time this is our time mr lincoln said sal just a very different version of it everything changed yet we did not lincoln looked confused how is that its because none of us should be here now anyway right liam looked at bob correct none of you should be alive in or be part of therefore you are not affected by the causal change of the time wave liam looked at the slowly ascending airship i think it might be advisable we find somewhere to hide until we know exactly what sort of a world were in right now everyone agree heads nodded liam looked around and spotted what appeared to be a derelict barn across the far side of the already harvested field off we go then he said sal glanced one more time at the ascending sky vessel she noticed it was segmented and as it gracefully gathered height its segments began to stretch and spread gradually telescoping along its length until it looked like the sleek hull of an antique submarine come on sal liam called after her she looked once more at the recently deposited building to her eyes it looked more like a factory than a farm and at the small figures descending the ramp emerging into the field disappearing into the distant crop of wheat or barley or whatever it was there was something peculiar about the way they moved a shuffling inelegant gait that made them look strangely topheavy strangely apelike sal im coming im coming chapter new york maddy rocked on her heels then for a moment she was actually airborne everything on the desk in front of her hovering a bare inch for less than a heartbeat she reached out for the corner of the desk to keep her balance as the whole archway lurched then convulsed with the boneshaking impact of something hard beneath them beneath showers of grit and cement dust cascaded down from the roof along with dozens of bricks clattering to the floor and exploding in clouds of redbrick powder oh my god was that an earthquake the computer monitors and the archways lights flickered out in unison and from the back room maddy heard the deafening crash of what sounded like a significant chunk of the archway roof collapsing in in the dark she winced at the sound of damage and chaos going on around her wondering if the entire williamsburg bridge was going to come crumbling down on her like a house of cards the rumbling outside that had preceded the quake faded away and finally it was quiet save for the patter of grit still trickling down from the loosened bricks above them becks you ok affirmative her voice came back out of the darkness maddy fumbled with her hands along the desk feeling empty soda cans and pens and pads finally finding her inhaler she took a pull on it and it rattled and wheezed giving up its medication and easing the tightness of her throat my god i thought that was a wave i believe it was replied becks her voice was further away now on the other side of the arch maddys legs bumped gently against one of the office chairs she sat down in it gratefully its never felt like that before though she could hear becks fiddling with something there is no power feed to the shutter motor maddy looked around the pitch black she couldnt even see any standbymode leds no power at all the generator in the back room should have fired up by now she should have heard that rhythmic thudding already instead nothing do you wish for me to open the shutter asked becks her heart flipped a beat at the thought of checking the state of the world outside given that moment of freefall and the horrendous crash a second later she wasnt sure what to expect out there still sitting here in the dark and clutching her inhaler wasnt going to achieve much yes go on then she heard the handle being cranked and the clack of chains then after a few seconds her darkadjusted eyes picked out a faint ribbon of light along the bottom as it widened and brightened a pall of muted daylight spread across into the archway and her heart sank as she saw their floor littered with rubble and shattered brick a deep crack ran across it a palms width at its widest exposing old pipes and dusty stress cables she suspected the whole archway the bridges entire support stanchion was structurally unstable perhaps even so damaged that if they ever got out of this fix and returned to normality they might need to find a new home the thought unnerved her more than anything she realized shed grown accustomed to this place it was the anchor this grubby dungeon when all around her was a swirling sea of chaos it was the one constant in all the crises theyd been through together thus far thered always been here this archway this desk this chair in which to hide lick their wounds and ponder a solution maddy got up and picked her way across the floor towards the widening ribbon of light where the backstreet was outside she could make out fallen brickwork rubble weeds poking through it reminded her of kramers apocalypse maybe history had somehow managed to double back on that other alternate world a nightmare landscape of irradiated ruins and those pitiful mutated creatures whod once been human she stood beside becks thats high enough she whispered if there were unspeakable horrors outside ready to attack them then she didnt want the shutter door wide open she chewed her lip anxiously im not sure i wanna see this one becks said nothing her eyes grey noncommittal impassive waiting for maddy to issue her orders ok no point me being all girly right she mumbled before ducking down squeezing under the shutter and emerging outside still squatting on her haunches she got her first glimpse oh sweet jesus becks stooped down low and joined her outside together they slowly stood up to get a better view of the world around them new york was barely recognizable the williamsburg bridge above them ended in a twisted mass of cables railway lines and fragmented road tarmac that angled down into the east river it looked like it was a casualty of war from some time ago they were perched at an awkward angle at the bottom of a large shallow crater she took a dozen tentative steps up the side and looked out over the uneven lip halfway across the east river she could see the stumps of the bridges midway support stanchions on the far side swathed in a thin mist manhattan island looked like a moonscape of grey rubble punctuated with the barely standing skeletons of bombedout buildings like a dozen hands worth of broken fingers pointing accusingly at the sky a long time ago a lifetime ago it seemed now maddy used to play a computer game called call of duty a second world war shooter one of the better multiplayer levels had been set amid the bombedout ruins of stalingrad a twisting maze of gutted halfcollapsed buildings craters blownopen cellars what she was staring at now was pretty much just that she turned to look at the state of things on their side of the river brooklyn was almost equally unrecognizable although the devastation seemed one degree less total on this side of the river all the buildings were gutted skeletons shattered artillery or bombdamaged and blackened with soot there were however some almost complete frames of buildings standing still a factory building to their right across a pockmarked and cratered quay had no roof but at least it still had four complete walls lined with empty window frames scarred splintered and gouged by shrapnel and gunfire its a war zone said maddy becks joined her and nodded affirmative there is extensive evidence of prolonged war maddy looked at her no kidding look said becks pointing up at the sky maddy followed her finger and saw through a haze of fog that seemed to fill the whole sky like a lowhanging autumn mist the ghostly outline of several large shapes that moved slowly and purposefully together like a pod of whales what the hell are those aircraft too slow for airplanes said maddy and too large they look like balloons or zeppelins of some kind they watched the faint shapes manoeuvre their profiles long and nautically slender topped by an irregular outline of stacked protrusions that made them look eerily like battleships then through the haze maddy caught a strobing flicker of light on the ground a distant flash through the haze that momentarily revealed the brokenteeth outlines of far far away bombdamaged buildings a moment later they heard the faint percussive thump of explosions sounds like some place is being bombed whispered maddy it is a war that is still in progress said becks maddy looked across the river at the ruins of manhattan the hazy air over there was clearing momentarily and she was able to see a little more detail she saw movement the glint of metal something that looked like a gun turret slowly rotating on an artillery platform in among all the chaos of gutted skyscrapers knotted and rusting support cables sagging floors and slopes of rubble and dust she thought she detected the regular ordered geometry of pillboxes and bunkers she turned her back on the river and manhattan to look northeast towards brooklyn and queens or what was left of it across warehouses with collapsed roofs and twisted industrial cranes no good to anyone now low apartment blocks pockmarked and deserted she thought she also saw the telltale signs of an entrenched front line great she muttered just great what is it madelaine she turned to gesture at their archway little more than a crumbling mound of red bricks somehow still managing to hold together and not collapse in on themselves thats a front line over the river and on this side over there that looks like another front line which of course makes where were standing nomans land their pitifullooking archway was half buried at the bottom of this large crater it looked like it was an old crater from an older war it was bisected by a shallow trough lined with sandbags in places and almost completely filled in in other places abandoned trench works abandoned some time ago by the look of them an old battle line left to slowly fill itself in she wondered who the soldiers hunkered down amid the rubble of manhattan were she turned to look at the signs of defence structures amid the shattered industrial ruins of brooklyn and wondered who was dug in there not that it mattered we dont want to be stuck here she glanced back at the archway looking like a pile of bricks salvaged recycled from some old tenement block pulled down to be replaced with something else a mound of broken masonry at the edge of a building site she supposed back inside while it was still managing to hold itself up the news wasnt going to be any better sensitive equipment computers motherboards how any of that could have survived that impact wed better go back inside and see if anythings working she said eventually chapter new york colonel william devereau could feel the vibrations of the distant bombing raid through the floor it felt like they were giving the front line further north up near queens a pounding they liked to do that every few days a reminder that they had air superiority and could deliver destruction on any stretch of the front line that they chose not that it achieved a whole great deal their carpet bombing would create another hundred new craters shift rubble around from one place to another and maybe inflict a few dozen casualties but that was about the size of it all the way along the new york sector they were dug in deep as ticks the damage was psychological if anything devereau pulled out a crumpled packet of cigarettes gitanes french made they were as bitter as bile but far better than the americanmade lungshredders he lit up took a pull and hacked a gobful of thick phlegm on to the floor he might have bothered to quit smoking except for the fact that statistically speaking a snipers bullet or a skynavy bomb would probably get him first anyway quicker than cancer he took this mornings highcommand communique and swiped open the sealed envelope with the tip of his bayonet his french was just about passable he could read it even if he struggled to speak it a page of telegraphed pronouncements the usual rubbish the war was going well the sheridandegrise line running from the atlantic west across america was holding true the troops were to be congratulated and to be told keep up the good work devereau balled up the communique and tossed it on to his small desk few of the troops spoke a word of french anyway he could just as well tell them anything he wanted french was the language of high echelons of command the unions generals were mostly imported most of them wellconnected parisbased sons of billionaires who fancied carving out a few years of military glory for themselves before settling down to a cosy life back in mainland europe the troops on the other hand the poor wretches cowering in their bunkers right now and hoping todays bombing raid wasnt going to drift further south were all local boys lads from michigan pennsylvania new york state ohio sons of soldiers grandsons of soldiers whod held the line here for the union for the last hundred and thirtyodd years he laughed dryly at that once upon a time it was the union of northern american states but not any more the union by name perhaps but no longer run by american generals and presidents he sighed long ago hed given up trying to explain to the lads under his command that the french and their other european allies werent over here bankrolling this war for them for their dream of a united nation of free men they were doing it for all their own reasons political reasons complicated reasons that were hard to explain to young men who could barely read and write anyway careless talk like that about their french benefactors could end up with him smoking one of these gitanes in front of a hastily assembled firing squad ah well do your duty come what may fais ce que dois advienne que pourra on the wall of his small bunker room damp concrete sweated in patches among the patches hung an old sepia photograph in a wooden frame a collectors item now devereau stood in front of it and studied the row of generals in camp chairs smiling for the photographer as they held their ceremonial sabres to one side generals from the old old times the very first period of the civil war generals all of them proud sons of america meade sherman grant hancock thick whiskers and proud smiles beneath their soft felt hats a soldier could fight and die for men like that for a cause like that a united america for freedom he shook his head sadly but not for this not for what this stale war had become generation after generation of american boys dying on one side for the french the room vibrated from the sonic boom of faroff ordnance and on the other side for the british chapter quantico virginia the inside of the derelict barn smelled of compost the afternoon light spearing in between the loose wooden slats and catching sluggish airborne motes of dust here thisll do us for now said liam catching his breath lincoln sat down on a desiccated bale of hay young lady he began still out of breath himself and gentlemen we meet again third time to my counting he frowned liam liam oconnor if memory serves me aye please now please tell me my timely escape from that underbridge dungeon of yours is not the cause of all this this alteration liam laughed desperately im afraid that and your untimely jumping into our window home from new orleans mr lincoln thats whats caused this all right a bit reckless and not too clever of you truth be told you have become a timeline anachronism rumbled bob until you are safely returned to your original timestamp history will remain contaminated and this timeline will persist sal handed him a worn smile youve been a very naughty boy so it would seem lincoln looked down at his feet sombre i believe i owe you all an apology liam getting warm inside the barn unzipped and took off his jacket one of a bunch of hooded sweatshirts branded with various sports team names splayed across them that sal had purchased for him from walmart some time ago he wore them without knowing without particularly caring who the yankees redsocks or the bulls were bob what do you suggest we do now recommendation we should remain here for the moment liam and await a tachyon signal they know our location madelaine will attempt to open a return window for us if she can said liam bob nodded correct if she can lincoln looked up your timetravelling machinery is broken the displacement machine requires a lot of power so it does we draw it in from the citys supply a lot of it liam said unfastening the buttons of his waistcoat if new york has changed and were not getting any energy then we have a bit of a problem we have a generator though said sal aye for what good the thing does maddyll be running it by now she replied it just takes a little while to charge up the machine this is only a positional translation said bob the energy requirement for the return portal will be small i estimate only three per cent of capacity charge would be required sal peered out between the wooden slats there then shouldnt be too long for us to wait what if this portal of yours does not appear asked lincoln what then are we stuck in this place jahulla sal made a face are you always this pessimistic he shrugged no woodsman ever felled a tree by smiling like a fool at it liam pursed his lips very poetic he joined sal in looking out at the distant farmcumrefinery and the fleet of smokebelching tractors and combines buzzing around in the field the first of the vehicles was returning up the ramp and into the cavernous dark entrance of some sort of delivery bay with a payload of harvested crop it reminded him bizarrely of termites feeding their queen he shuddered at the unpleasant comparison if maddys got technical problems her end he began jayzus now when does she ever not then i suppose well not be getting a portal back home said liam hang on said sal its worth a go i guess she pulled the mobile phone out of the pouch of her hoody flipped it open selected maddys phone on quick dial and held it up to her ear a moment later she shook her head no signal liam looked back outside up at the sky blue and cloudless just like the normal september had been the sun had dipped past midday an hour ago and glinted with a bronze warmth off the hull of the airborne vessel hovering several miles away and yet still looking impossibly large if theres nothing from maddy by the time it gets dark it means shes got problems no power most likely he shucked his shoulders which means weve got good news and bad news sal turned to look at him bad news first liam you should always do bad news first all right bad news is it means were walking home the good news is that if maddys got no power the archway field wont be on which means it wont reset without us he looked at bob i suggest tonight we start making our way northeast back to new york what do you think affirmative that is a valid plan if we maintain a direct trueline route back to new york i will be able to detect any narrowbeam tachyon signal she might attempt to send tonight night sir said lincoln night why on earth would you want to choose the night to walk home its when all manner of scoundrels and thieves emerge for their nefarious purposes liam continued to study the distant airborne object i dont know about you but im a little nervous about all that stuff out there thats pretty advanced technology isnt it bob the support unit joined him beside the wall of the barn and peered out the airborne vessel may be using lighterthanair technology you mean like a balloon like them nazi airships affirmative the ground vehicles appear to be using conventional combustion engine technology comparable to the normal timeline he turned to liam with closer inspection we could determine more precisely what technology levels exist in this alternate timeline uhh how about we dont make a closer inspection he slapped bob gently on his back nice idea an all bob but to be entirely honest id rather we just made our way back home as quickly and as quietly as we can i agree said sal she was going to say something about being a little perturbed by the workers shed glimpsed emerging from the refinery and shuffling down the ramp barely more than dots at that distance but thered been something unsettling almost inhuman about the way they moved nighttime i suggest mr lincoln said liam given these people have big floaty air vessels wed be far more easily spotted in the day nighttime lincoln grumbled well now mr oconnor we shall just have to hope this is a safer world by night than my home place time he shrugged the end of the sentence away he was still struggling with the terminology of time travel oh i wouldnt worry too much said sal weve got big bad bob hell look after us affirmative i am a support unit your safety mr lincoln is a primary mission parameter you are to be safely escorted to the new york field office and from there returned to anyway sal put on a cheery smile im sure maddys going to get things up and running and open that portal any time soon right liam he tried to wear the same breezy optimism on his face but it didnt take instead he cocked a sceptical eyebrow at her i presume youre talking about some other team there sal right uh why well to be sure and id hate to think i sound as grumpy as our new lanky friend here but he shrugged it never bleedin well seems to go quite that smoothly for us chapter new york maddy stared heartbroken at the small mound of debris in the back room a portion of the ceiling had completely collapsed through a jagged hole in the brickwork above she could see shards of sunlight poking through the bricks had cascaded down on to two of the growth tubes shattering the plastic and spilling the protein solution and foetuses on to the floor there was nothing that could be done for either of the growth candidates one of each a baby bob and a baby becks they were quite dead oh god oh no this is awful their relatively new generator was damaged as well the casing battered and dented a panel on one side had been knocked away and dangled from the frayed remains of several cables all the damage had been caused when the archway had appeared in this alternate reality hovering several feet above the ground where the crater was the whole archway had dropped by almost a yard enough of a shock for the old brickwork held together by crumbling cement prayer and gravity that it had failed them i have evaluated the damage madelaine the general structure of the archway is severely compromised she nodded silently the generator is not functional at the moment although it is possible that i might be able to repair it i will need to first dig away the bricks to assess the level of damage becks pointed to the shattered tubes those two tubes cannot be repaired the other three growth tubes are undamaged however the foetuses inside them will be viable for only another fortyeight hours without power just gets better and better maddy replied the sound of her voice scared her it was small defeated barely more than a whisper becks looked at her missing the irony entirely no there is worse news madelaine maddy nodded at becks to go on the tachyon transmission array is completely destroyed maddy cursed under her breath the transmission array was an important piece of equipment a relatively small but efficiently crafted signal transfer dish that had sat quietly in the far corner of the back room and until now never ever warranted her specific attention it did its job had never required any maintenance the only reason she knew of its existence at all was because shed recently out of sheer boredom read through a manifest of the technical components in the archway but now there it was smashed to bits nothing more than a twisted mesh of fine wires and shattered eggshell silicon maddy had a fair idea what that meant we cant signal bob can we correct more importantly even if we had an adequate source of electricity we will be unable to open or close any displacement windows those words failed to fully register with her what did you say we use the same array to target signals as we do to target tachyon stream pulses to open a portal madelaine without the transmission array we are completely unable to open any portals we are unable to operate in any meaningful way this field office is no longer able to function maddy felt her legs wobble and give way and before she knew it she was slumped on her knees among the pile of red bricks and cement powder tears streamed uncontrollably down her dustcovered face leaving clean tracks on her cheeks in their wake madelaine are you ok no not really maddy burbled she buried her face in her hands bricks shifted and slid as becks stepped round carefully and squatted down in front of her she reached out and gently pulled one of maddys hands away from her face for a moment she studied maddys eyes screwed up behind the round glasses red and puffy why are you crying she asked softly almost tenderly maddy sniffed wiped her cheeks with the back of her hand what the hell else am i going to do were totally screwed thats us finished this time might as well just i dunno just curl up and and that is not a sensible course of action madelaine maddy looked at her becks quite impassive and calm almost childlike in the way she was squatting on the bricks like some wartime child playing tea party with her broken dolls amid the rubble of her own home oblivious to her fate dont you see becks were all done here were finished she stood up and clattered her way slowly across the bricks towards the doorway leading back into the main arch she left becks still squatting on her haunches patiently awaiting further instructions madelaine maddy looked around the mess of the archway the airborne dust that had filled the place half an hour ago had now settled leaving a light pale coating of powder on everything madelaine becks called again from the back room her voice normally so commanding surprisingly deep for her feminine frame right now sounded almost like the forlorn bleating of a lamb maddy made her way across the floor over the wide crack in the concrete and ducked under the open shutter to look out again at the grey ruins of new york smudges of smoke marked the horizon to the north queens where the bombing raid had taken place earlier and the salmonpink sun now settling behind the tortured skeletons of manhattans once fine and proud buildings cast dappled paintbrush strokes of meagre warmth across the nomans land the only colour on this colourless landscape beckss faint voice echoed out of the archway after her once more madelaine what are my orders she ignored the support unit left her sitting in the gathering darkness among the bricks abandoned like an orphaned child madelaine one step in front of the other in the gathering twilight each one easier than the last she realized she could leave walk away from it all walk away from the responsibilities shed never asked for walk away from secrets she didnt ask to know about if all their field office was now was a crumbling archway and a bunch of machines that didnt work any more what difference would it make if she stayed or left she realized something i can go she turned her back on the east river manhattan and the sun setting beyond and faced northeast towards the ruins of brooklyn towards boston home perhaps even in this alternate timeline the same people had met fallen in love and made the same babies and somewhere northeast of here in her home city there was a little girl with glasses and frizzy strawberryred hair who liked messing around with her fathers electronics toolset rather than playing with barbie dolls perhaps that home was there perhaps her mom and dad were the same two people and she could explain to them who she was get them to understand she was their daughter but ten years older for them it would be like having an older sister for their only child a sister who could understand her in a way no normal sister could a mentor a guide a friend her faltering steps across the rubblestrewn landscape quickened a part of her argued the case that she still had responsibilities and obligations here liam and sal they too were stuck in this whatever this world was but what could she do for them sit on her bunk and wait for them in the dark wait until some bombing raid came here and decided to give this portion of the city another pounding maddy shook the nagging voice away she really hadnt needed becks to catalogue to her how complete and catastrophic the damage was to their equipment in the absence of a plan or anything left of their field office for which she had to be responsible there was only one small voice that made sense a childlike voice i want to go home chapter somewhere in virginia the chinese man looked down at them surprised new york you wan go new york thats right said liam you crazee he shook his head i take you far as dead city no more i goin west new pittsburgh maybe cleveland you shou go west too dead city the man shrugged said something to his wife sitting beside him in the oddlooking vehicles front cabin he turned back to liam yuh dead city you know ol times use to be call baltimore it was dark and liam could only see the side of the mans face lit by the paper lantern swinging in the fresh breeze he read the expression as friendly bemusement you and your friends sit in back with chickens i take you north some way the one eye liam could see glinted in the lanterns amber light it was locked suspiciously on him you no trouble liam spread his hands turned to make sure bob had tucked the shotgun away out of sight i promise you sir well be no trouble he glanced at the side of the mans vehicle it reminded him of a traditional romany gypsy caravan every surface seemed to be lavishly decorated with intricate oriental designs and down along the side a multitude of hooks protruded from which pots and pans and other kitchen miscellany rattled and clanged softly as the gentle breeze stirred ears of corn either side of the empty road well just be in the back then said liam keeping your chickens company the chinese man nodded satisfied with that then turned to his wife and began chattering to her she didnt seem quite so pleased to have passengers come aboard they made their way to the back of the caravan it rattled and vibrated from the idling engine beneath which intermittently spat clouds of vapour out between the spokes of its six wide wooden cartwheels liam pulled open a wire mesh gate at the rear and stepped up inside to see a cramped space almost completely filled with carefully stacked household possessions the rest of them followed suit the vehicle lurching alarmingly as bob finally pulled himself up inside and slammed the mesh door behind him there was just about room for the four of them to huddle on the floor shoulders rubbing shoulders and legs pulled up in front of them with a cough and a splutter the vehicle lurched forward and a thousand different objects around them began to squeak and rattle and clank it might not be the most comfortable ride for them but at least it was taking them in the right direction north towards new york so far thered been nothing from maddy no portal no message not a good sign liam was thinking of something interesting to say when with a flutter of dislodged feathers a rooster emerged from behind a wobbling cupboard and settled on top of bobs head oh sorry said liam i actually thought he was uh you know joking about having chickens in the back bob swiped a big hand at it and the bird scrambled and flapped around the enclosed space for a full minute before finally tentatively returning to roost on his head again no place like home offered liam bob stared indignantly back at him you sir look about as happy as a clam at high tide bob switched to stare indignantly at lincoln suits you said sal affectionately patting his arm chapter somewhere in virginia as dawn started to make its mark on the horizon the chinese man deposited them at a junction of roads one of them heading west the other continuing north he warned liam once again that heading north to new york was no good why whats going on in new york the question caused the man to cock his head curiously you serious he didnt wait for liam to answer you been sleep all your life the city it all gone now new york it just big ruin a ruin whats up with it he turned round to the others standing beside him on the shoulders of the road sals eyes were wide her face ashen how you not know this the man asked incredulous well weve been away a long time liams answer sounded lame and the chinese man shrugged a whatever as if to acknowledge that the answer maybe wasnt his business the war it stay there it never move on been there forever war lincoln took a step closer great scott did you say war sir the chinese man leaned back in his cabin wary of the tall mans belligerent face yeah you not know of war no sir a war between who man tell me liam rested a hand on lincolns shoulder easy there fella the chinese mans wife uttered something into his ear and he nodded firing up the engine on his carriage it coughed and clattered noisily before settling down to a noisy chug he was clearly getting a little nervous of these crazies hed picked up and deposited here on this crossroads in the middle of nowhere please said liam dont go yet we need to know more i tell you this it not safe north fighting there never stop you shou go west he pointed east across the rolling fields of barley east no good too dead city maybe twentyfive mile that way poison not good for you health he shrugged an apology as his wife tugged insistently on his arm we go now the carriages large wheels rolled forward on to the road as a fan of acrid smoke erupted through the spokes liam coughed and wafted it out of his face and as it gradually cleared he watched the carriage clatter rattle and chug its way along the road heading towards new pittsburgh or at least thats what the handpainted sign at the junction indicated they watched until the carriage was just a faint twinkle of swinging lanterns in the distance i suppose we should find somewhere to hide before it gets too light said liam he looked around on either side of the roads heading north south and west as far as his eyes could see in the grey light of dawn it was nothing but shoulderhigh ears of barley swaying gently and whispering they followed the singlelane road heading north only a dozen vehicles passed them by most of them ramshacklelooking carriages carrying families and their worldly possessions stacked high one vehicle in particular sounded different enough as it approached from the distance for bob to suggest they hide and they did crouching in the field amid the stalks of barley as it drew nearer came into view and eventually rolled slowly past them sal exchanged a glance with liam the vehicle was military a tank being perhaps the most appropriate word to describe it it looked almost comically top heavy the approximate proportions of a small terraced house the top floor was a large gun turret that looked like it probably rotated from which protruded three shortbarrelled cannons at the very top a hatch was open and a tiredlooking army officer in a crimson tunic and white sash was smoking a pipe and gazing out across the rolling fields the bottom floor of the tank was a mass of iron plating and rivets flanked on either side by caterpillar tracks that ground noisily along the tarmac road the tracks wound round a large solid iron rear wheel and at the front a much smaller spoked wheel between the wheels on each side a miniature sidecannon protruded as it slowly passed them by sal got a glance at the rear of the tanks bulky chassis ironplated shutters were open revealing three panes of glass like the bay window of a suburban house through them she could see by the muted amber light of a gas lamp half a dozen soldiers gathered around a table having breakfast by the look of it and bunk beds in threehigh stacks they watched the enormous vehicle trundling its way northwards the rumble of its engine and the squeak and groan of the caterpillar tracks continued to hang in the air long after theyd lost sight of it in the pallid grey light of dawn liam looked at the others that looked like a gentlemans club on wheels an hour later just after the sun had breached the horizon they finally came across a smaller potholed lane that branched off the road and led into what appeared to be a small deserted hamlet they soon found themselves on a village green overgrown with weeds the buildings surrounding it were boarded up and derelict over every groundfloor window wooden slats had been nailed in place years ago by the sunbleached look of them a ghost town said sal aye bob strode towards the door of the nearest building a chapel its timber slat walls were flecked with white paint here and there but most of it was the dull pale grey of weathered wood information his baritone voice rumbled as he reached out a hand to hold down the frayed and curled corner of a notice tacked to the chapels door the others joined him as he read out the faint printed words on the tattered page notice of clearance this settlement has been evacuated in accordance with the war appropriations act it is an illegal act to enter occupy andor make use of these properties which are scheduled to be cleared and used as additional farmland in due course its an old notice said sal pointing at a date in the corner see fifth of june been deserted for what liam frowned as he struggled to do the maths sixteen years said bob right im thirsty liam said sal he realized he too was thirsty the cool of dawn was soon going to become the cloying warmth of a september morning they needed to find some drinking water i suggest we look around see if this ghost town has a well or a rainwater tank or a spring or something the sun was warming the sides of the old buildings casting long cool shadows in their wake across weedstrewn front gardens he could see the remnants of lives lived here a childrens swing dangling from a rusting aframe a mailbox on the top of a post nailed to a picket fence inside it the dried twigs of some birds abandoned nest a washing line with the tattered threads of laundry still pegged to it flapping gently liam suspected that sixteen years ago the people living here must have been evicted with little or no warning feeling a pang of guilt he didnt know why he swung a kick at the chapels wooden door it creaked but failed to give let me said bob casually thrusting one shoulder against it the door didnt even bother to try arguing with him it cracked surrendered and rattled inwards right said liam rubbing the sore toe of his foot lets see what we can find chapter new york maddy realized she must have been lost in some sort of a daze the night had passed without her really even being aware of it she vaguely remembered settling down in the corner of some bombdamaged warehouse gathering her knees to her chest for a little warmth and crying she must have fallen asleep at some point and now it wasnt daylight that had woken her up it was someones boot roughly kicking her side hey wakey wakey she looked up to see two men staring down at her soldiers by the look of them they both wore something that approximated a uniform dark blue almost black tunics belts buckles pouches and cloth slouch caps she blinked back at the brightness reached for her glasses and wiped dust from them come on sweetheart one of them said his face seemed to be mostly beard beneath the peak of his cap gonna have to take you in girl colonels gonna want to talk to you he offered her a hand im sorry am i am i in the wrong place or something wrong place beardyface laughed hell girl the whole darned sectors the wrong place she let him pull her up im sorry i dont she looked at him beneath his peak his skin was dark his cheeks speckled with grey stubble am i in some sort of trouble youre a civilian in a frontline union defence zone he shrugged if the colonel reckons on yer bein a southern spy you gonna be in a whole world o trouble girl sright said the other soldier pale as cigarette ash and surely only a couple of years older than sal had us a spy through this way coupla months back didnt we sarge uhhuh replied the black soldier werent no girl though he studied her suspiciously either them southern boysre gettin clever or they gettin desperate im not a spy said maddy im just she realized she had no answer that wasnt going to sound utterly unconvincing im just lost she said finally well he pursed his lips reckon well be lettin colonel devereau be the judge a that huh come on now miss the two soldiers led her through the bombedout ruins on to a street temporarily cleared of rubble she looked up at a warm morning sky dashed with pink clouds and for a moment savoured the warmth of the sun on her face you aint gonna run on me are you miss asked the young one only we gotta shoot at yous if ya do see hey now ray she look to you like she gonna run maddy shook her head wearily she wouldnt know where to run even if she had the will to do so ill be a good girl she said quietly i promise whats your name by the way the black man looked surprised at the question you lookin for introductions she nodded im maddy he laughed well since you insist on bein all so formal an all names sergeant freeman an this young drainpipe is private ray calder fellas just call me ray grinned the young man colonel devereau sat down to enjoy his mug of coffee a rare treat real coffee beans shipped in from some faroff exotic country he was just beginning to conjure up the swaying palm trees and golden beaches and turquoise lagoons of some distant tropical french colony in his minds eye stirred by the aroma of the strong black brew in his chipped enamel mug when his adjutant rapped knuckles on the bunkers metal door the door rang like a tuning fork yes he sighed the door creaked heavily open sorry to interrupt sir patrol in sector five picked up a noncombatant a girl sir a girl he made a face she out there in the corridor yes sir he sighed right he waved a tired hand best bring her in then he picked up his mug again and held it beneath his nose enjoying the smoky aroma once more while outside he heard orders being barked down the concrete passage a moment later the girl in question stepped over the lip of the doorway she looked a sorry sight a bespectacled child thin pale and grubby she was wearing what he would consider to be a workmans trousers faded blue canvas and her top was a smudged white shirt with no buttons or loops or any sign of feminine embellishments of lace or ribbon just a printed word intel take a seat he said she stepped forward and slumped in the wooden chair in front of his desk very unladylike in her posture so are you going to give me your real name or am i going to get your spy name maddy she uttered madelaine carter its my real name he shrugged ok theres a start then maddy he took his first tentative sip testing the hot water with a top lip covered in drooping bristles maddy looked up at him her eyes narrowing as she studied him silently you and your men are dressed up like civilwar soldiers like from the s or something except she shook her head i dont see any muskets your soldiers have weirdlooking assault rifles devereau laughed good god civil war thats a very oldfashioned term youre using young lady civil war this war hasnt been called that in well over a century she frowned puzzled youre telling me that this this is the same war devereaus turn to look perplexed youre asking me that young lady he said pulling on the handle of his moustache as if you actually dont know yes he sipped his coffee swilling the rich bitter taste around his mouth so i presume this is how you were instructed to behave then if you got caught hmm to act the fool to appear quite mad you dont know the half of it she laughed bitterly maybe i am well he put down his mug spread his hands why dont you tell me the half of it as you say youll only think im completely mad or lying she shrugged because im not from this world see im from another world another time really she shook her head whats the point youre not going to believe anything that comes out of my mouth right he stroked his beard in silent contemplation for a full minute heres the thing if i were sending you to spy on the south id dress you anonymously id pick someone who looked and behaved quite normally you on the other hand young lady are neither he pointed a finger at her shirt and it seems quite foolish to me to be putting that badge on the front of you it would be a bit like a thief wearing an i am a burglar sign round his neck she looked down at her sweatshirt intel she smiled oh youre thinking its short for intelligence right he returned her smile indeed military intelligence you might just as well have put the word spy on your shirt intel theyre a manufacturer of silicon chips she said in my world he frowned silicon chips you know like in computers computers what is one of those you serious they sat in silence for a while outside the colonels bunker a muted clunking of metal on metal could be heard starting up machinery somewhere in the subterranean nest of rooms and passageways well now said devereau sipping his cooling coffee im halfway to believing miss carter that youre not a spy or at the very least if you are one not a very good one and that might just spare you from going in front of a firing squad her jaw dropped a little firing squad ahhh i see that seems to have focused your mind a little yes i have ordered men to be executed an unpleasant and occasionally necessary part of being a frontline commander i uhh look im not a spy god no thats thats not me i actually you neednt be alarmed i suspect as much you really are far too odd young lady however i think itd be a good idea if you start telling me time traveller she blurted out im a time traveller i travel through time then winced at how ridiculous that must sound to him devereau could have laughed at her ingeniously novel reply but he rather fancied seeing how well thought out her outburst was indeed now is this the same notion as is used in that famous work the time machine the time machine maddys mind raced yes that old book had been written in the correct that is perhaps even in this corrupted timeline the same author h g wells could have been inspired to write the very same or a very similar book yes she replied yes the technology exists to move backwards and forwards through time well she shrugged it will do in the year theyll work out a way to do it devereau nodded patiently and let me see youre expecting me to believe you are from the year i take it from the future yes but actually i kinda work in but not this if you see what i mean a very different one she was confusing him see this is wrong its all wrong this this room that ruined new york outside this war its all wrong it shouldnt be like this oh how should it be maddy leaned forward your side won it won over a hundred and thirty years ago the north beat the south america became one big nation it became the worlds most powerful nation do you know this nation even managed to send a man to the moon miss carter he smiled wryly youll never know how much id love to believe a fanciful story as that but its true honest to god its this nation is a mongrel nation and thats all itll ever be too busy fighting itself state against state brother against brother and now devereau lowered his voice to a more cautious level and now were all but governed by france and europe and the southern confederacy is little more than a mere colony of great britain no she said shaking her head no youre so wrong this is wrong theres a correct history a way it should go and in the correct history the north wins in and do you know why do you know how it wins go on because it made the issue of slavery abolishing slaves a war aim it decided to make that the main reason for the war and it worked slavery he shook his head theres no slavery there hasnt been since well now since when the south signed an alliance with britains king edward vii the south the confederates dont have slaves of course not then then why are you guys fighting each other he shrugged its a question i ask myself every day devereau sighed truth is were underdogs of the british and the french were fighting their war for them my god this is so wrong this is all to do with lincoln lincoln a man called abraham lincoln he was your president when the civil war started devereau shook his head theres never been a president lincoln not in this timeline no but in mine in correct history it was his idea to make it about slavey hes the reason the north won the war devereau stroked his beard now what a lovely idea that would be he looked at her timeline what is that its uh sheesh its really hard to explain its the way events in history go they go in one way or another we call each possible way in which a history happens a timeline we have a machine that can transport you from one timeline to another maddy smiled you know in my timeline this war ended in the north won and the states came together again the united states will go on to do some incredible things she held herself back from saying and some bad things devereau looked down at the battered enamel mug in his hands and sighed the deep wistful sigh of someone who wished he could share in this fantasy actually believe that it had a shred of truth to it you know she said i can actually prove all of this to you i really can he looked up at her and how could you possibly do that ive got things i can show you the girl this madelaine carter supposedly from another time another place had walked into this room five minutes ago with a listless almost defeated way about her but now it seemed shed found a spark of something inside something quite infectious something he longed to feel himself what things she grinned how would you like to see my time machine chapter new york becks stood up the aluminium shelving unit that had been knocked over by falling bricks picked up loops of cable on spindles dusty old motherboards a box of electrical components electronic gadgets and gizmos brought back to all stamped with the wg systems logo she set these things back on their shelves tidy and orderly just as they had been before the archway had landed in this timeline with a crash she found the broom behind the cracked perspex displacement tube and began methodically sweeping the fractured and uneven concrete floor pushing the fallen bricks and mortar into a pile in the middle she swept the broom with a rhythmic rasp in the darkness her eyes adjusted to the faintest glimmer of moonlight that found its way through the cracks in the archway above her eyes dilated in the dark and registered little they were glazed over from the outside looking to all intents and purposes like someone in a deep state of shock traumatized a lost soul seeking solace in the simple task of tidying up but inside her head the silicon wafer computer hummed with activity lines of code chasing each other in tireless loops as she tried desperately to make sense of the situation she was now in alone maddy was gone there was no strategist there was no team there was not even a field office any more this dark hole was nothing but dustcovered secondhand furniture an old highschool desk and a row of computers that more than likely were never going to work again data she shook her head she didnt want to acknowledge the data data she closed a siliconsynaptic data gate not wanting the machine code to tell her what she already suspected that somehow this was all her fault that she had provided inadequate information or worse inaccurate information to madelaine carter causing her to make an erroneous judgement call that the team was now no longer operational she and bob had both failed to apprehend the target abraham lincoln she realized that was perhaps the first error in a string of errors that had led them to this point and now she was here sweeping bricks in the dark data the stream of hexadecimal data had found another way through the myriad circuits to get her attention assessment endofrun condition true endofrun protocol extract hard drives from system computers destroy retrieve tachyon phase accelerator and displacement attenuation boards from displacement machine destroy selfterminate the protocol left no vital technology behind all the rest the computers the growth tubes in the back the generator even the rest of the displacement machine used circuitry that could be assembled from components bought from any electronics store the question was was this really an endofrun condition she looked around at the dark corners of the archway her memory spooled a million different moments from the last few months of stored data the first time shed made a hot drink for maddy and added coffee granules tea leaves and chocolate powder not realizing the hot drink was meant to be just one of those not all of them the time liam had got her and bob to play mario kart on the nintendo and theyd spent seven hours straight playing on the machine beating liam to last place every race the first time she felt something that was more than the code of her operating system or her ai plugin in the prehistoric past a moment of affection when liam had told her that she wasnt a mistaken addition to the team that shed done well that the team should have two support units in it a bob and a becks sal teaching her swearwords in hindi and mumbai street slang she had a whole database of curses and insults she could hurl could sound as convincing as any other putput rickshaw driver in the downtown smog she even had her borrowed memories as bob they felt almost as real as her own duplicated video and sound files of bob observing the assassination of president john f kennedy from the dallas book depository bob making the choice to search every internment camp in the washington area to find and save liam hadnt bob changed a mission priority then actually decided his own mission priority rewritten code she stopped sweeping stood statuestill in the dark the broom still held tightly in her hands her internal clock passed the better part of an hour with her frozen like that before finally a string of characters broke the deadlock assessment endofrun condition false she stirred looked up from the floor mission priority damage assessment recovery analysis locate and retrieve strategist madelaine carter chapter somewhere in virginia im going to read you what i found said liam he shuffled closer to the fire in the middle of the room after exploring the deserted hamlet they decided to settle in the kitchen of a farmhouse aside from the chapel it was the largest building around they found a pantry full of old dustcovered tins of food everything else in there had long ago perished or been scavenged by rats or wild animals now as the afternoon sun waned and a cool wind began to whip up over a decades worth of dead leaves they had a fire going in a rusting brazier as sal lincoln and liam hungrily spooned at mouthfuls of a tepid tasteless stew liam put down his bowl and picked up the old dogeared childs school exercise book hed found in what had clearly once been a young boys bedroom the brittle pages were covered with the untidy pencil scribbles of liams handwriting in the farmhouse theyd come across a study lined with shelves full of books and magazines and a stack of old newspapers tied up with twine he looked up at sal and lincoln both eager to hear what notes hed made bob meanwhile stood in the corner of the kitchen the shotgun nestling in his thick arms looking out through a grimy window across a backyard full of weeds now we know in correct history the american civil war was meant to end in at least liam did hed been reading up on that period of history a few weeks ago hed surprised himself with how much of that information was still in his head better memory than he thought he had the deciding battle of the war was the battle of gettysburg in correct history the confederates lost that battle badly and the army of southern virginia under general lee never really recovered well he looked down at his notes flipped through a couple of pages well in this timeline it seems they managed to win the union army retreated back to washington in disarray and he looked up at lincoln president john bells government made a hasty retreat north to new york to make that city the new seat of government you are implying that president bell that man should have been me yup liam returned to his notes so after the union defeat at gettysburg great britain finally comes out in open support of the confederate south so they were already on the souths side asked sal liam shrugged kind of not openly though just helping a little discreetly why secretly slavery the british public were appalled by it theyd demanded its abolition at home years earlier and because the south still used slaves britain couldnt bring themselves to fully support them but on the other hand the british felt threatened by the growing industrial power and influence of the north the union all that changed when after gettysburg the british made an offer to jefferson davis and whos this jefferson davis asked lincoln the confederates president the offer was a clever one liam fumbled through the pages of notes hed made this afternoon and finally found the paragraph he was looking for to announce the first measures of a postslavery economic reformation lincolns eyes widened good god an end to slavery in the south the beginning of the end it was enough of a gesture said liam for the british public to allow their government to openly ally with the south and this confederate president davis went on to put an end to slavery liam nodded so it seems there was an uproar among all the slave owners in the south of course but then when convoys of british ships stuffed with money and food and weapons started arriving i suppose the poor common people of the south figured out maybe supporting the arguments of the rich slaveholders wasnt doing them any favours liam said looking down at his notes davis announces the freedom act it made it a crime for one man to be owned by another there were still many who claimed by doing this the southern states economy would completely crash that freed slaves would kill their former masters run riot in the streets lincoln raised a shaggy eyebrow and did they no liam shook his head it all seems to have worked out well by then though british money and troops and supplies were flooding in the confederacy held together and the freeing of slaves was not the end of the world for them as theyd feared sal leaned forward so go on the year after in the north president bell made a similar announcement the proclamation of liberty which looks like it was almost word for word a copy of the souths one but it was enough of a gesture to encourage the french and several other european nations to put their support behind the north liam looked up from his exercise book and from that point onwards the war wasnt about slavery any more because both sides of the struggle had turned their back on it he put his notes down and reached for his bowl of stew he hungrily spooned in a mouthful so that as far as you got asked sal he nodded his mouth full imnnn goinnnnn to mmmeeeed sommme mooore ater ommm he sputtered juice dribbling down his chin lincoln gazed into the flames in front of him i have i must admit not dwelled a great deal on the notion of slavery just that it is the way of things the order of things that a white man is better suited to spend his time on matters of the mind the black man to be merely a beast of burden just like a farmyard every beast has its particular role to chuddah sals jaw hung open how could you actually believe something like that lincoln stroked his bearded chin thoughtfully it is a commonly held perception after all it is white men who enslaved black men with their superior technology is history not the story of more advanced races and civilizations conquering other oh right does that make me a beast of burden she said sharply because my skins brown on the contrary he shrugged casually and offered her a wellintended smile despite your brown skin being a halfnegro a mulatto it seems quite clear to me that you are in fact a very bright child i liam winced at lincolns choice of words ughh i dont have to listen to this sal placed her bowl of stew on the floor and stood up people like you dont exist in my time it may not be such a great time but at least we dont have to listen to to ignorant pinchudda like that she turned away and stormed out of the kitchen lincoln looked at liam perplexed what is the matter with the girl the way you said what you said it well it couldve come out sounding better lincolns brow lowered into a dark scowl as his gaze returned to the fire i meant praise by what i said liam finished his stew and set his bowl down we should all get some sleep if were to get going again tonight he got up bob how long have we got until its dark four hours and fiftytwo minutes liam all right will you wake us up then affirmative liam headed out of the kitchens back door into the weedstrewn yard to find sal sitting on a squeaking swing you all right hes a racist liam stood beside the frame he rested his hand on its paintflecked surface and felt its unsteady sway hes from thats the way people speak and think back then they didnt know any better he didnt mean anything nasty by it she shook her head ive never been never had something like that said to me before she looked up at him i feel like hes just rubbished me my parents everyone ive ever known just by saying what he said judging people by the colour of their skin i think he was trying to be kind kind jahulla liam shrugged ah well ive been mistaken for welsh before would you believe ive heard many a silly englishman lump us irish north and south welsh and scottish even altogether in the same pot imagine that and many an irishman confused the chinese with japanese he mused quite probably many a chineseman confused turks with persians and many a persian confused celts with saxons he reached out and squeezed her hand come on sal lets go back inside we need to get a little rest so we do before we start out tonight chapter new york you realize young lady that this is the dead zone said colonel devereau she stopped and turned dead zone he pointed across the landscape of ruins leading down towards the east river beyond the rivers smooth dark water lay the skeleton of manhattan were just about within range of their snipers one of them might try and take a potshot if hes bored enough what maddy ducked down to the ground her bound hands crossed over her head neither devereau nor any of the other soldiers moved a murmur of laughter rippled up and down the patrol line as they watched her fidgeting on her haunches relax he said its well beyond accurate range all the same he took off his forage cap reached to his side and unclipped a carbine bayonet popped the hat on the tip and raised his arm sweeping the hat slowly in a figure of eight what are you doing hissed maddy youre attracting attention indeed im signalling the enemy maddy looked up at him as he stepped forward across the rubble up on to the top of the low uneven wall of loose bricks in the stillness broken only by the tidal lapping of poisoned water nearby she expected a shot to ring out and this reckless officer to drop headless like a butchers carcass across the river her eyes picked out faint movement the glint of metal there he said stepping down theyll spread the word on their side we should be safe from potshots for a while but she got to her feet but thats the enemy isnt it i know the colonel over there pleasant enough fellow know him he sighed weve been staring over this wretched river at each other for years decades actually we meet once a year for thanksgiving he turned to his men dont we sergeant freeman she recognized the bearded man whod found her earlier this morning aye sir a chance for the boys on both sides to let their hair down devereau pulled up some field glasses and inspected the southern lines briefly in fact a couple of years ago east river froze right over the lads had a snowball fight whupped em good too said sergeant freeman grinning indeed we did he lowered his field glasses a good day he added wistfully he turned to her now then you say your base is here somewhere and this miraculous timetravelling device of yours she heard barely concealed amusement in his voice hes humouring himself for a moment she wondered what her fate was going to be if she failed to convince him that the broken machinery in the archway was what she said it was and what about becks presumably she was still sitting inside awaiting further orders or perhaps she was nearby watching them even now she wondered how the support unit would act once she spotted maddy in cuffs being led towards the archway by men with weapons its around here somewhere she said looking across the wasteland towards the collapsed remains of the williamsburg bridge that was her only way of orienting herself the only landmark she could recognize not too far from the supportworks of that bridge over there right i have a a friend over there though devereau looked at her sternly youre not alone look shes not a spy either is she armed maddy shook her head no no weapons but she well she can be dangerous devereau seemed amused by that twenty men i think between us we can handle an unarmed woman no really said maddy trust me shes really nothing like me she well she can be kind of deadly i should call out to her first let her know its ok the colonel eyed her suspiciously for a moment i wont call out for her to run or anything i promise he stroked his beard thoughtfully all right then but to make it perfectly clear i hear anything out of your mouth that sounds like a codeword or a warning i shall be inclined to shoot you right i promise she cupped her hands round her mouth becks her croaky voice echoed off the shattered corner wall of a nearby warehouse it bounced and reverberated through the rubble and maze of halfstanding buildings through dead brooklyn fading slowly like the memory of a dream finally there was only the mournful whisper of a breeze teasing a window shutter somewhere to clap insistently against a rotten frame its maddy are you there her voice faded its ok im ok these soldiers arent going to hurt me nothing but the faroff clatter of the shutter the tidal hiss and draw of the languid east river nearby lapping at the shore it appears that this friend of yours has abandoned you said devereau maddy shook her head no she wouldnt do that shes out there somewhere she said pointing towards the ruins of the bridge theres this big shallow crater over there somewhere and our archways at the bottom of it if we go a bit closer it was then a solitary sound caused devereaus men to drop to their knees and raise their carbines the clatter of a loose slate tile sliding down a mound of rubble then silence once more becks maddy called out again is that you the men were looking in all directions up and around at the broken walls and exposed halffloors of gutted buildings perfect positions from which a sniper could pick them all off she heard some of them racking their carbines ready to fire the click of safety nubs coming off becks you there the stillness was broken by another sound of movement the direction confused by echoes bouncing off the pockmarked walls of buildings either side of them why did you leave me a voice echoed across the stillness the colonel and his men were turning looking around nervously here there everywhere trying to determine where the voice had come from it sounded almost sexless neutral unwelcoming almost hostile becks where are you your departure was inappropriate i im sorry i just i dunno what happened becks i freaked out i guess a long silence becks her cry faded to nothing leaving maddy with an unsettling thought flitting around in her head becks doesnt sound right she sounds different her voice normally so clinical so reassuringly logical seemed to carry the hint of a human emotion in it anger resentment shed never heard that in beckss voice before becks please come out she glanced at the soldiers all of them it seemed were fingering their triggers anxiously shes spooking them please tell your men not to shoot if she comes out uttered maddy to devereau she wont hurt anyone ill instruct her not to instruct her devereaus eyes narrowed you make her sound like a guard dog she ignored him becks please come out slowly these soldiers arent going to hurt you or me theyre not a threat a few moments later the fading echo of her voice was answered with the sound of clattering rubble and then beckss face emerged from the gloom of the corner of a bombedout basement to their right there shouted one of the soldiers and a moment later the air was split by the crack of two rapidfire shots a plume of cement dust exploded from a breeze block beside beckss head as she clambered out of the darkness into the pallid daylight sergeant freeman immediately bellowed a ceasefire she stepped forward down a slope of rubble towards them unperturbed by the nearmiss her cool grey gaze on maddy alone raise your hands where we can see them barked devereau becks approached slowly until she was no more than half a dozen yards from them then stopped calmly evaluating the threat level of the soldiers for a moment becks said maddy its fine these guys are friendly just show them your empty hands becks slowly raised her arms and opened her hands to show her palms then turned her attention on maddy cocking her head curiously why did you leave me she seemed to need an answer as if nothing more could be discussed until the question was answered satisfactorily maddy could imagine the software in her head was stuck on a loop of code running over and over in an infinite circle unable to escape it until it had some relevant data to process best to be honest with her i i just wanted to go home i information you are not permitted to leave the agency come on becks cut me some slack here you said everything was all smashed up didnt you becks nodded affirmative well maddy shrugged so i suppose i figured i thought our team was all finished thats why i a mission is still in progress beckss gaze flickered across devereau then back to her and there is still a time contamination event that must be corrected maddy yeah and howre we supposed to do that huh some other teams going to have to sort this one out because were totally freakin ruined arent we negative what i have now made a complete evaluation of the damage i can effect adequate repairs if we are able to secure suitably adaptable components she looked at maddy with an expression that almost looked like a plea i must have new orders madelaine what are your instructions maddy stepped forward reached out for the support unit and grasped her scarred left hand tentatively with both of hers she squeezed gently im so sorry she whispered maybe it was in her mind maybe it was just wishful thinking but she thought she felt becks return the gesture with the slightest squeeze lets go back to the arch becks you can show me what we need to do to fix it up she turned and nodded at devereau and his men i think these guys might be able to help us out affirmative chapter somewhere in virginia liam was shaken roughly awake by the slanted stripes of bloodred dusk stealing in through the slatted windows he could see it was sal tugging on his arm what what he muttered irritably some weird midget just ran in and stole bobs gun what he took a moment to digest that it sounded like the tail end of some bizarre dream what did you just say midget or maybe it was a child it sounded like she wasnt sure this wasnt a dream either it happened so fast i was talking to bob and this thing just ran into the kitchen grabbed the shotgun and ran out again thing liam sat up on the creaking sofa wheres bob ran out after him to get it back good thing too it was the only weapon they had between them apart from bob himself that is he shook away the last tendrils of sleep stepped through the kitchen where lincolns long frame was sprawled across the table still fast asleep the back door was wide open he went out of the back sal nodded liam stood in the doorway he could hear a fastreceding rustle and thrash of movement across the cornfield at the end of the weedinfested garden in the failing light he could just make out where bob had entered the field leaving a wake of broken and flattened cornstalks hell get it back im sure said liam hes fast hope so the setting sun was no more than a golden sliver trembling on the horizon the clouds combed out across the sky directly above it like cotton candy a fleshy pink well make a move as soon as he gets back said liam grab as many tins as we can carry and liam whispered sal what do you see that see what there she pointed down the garden towards the edge of the field he saw nothing but the dark parting of flattened stalks amid the chesthigh wall of gently swaying corn what i cant see any then all of a sudden he did dark shapes slowly emerging from the field and stepping into the garden hey whos that out there liam challenged the shapes moved carefully towards them low shadows blending in with the tufts of weeds and the darkness of the ground jayzus liam dragged sal back inside the kitchen and slammed the door shut the noise roused lincoln from his slumber curse you i was sleeping he snarled what are they whimpered sal i dont know to be sure but the door suddenly lurched on its hinges rattling from an impact a splintered crack ran down the middle of it what the devil is going on here roared lincoln still blearyeyed with sleep chuddah gasped sal the window liam turned to see hands fumbling at it no not hands not quite they looked peculiar but moving scrabbling scratching too quickly to identify what it was that looked so odd about them the grimecovered glass suddenly shattered as something was lobbed through it out out liam barked pushing sal ahead of him and dragging lincoln out of his chair they tumbled together from the kitchen and into the dark hallway beyond he slammed the door closed behind him it would swing into the hall which meant they could lean things against it to prevent it being opened block this we need to barricade it they looked around themselves desperately and lincoln gestured to a tall floorstanding grandfather clock liam nodded he and sal helped him drag it across the dustcovered floor and tilted it back to lean against the kitchen door with a clumsy thud it chimed noisily in protest at the rough treatment they could hear the back door being battered and finally swinging inwards the bark of wooden chair legs bumped and scraping the clatter of things knocked falling shattering and rolling across the floor ththeyre inside whispered sal a moment later the door they and the grandfather clock were pressing their weight against shuddered under a huge impact as if someone or something on the far side was wielding a mallet lincoln cursed who the devil is this i dont know i dont know not people hissed sal theyre not human to their right along the dark hallway leading to the front of the farmhouse the handle of the front door rattled as something tested it liam turned to see a hairline crimson seam of twilight glowing between the bottom of the door and the doorstep it flickered with movement as god knows how many shapes began to gather outside go away sal screamed a crash against the front door and liam saw a sliver of light in the middle of the doors oak panel thatll not hold for long stairs he remembered there was a staircase in this hallway up to the first floor over there the stairs we need to go up are you quite mad sir snarled lincoln we shall be trapped with nowhere to go doesnt matter bob will be back soon hell sort them out he is but one man there sounds like no less than an army of men out there theyre not human said sal again the front door shuddered violently under the impact of another heavy blow and a second bloodred line of a crack joined the first not a hairline thread this time but a ragged gash upstairs now its our only chance ok yes come on sal nodded quickly damn you sir i will not run like a yard dog find me a weapon and i shall for cryin out loud snapped liam what is it with you do you want to die lincolns face was thunder i am no coward sir i shall stand and fight well i am said sal so can we go please they suddenly heard the clatter of falling grit on the floor beside their feet they turned to look where it had come from to see what appeared to be a jagged red eye on the plaster wall beside the kitchen door wuh it blinked or more precisely it flickered tis a hole said lincoln a small fist punched through the plasterboard and broke off a shard of plaster which crumbled to the floor with a hiss of cascading powder and grit another small dull eye of dusk red appeared beside it and another oh jayzus wept theyre breaking up the bleedin wall lincoln pursed his lips perhaps then we should as you suggested run come on the kitchen door bulged and cracked from a heavy blow and the grandfather clock lurched with a tuneless jangle of chimes the three of them scrambled down the hall past the front door yielding again under yet another hammer blow a strip of wood clattered to the floor and through the fresh gap liam thought he caught a glimpse of something that resembled a face wide and flat with pinholesmall black eyes and a hole was it a hole for a nose what are these things demons up up he screamed at sal and lincoln go up the front door was looking horribly fragile now a spiderweb of cracks and gashes that flickered and widened with each shuddering blow liam followed them up the wooden stairs stumbling more than once in the darkness sal was waiting for him on the landing at the top which way liam which way either just go behind him down the stairs he heard a splintering crack either the kitchen or the front door finally giving way he could hear sal still there in front of him hopping uncertainly from one foot to the other lincoln beside her panting heavily go liam screamed sal fumbled along the dark landing hands patting and feeling the wall in front of her for a door to open liam heard the grandfather clock collapse on to the floor filling the house with a jangling chime theyre through he turned away from the stairs as he heard feet scratching claws on the wooden floor and a bizarre humming almost like human voices but humming as if the things down there whatever they were were somehow gagged he turned and started in the dark patting the damp peeling walls with his hands to feel his way sal he hissed he realized too late that she and lincoln had turned right at the top of the stairs and hed gone left the darkness was filled with the sound of feet scrambling up the stairs behind him scratching and that unsettling humming sound but more like a gagged snarl now than a humming his hands found a recess a doorframe and finally a handle he grabbed it with both hands pushed the door open and was met with the faintest ruddy bloom of light from the very last blush of dusk it seeped in through a small square dusty attic window liam shut the door behind him treading on boxes of soft things perhaps toys or clothes the room must have been used for storage the roof was low with a thick wooden beam running across he ran across to the tiny window ducking under the beam to fiddle with the latch to open it behind him he heard the tap and scrape of feet and claws muted snarling and laboured breathing then the crash of a fist on a door the splintering crack of old dry wood giving way and then his blood chilled he heard sal scream muffled by a door further down the landing he realized as he fumbled with the latch of the small window that their pursuers had chosen to follow sal and lincoln and not him crashing and splintering again the things were ferociously hammering on it tearing sals door to pieces liam hesitated hed planned to open the tiny window and squeeze himself through perhaps to hide outside on the shingle roof but sal screamed again but those things were going to get her liam cursed under his breath ahh jayzus his hands fumbled for something anything to use as a weapon frantically patting the floor around him while he listened to the struggle down the hallway lincoln bellowing curses sal screaming horrible mewing sounds from those creatures things being knocked over blows being landed the scrape and thud of feet on boards come on come on he hissed he heard sal desperately pleading lincolns baritone voice too an enraged roar the sound of a violent struggle he had to admit it lincoln had mettle that obnoxious loudmouthed longlimbed idiot sounded like he was putting up a fight with just his bare fists going down fighting with just his bare fists liams fingers touched a pole of some sort he felt his way down it to a thicket of coarse fibres a brush of some kind ah stuff it good enough he picked it up and charged across the small attic room towards the doorway failing to remember the low beam failing to duck chapter new york colonel devereau and sergeant freeman crouched down and shone their flashlights under the halfopen corrugatediron shutter door into the dark space beyond this is it he said he sounded disappointed this is your time machine by the subdued tone of his voice maddy wondered whether he actually really had wanted to believe what shed told him was for real it would make persuading him seeking his help a great deal easier if he did she knelt down and looked inside the archway appeared to be in a lot better shape than it had yesterday becks must have spent the night fixing things up shed swept away the fallen bricks and mortar straightened up the shelves that had collapsed tidied the general mess inside apart from the gaping crack running across their floor and the jagged holes in the roof it almost looked as normal except that is for the fact that it was utterly dark we have no power said maddy our generator was totally trashed when we uh landed here devereau shoved the shutter a little higher and it clacked noisily the men of his platoon ducked inside and another half a dozen torches snapped on and began sweeping the archway picking out details here and there negative madelaine said becks the generator works i was able to effect a temporary repair i shall go and switch it on becks stepped inside and made her way briskly towards the sliding door leading into the back room she was lost in the darkness hey miss snapped sergeant freeman swinging his carbine off his shoulder where n hell you think youre goin becks turned to look at him as torchlight danced across her face quite calmly to turn the power on of course its through that far door said maddy theres a storage room back there its where our generator is devereau shrugged theyd walked once round this odd construction it reminded him of a termite mound a large badly puttogether hummock made entirely of crumbling bricks there was presumably no place inside for this other girl becks to run or hide better follow her back there sergeant he said to freeman both headed through the opening to the back room and a moment later maddy sighed with relief at the reassuring sound of the generator chugging to life the archways strip lights flickered then winked on in unison devereau cursed he reached out towards the shutter door and yanked it down gimme a hand he said to a young soldier together they wrestled it down until it clattered and bounced against the floor were right in the middle of the dead zone said devereau last thing we want is begging the attention of their sky navy with a careless show of lights oh yeah maddy nodded an apology the computer monitors were on all of them busy showing the system slowly booting up becks emerged freeman with her there was damage to the fuel tank said becks we have lost a significant portion of our reserves she approached maddy and devereau we will need more fuel madelaine to recharge the displacement machine affirmative but hang on whats the point you said the tachyon transmission array was i believe it may be possible to acquire analogous transmission technology and reconfigure it to channel tachyon particles excuse me devereau made a face can you two stop talking whatever gibberish mumbojumbo that is for a moment they did and then both looked at him all right now i suppose im more than halfway towards considering the pair of you arent southern spies he pulled out his packet of gitanes and lit one hacking up a gob of discoloured phlegm on to the floor as he did so do you mind said maddy testily thats disgusting he ignored her but you miss both of you actually have got yourselves a lot of explaining yet to do if you dont want to find yourself chained up in a federal military prison he pulled on his cigarette and puffed a cloud of rancid smoke into the air between them maddy wrinkled her nose at the stench a hell of a lot of explaining he added becks was silent a guarded expression on her face maddy shrugged sure why not you might as well hear it all everything she turned to becks expecting her to sound a note of caution after all this timeline isnt meant to exist none of it not this war not these soldiers she smiled candidly at him not even you colonel devereau i should not exist his voice was midway between incredulity and anger not the way you are not like this he frowned and jutted his bearded chin indignantly maam i rather like the way i am if thats all the same to you look maddy puffed her cheeks its really complicated devereau i guess id better explain to you all about how time travel works she nodded towards their threadbare armchairs want to go grab a seat this could take us quite a while chapter somewhere in virginia bobs singleminded pursuit of the small creature that had boldly dashed into the farmhouse kitchen and stolen their one firearm from right under his nose was getting him nowhere he was standing in a field of corn it was too dark now for his eyes to pick out the broken stalks suggesting which way the creature had fled he was four hundred yards away from the farmhouse the light failing and a cautionary warning flashing in his mind tactical error he was about to process that into an analysis tree when he first heard the shouting and banging drifting across the silently swaying field of corn from the farmhouse several conclusions presented themselves the childlike creature is not alone the gun being stolen was a distraction the others are in danger he bounded back through the corn taking the path of flattened stalks hed already made ahead of him the noises grew more distinct more frantic from the sound of it he determined the struggle was coming from inside the house somewhere and as he drew closer he could see that the back door through which hed rushed out only minutes ago was nothing more than a splintered frame swinging gently on bent hinges he heard a highpitched scream and identified the voice as sals something inside his head twitched not the silicon wafer but the small wrinkled nugget of flesh the brain the size of a rats with which it had a synapticwire link as he bounded across the overgrown garden his mind was drawing up a shortlist of candidate words to describe what he felt guilt relevance shame relevance anger relevance hed been fooled lured out into the field so that the others were left entirely alone vulnerable no gun between them no support unit to protect them he crashed through the remains of the swinging back door knocking it off its hinges the kitchen looked as if a tornado had passed through it everything that could be dislodged or broken had been the wall was a mess of plaster dust and holes revealing the wooden slats of support posts the fistsized holes punched into it all the way through to the hallway beyond the door into the hallway looked just like the back door smashed to splinters liam bob bellowed into the house he heard nothing now the sound of struggling and screaming had ended at some point in the last thirty seconds saleena he tried again stepping into the hallway his eyes adjusting to the gloom he could see scratch and scrape marks across the floor along the walls up the stairs quickly urgently he clambered up them the old wooden steps groaning and creaking under the burden of his weight he turned right at the top of the stairs a door at the end scratched battered and split with a deep crack down the middle hung wide open and into the room beyond he could see the frame of a bed on its side an overturned chair a last stand had taken place there no bodies though gone in the space of only minutes seconds the humans it was his duty to protect had been snatched away from him he took another few steps into the room and saw more signs of the struggle a chair leg wrenched from its seat perhaps used as a club one end of it was spattered with blood black in this waning dusk light there were splashes and dots of it on the pale walls the logical part of his mind berated him with a simple message mission status fail the organic part was prepared to express its assessment of the situation with a flood of feelings he was unable or unwilling to find appropriate labels for right now he backed out of the room and slumped against the landing wall sliding down until he was a hunched mass of dejected muscle at the bottom of it you have failed his deep voice rumbled softly like a gas boiler switching on a subway train passing through a subterranean tunnel you failed he said again this time his voice trembling slightly he supposed if becks had been right here she would have found that intriguing impressive even that his voice was unintentionally conveying an emotion the computer in his skull was nagging him to make a judgement call on a growing list of new missionpriority suggestions to continue making his way northeast to new york after all madelaine carter was still there and still needed protecting to attempt to locate the bodies of liam oconnor saleena vikram and abraham lincoln because there was always the chance a possibility one or more of them might still be alive to selfterminate out of sheer shame perhaps his ai was now unreliable faulty he had made a poor judgement that had resulted in this an alltooobvious ploy to lure him outside subconsciously he balled a giant fist angry with himself for being so stupid perhaps another support unit uploaded with freshly installed software and not burdened with many months worth of memories of kinship adventures jokes even would turn out to do a far more efficient job than he he was giving selftermination some serious thought even though the software was advising him quite strongly that it was an illogical conclusion and achieved nothing useful when he heard the scrape of a footfall beside him he turned quickly to look along the almost pitchblack landing quite ready to tear something someone apart limb from limb for no other reason than mere revenge and he saw liam standing there wideeyed exhibiting posttraumatic stress behavioural indicators he was in shock liam oconnor his voice boomed liam took a shuffling step forward clutching his head bob jeeez i dont know what i just bob lurched to his feet closed the gap between them and before his computer brain could cringe with disapproval distaste and embarrassment at the behaviour of its host body bobs huge muscular arms were wrapped round liams narrow frame and squeezing him hard you are alive he rumbled unnecessarily bob i think they took sal and lincoln they are alive liam was struggling to breathe his nose and mouth crushed against the wall of bobs sweaty shoulder he pushed the support unit back and bob loosened his hug i think so i think they took them his words were suddenly drowned out by a deafening roar that made the landing the whole farmhouse vibrate like the head of a snare drum white light flickered into the building dazzlingly bright finding holes and cracks in the ceiling above them sending pinsharp blades of light down on to them that swept across their skin across the wooden floor light from above the roar too directly above them they tumbled down the stairs before either of them had discussed whether it might be a good idea to actually remain hidden somewhere inside they stepped through the shattered remains of the front door and out on to the porch looking up at the brilliant white light liam shaded his eyes it was as intense and uncomfortable as looking directly at the sun a false dawn of artificial sunlight trained down on them what is it he all but screamed he couldnt even hear himself let alone hear whether bob managed to answer an icy blast of air swept down on them and he felt something cold and wet settle on his cheeks in the light he could see a million white fluffy flakes of something slowly descending swirling in the downdraught seesawing like feathers like ash from a forest fire but they were neither my god its snowing thats exactly what it was snow the deafening roar that had filled the air making talking shouting an utterly pointless endeavour for the best part of the last minute suddenly ceased it left them in a silence filled only with liams rasping breath and the soft whisper of snow falling and settling on the ground around them what the uttered liam feeling more and more flakes landing on his upturned face on the back of the hand shading his eyes the blinding light swept off liam and bob and back on to the farmhouse then across the other buildings in the small rural hamlet like a probing eye trying to make quick sense of the scene liam tracked the thick beam of the spotlight all the way up into a dark and completely starless sky he thought he was looking at a dense bank of snowladen cloud above them that might be the best explanation for the unseasonal and surprising arrival of snow but then a row of smaller lights suddenly appeared a row of spotlights trained upwards casting fans of light across a smooth burnished copper hull his mouth was useless slack and open and doing little more than making a gurgling note of surprise chapter new york colonel bill devereau stared at the images on the computer screens a slideshow of pictures pulled by computerbob off the systems database at maddys request photographs of new york busy and vibrant times square packed with yellow cabs and tourists a giant billboard with shreks green face leering out over milling pedestrians a cowboy in his underpants and stetson and boots busking with acoustic guitar surrounded by grinning japanese girls a picture of the spice girls posing together in front of the empire state building my god he whispered a picture of lady liberty mintgreen and undamaged by bombs and smallarms fire standing proud and tall holding aloft her beacon of hope i forgot what she looked like he said is the statue damaged in this timeline colonel devereau asked becks bill he said softly i guess you two ladies can call me bill affirmative bill he shook his head sadly shes no more than a rusting stump bombed by the south back in during the second siege of new york they blew her up then used liberty island to deploy several artillery batteries from there they pounded manhattan to rubble where when we come from bill said maddy i mean its todays date september the twelfth the very same date but its a very different time anyway she flapped her hand dismissing the point the point is in our time new yorks all there in one piece she smiled sadly well sort of she decided there was no point mentioning the twin towers to him it would only complicate things he drew his eyes away from the slideshow of images they glistened with moisture tears he was determined not to shed in front of the girls more importantly in front of his own men this is this is really how our world should be yes he looked back at the nearest monitor to see an image of president bush and prime minister blair standing side by side behind lecterns addressing an audience of the press then an image of homer simpson strangling bart simpson and you and all these devices of yours he nodded at the tall rack of circuit boards to their left the displacement machine and the large empty perspex tube this technology of yours could change my world to how they appear on these what do you call them computer monitors these computer monitors of yours she nodded this war shouldve ended in thats how history is supposed to go he stroked the thatch of dark bristles on his cheek deep in thought this really is quite some story you are asking me to believe maddy sniffed well its the truth although sometimes you know i wish it wasnt devereau pulled on his beard with a gloved hand and you say this technology this time displacing device can send you to any time and any place too yeah devereau noticed sergeant freeman out of the corner of his eye standing nearby and just as bewitched by the slideshow of images whatre you thinking sergeant freeman the old nco shook his head seen a lot of things in my time sir perhaps too many things but this he hunted down the right words to express what he was thinking these these here pictures if they are what this city what this nation was meant to be then i guess i gotta wonder how the hell we been so stupid we ended up makin this mess of a world we all livin in devereau nodded thoughtfully if we can fix our machine we could change it back said maddy it would cause a time wave that would correct everything youd all live very different lives be very different people she wondered whether she ought to add that some of them might not even exist a different century and a half of history would mean very different family trees for some of these men and the thing is she added none of you would have a memory of this war because well she shrugged because it will have never taken place sergeant freeman nodded i say amen to that devereau adjusted the collar of his tunic and what pray tell is a time wave a vibration through spacetime that leaves behind it a recalibration of reality replied becks a wave of reality overwriting reality added maddy devereau frowned i would become someone else correct bill said becks everything and everyone is recalibrated his eyes narrowed then surely my allowing you to alter history would be like well not to put too fine a point on it ladies it would be like killing myself maddy pursed her lips he was of course in a sense quite right a time wave would erase devereau and everyone else and in its wake leave other versions of themselves or quite possibly in many cases leave absolutely no version of them at all she looked back at the slideshow of images there were plenty of things wrong with the she and becks had come from but it had to be better than this wartorn hell she could see devereaus eyes freemans too eyes that glistened with a deep melancholy after all she guessed they were both men who had spent most of their lives living in concrete bunkers and staring across the rubble and the river at men just like themselves these images on the screen were a beacon of hope of what could have been something else i should explain to you said maddy theres no guarantee this reality is stable that it will hold things are unbalanced right now and somewhere at some quantum dimensional level reality is sort of considering whether this timeline is stable enough to stick with or whether it needs to adjust itself again adjust itself what do you mean another time wave could just as easily come along and wipe this reality away and replace it with something far worse devereau frowned worse ok she gave it a moments thought for example a world in which the south has already won this war good god a victory for the angloconfederacy or much much worse she added worse he stiffened worse than that oh yeah she nodded trust me bill you ought to see some of the crazy stuff weve seen itd turn your hair white chapter somewhere in virginia in stunned silence liam watched the enormous vessel that had loomed above the farmhouse settle lightly on the ground jets venting blasts of icecold nitrogen gas filling the air around them with an arctic mist and a blizzard of snowflakes from within the swirling fog he heard the heavy clanking of chains and winches and finally the thud of something smacking the ground heavily a moment later he heard the clatter of horseshoes on metal the throaty snort of horses and mens voices softly calming them presently something began to emerge from the mist bob shifted position preparing himself to defend liam easy there big fella whispered liam and patted bobs side he could just about make out several dozen bulky fourlegged beasts but certainly not horses as hed first thought they seemed to be heavy up front by the look of their faint silhouettes with much more slender hindquarters he squinted into the mist and the dancing flakes of snow beginning to thin now as the sound of venting jets ceased he heard an ooofff of exertion from someone and the soft thud of boots on the ground a figure was approaching them uh hello over there the figure drew close enough for liam to see it was a man in a welltailored army uniform ahhh there you are he drew up in front of them a trim man in his late twenties beneath the pointed peak of his white pith helmet liam could see a cleanshaven face with a friendly smile spread across features that seemed artfully chiselled specifically to melt the hearts of women he was wearing a smart crimson tunic with brass buttons that led down to an equipment belt cinched tightly round his waist best not to run gents he said and offered a hand in a crisp white glove captain ewan mcmanus third company fourth battalion black watch regiment liam offered his hand uh hello i suspect you chaps have just had a nasty runin havent you he cocked his head some bother was it liam nodded the last few moments of shock confusion dismay bewilderment were beginning to blow away like the thinning mist around them he remembered sal was out there perhaps nearby still yes oh jayzus they took our friend they he was saying they but he hadnt the slightest idea what they were dammit thats not good news captain mcmanus grimaced youre saying theyve taken captives yes shes just a young girl a child really and another one a man they were here just minutes ago minutes ago i know said mcmanus weve been on their trail animals we think its these ones they raided a farm town about a dozen miles west of here earlier this afternoon awful mess a blood bath killed the lot of them women children the officer turned round and cupped his mouth white bear up here please over the mans shoulder liam could see a platoon of soldiers in similar tall helmets and red tunics sitting astride those beasts that hed yet to actually identify one of the men hastily dismounted and hurried forward to join them he had long black hair in braids and dark skin pebbledashed with faint smallpox scars chief white bears our tracker hes a mohawk absolutely the very best assured mcmanus he turned to the indian get me a heading were going to follow them on the ground all right dah white bear nodded and trotted off towards the farmhouse i suspect theyre heading northeast towards the dead city thats where others of their kind have headed to in the past well do our best to catch them before they get in there what are they asked liam the officer looked at him surprised you dont know he shook his head no i thought they were he didnt know where to begin monsters demons he ended up offering a confused harried shrug me and bob were sort of new here mcmanus looked up at bob acknowledging him for the first time good grief youre a big chap he turned back to liam jolly big isnt he liam nodded impatiently like he needed to be told that those things those creatures well now yes i suppose you must have at least read about this in the papers that were using some more experimental types of genics to work on the plantations over here he shook his head the evening times and the other newspapers were ranting about that when we were shipping out from london weve had simpleminded eugenics working in factories and farms back home for ages but these recent innovations the dextrous hands with thumbs and the larger brains awfully clever stuff if you ask me well thats become a heated issue they dont like it the idea of genics being smart enough to change the oil on an autolocomotion engine or being able to write their name mcmanus looked at them but you must know about that of course liam nodded convincingly sure yeah of course so the officer continued were trying out these more advanced types over here in the southern states generally these smarter genics are really jolly good very impressive actually but we do get problems every now and then they can flip out occasionally and turn exceedingly nasty the officer suddenly shook his head with disgust at himself im sorry awfully rude i didnt manage to get your names im liam liam oconnor and the big fella here is bob mcmanus offered bob his hand pleased to meet you bob and liam now look were going to try and run these genics down before they get to the citys outskirts well do what we can to get your friends back but im not going to tell you a lie they can be very unpredictable what do you mean asked liam mcmanus shook his head they can be gentle tender loving even then without any warning at all without any reason they can turn on you be quite deadly in fact theres no knowing what sets them off he looked at the trickle of drying blood running down from liams temple and gestured at the gigantic vessel looming over them theres a regimental surgeon aboard the ship type i suggest you go aboard and let him have a look at you and we shall go and liam shook his head no i need to find her please i have to come along bob nodded affirmative enough time has already been wasted we cannot lose them the officer looked at them both silently shes my sister said liam finally desperately he tossed a hooded glance at bob both of our sister isnt she bob acknowledged that with an unconvincing nod yes we are family your sister mcmanus frowned circumspectly hmm i shouldnt really do this allow civilians along he stroked his chin but well yes missing family you want to do all that you can to find them dont you liam nodded we wont get in your way we just want to find her and our friend mcmanus summoned one of his men sergeant cope these two civvies shall be joining us clear some saddle space for them will you the sergeant eyes dark beneath the brim of his helmet and the rest of his face lost behind a large walrus moustache nodded briskly right you are sir mcmanus turned back to liam and bob youve ridden a huff huff a huffalo he shook his head not to worry youll be riding rearsaddle he glanced at bob going to need to pick a jolly big one for you though at that moment the indian tracker white bear emerged from the farmhouse and jogged across to captain mcmanus they go northeast he gestured past the building towards the gravel road on which liam and the others had entered the hamlet earlier that day tracks go that way how many do you think white bear fifty maybe more many different ones some big some small he glanced quickly at liam and bob then back at his commanding officer only one human track man i think liam looked alarmed and the young officer raised a hand to calm him that may just mean theyre carrying your sister to move along faster you see mcmanus turned to his men platoon ready your mounts and then he tugged something down from the side of his helmet a padded leather pouch that settled over his ear from that he pulled out a thick telescopic brass arm that curved round his jawline and ended with a brass mouthpiece he tapped it once captain mcmanus to duty officer we have some very reliable tracks down here were going to follow them on foot he nodded to a response coming through his earpiece right you are well call you if we need you he smiled at liam ready yes we need to go now before we lose them the officer nodded over towards the two huffs that had had rear saddles cleared of field kit of course lets find your friend and that sister of yours chapter somewhere in virginia they moved through the darkness silently across the seemingly endless cornfield sal was bouncing uncomfortably over the shoulder of some huge lumbering beast she might have said man but shed only caught the briefest glimpse of it it stood on two legs and had two arms that much she knew and that was about as much of a comparison as she could make to a human the group of them pack seemed like a better word moved swiftly through the corn stalks leaves and cobs swiping at her face she tried to call out to lincoln not sure whether he too was somewhere among the pack behind her ahead maybe draped like her over the large meaty shoulder of one of these things but a hand the oddestshaped hand shed ever seen two fat fingers as big as aubergines and a thumb like a marrow clumsily smothered her mouth mashing her lips painfully against her teeth it seemed like almost an hour before the group emerged from the edge of the field and hesitated by the side of a tarmac road the very same road she suspected theyd been driven along by the chinese man it was fully dark now and a gibbous moon had emerged into the sky to bathe the night a quicksilver blue upsidedown she could see these creatures more clearly they were all humanlike in so far as they stood erect on legs and their arms swung free but their size and shape varied immensely she saw that about a dozen of them were as large as the one carrying her they teetered on small legs incredibly topheavy with a muscle mass that put bob to shame they vaguely reminded her of silverback gorillas except there wasnt a single hair on them bald from head to toe skin pale almost translucent in the moonlight their heads didnt look anything like a gorillas head either loafshaped skulls smaller in fact than a regular adult humans skull with tiny almost delicate faces eyes so small they almost looked like mere pinholes beneath those a gash no nose just an open flap of flesh a hole and beneath the nonnose a simple lipless slit for a mouth sal twisted her head and saw others much smaller agilelooking they had slender torsos with a narrow ribcage that reminded her vaguely of a salamander she noticed their hands were the same kind two fingers and an opposable thumb but these were long and thin with bony knuckles and fingernails that were more like claws their heads were similar but the eyes much bigger she glimpsed allblack eyes wide and round that blinked in the moonlight like those of an owl she saw one of a third type the smallest the size of a child with a head disproportionately large it must have been that one which had burst into the kitchen and stolen the shotgun she wondered where that gun was whether this creature had dispensed with it not knowing what it was or how to make use of it are they that stupid she suspected not theyd cleverly outflanked them in the farmhouse bottling them up in the hallway at the very least they seemed to know a house tended to have a back door and a front door this smallest creature the child had the same hand configuration but the two fingers and the thumb on each looked completely human the hands could easily have been those of some machineworker whod lost the little finger and the next one along of both hands in some unfortunate industrial accident its face looked odd in the light she thought she saw some scarring around its lipless mouth one other thing she noticed about all these creatures the last observation she made before the brute carrying her began to lope forward and her vision blurred as her head bounced and bumped against his muscular chest was that every one of them was completely naked except for a solitary item of clothing on them one of the apes had a ladys straw sunhat on its head the strap tucked under its chin to hold it on another had a threadbare winter scarf wrapped round its neck one of the salamanders even had a ladys polkadot summer dress on far too large for its narrow frame they looked like children playing dressup children whod raided their mothers wardrobe and each taken a single item they rather fancied the creatures trotted silently along the tarmac road cautiously watching both ways for signs of an approaching vehicle even up into the starry sky with wide fearful eyes they padded several hundred yards up the road finally after a small noise from the child some sort of instruction the pack of creatures flitted quickly across both lanes and into the enormous field on the far side the stalks here were shorter with pommellike heads of something fluffy that batted against her face as they lumbered through running beside her she caught a glimpse of another ape stretched over his shoulders she saw the dark shape of lincolns long limp body his head bumped up and down lifelessly against the other creatures bulging chest and for a moment she was afraid the man was dead that she was all alone with these freaks but then lincoln flinched at a bump and spat a curse at his ape a big threefingered fist smacked the back of his head to shut him up lincoln snarled indignantly cursed and struggled with the creature landing ineffectual punches with his fists on its enormous shoulder a heaving powerful elliptical bulge of muscle tissue that flexed and wobbled beneath ghostpale skin as it continued to lumber with all the grace of a rhino oblivious to lincolns pitiful and futile attempt to fight back sal closed her eyes relieved he was still alive relieved she wasnt alone and desperately hoping these creatures were leaving a trail that bob and liam were going to be able to follow chapter new york all right then young lady said devereau he puffed out a foulsmelling cloud of cigarette smoke that maddy subtly wafted away from her face with the gentle flap of her hand the colonel didnt seem to notice that youll have whatever help i can offer you but ill wager we have nothing of your sort of technology in our bunkers thank you he shrugged if these gadgets contraptions and devices of yours do what you say theyll do then perhaps it should be us thanking you he hesitated frowned and then slapped a hand over his tired eyes and shook his head but yes no arghh the logic of this time travel is confusing he sighed of course if youre successful and change history back to your version of events i would not know any different would i we would know nothing of of what has been done maddy nodded affirmative said becks good god this timetravelling nonsense plays the devil with your mind he muttered i should think it must drive you to madness dwelling on such things all the time it gives me a headache maddy conceded but i think im beginning to get the hang of it now it was dark in the archway the generator had been turned off to conserve what fuel was left in the tank and the glow of a candle flickered across maddys messy desk reflected in the dark screens of the computer monitors outside the archway she could hear devereaus men talking in whispers could see the glow of their cigarettes in the night as they kept watch for the southern sky navy so this travelling through time what is it for you miss carter a profession he wheezed a smokers laugh a hobby is it maddy looked down at the mess across her desk caught in the dancing glow of the candle light more a duty really she replied not one i chose exactly it just sort of happened ended up being me and a couple of other poor suckers who have to do it and you miss becks what about you becks looked at maddy questioningly hell why not maddy smiled casually go on you might as well tell him the truth about what you are none of its going to make any difference when if we can fix this mess becks nodded slowly that is true madelaine what you are devereau looked confused you said what just then didnt you not who i am a support unit said becks that is to say an artificially engineered life form my organic frame has been genetically edited and designed for combat and reconnaissance roles by a military dnasoftware contractor shes also a real barrel of laughs added maddy becks frowned disgruntled at that i have developed basic humour files genetic said devereau is that the word you just used becks nodded yes devereau stroked his beard the angloconfederates have been experimenting with a similarsounding invention eugenology i believe they call it playing with the bricks and mortar of nature itself playing in gods very own laboratory is this a similar thing to what you just said affirmative the manipulation of genetic data altering the growth instruction code of stem cells to produce an organic life form that meets specified criteria in my case i have physical strength that is approximately four hundred per cent greater than a normal female of similar build i also have a hyperreactive immune system capable of repairing extreme body damage which means you can shoot her and shell pretty much just shrug it off like a bee sting maddy took her glasses off and rubbed tired eyes although that doesnt stop her kvetching about it i can feel pain that is necessary damage feedback data said becks she looked at maddy kvetching what does this word mean she shook her head moaning dont worry about it i was trying to be funny becks cocked her head momentarily and filed something she turned back to devereau it is possible to destroy this body she continued it is possible for the reactiveimmune system to be overwhelmed if too much blood is lost for instance this bodys organs would systemically fail like those of a normal human body devereau seemed to draw back from her into his chair putting a few inches more space between himself and becks he eyed her warily the south has experimented with eugenic creatures on the battlefield before theyve been fooling around with that ungodly science for the last thirty years twentythree years ago at the battle of preston peak when our boys were making a push along the sheridansaint germain section of the front line they put on to the battlefield an experimental company of those devils devereau shook his head recalling old headlines the press at the time called them the almostmen he ran a hand through dark hair threaded with silvergrey at the temples it was a massacre the rumours of the time the stories in the press were truly horrendous three thousand men holding the town of preston peak most of them recent draftees from the state of ohio just boys really we lost every last one of them when the north counterattacked with a tank regiment and steamwalkers and retook the town they found only parts of bodies he tossed his gitane on to the floor and crushed it with the heel of his boot they found a he looked at maddy this isnt very nice miss carter well i guess youve started now she replied uncertainly you might as well go on as you wish they found a body mounted on a wooden crossbar a head arms torso legs all from different men as if these creatures had been mocking man parodying the southern science trying to make their very own creature the soldiers entering the town found very few of the creatures alive theyd turned on each other you know as if killing every human in the town hadnt been enough but before turning on each other theyd turned on the southern officers whod been assigned to lead them trust me miss carter you really wouldnt want to hear what they did to them maddy looked at his face no i guess youre probably right since then theyve not experimented with military eugenic units but we know they have eugenic workers hundreds thousands of them working the plantations they must have a better understanding these days of how to control them how to design obedience into their minds in my time thats basically the same technology as genetic engineering maddy looked out of the open shutter at the moonlit ruins of brooklyn you know when we arrived here i didnt think things looked that you know that advanced in this timeline scientific development is not necessarily symmetrical replied becks she nodded becks was right war in this case a permanent state of war seemed to have had the effect of accelerating some sciences and retarding others for example those bombers the souths sky navy that bill had mentioned seemed to be using a lighterthanair technology far more advanced than was available in the normal while on the other hand it seemed that there was no sign of any computer technology or if there was it was rudimentary the angloconfederates have invested much in these modern sciences said devereau the british seem to have access to the finest scientific minds the laboratories and of course they certainly have the money maddy made a face well theyre not doing so great in our time i find that difficult to believe he laughed drily the british empire encompasses half the world devereau fiddled with the frayed cuff of his uniform tunic whereas our government he lowered his voice useless selfserving politicians the lot of them rely on technology that is decades old tanks and steamwalkers that stall and fail in the middle of a battle rotorflyers that drop out of the sky at the first touch of a bullet but he sighed so long as the union high command has an endless supply of men to throw into the meatgrinder so long as this cursed eternal war remains a stalemate there are businessmen industrialists weapons manufacturers who remain powerful and very rich maddy noticed his voice had become almost a whisper you wouldnt say those things in front of your men would you he shrugged i suspect they all feel the same cynicism as i do but it would take only one of them to report my words to the high command and i would be facing a firing squad so he offered her a fatalistic smile i keep my grumblings to myself and i do my job and hold my part of the front line his tone changed his expression changed a little more hopeful so tell me then what piece of mysterious machinery is it that you need to fix this timetravelling device of yours chapter somewhere in virginia what did he just say we lost them liam swung a leg over the back saddle of the huff and dropped down on to the ground the creature half buffalo half horse snorted irritably at his sudden ungainly dismount captain mcmanus nodded yes it seems we have clever creatures these ones they split up and one group left a deadend trail for us to follow white bear on his haunches studying footprints in the hard soil nodded he looked up at them they very smart he shook his head disgusted with himself trick me mcmanus patted the indians shoulder its ok white bear well pick their trail up again in the morning liam stepped forward you cant stop now yes we can and we should weve lost them well end up spending the night chasing shadows and have nothing to show for it come sunrise but theyre going to get away please we have to well make camp here first light he tapped the earpiece in his helmet im calling in the regimental carrier well have some more hooves and boots on the ground i assure you were going to find them find them liams voice rose angry exasperated but youve just lost them on the contrary mr oconnor im almost certain theyre headed that way he said pointing to the horizon id say its less than ten miles from here what is the dead city what used to be known as baltimore weve had genics go rogue on us before thats where they tend to head they know we prefer to steer clear why surely you know he shook his head good god where exactly have you spent your entire life mr oconnor i just i liam shrugged a priory kirklees priory ah catholic are you aye something like that liam nodded impatiently whats wrong with this city the north poisoned it with virals killed thousands of innocent civilians with habsburgs disease i know its been nearly twenty years since then but they say the rats and wild dogs carry the spores you really wouldnt want to go in there if you can help it thats why the feral genics use it as a refuge ill go in me and bob well go mcmanus patted his shoulder reassuringly dont worry if thats where theyve gone and i do suspect it is i shall be taking a company in there to flush those vermin out my boys are all inoculated against habsburg well find them all right now if you dont mind matters to attend to mcmanus turned away from liam and began issuing orders to his walrusfaced sergeant who barked them out again in a paradeground voice the platoon dismounted and began to make preparations to camp where they were for the night bob joined liam mcmanus is tactically correct with this decision liam but liam balled his fists shes out there she needs us both of them are it is our mission priority to retrieve them both bob was right of course they needed lincoln to be alive too if they had any hope of putting history back where it belonged bob had a go at a reassuring wink i calculate a high degree of certainty that we will retrieve them unharmed liam looked up at the support unit and realized he was doing his best to be supportive even though his mind was little more than looping strings of computer code somewhere inside his coconut computer head was a friend reaching out and trying to help yeah maybe youre right you big ape chapter somewhere in virginia the tea was good strong and steaming liam gulped it down despite the heat scorching his throat he hadnt realized just how thirsty he was a brazier glowed in the middle of the field a harvested field rows of severed stalks flattened by army boots and the hoofs of two dozen oneton huffalos now tethered together in a surly huddle of muscle and hide lowing and snorting four soldiers stood guard staring out into the darkness the rest of the platoon wrapped in thick woollen ponchos most of them used to the rigours of army life were taking full advantage of the few hours of dark left and already fast asleep captain mcmanus reached for the metal pot hanging from a metal frame over the glowing coals in the brazier he topped up liams enamel mug thank you my favourite time of the day said mcmanus as he sipped his tea the few hours before dawn theres a wonderful tone to the sky just before sunrise especially such places like asia minor he shrugged afghanistan very nice the skys almost a vanilla colour before dawn its almost always a grey dawn in cork said liam ahhh now mcmanus grinned and wagged a finger i knew there was a slice of irish in your accent liam oconnor just couldnt quite place it well some of its rubbed off recently ive been living sort of with a girl from boston he shrugged and a girl from india mcmanus looked at him cocked his head curiously if you dont mind me saying you really are quite the strangest fellow ive met in a good long time liam hunched his shoulders you dont know the half of it you seem i dont know you may laugh at this you seem to me like a rip van winkle as if youve slept all your life how is it that you seem to know so little of world affairs do you not read the papers like i said me and bob weve been away in a priory on our own me mother died recently so we came home to care for sal and well the three of us finally decided to uh to see some of the world together you know well youve not chosen the best place in the world to start your travels liam the american war here may have ground to a halt in recent years but mcmanus looked cautiously around before continuing with a slightly lowered voice there are rumours flying about that thats going to change liam perked up his eyes off the smouldering coals what do you mean mcmanus stroked his smooth chin its no big secret liam this particular war is losing popular support back home the british people are weary of it war its all anyone in britain has known mcmanus warmed enough by the brazier unbuttoned his tunic collar we have so many different wars going on at the moment you understand were fighting separatists in northern india bandit militias in our african colonies tribal warbands in afghanistan persia i cant tell you how many dusty little backwaters my lads and i have seen action in he shook his head sadly his eyes lost in the glowing embers and its always the same brutality the same mindless cruelty one tribe of savages hacking the next to bits and always always its the women and children who die first i ive seen things liam some quite horrible things liam regarded the young officers face saw eyes that all of a sudden looked far older than they should you sound like youve seen more than enough fighting mcmanus shrugged i can fight any number of battles i can stand on a battlefield alongside my men and stare down another army he smiled im a soldier thats exactly what im trained for but but but its the evil its the sheer cold hate i see in our colonies liam the savagery theyre not even fighting us half the time theyre too busy settling old tribal scores odd that isnt it youd think the people in these far places would unite together to fight the british redcoats but they dont his words trailed to silence and for a while they listened to the wheezing and snoring of two dozen men asleep on the field i do sometimes wonder why we bother to keep this empire of ours why were there its not like these places want the law and order we try to bring to them they seem to relish their barbarity what they do to each other you cant educate these people he shook his head its a nasty situation aye well i find its usually because some rich and powerful fella somewheres making money out of any nasty situation he shrugged thats probably why you and your lads are all over the place mcmanus shrugged perhaps theres always money to be made in a war zone he finished his tea i do wonder why were in all these blasted places when i lose men and i have to write home to their mothers or wives about how they died courageously for a good cause you wonder what that good cause is yes he nodded you know a part of me says our boys should all return home leave these savages to it if hacking each other to pieces is what they want then who are we to impose our ways on them but then then i remind myself that the ones who end up suffering the most are the children when you see it for yourself liam when youve seen what ive seen its hard to walk away but is it not wrong that youre there in the first place liam cocked a brow there was plenty lads i knew who didnt have much good to say about the british for good or bad were in the situation were in and the truth of it is liam were beginning to lose control of our colonies we need more boots on the ground in africa in asia minor in the far east and we can afford less boots on the ground over here does that mean liam looked at him does that mean your sides about to surrender mcmanus looked at him pointedly his silence was weighted so hang on liam had heard some of the men earlier this evening muttering something about their regiments hasty redeployment to america thats why youre over here to finish the war mcmanuss head tilted the slightest of nods our lads are stretched far too thinly i fancy this particular war is one our government wants to be done with once and for all he ran a hand through his blond hair pushing a stray tress from his chiselled face a final push by the south and then i suspect a hastily negotiated peace chapter new york im not so sure this is such a good idea said maddy the boat bobbed gently on the rivers tidal waves its steam engine puffing smoke and coughing as it powered a churning paddle at the rear well be just fine said devereau i know colonel wainwright hell not order his men to shoot on us while were under a white flag maddy looked up at the rag fluttering from the small boats masthead she wished the thing was a good deal bigger and somewhat cleaner whiter and more noticeable it looked more like a loose flapping sail than it did a flag of truce twothirds of the way across the east river she could see the southern front line in more detail now trenches of reinforced concrete and bunkers with viewing slits from which protruded the long thick barrels of fixed artillery she could make out individual faces moving among the structures a growing buzz of activity as they drew closer theyre going to blast us out of the water she muttered becks was beside her we have been within effective range for the last five minutes she turned to maddy and they have not fired well i guess we take that as a good sign then maddy grinned anxiously affirmative presently the boat finally approached a wooden jetty protruding past a graveyard of rusting and rotting hulls of longago bombdamaged vessels lying beached on the silted banks of the river the pilot reversed the engine churning water noisily behind them and slowing the boat down as a couple of soldiers up front waited at the prow to hop over the side on to the end of the jetty just hope this isnt mistaken as some sort of amphibious invasion maddy found herself muttering under her breath negative said becks there are too few troops for this to be an effective assault maddy sighed duh really the boat thudded gently against the jetty and the two soldiers dropped on to the creaking wooden planks quickly securing a line to a mooring kleet devereau was first on to the wooden planks allow me he said offering a hand to maddy as she prepared to jump down to join him oh what a gentleman she grasped hold of his hand gratefully thank you becks was next devereau offered her his hand i will not be needing assistance she said casually leaping down with a heavy thud of firmly planted trainers obviously you dont devereau shrugged sergeant freeman yes sir you and half a dozen men along with us the rest to stay on the launch maddy looked around she shivered the morning was still fresh and cool the clear september sky stained a beautiful salmon pink by the rising sun dont be nervous madelaine said becks i am with you she grasped the support units hand im fine she lied just a bit cold thats all devereau joined them what happens now asked maddy her question was answered with movement at the far end of the jetty a welcoming committee had assembled she saw a dozen men in uniforms remarkably similar in design to devereau and his men only a dusty grey instead of a dark blue leading an escort of armed men was an officer in his late thirties sporting a dark beard like colonel devereau only clipped in a way that reminded maddy of some jaunty laughing cavalier a dozen yards short of them he stopped with a theatrical flourish he whipped off his felt slouch cap to reveal long sandy hair and bowed like an actor taking a curtain call colonel devereau what a pleasant surprise he smiled unless ive completely lost track of the date its quite a few weeks yet until thanksgiving is it not colonel wainwright devereau stepped forward and extended his hand indeed im not over here to share our annual bottle of sherry wainwright shrugged mores the pity devereau gestured towards maddy and becks i have with me a couple of ladies who are shall i say in need of some assistance wainwright cocked an eyebrow assistance yes devereau took a step closer to the southern colonel james he lowered his voice for wainwright alone to hear they have quite an intriguing tale to tell very very intriguing something for my ears alone is it bill indeed important i assume very wainwright thoughtfully stroked the side of his face for a moment we shall have to be discreet old friend ive got visitors in this sector british he nodded top brass a routine inspection of our defence network going on in the sector next door to mine he grinned i suspect they might take a dim view of my consorting with the enemy then perhaps we shouldnt waste any time standing out here quite he looked past devereau ladies pleasure to make your acquaintance bill why dont you come with me as it happens ive just put some rather decent coffee on devereau allowed maddy to take the lead in explaining her situation with becks clarifying the finer technical points every now and then technical points as wasted on the southern colonel as theyd been on the northern colonel wainwright sat pokerfaced through half an hour one expression on his face a courteous tolerance like a friendly old man listening to a childs tall story maddy finished and sipped cold coffee well that is a devil of a thing wainwright said eventually he looked at colonel devereau william what do you make of this i would happily have locked her up and considered her to be one of your spies had she not shown me glimpses of her world the southern colonels tawny eyebrows rose with curiosity devereau tapped a shoulder bag maddy had cradled in her lap show him the things you have brought along maddy nodded dipped into the bag and pulled out a copy of wired magazine i buy them occasionally this is septembers issue there was a stack of magazines by her bunk september issues of gadget and games magazines every few days since being recruited she felt compelled to go out and buy some magazines to read in order to feel somehow still in touch with this world god help her she even had a few of those awful gossip magazines with nothing but pictures of drunken celebrities stumbling out of nightclubs and limos wainwright flicked through the glossy pages of specialeffects shots for forthcoming movies maddy pulled out another a national geographic this is better she said more pictures of the real world and not just movies movies like the newsotropes james said devereau moving images with sound ahhh grunted wainwright as he reached for the magazine maddy was holding out he flicked through more pages pausing on a photograph depicting the space shuttle discovery launching from its pad in cape canaveral and another showing the earth from space wainwright looked up at maddy you are telling me this is true that men have stepped off this world oh yes in fact men have stepped on the moon she smiled and thats pretty old news in my time happened back in wainwright shook his head suspiciously at pictures of the international space station being bolted together by a man wearing an impossibly bulky suit of what looked to him like white linen sceptical this is quite a story he stroked his bearded chin i certainly would like to believe a world like this exists he offered maddy a wistful smile i would want to believe that but these pictures they could be the work of the unions propaganda division bill devereau laughed you think my high command could be this inventive the fools can barely organize food parcels for my men wainwright shrugged that much was true well ive got this too maddy pulled out her iphone she switched it on and turned the glowing screen to show the colonel he jerked in his seat one boot inadvertently kicking the table and spilling slops of coffee good heavens what in gods name is that just a mobile telephone she said bit like a field radio i guess he gazed wideeyed at the screen youve got radios right she asked wainwright looked at her wireless communicators devereau had assured her they did far better battlefieldcommunications equipment than his own regiment who still relied on telephonecable technology decades old and prone to frequently going down after southern bombing raids yes yes of course wainwright reached a gloved hand out to touch her iphone such an incredibly small device oh and it does a bunch of other stuff too plays music wanna hear some his eyes glistened in the gloom of the bunker he nodded she tapped the screen and a moment later its small speaker played a scratchy beat and a few garbled words of hip hop both wainwright and devereau made remarkably similar faces something halfway between a wince of disgust and a polite smile of pity this really is music you say music from your time asked wainwright maddy turned it off and offered them an apologetic shrug well not everything is an improvement i guess she handed the iphone to him wainwright was quiet for a few moments as he stroked the glowing screen in silent wonder james said devereau you and i our men could be living our lives in that world not this one he leaned forward his bayonet scabbard tapping a chair leg this girls country is america but its a different america its a whole nation a united nation not a shattered and broken one our men our people have their own flag their own government bill wainwright raised a hand to politely hush his friend he stared at the iphone in silence caressing its smooth screen this this seems to me to be technology far in advance of even the british it is said maddy its everywhere in my time every kid has one well almost every kid he looked at her this is a childs thing oh yeah well not a toy but you know kids can use them he turned to devereau his expression a question bill ive seen other things james these ladies arrived out of nowhere right in the middle of our abandoned old lines by the river they have machines devices you really should inspect them this what this girl is saying this is for real i believe it to be devereau nodded there is no other explanation for these pictures for that device you are holding in your hands wainwright once more gazed at the screen the colourful icons of apps james if shes right if there really is another america it would no longer be a broken battlefield thered be no british and french fighting each other on our soil spilling american blood devereau tapped a finger on a magazine page on the image of the space shuttle launching americans achieved that james not british not french americans wainwright looked up at him his eyes narrowed there was a dream once old friend wasnt there devereau nodded a nation of the free yes there was a dream he passed the phone back over the table to maddy and you say your timetravelling machine can change everything to how it appears in these pictures yes wainwright slowly nodded thoughtfully weighing up all that shed brought to show him well then what is it you need from me becks leaned forward across the table an axial feed parabolic radio antenna excuse me a satellite dish said maddy both colonels looked at her as if she was speaking hebrew a radio dish ah devereau raised a finger i think they may mean a communications saucer maddy nodded yup that sounds like what were after chapter dead city sal grunted in pain as the creature finally dumped her unceremoniously on the ground she looked around at the dark place and saw nothing but a few faint glints of daylight but she could hear plenty grunts and groans the gasp of dozens breathing heavily the rancid odour of stale sweat a match suddenly flared in the darkness and she saw she was in the coal cellar of some building along with the entire pack of these strange creatures the match lit the end of a thick candle already well used sheathed in drips and rivulets of hardened wax in the steady glow she watched the creatures some of them settled themselves on beds of scrap cloth and threadbare mattresses and she realized that this must be their lair for want of a better word some of the creatures had no bed or nest to settle on she noticed that the small childlike creature seemed to be organizing something distributing scraps of cloth for those without something on which to rest she heard hushed mutterings and grunts as it pointed and gestured to make itself understood to half a dozen of the salamanderlike creatures they seemed uncertain of their surroundings and frightened theyre new to this group she supposed this pack must have picked them up on a foray out of her blood ran cold the dead city thats what this place was wasnt it shed caught glimpses turning her head to one side away from the creatures sweatsoaked shoulder caught fleeting glimpses of the outskirts of a deserted town weeds chest high saplings growing in the middle of cracked tarmac roads long ago broken into a crazy paving by mother nature the sun coming up casting shadows from tall brick buildings lined with windows fogged by grime and algae nubs of moss emerging from cracked wooden window frames shed caught sight of old shopfronts and signs faded and flaking mckenzies hardware store russell and bartons candy and confectionery ma jacksons fried chicken signs that swung lifelessly above smashed windows and hollow shells beyond long ago picked clean of anything useful or edible the dead city hadnt that chinese man warned them not to stray any closer miss vikram she turned her head at the sound of the whispered voice and saw to her relief lincoln lying on the pile of coals beside her jahulla she hissed surprised at how pleased she was to see him are you ok his wiry hair was clotted with dried blood one of those infernal big ones walloped me hard in that farmhouse i must have been knocked senseless for a while i think were in that dead city that the chinese man said we shouldnt go near lincoln nodded i believe we are im frightened she said me too lincoln swallowed do you have an idea what these creatures are she shook her head if she believed in the things her parents had once believed in in shivu in brahma and his four heads and vishnu with all his arms all that crazy stuff perhaps she might have allowed herself to think they were something supernatural something evil spawn of hell whispered lincoln demons do you think we died and this is the very first layer of the underworld she looked at him incredulous why do you think that he winced as he fumbled at the lump on his head these are not any creatures of earth i have ever seen their whispered conversation had attracted the attention of the child it stopped organizing the others and wandered over towards them with an awkward gait that looked like an uncomfortable approximation of a person walking as if it was making a conscious effort to appear more human sal and lincoln instantly stopped speaking and looked up at it from the pile of coals they were lying on she could see it more easily now even if it was just by candlelight it was no more than four feet tall slender and narrow shouldered its head was loafshaped like the others but in proportion to its meagre body much larger the creature squatted down a position that looked more comfortable for it to settle into and cocked its oversized head curiously at them its eyes were bigger than those on the apelike variety that had carried her and lincoln bigger and more childlike but it was the mouth that drew her attention there were no lips just a jagged uneven line of scarred ribbed and bumpy flesh as if some careless or perhaps drunk sculptor had fashioned them as an afterthought from lumpy clay sal noticed surprised she hadnt spotted it before that the creature had a dark bowtie tied round its thin neck it looked almost comical and reminded her again of children playing dressup if she wasnt so terrified of what these creatures were going to do to her and lincoln she might have thought this thing actually looked almost cute i im sal she whispered mmy name is ssal she pointed at lincoln and he is aabraham it cocked its head again the eyes all black like a rodents narrowed and faint frown lines appeared on its featureless pale skin the gash of a mouth flexed unpleasantly shal saleena she said again mmy llonger name its saleena shaleena it repeated carefully no its ssssaleena thatsh what i shaid shaleena she realized its malformed mouth was producing a lisp she nodded thats right then it looked at lincoln aybraham it pronounced carefully he nodded the creature looked down at them carefully for a full minute in a thoughtful silence then finally its lips rippled and flexed my name ish shixtyone my name is sixtyone thatsh what my name ushed to be the creatures lips moved in a way that sal interpreted as a possible smile although with the twisted jagged lines of its lips the twitch of movement could have meant anything i changed my name itsh shamuel now she shot a quick glance at lincoln did he just say samuel she looked at it again your name did you ssay yyour name is samuel it nodded there was a hint of childlike pride in that gesture she thought like a little boy showing his teacher that he can actually tie his own shoelaces now thatsh exshactly right it smiled again shamuelsh the name chapter outside dead city captain ewan mcmanus studied the city skyline through field glasses marvellous he muttered without any real enthusiasm he lowered his glasses his eyes squinting back sunlight beneath the peak of his helmet are you saying they went in there asked liam thats the dead city you were talking about last night right mcmanus nodded the very same white bear was beside them hed just returned from scouting ahead tracks lead into city he said many more track go into city as i suspected he tucked the field glasses back into a pouch on his belt this areas been plagued by runaway eugenics they raid for food sometimes just for fun and thats where they scurry back to i also see human track is small light maybe girl said white bear looking at liam your sister she walk maybe eugenic need rest awhile dah oh jayzus thank god shes alive mcmanus slapped his shoulder there you are some jolly good news so what now were going in mcmanus nodded of course well go in this is the kind of thing my lads are used to doing housetohouse urban fighting not for the fainthearted its combat up close and not very pretty im afraid he shook his head of course if the confederate army had the gumption to go in and clean this mess up earlier instead of ignoring the problem we wouldnt have so many eugenics to deal with now he puffed his lips pfft ruddy useless lot nothing more than poorly trained farmhands fools and felons so when mcmanus turned to liam when are we going in liam nodded i shall call in the regimental carrier first a few things my chapsre going to need he turned away from liam towards the rest of the mounted platoon pulling down the communicator from his helmet summon sky god said white bear grinning excuse me big bird in sky it come make much snow dah oh right you like the snow do you the indian nodded vigorously liam turned to look at the silent city once upon a time a city called baltimore from this distance it didnt look dead just peaceful he could see tall buildings towards the middle of it the chimneys of factories the steeples of churches further out and the ordered rows of brick houses in the suburbs a peaceful city slumbering in the midday sun he heard the thud of heavy feet approaching and turned to see bob anything negative bob rumbled hed gone to climb a nearby water tower in the hope that he had a better chance of sniffing something out but still no messages from maddy not even a partial message not even a single tachyon particle which could only mean one thing she had her own problems to deal with same thing different day when werent they desperately fighting their own separate fires chapter new york i presume you are referring to our divisional communications hub said wainwright becks nodded colonel devereau has explained that the hub services communications between this section of your front line and your high command back in fredericksburg virginia he cocked an eyebrow at devereau it appears you have spies at work over here bill we know where it is have done for some time just south of what used to be times square weve seen the dish and the antennae if our sky force was worth spit in a barrel wed have bombed it to rubble years ago wainwright got up and paced towards one wall of his office a huge map all but covered the entire wall pin heads protruded notes were tacked to it and pen marks and scribbles identified troop deployments and defence concentrations all along the east side of manhattan in a war with some movement to it that information would have been critical military intelligence but for devereau most of the information on the map was old news bunkers pillboxes and trenches built many decades ago when both he and wainwright were boys in shorts devereau knew as much about the deployment of wainwrights men as he did his own the southern colonel tapped the map with a finger here as you say just below what used to be called times square not so very far away from here so said maddy lets go and get it not so far away but the communications bunker is garrisoned by a detachment of british troops he shrugged they dont trust regular confederate troops with guarding it just a bunch of dumb ol cornseed hicks thats how they see us he turned to look at the map for a moment then back to them that would mean taking it by force attacking it he let those words ring off the hard walls of the room eventually he shook his head and sighed im sorry that is the only communications equipment we have along this section of the line is there no other way to fix your machine negative said becks wainwright looked at them at the magazines open on the table at the small glowing screen of the device the girl had called an iphone the evidence of another world was there he was more than certain the north didnt have this kind of technology or the knowledge the imagination the ability to produce the images in those magazines and he was doubly certain they could never have constructed such a device what youre asking is for me to carry out an act of treason being here talking to you now james i too am guilty of treason said devereau we are both already guilty enough to face a firing squad wainwright nodded accepting the point but this taking that bunker exchanging fire with british soldiers he bit his lip you do understand what that means an act of mutiny yes the words had a sobering effect on both officers maddy picked up on that look maybe theres another way negative said becks again a radio communication transmission dish is the component we require modification would have to be made to maddy raised her hand to hush her you guysll never face a firing squad because as soon as were done fixing your dish to our technology we can change this world back devereau turned to her but should this plan fail for whatever reason then the consequences for our men as well as ourselves would be dire to say the least wainwright sat down at his table colonel devereau and i being guilty of treason is one thing we would both face our firing squads but a mutiny he poured himself the dregs of cooling coffee from the chipped jug between them every man of the regiment would be punished whether they took part or not devereau nodded slowly i cant ask my men to do that we could show them all what we just showed you said maddy no he shook his head no i fear not many of them would fully understand and not understanding they would not dare risk facing charges of mutiny there was a knock on the door to his room enter a young mans face with a grey forage cap perched on a thatch of gingercoloured hair looked round the door sir yes corporal you asked me to warn you when the british were coming well they are sir thank you lawrence instruct the men to prepare for an inspection yes sir the door closed behind him youll need to leave immediately said wainwright it should take them ten minutes to make their way down here best youre long gone by then please said maddy please think about it here maam you should take your things with you he said gathering up her magazines becks grabbed the magazines and the iphone and placed them in a shoulder bag well just think about it we have to fix this history begged maddy you think this war is bad enough it could get worse wainwright stiffened ignoring her pleas colonel devereau will you please take these ladies with you back to your lines devereau nodded of course he offered wainwright a salute which the southern officer returned crisply he turned on a boot heel opened the door and stepped into the concrete corridor outside come on miss carter he said grasping maddys arm we have to leave right now but she gripped the edge of the table to stop him ushering her out but hes our only freakin hope we have to sergeant freeman freemans head appeared in the doorway a little help here please becks surprisingly agreed with the colonel it is advisable to leave now madelaine we should recalculate our options back at the archway five minutes later they were on the launch chugging sluggishly back across the east river maddy stared at the slowly approaching rubbleandruin landscape of brooklyn and wondered if their only hope was to try to convince colonel devereau and his men to launch their own attack to capture this communications bunker looking at him looking at sergeant freeman the other soldiers old and young alike sitting in their threadbare uniforms with the same patient look of defeat etched on each face she realized they werent fighting men they were draftees men serving whatever period they were required to serve counting away days until they might one day see their homes again unless there was some other option some other course of action they were well and truly stuck in this mess forget helping liam and sal forget worrying about handwritten warnings from the future she and becks were nothing more than two civilians stuck in the ruined and contested wasteland of an eternal war chapter outside dead city liam gazed out of the forward observation windows of the carriers bridge a long horseshoe array of glass panels that allowed the late summer sun to flood in and bathed the place with warmth and light passing beneath them was a patchwork of fields that had seemed so much larger on the ground and just ahead the fields gave way to the outskirts of the dead city ordered rows of suburban homes with gardens long ago gone to seed giving way to smaller more tightly packed homes and those giving way to drab brickbuilt tenement blocks further ahead the apartment blocks grew taller and shared standing room with factories and warehouses and office blocks all as dead and still as gravestones in a cemetery well be landing shortly said captain mcmanus he nodded at a thickset man in his forties with silvergrey hair and muttonchop sideburns that flared out generously colonel donohue is sending us in with three companies of men and some of our experimentals experimentals please explain said bob mcmanus smiled youll see soon enough the drone of the carriers engines changed in tone and the vessel began a gentle descent liam saw tendrils of mist waft up beside the bridge windows and remembered the bizarre sight of a sky suddenly filling with a blizzard whats with all the snow the carrier uses lighterthanair gases and vacuum voids to create lift but its still not quite enough to make a ship this size entirely buoyant so from the bottom of her hull we vent a cloud of nitrogen which chills the air causing it to become more dense which of course provides us with additional lift we are in effect creating a bed of thicker air on which we sit and we just carry that bed along with us but the snow well if the airs humid then the moisture in the air becomes snow you see captain mcmanus called out the colonel yes sir best ready your men for disembarking right you are sir he tapped liams arm this way mcmanus led them out of the bridge on to the quarterdeck outside and down a ladder to the spar deck below as he descended the steep steps liam made the mistake of looking out past the brass handrail at the slowly looming cityscape below oh jayzus he said queasily i didnt want to go and do that vertigo some of my chaps suffer from it said mcmanus grinning just dont look down liam and bob joined him on the deck at the bottom and then to liams relief they were led inside again past several soldiers who politely stepped aside for them as they descended another ladder into a large equipment hangar he stopped at the bottom of the steps my god he whispered the hangar looked to be about fifty to seventyfive feet wide and three or four times that in length roughly the size of a small football pitch the space was filled with three hundred men mustering forming up checking each others backpacks and webbing several dozen of the huffaloes corralled in one corner it was cold chilled by the artificial arctic mist being generated outside the hull plumes of breath lifted from every man despite the wretched churning concern for sals perilous circumstances his hope that somewhere in the city below she was still alive liam experienced a moment of wonder at the bustling activity before him across the hangar deck he saw several dozen doglike animals but not dogs not like any dogs hed ever seen larger almost as big as lions but lithe and thin like greyhounds they had oddly humanlike heads baboonlike in fact with keen human eyes that seemed to convey intelligence what are those hunterseekers eugenics of course we used them to great effect in afghanistan and northern india theyre very good at sniffing out insurgents squeezing their way into caves and tunnels and whathaveyou then calling in their position and describing the troop strength calling in you mean they can talk yes of course be ruddy useless to us otherwise he raised an eyebrow and chuckled at liams wideeyed gawp oh i wouldnt expect anything too deep and profound to come out of their mouths youll not get hamlet out of them im afraid theyre really no smarter than small children what seriously did you just say small children an intelligence designed to be equivalent to that of a fiveyearold child he added we made our mistakes with earlier classes of eugenics designed some to be far too intelligent for their own good thats the trick you see engineer them to be clever enough to carry out the tasks theyre designed for and no more if theyre kept simpleminded its easier to keep them happy liam was busy digesting the fact that in this insane world there were baboondogs that could talk meanwhile mcmanus wandered off to locate his junior officers and ncos he turned to look at bob who shrugged and gurned a smile at him this is getting to be far too weird a reality for me whispered liam bob nodded we must find them soon before another wave arrives chapter dead city food there was food of sorts sal watched the eugenic creatures hungrily devouring the scraps theyd scavenged on their raid she could see several old and rusted cans being passed around the labels that indicated their contents long ago faded or torn off rats plenty of rats caught and skinned cooked over a small fire cobs of corn being stripped out of their husks she saw samuel among the muttering cluster of creatures organizing them ensuring every creature in his pack had something to eat pack thats the term shed used for them earlier but now now that she knew that at least some of these things could talk just like a human and the others well they might not be able to talk but they behaved with a clear intelligence pack felt like the wrong word to use samuel came over to her and lincoln with a handful of food items cradled in his thin arms you musht eat shomething or you will shtarve he held a rat carcass on a stick it was still sizzling from the fire he offered it to them itsh very good sal shook her head i cant gods teeth uttered lincoln i cant eat a rat samuel shrugged i will have it then how about shomething elshe corn sal nodded it was raw but then she realized she was starving please lincoln nodded i have eaten corn raw before samuel handed them each a cob in its husk and then squatted down on his haunches to consume the rat the buildings coal cellar echoed with the sounds of eating slurping chewing the grunting satisfaction of hunger being sated samuel said sal quietly why why are we here the eugenic looked up from his carcass you are both our prishonersh did you say prisoners asked lincoln yesh sal peeled the last of the husk away and hungrily nibbled some of the ears of corn off the cob but why sholdiersh will be coming here shoon soldiers one of the other bandsh they killed shome people very shtoopid samuel looked at them killed humansh like you that will make the sholdiersh come here i know thish he shook his head and casually slapped his forehead that wash very shtoopid shaddyah how human a gesture was that it was just the sort of daft thing maddy would do exasperated and stressed out over something we are to be hostages asked lincoln samuel cocked his head hoshtagesh what doesh that mean you will use our lives to bargain for yours perhapsh he nodded slowly ideas forming and reforming behind his big eyes if we give you back shafe and shound maybe they leave ush all alone he hunched narrow shoulders we dont normally kill humansh it meansh trouble shomething bad musht have happened he carefully tore another chunk from the cooked rat sal saw how carefully he chewed careful to keep the loose irregular flaps of his lips free of his teeth she dared herself to ask what happened to your mouth samuel shook his head i wash birthed with a normal mouth jush like yoursh shaleena i wash deshigned to work on machinery designed yesh made by shmart men in a faraway town called oxford they grow ush genicsh over there in them big vatsh genics sal frowned do you mean youre genetically engineered things you say you worked on machinery said lincoln he nodded mechanic he said with a hint of pride a mechanic genic very clever me my genic type fixesh broken machinery in factoriesh make them work very shmooth again but me and my big mouth sal figured he was grinning but it was hard to tell i got in shome big big trouble lincoln pulled corn from between his teeth trouble yesh one of the big worker genicsh got crushed and killed by one of the factory machinesh i shaw what happened it wash a humansh fault the machine wash shet up all wrong and i shaid sho but the humansh wouldnt lishen to me he shrugged casually sho i told all the manualworker eugenicsh they should put down their toolsh and shtop working until they fixshed the machine and put it right otherwishe thered be another one killed and another and another what happened they shewed my mouth up with a needle and thread shaid i wash a troublemaker shee they dont like it when a genic talksh back at them that and when they turned over my bunk room they dishcovered i had booksh they didnt like that at all didnt like how i taught myshelf to read very dangeroush givesh all the other eugenicsh big samuel struggled to say the next word carefully he just about managed to say it without a lisp ideas he took another careful bite they shtopped making the very clever type like me yearsh ago too much trouble with all the talking back i still do not understand how they make you said lincoln at firsht a century ago it wash breeding one animal with another to make new animalsh shelective breeding they call it but now they know how to make a creature from nothing i heard shomeone shay the shmart men in oxford can play with the code of nature shome might even shay itsh the code of god the proper term for thish technique though ish eugenology samuel finished his rat and discarded the wooden skewer with nothing more than the rodents blackened bones and a few rags of sinewy meat left on it they write thish code then they grow ush jush like tomato plansh in a big factory farm grow like plants yesh in large tub of shtinky gunky shtuff they call proteen growth sholution shaddyah whispered sal just like bob one of the other eugenics called out samuels name uhoh shomeone needsh me he looked at their uneaten corn eat it you will need your shtrength for later he got up and padded across the cellar on his knuckles and flat feet leaving sal and lincoln alone good god his story is remarkable uttered lincoln he looked at sal grown just like a field of beans unless he is making fools of us sal shook her head biting into the corn cob again hes talking about genetics its a pretty big technology in my time everythings genetically modified just like bob bob your big friend uhhuh designed just like these then grown in a large tube of gunk chapter new york colonel james wainwright he refused to stand to attention and salute the british officer the man had rudely arrogantly strode into his room without even the courtesy of knocking wainwright did however bother to look up from signing the stack of requisition forms in front of him the officer looked to be about half his age barely into his twenties and yet sporting a rank above his yes what is it the officer bristled at wainwrights dismissive tone it is customary to salute a senior officer wainwright sat back in his chair casually and splayed his hands well what do you want he didnt recognize the young mans face he must be a relatively newly commissioned officer the collar and chest insignia denoted he was from ssid signals security and intelligence division the group of officers carrying out the inspection along this section of the front line the young man stepped forward pulled a chair out from under the desk and casually sat down colonel wainwright he said quietly serving commander of the virginia regiment i know who i am thank you lets dispense with formality if you wish you can call me rupert wainwright said nothing he studied the young officer with barely concealed contempt how long have you been in command here colonel wainwright roughly in command nine years three months and seven days if you must know but ive been staring across this infernal piece of river at the enemy for nearly twenty years rupert steepled his fingers thoughtfully a long time far too long well the young man lowered his voice a little it should be a relief then wainwright looked sharply at him relief you know things are in motion the powers that be have a feeling this stalemate this cold war has run its course served its purpose and now theyd like to be finished with it that caught wainwrights attention he sat forward good god a truce is that what youre talking about rupert chuckled at that no of course not a push colonel a final push and were going to make that push into the northern heartland through whats left of this pile of rubble he shrugged apologetically sorry did i say rubble i meant through whats left of new york thats madness theyre dug in as deep as ticks on a dogs back any infantry landing on the far side would be mown down oh i wouldnt worry too much about that old chap between the sky navys pounding and the experimentals well be sending in alongside your boys i think well experimentals rupert smiled coolly yes eugenics youre mixing eugenics with my men dont panic colonel these arent like the old varieties far more reliable wainwright stood up leaning over his desk towards the young man we had a promise from high command a castiron promise no more militarypurpose eugenics no more of those those monsters tsk tsk theyre not monsters colonel theyre just tools for a specific job just tools from our tool box a tool lad doesnt turn on its owner a tool doesnt rip to shreds the enemy then turn on its handler and rip him to shreds and then when theres nothing left to kill rip itself to shreds oh please youre referring to that preston incident arent you that happened nearly twenty years ago we have much more reliable behaviour inhibitors in our eugenics now the men wont tolerate this said wainwright my men wont fight alongside them tolerate did you say rupert stared at the southern colonel coolly then eventually his face softened well now strictly speaking wainwright they wont be alongside them anyway your chaps will be in the first wave ashore creating a bridgehead for the attack then he smiled well ship our monsters as you call them over and let them loose on the enemy this is insane i im i shall protest this through well now heres the thing you can protest all you like colonel and you can do it from your cell in camp elizabeth what did you say the mere mention of the military internment camp silenced wainwright a long pause in which his mind raced to determine what this rupert might know about him thats right im actually here to relieve you of duty and i suspect youll face a relatively prompt court martial why whats the charge the young man cocked an eyebrow i think you know why or would you like me to clarify that for you wainwright nodded i think you better had well now you see i have a file on you jolly fat one actually its been open for a couple of years now too many rumours floating around that youve gone soft on the enemy we know youve had an unauthorized meeting with officers on the other side on several separate occasions we know that several years ago you ordered the release of northern prisoners of war to return they were deserters they werent fit to fight anyone they just wanted to return home even this morning a little bird told me you received a visit from across the river im afraid this really wont do with the buildup for the offensive we really cant afford to have a frontline commander whos in the habit of taking tea with the enemy wainwright stared at him you are relieving me of my command with immediate effect im afraid the young officer offered him an insincere shrug of sympathy now theres two ways we can do this i can summon a squad of my chaps to drag you out kicking and screaming not very dignified im sure you wouldnt want your boys seeing you leaving like that or we can do this like proper gentlemen youll assign a temporary regimental commander to cover you can gather whatever personal effects you want and we shall leave together he smiled it would be far better for you and your men that way i think wainwright glanced at the open door he could see the hallway outside the pooling of light from an overhead bulb and the shadow of a soldier standing to attention his or mine the young man stretched a whitegloved hand across the desk towards him i shall need your sidearm colonel if you dont mind wainwright unzipped the holster feeling the firm grip of the revolver in his hand please he whispered ill come without a fuss but listen to me you cant send in eugenics alongside my men itll be a massacre we need proper regiments on the front line now wainwright men prepared to fight not traitors like you or cowards or these semiliterate peasants that you call soldiers there will be british troops in the vanguard once we have a toehold but your peasant militia will be the ones going in first the gun was suddenly in his hand and the room already booming with the fading echo of a single shot fired before he had a conscious thought of what hed just done through the cloud of dissipating bluegrey smoke he saw the young man staring back at him a third eye in the middle of his forehead puckered and red and spilling a small dark trickle of almost black blood down his surprised young face his mouth flapped open with a gurgle you you was all he managed to say before his eyes rolled upwards showing just the whites and he toppled over on to the floor one booted foot began to drum post mortem against the leg of his desk wainwright aimed the gun at the doorway as the shadow outside jerked and moved a head suddenly appeared round the door that of his gingerhaired adjutant he stared goggleeyed at the gun then at the stilltwitching young man you just shot a british officer yes lawrence i do seem to have done that wainwright pursed his lips thoughtfully for a moment how many men did he bring twelve where are they canteen sir arrest them arrest them you heard me confiscate their weapons strip them of any radio equipment and lock them up in the stores bunker then then he balled his fists tapping them against his desk insistently urging his racing mind to focus properly then i want you to double the guards on our command bunkers and gun emplacements nobody comes in nobody goes out sir the lieutenant turned to go and lawrence yes sir pull all the cables in the radio room linking us to the communications hub all of them every last one he was sure the british were going to miss their officer soon enough and word would find its way back that there was trouble brewing but the longer he had for that news to travel the better the young lieutenant looked pale whats going to happen to us sir nothing good im afraid i must talk to the men shall i have them assembled no no not yet i need to go and see someone first he looked up at lawrence not a word to anyone about this yet do you understand he nodded and lock this room up ill be back as quickly as i can where are you going sir to meet the enemy chapter dead city gods teeth tis a freak show whispered lincoln sal found herself nodding she estimated there were about a hundred and fifty of them in the abandoned albion theatre rows of stained and faded burgundy velvet seats sprouting tufts of stuffing through ripped seams faced a stage made of damp and rotting wooden boards beneath a partially collapsed roof moisture dripped from above with a steady taptaptapping and the waning afternoon light cast slanted rosetinted rays down into the gloom of the auditorium samuel it appeared was one of the leaders of this odd assortment of unnatural creations along with two others a leadership committee of sorts one of them was even thinner than the type she thought of as salamanderlike impossibly thin she wondered where the creature managed to store its internal organs its arms and legs were sticklike bulging unpleasantly at the joints its head instead of being loafshaped like many of the other types was tall and tapered like a traffic cone samuel had told them every eugenics shape was designed specifically for a purpose sal could only imagine this one was designed to slither through pipes or at least wriggle through some very tight places it looked like a fleshcoloured cigar with limbs have ignored us this long because we just a nuisance not a danger its chest was so slim and its lungs must have been so tiny that it was forced to pant like a dog on a hot day its words broken up into garbled bites between each rapid breath i say that we stay hidden here it shuffled on thin trembling legs to a stool at the side of the stage and perched on the edge of it another of the leaders spoke this one looked like an even bulkier version of the apetype it swayed topheavy with muscles that flexed and wobbled with a life of their own its head looked like an apple nestling almost lost between two watermelons for shoulders and on top of its head an oldfashioned top hat was perched sal realized that even though its head looked no bigger than an apple compared to its body it had to be the same size as an adult humans for it to fit so snugly its huge the rest of the eugenic was oddly out of proportion its waist tapered in and the legs short and fat seemed almost like an afterthought if them humans come it said with a voice so deep sal felt something vibrate in her own chest it stabbed a finger as big as a canteloupe at her and lincoln if them come maybe we kill these both show them soldiers their heads them be frightened off not bother us no more the apes deep voice made bobs barrelround voice sound like the whine of a mosquito samuel put the shotgun hed been cradling in his skinny arms down on the stage and scooted forward no thatsh shtoopid we need them alive if we kill them they will really take a bloody revenge on all of ush im sure no humans will come samuel whispered the cigarlike one they have left us alone this long but that wash before shome shtoopid genicsh killed shome of them samuel scuttled across the stage and looked up at the apes tiny apple head it wash one of your lot lasht week washnt it the ape shrugged guiltily maybe you idiot snapped samuel were all going to be dead thanksh to you they wont enter the city samuel panted the cigar they still fear all the poisons and the diseases sal noticed his thin legs were shaking again under the stress of standing he may have been designed to squeeze into tight places but clearly those legs werent created to hold his weight for long once again the cigar perched on the edge of the stool why did you steal some humans anyway becaushe henry becaushe i heard about thish foolsh shtupid raid i heard about the humansh being killed women and children and i knew we better have shomething to bargain with when they come for ush here the ape stooped over samuel his looming shadow filling half the stage call me fool again sam i squash you samuel looked up at him his ragged lips flapping sal wondered whether that was fear or frustration the audience stared in silence and the taptaptapping of rainwater continued in the background sal watched the frozen tableau for a moment she wondered whether somehow shed been sucked down a rabbit hole and was stuck in some bizarre postapocalyptic version of alices wonderland gimme them humans said the ape i kill them go take em heads and throw at them redcoats if them come that scare them away if not he grinned at the shotgun lying on the stage then we now got nice big gun samuel shook his head and tutted they have bigger gunsh you big dumb mump and many more of them too we wouldnt lasht a minute fighting them jerry the ape jerry smacked a threedigit fist down on to the old floorboards the entire stage rattled i want fight them not running like he scratched his head struggling for an example samuel waited until it was clear jerry wasnt going to come up with anything truth ish jerry you killing humansh wash a big mishtake didnt mean to sam them got in the way an an just happened real quick well we cant unhappen it now itsh done samuel shrugged bony shoulders perhapsh my taking shome human prishonersh wash a mishtake too he lowered his big head on his narrow neck weve pushed our luck too far thish time i shay we musht all leave find a new place to hide where will we go samuel wheezed henry samuel put a finger to his ragged lips thoughtful for a moment we could try north there was whispering and muttering from the auditorium shome of you know i can read right well i ushed to read thingsh that are called a book book the apes applehead frowned what them marksh on paper you big mump wordsh knowledge call me a mump again and i smash you samuel casually waved away jerrys outburst shush let me finish i ushed to read booksh about the world how it ushed to be they call booksh about that short of thing hishtory booksh the audience of genics muttered the phrase trying it out on their own varied lips there ushed to be humansh treated jusht like ush they called them negroesh they looked different they had dark shkin were treated like complete mumps but shome of the pale humansh felt shorry for them and they figured they wash jusht ash normal ash other humansh so samuel what is your point said henry his thin wheezy voice whistled asthmatically you know about the human war right theresh one shide called the northies and then theresh our lot maybe if we go north and find the northies they might treat ush different them northies rumbled the ape you say them human too yesh of courshe they are them will treat us just same all humans bad not all humansh shome of them all humans bad i kill them what come in our city some of the audience of eugenics roared support for that samuel sighed he turned to look up at the big ape then pointed to the top hat rammed tightly on his head then why jerry if you hate humansh sho much why do you try and look more like one of them hmm and why did you pick a human name jerrys face frowned at that anger and confusion in equal measures the theatre was silent for a moment samuel let that question hang in the air for the giant to ponder eventually a big fist reached up and pulled the top hat off jerry tossed it across the stage stoopid hat anyway he rumbled jerry henry all of you lishen to me i shay we musht leave here tomorrow i know the humansh are coming can feel it in my bonesh and they will kill ush all if we shtay im sure of it jerry shook his head defiantly them come here we gonna smash them up there were more roars of approval from the seats well thatsh up to you me im leaving tomorrow and im taking those two prishonersh with me he said pointing towards sal and lincoln them stay here sam waddled up to jerry stood toe to toe and glowered up at him theyre mine i found them you want them you gotta take em off me jerrys tiny blackdot eyes returned the challenge his huge fists bunched and flexed as they glared at each other for a dozen silent seconds you gonna shmash me up then jerry said nothing well finally jerry looked down shamefaced at the stage boards between his big feet no sam he muttered thatsh right youre not he shook his head becaushe without me to figure out the complicated thingsh for you youd be losht he looked out at the bizarre menagerie sitting among the rows of threadbare seats all of you would be their noises chirrups mutterings howlings dwindled to a silence we have to leave the army men will come because humansh were killed we should leave tomorrow morning head north and find a new home he glanced at sal and lincoln not all humansh hate our gutsh these two sheem different to me maybe them northy people think different too he shrugged maybe not but i know we cant shtay here not no more we knew thish day gonna happen eventually anyway ancient weatherworn timber creaked to fill the long silence sams right i think panted henry we have to go jerry looked at him sensing wiser minds than his had reached a consensus he couldnt begin to argue against he sighed maybe you right of courshe i am sorry sam he said finally dont worry about it sam reached out and patted one of his bulging knuckles you big ol mump you gotta jusht trusht me all right wed be real dumb to shtay put and fight them sholdiersh real dumb sam waddled towards the edge of the stage and looked out at the dark rows of seats and we aint no dummiesh are we chapter dead city sal stared up at the stars through the shutters of their coal cellar oddly calming she thought in a world turned upsidedown where everything was wrong bizarre you could at least look up at the sky and see normality stars that shone regardless of who won a civil war or who should or should not be a president their light was billions of years old they didnt have a care that a girl from stuck in the year in a world that should never have been was watching them funny that across from her she could see samuel on a nest of worn blankets twitching in his sleep his ragged lips rustling like tent flaps with every shallow breath around him other genics of all the standard types shed seen were curled up and fast asleep producing a chorus of breathing different sounds different rhythms soft whimperings halfspoken muttered words feet and hands jerking and curling she realized these manufactured creatures dreamed in their sleep just like humans twitched and flexed like babies in a womb babies children yes just like frightened children even the smart ones like sam and that strange thin one henry even that giant ape ferocious though he might look he was like a little baby inside that miniature head and wasnt it so childlike their futile efforts to look more human the items of clothing they each tried their best to wear properly the names they chose for themselves they had every reason to despise humans for the way theyd been treated yet they did all they could to be more like them after the gathering at the deserted theatre the various packs had returned to their dens to settle in for the night she and lincoln had spoken with sam for a while softly as the other creatures began to fall asleep shed asked him about his life what it was like to be made hed told her about the growth farms in the english countryside enormous factories of iron struts and grimy glass where near to fullgrown genics were birthed from giant copper vats then cleaned clothed and numbered and about living from day one in schoolhouses long huts stacked with hard bunk beds and straw mattresses living there to be educated on the basics they needed for their lifelong roles taught by other genics designed specifically to teach his description of the growth farms had reminded her of the enormous internment camps back in along indias northern border with pakistan the lives of refugees lived entirely within chainlink compounds one day like any other then with no warning at all hed been crated up like so much freight and shipped to a far corner of the british empire sam had told them that at first hed worked in a very hot place where the humans were of sals colour mostly darker there hed worked on maintaining field harvesters stripping them cleaning the engines alongside human workers who lived only marginally better lives than the genics did it had been one of them who had taught him how to read then again without warning hed been packaged like freight and shipped to another country and another eventually learning from the scraps of books and pamphlets he picked up and squirrelled away the names of all these strange places new rhodesia great albany british central district cape georgia finally ending up in a place called america sam said he could read most things only occasionally did he find language too difficult for him to understand but his one big regret was that he couldnt write more than a childs untidy scrawl his hands designed to hold spanners and wrenches lacked the dexterity to manage something as straightforward as a pencil if he could have written things hed said he would have liked to have written singsong stories sal had no idea what those were perhaps he meant poems on that note hed said he needed his rest and was fast asleep within seconds she wondered if that was a deliberately designed ability to be able to flick a switch inside and be instantly unconscious or whether it was a lifetimes habit learning to get rest when it was available abraham she whispered in the dark there was no reply lincoln she tried again nothing she was going to ask him what he thought of an idea she had to see if they could slip out of the cellar unheard escape the city and try to intercept these soldiers the genics were certain were coming their way perhaps seeing them free and unharmed the soldiers might let the creatures go be redeployed to do something more useful elsewhere or if not then perhaps she and lincoln might be able to send them off in the wrong direction on a wildgoose chase give these things a chance to escape and find a new home somewhere else but the deep voice of a genic grunted irritably out of the darkness shut up resting now so much for that idea then chapter outside dead city liam watched the night sky he was looking at the very same stars as sal in front of them was the outline of the dark city suburbs mcmanus prodded the dying fire with a stick we shall wait till first light liam then well send in the hounds another delay of hours liam did his best to contain the frustration behind gritted teeth they should find those runaways easily enough and your sister and friend too liam glanced across the trampled field lit by several campfires the hounds that mcmanus referred to were those large baboonheaded dogs he could see them clustered around one of the fires eating rations of food out of a trough he could see flashes of long teeth as they periodically raised their heads and chewed hungrily on what appeared to be dry nuggets of protein biscuit they look pretty ferocious so they do are you sure my sisters going to be safe from them indeed those hunterseekers wont harm them theyve been instructed howll they know who it is theyre not to hurt though white bear has had them all get a taste of the tracks left by the genics they know the smell of your sister and have orders to follow the scent locate them and then report in liam looked at him sceptically instructed you said you make them sound almost human mcmanus grinned he put his fingers in his mouth and whistled one of the hunterseekers looked up from his feeding trough yes thats right you over there packalpha come here the creature obediently got up off its haunches and trotted across the camp towards them liam shared a look with bob ive never seen a dog so well trained well firstly remember these things arent dogs said mcmanus the hunterseeker came to a halt in front of them waist high almost as big as a great dane you may sit packalpha thanks guv it grunted slim hindquarters settling down on the dusty ground this civilian is mr liam oconnor and the big chap is mr bob oconnor its their sister and friend whove been taken by the runaways now for their peace of mind would you please tell them what your orders are it turned intelligent babooneyes on to liam a pink tongue protruded from its long furry muzzle and moistened its thin dark leathery lips follow smelltrail find humans and what will you do when you find them it cocked its head and liam could have sworn the thing rolled its eyes as if that was the most stupid question a person could ask call home mcmanus pointed to a leather strap round the creatures neck beneath its jaw was a small brass box with a simple toggle switch on it they flip that switch and it turns on a shortrange radio beacon which we can then follow in it also opens the microphone so they can tell us exactly what theyre seeing they make excellent reconnaissance units he turned back to the genic squatted down to inspect an ident number on its collar ahh youre packalphatwo sorry didnt recognize you there george isnt it liam choked a surprised laugh george ahh yes we let them pick their own informal names they like to do it makes them feel a part of the regiment doesnt it ol chap the creature nodded good name george just like king thats right just like our king george mcmanus patted the top of his small round head george is one of our best did some really rather excellent work rooting out the bad chaps from the mountains in afghanistan didnt you bad men i kill you did jolly well george very well indeed george turned his baboonhead to look back at his pack and the trough a worried frown rolling along the protruding brow above his eyes go eat now guv ah yes better get off before those greedy beggars in your squad finish all the chow dismissed the hunterseeker turned and trotted back across the makeshift camp liam shook his head at the bizarre conversation hed just witnessed yes theyre a very helpful eugenic product said mcmanus far more efficient at tracking than any human can be better even than dare i say our indian chap white bear why did you not use those hunter creatures earlier then asked bob when we were following the trail from the farmhouse bob nodded trackings not just following a scent or footprints its thinking assessing how you personally would attempt to hide your trail its like playing chess predicting an opponents move george and his chums cant do anything sophisticated like that theyre jolly good though at following a scent tracking and following a scent two very different things the names said liam why do they pick names like that human names mcmanus shrugged eugenics thats the odd thing they all want in some way to be more human after all i suppose they must think of us as as i suppose their parents in a way they are just children really though simpleminded children high up in the sky the regimental carrier slowly manoeuvred in a wide turning arc a searchlight periodically lancing out into the darkness and combing the ground around the camp mcmanus poked and prodded their campfire with a stick stirring the glowing embers to life even the wild ones the runaways they take human names weve noticed them try to mimic us when they can sometimes wearing items of clothing bracelets hats that kind of thing like black slaves used to do mcmanus stopped midstride black slaves he glared at liam good grief youre talking about human slavery liam nodded yes barbaric he spat an abhorrent savage practice i thank god we live in modern more enlightened times so your side the south angloconfederacy he corrected liam north and south those are old names from bygone times the angloconfederacy then it doesnt keep black slaves any more does it good god mr oconnor are you actually trying to be offensive this evening liam winced no i im sorry i just wondered do you honestly think his majestys government our armed forces this prestigious regiment would fight alongside any nation that actually kept humans as slaves we put an end to that in this country nearly a century and a half ago mcmanus shook his head disapprovingly good lord look around you why dont you mr oconnor were not ruddy barbarians in the british army he got up and strode off leaving liam and bob behind liam looked at bob what i just asked the question thats all i believe you may have angered mcmanus said bob liam nodded i think youre right he looked around just as mcmanus had suggested at the men sitting beside campfires in their woollen undershirts and braces the junior officers around their brazier warming their hands hed been so distracted by their desperate mission to rescue sal and lincoln distracted by the bizarre technology of this world and the curious talking creatures it had spawned that hed failed to note that at least a third of these men and officers in crimson tunics and pith helmets were darkskinned professional soldiers recruited from every corner of the british empire oh i see he pressed his lips realizing now why his clumsy question might have caused mcmanus to snap angrily at him i guess i probably need to go and apologize chapter new york devereau watched his southern counterpart jump down off the prow of the launch and wade through the lapping tide up the shingle towards him wainwright stood a yard short and offered him a crisp salute colonel twice in one day devereau returned the salute we make poor enemies dont we wainwright nodded politely at maddy and becks standing a little further behind devereau william we must talk quickly whats the matter the british are preparing an offensive in this sector another every two or three years it seemed the angloconfederacy probed somewhere along the front line with a halfhearted assault thousands of men usually dead or injured for a front line that might have shifted a quartermile in one direction or the other it made headlines in newspapers it gave the generals on either side a chance to earn campaign medals but it achieved nothing useful no william this ones for good they want a significant victory this time oh they want to take new york wainwright stepped a little closer and lowered his voice and theyre sending in experimentals eugenics devereau felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise he fought to keep a rigid expression on his face james are you certain of this certain wainwright laughed bitterly i have just committed an act of treason of course im certain theyre coming your way william and theyre going to throw every little monster in their box of tricks right at you god help us whispered devereau he glanced over his shoulder at maddy and becks then back at wainwright james perhaps youll reconsider your position on the discussion we had this morning thats why im here old friend these two young women do you do i believe their story devereau considered his answer for a moment youve seen their pictures their small device im no technician but i swear that thing is beyond even the capability of the british wainwright nodded and theres more to see in their bunker if you want to come and wainwright raised a hand theres little time i believe i have little choice but to believe them i have nothing left but hope that they can change all of this devereau turned and beckoned maddy and becks to join them maddy smiled colonel she said politely miss carter i have agreed to join my efforts with colonel devereau and help you fix your time machine really oh thats william miss madelaine miss becks wainwright drew a deep breath i have committed an act of treason and mutiny as soon as they discover this they will be swarming all over my sector if there are parts you need to take from the british communications hub then we will need to move quickly if we can retrieve what you need from there said devereau how long will it take you to fix your time machine maddy turned to becks becks i am unable to give a precise estimate connecting and configuring a radio communications dish may take her eyelids flickered for a moment thirteen hours what gasped wainwright that is far too long in addition we need to establish a source of power our generator utilizes petroleumderived diesel do you have this fuel type the colonels looked at each other wainwright shook his head i have not heard of it southern engines run on a liquidform fuel we call maizolene i believe it is a mixture of cornbased alcohol and texas oil as i suspected said becks a variety of hybrid ethanol then we would need to adapt the generator to run on this fuel this may not be possible in which case we would need to acquire one of your engines and use that as the motorized device to turn the generators dynamo to produce electrical power maddy sucked her teeth that sounds like a lot of work correct beckss eyes blinked again approximately thirty hours of work she turned to maddy but i am making several significant assumptions in this calculation it could take much longer good god there is no time for this the british will be here before we can unless we buy her the time she needs said devereau the others looked at him james he continued you and i have said this before have we not this war is not the war it started out as its not our war wainwright nodded this is a war no american would want the colonels eyed each other silently long enough so that maddy felt the need to say something what what the hell are you guys thinking james i think no i know my men would join me what about yours the confederate colonel turned to look back across the east river i believe they might he glanced at devereau particularly if they learn what the british are planning to do what maddy looked from one to the other what are you two talking about an uprising said devereau a mutiny added wainwright both men smiled at the thought of it it could spread said devereau really it could spread right along the front line if someone somewhere dared to make the start of it word would need to get out you and i william wed need to make absolutely sure the news got out wainwright grinned suddenly there is not a regiment old friend not a single confederate regiment that would not celebrate an end to this damned war oh my god is that your plan then asked maddy a popular uprising if news spreads among the men said devereau that the british plan to deploy eugenic military units again on american soil yes good lord this could this could truly take hold the soldiers on both sides the general public would be terrified of another preston peak massacre and if it comes to it added wainwright if it came down to it our men im sure would fight side by side maddy thought she saw tears in devereaus eyes my god james this could be it a tinderbox issue americans can unite on militaryuse eugenics being used over here again thats what needs to be said old friend loud and clear so everyone can hear it his grin widened this is the flame to the thatch indeed maddy looked from one colonel to the other so is this what were doing then starting a revolution they both nodded and not before time said devereau maddy hunched her shoulders ok so do you guys need to shake on it or something wainwright offered his hand and devereau grasped it we have much to do james and very quickly indeed i will go back and present this to my men as shall i said devereau chapter outside dead city the british troops were up and mustering at dawn with the noisy clatter of equipment and belt buckles the thudding of boots on pressed soil the barking of paradeground voices liam watched with guarded fascination as they scrambled quickly to assemble into ranks by platoon by company until he was looking at three hundred soldiers rows of red tunics and crisscrossing leather belts shifting gently as chests heaved for breath white pith helmets in endless ranks their pointed peaks shadowing the eyes of hardened faces that looked like theyd seen plenty of action liam was impressed by their discipline and efficiency if they fought half as well as they mustered he wondered how a war anywhere in this world could last long in the face of such a military machine as the british army mcmanus had confided in them last night that this regiment the black watch was actually considered one of the finest in the british army an elite regiment that had experienced combat on every continent in the world and had been chosen to fieldtrial the newest generation of experimental eugenic units speaking of which he watched the hunterseekers moving out of the camp at a trot as the last of the tents and camp equipment was being rolled up and stowed into the large saddlebags of the baggage huffaloes the hunterseeker that had chatted briefly with mcmanus last night george exchanged a polite nod with the captain as his pack moved out last they broke from a trot into a loping gallop as they spread out in a loose line across the weedstrewn field and finally several minutes later disappeared a quarter of a mile away into the dead and overgrown outskirts of the suburban fringe of baltimore liam could just make out a line of backyards bordered with rotting and leaning picket fences fallingdown shanty homes abandoned carts and rusting automobiles of an oldfashioned coach design their spoked wheels tied to the ground by thick brambles and briar mcmanus issued orders to the junior officers and ncos before joining liam and bob they should locate the eugenics soon enough did you see how quickly they set off i believe they already have the scent liam nodded are you sure captain they wont descend into some sort of well some sort of bloodlust when they find them he shook his head they may be eugenics but they are also members of the british army theyll behave he pulled down the brass mouthpiece from the earpad at the side of his helmet captain mcmanus here weve just sent the hounds in and were now moving out towards the city he gave a crisp nod at the response over the earphone yes sir up above them liam could see the carrier slowly circling high catching the first dawn rays along its shimmering copper hull it was seeing the sun a good hour before they were going to feel the warmth of it on their own faces right then said mcmanus well get our lads moving in so weve less ground to cover once theyve pinpointed a location he smiled well find them this morning dont you two worry liam nodded given how quickly those baboondogs had crossed the hardscrabble field he actually felt quite confident they were going to find them it was whether they were going to find them in one piece that was worrying him the walrusmoustached sergeant bellowed for the troops to move out and section by section they peeled out of their rows to join the back of the lengthening column moving down the broken tarmac of what was once the main road leading into the city you chaps want to walk or ride well walk said liam jolly good he said tightening the strap of his helmet well no point hanging about then its only beggars and desk clerks youll find at the rear of a ruddy column chapter dead city sal felt a hand on her shoulder tugging her insistently wake now she looked up to see one of samuels pack one of the apes she recognized it as the one that had carried her here the night before last whats the matter them come sal sat up on her bed a loosely gathered pile of grubby coal sacks to see the entire pack awake and hastily scrambling to gather their few possessions she saw lincoln sitting up beside her just as confused and muddled from being so rudely awoken what the devils happening now he growled samuel padded over theyre here already sholdiersh they coming we musht leave he reached down for sals hand please she refused to get up why dont you just run me and abraham will go to the soldiers well tell them were ok samuel looked for the briefest moment like he was considering that suggestion but then he reached for her hand again no you come with me she snatched her hand back no the eugenic muttered a curse under his breath he turned to the ape standing beside him get them up he turned to address the others letsh go samuel led the way out of the coal cellar the ape yanked sal and lincoln to their feet you come he rumbled pushing them both in front of him they climbed a flight of stone steps out of the cellar and crossed the creaking wooden floor of what was once a lounge from the meagre daylight seeping in through shuttered windows sal saw old tallbacked armchairs draped with dust covers a wall lined with books quietly mouldering away they were in a hallway morning light streaming in through an open front door then they were stumbling down porch steps through an overgrown front yard and past a rusting gate on to a wide weedchoked avenue flanked on either side by tall threestorey town houses with proud verandas and entrance porticoes she caught a glimpse of wooden boards nailed over windows and front doors the faded redpaint lettering of plague and infections warnings hurriedly scrawled decades ago ahead of them she could see samuel scooting along the avenue a curious shambling gait hunched over like a primate his disproportionately short legs working so very hard to keep him ahead of his pack of apes slender salamanders and several other eugenic types she noticed several miniature ones no more than a foot and a half tall with slender bodies like meerkats but bald and pale like all the others and with similarly loafshaped skulls they were all wearing the same miniature striped overalls and she suspected they must have been some sort of work team she wondered what sort of mundane job theyd been designed for every now and then to keep up they used their arms running like macaque monkeys she heard their frightened gabbling their twittering voices using pidgin english words behind them coming from some way down the end of the avenue and round a corner sal heard the echoing rattle of gunshots and the highpitched death rattle of something brought down a eugenic from one of the other packs she guessed theyre close they scrambled together along the avenue until they came to an intersection in front of them sal saw a grand old redbrick building with marble columns supporting a large entrance portico a clock tower stretched proudly from its roof she guessed it might once have been a courthouse or a library or some building with a public purpose before it decorative gardens had gone truly wild and native gardens fronted by a low stone wall that still boasted patches of blistering and peeling white paint on it she saw a faded street sign on a rusted plaque robert e lee university samuel was frantically waving his spindly arms to the left thish way he screamed thish way hurry from side streets and spilling out of the open doorways of abandoned homes other packs emerged to join them they were on a much wider avenue now but it was cluttered with abandoned carts and old automobiles panic had swept through this city long ago streets and avenues congested with civilians desperate to leave carts laden with suitcases valuable heirlooms and giltframed family portraits had been left to rot weather and fade out in the open north charles street now a graveyard of vehicles and yes here and there she could see bleached bones the dark leather of desiccated skin and tufts of hair in among the iron spokes of cartwheels and rusting chassis theyd just begun to pick their way through the jam of longdead vehicles when they heard the rattle of gunfire again it sounded closer than last time sal wrenched her hand free of the ape that had been clasping it no she shouted please just let us go the ape grappled with her hoisted her up and held her under one arm samuel led the way through the barricade of vehicles and finally stopped the clutter was slowing them down too much he took a turning off the broad avenue into a smaller alleyway the others followed him he stopped and slumped against a brick wall gasping and wheezing exhausted from the last few minutes of running such a small body with lungs and a heart not designed for this kind of exertion the other eugenics crowded round his panting form waiting for him to recover waiting for further instructions go he gasped go theresh no time to wait for me go go but which way sam asked one of them go north which way izzat north asked one of the salamanders north he pointed up at the strip of sky above the alleyway keep the shun the shun up there in the shky keep it on your right he said slapping his right shoulder for those in his group that didnt know their lefts from their rights keep the shun on that shide of you he gasped now go several of the eugenics did as they were told and shambled off reluctantly down the alleyway towards a smaller intersection at the far end looking over their shoulders unhappily hoping samuel was following close behind the ape holding sal and dragging lincoln by the arm hesitated to leave samuel as some of the others waivered uncertainly shuffling from one foot to the other sam you come too samuel flapped his hands go all of you jusht go sal wriggled let me go please the apes voice growled sam you come too i cant keep up any more coming from further down north charles street they heard more gunshots and the screams of eugenics brought down it seemed the whole city was beginning to stir to life with creatures emerging from their boltholes in blind panic like rats leaving a sinking ship sal suspected the city had been home to far more than the hundred and fifty or so theyd seen at the theatre meeting the gunshots seemed to be echoing from different ends of the avenue the soldiers were coming from all directions tightening a noose round them sal looked up at the apes face put me down let us go and pick sam up instead the ape nodded loosening his hold on sal i carry you the small eugenic shook his oversized head no but do ash she shaid let em both go the ape placed sal down and released lincolns wrist lincoln snarled with relief and rubbed his arm where the brutes hand had been wrapped round it sam sighed you go to thoshe sholdiersh if you want sal remained where she was she knelt down in front of sam sam youve got to run now she said me and abraham well stop them stall them somehow buy you some time but youve got to leave now his brow creased confused you want me to eshcape he wheezed yes she looked at lincoln yes we do dont we he nodded odd creature as you are i see in you he looked for the right words i see in you admirable qualities sir a good soul he knelt down beside sal better than quite a few ive met sam looked up at him wideeyed never been called shir before they heard gunfire and shrieking from the far end of the alley sal turned to see the eugenics whod headed down that way doubling back to rejoin them beyond their shambling forms at the far intersection she saw a row of fourlegged creatures like hunting dogs but no not quite behind them a row of uniformed men with guns the far end of the alley was blocked off shaddyah she shared a glance with lincoln what do we do the alleyway it was little more than a ratrun lay in the dark shadow between two old brickbuilt tenement blocks most of the windows and doors were boarded up but some of the boards had worked loose and fallen away the creatures could lose themselves inside those buildings hide in the gloomy labyrinth of rooms and hallways but only for a while theyd be trapped in there she heard noises from north charles street soldiers pulling the jam of vehicles roughly aside the splintering crack of old cartwheel spokes the groan of stressed rusting metal being dragged to the kerbside they were busy clearing a way through the traffic jam and then she felt it a cold tickle on her cheek she felt it again moisture im not crying am i she felt a cold tingle on the back of her hand and looked at lincoln a snowflake was fluttering lazily between them seesawing down snowing grunted lincoln it was more dancing flakes of snow descended around them she looked up at the narrow strip of daylight above and saw nothing but blue sky for a moment her mind instinctively queried why how it could snow on a sunny september morning then a dark form obscured the sky the alleyway dimmed as the blue vanished to be replaced with the smooth dark copper hull of some gigantic vessel they here now said the ape looking up his small eyes wide as pennies chapter dead city captain mcmanus nodded at the message coming in over his earpad right you are were on our way over he turned to liam good news mr oconnor weve got a report of a handful of the runaways boxed up in a small alleyway couple of guests along with them one girl one man quite tall sound like your two liam exhaled a sigh of relief are they all right apparently theyve both been seen on their feet thats obviously a good sign mcmanus opened up a map of the city just nearby the old university on north charles street he looked up from his map to the streets around them taking a moment to get his bearings ah yes very close indeed he pointed up at the carrier hovering over the city a block away just over there in fact right underneath her he tapped a switch on his mouthpiece all units in the vicinity of the carrier this is captain mcmanus we have a group of eugenics and their human prisoners bottled up in an alleyway nobody is to engage them repeat no firing just hold your positions chaps until further orders he tapped the switch on the mouthpiece to turn it off well now gents shall we a wretched look of belated relief stretched across liams face aye we go hide said the ape anxiously pointing up at the fire escapes and the dark open windows of the tenement blocks no said sal no if you run from them if you hide in those buildings theyll come after you theyll kill you all a mewling whimper of fear rippled through the creatures huddled around samuel what we do sam asked one of them what we do sal craned her neck to look out of the alleyway into the wide avenue she could see dozens of red tunics now hunkered down with guns trained on them the soldiers had dragged several vehicles and carts aside to create a narrow access way up and down north charles street she turned to look down the far end of their alley the soldiers and their dogs were settled there patiently waiting above the sky was still blocked by the air vessel a searchlight occasionally blinking on and combing up and down the alley ill go out there she said pointing to the soldiers let me talk to them let me explain youre not dangerous that youve not hurt anyone that youll come out peacefully they kill us one of them gasped you have to trust me she said i think they mustve come to rescue me and abraham if we go out and show them were not hurt theyll sodjers kill others me saw it said a eugenic from another group wuz all hands up and they does the bangs bangs if you try to run im sure theyll shoot you down snapped sal she turned to samuel please sam let me go out and talk to them he scratched his chin his fingers trembling his eyes darted from one end of the alley to the other nervously you think sho you can make it shafe youre not monsters youre not dangerous i can tell them that he pressed his ragged lips together you tell em then tell em were not bad we didnt hurt no one she nodded i will samuel smiled i trust ok sal smiled she got to her feet a moment young lady said lincoln he tore the bottom half of the sleeve off his dirty shirt a white flag well truth be its brown but they shall understand it as a flag of truce he said tying it round a strip of wood he got up and walked cautiously to the mouth of the avenue allow me coming out he bellowed loudly please do not shoot your guns he waved his makeshift flag in the open up and down several times to be sure it was seen i am stepping out lincolns voice boomed again and then slowly he emerged into the morning sunlight streaming down the broad avenue both arms raised i am abraham lincoln i bear no arms step out into the road if you dont mind sir so we can see you nice and clear i have a girl with me she wishes to parley there was no response to that lincoln turned slowly and nodded at sal to step out beside him she emerged into the sun shading her eyes with her raised hands please dont shoot she called out stand beside the gentleman a voice replied theres a good girl she did as she was told there are some eugenic creatures with us down the alley they also want to come out and join us peacefully there was no answer the morning was still and silent save for the soft hum of idling motors up in the sky from far away the stillness was broken by an echoing crack of gunfire sal is that you chapter dead city the voice came from further up the avenue she couldnt see anything with the glare of the sun in her eyes but she recognized the voice liam aye jayzus his voice echoed back down the avenue she heard the slap of his feet on hard tarmac and finally he emerged in front of the soldiers and stood before her well look at you he checked her over look a state so you do she felt a rush of relief so intense her legs felt unsteady beneath her she noted the bandage on his head you got hurt knocked out sal stupid i shouldve ducked thats why i so this is your sister is it called out another voice crisp and commanding sister she glanced up at him he nodded slightly she realized liam must have told them that for a reason out of the bloom of sunlight she saw a tall wide shape emerging unmistakably bob beside him another man slim wearing a white pith helmet this fella here said liam as they approached is captain mcmanus its really all thanks to him we found you so beneath the helmets peak she saw the taut face of a young army officer sister he frowned confused but youre white and shes my step sister so she is cut in liam closest family i got so help me mcmanus cocked his head and shrugged well then he extended a whitegloved hand really rather pleased we found you in one piece young lady she reached out and shook it lightly thank you and you sir lincoln shook his hand abraham lincoln jolly good to have retrieved you unharmed mr lincoln mcmanus nodded politely now weve got a few of these runaways back in the alley have we sal nodded look please dont hurt them he frowned at her dont hurt them please theyre harmless he tapped his finger pensively against his chin how many of them down in that side street there she shrugged couple of dozen i think these creatures captain they did not kill any people it was other creatures nor have they hurt us said lincoln they treated us really well added sal gave us food and water they didnt hurt us really mcmanus looked bemused thats rather untypical behaviour of these things theyre feral animals you cant predict how theyll behave from one moment to the next you sure they didnt hurt you said liam i mean they were well they seemed pretty ferocious back in that farmhouse they were scared liam theyre like frightened children frightened perhaps but they are still exceedingly dangerous they need to be apprehended and then we can decide whats to be done with them i cant promise clemency if we discover any of them were directly involved in the recent killings you understand that sal nodded honestly it wasnt any of them he glanced over her shoulder at the deserted brick tenement building do we need to flush them out of there as well she shook her head no i told them not to go inside and hide that it would just make things worse very sensible advice theyre all just waiting back in the alley they just want to come out like we did just come out with their hands up he shrugged good he cupped his hands round his mouth you runaways hiding in the alley best you come out now nothing emerged from the alleyway for a moment sal had a sinking feeling that fear had got the better of them and they had quietly slipped away into the tenement buildings on either side but then they heard a soft frightened whimper emerge from the gloom too frightened to budge let me try she said to mcmanus if you wish samuel she called out its ok theyre not going to hurt any of you do as he said all of you just like i did slowly with your hands nice and high silence not a murmur she was about to cup her mouth and try again but then the first pale figure slowly emerged blinking into the sunlight samuel he was doing as shed instructed his thin childs arms raised above his oversized head twenty yards away she could see he was trembling the ape emerged behind towering above him huge muscular arms raised no shoot it cried in a deep voice sal nodded encouragement thats right no ones going to shoot you come on the others began to emerge one by one thats it come on its ok captain mcmanus studied the creatures as they stepped into the daylight by the shape of the heads id say these are mostly watsonrutherford class eugenics manufactured fifteen some of them twenty years ago he mused hmmm all old stock very poor condition looking at them largely malnourished he ordered some of his men over to herd the group together liam stepped beside sal he put an arm round her shoulders and hugged her its a relief to see you again he whispered squeezing her tight i let you down sal god im so sorry when i came round i was you were already gone she put a hand to his mouth im ok honest but if were both fine liam she smiled hungry very hungry but fine closer together corporal barked mcmanus dont want any of these devils sneaking off mr lincoln youre not hurt asked liam as this young lady said we are both fine mr oconnor but i could eat a whole barn full of horses liam she stepped back heard anything yet from maddy he shook his head and lowered his voice nothing mcmanus was busy issuing orders and appraising the condition of the eugenics not a thing he replied she must have problems of her own to deal with and those of you wearing clothes called out mcmanus lets have those removed if you please youre not human sal turned to look up at bob and smiled good to see you too coconut head i am glad you are both unharmed he replied she punched his flank gently you know one or two of these genics have got even bigger muscles than you he scowled muscletissue density not size is the determining factor she tipped her head back at the creatures seen the big one back there hmm jealous he looked puzzled that is not a human emotion i have managed to generate files on yet not jealous yeah right she turned round to point out the ape and stopped dead hold on hey whats going on the others turned to see captain mcmanus unbuckling the flap of his gun holster the creatures were huddled tightly together in the middle of the avenue their items of clothing hats scarves aprons discarded on the ground the soldiers had formed a loose circle round them a cautious dozen yards between them and the eugenics carbines raised to their shoulders and aimed excuse me called out sal whatre you doing mcmanus ignored her mark your targets men jayzus liam jogged over towards him sal followed captain mcmanus what hoy stop youre not planning on shooting them are you he turned to liam what yes of course we are sal saw samuel at the front of the huddle his eyes picking her out his ragged lips moved a whispered unheard question sal you told us clearly theyre not a danger to anyone now said liam can you not see they have no weapons look at them theyre they are faulty mr oconnor faulty eugenic units which makes them unreliable as i said unpredictable sal looked at him faulty quite faulty yes he nodded casually they cant be reconditioned quite honestly theyre in an appalling condition anyway and we certainly cant leave these things running around on the loose he turned back to his men make ready stop she shrieked please stop she grasped his gun hand excuse me would you mind letting go look captain said liam i dont think this is right either you cant just shoot them like this lincoln had joined them now my friends are quite correct sir these poor wretches should not be treated in this way mcmanus looked at them all bewildered by their concern you do understand these are not he looked at the shivering huddle of ashwhite eugenics that these are not people good grief theyre not even animals theyre eugenic products blood and bone factory machines that really is all they are no cried sal jahulla no theyre more than that they they theyre just like us theyre intelligent they can talk and of course they can talk some of them were designed that way good god some of the smartest ones can almost be convincing but listen young lady he said softly almost sympathetically dont ever make the mistake of thinking one of these things can be your friend he twisted his hand out of her grasp understand they are products thats all machines more importantly they are broken machines and that makes them unreliable unpredictable he raised his gun dangerous please cried sal stop she saw samuel his scrawny arms folded in front of his face mcmanus fingered the safety catch on his sidearm and filled his lungs with a breath take aim the ape standing behind samuel quickly moved a thick arm down and wrapped it round samuels small torso protectively as if the bulk of his muscle was going to be enough to shield him fire chapter new york colonel wainwright regarded his men gathered together in the rough ground between their main command bunker and the trench facing out across the east river just short of three hundred men left in his regiment the last time the th virginia had been at a full strength of six hundred was many decades ago long before his time it seemed the southern command was adopting the northern habit of letting regiments run down and then completely disbanding them when their troops number hit a critical minimum he shook his head foolish a regiments fighting spirit lay in its history the th had been raised back in had been commanded by general lee had fought under pickett and charged the union troops at gettysburg theyd taken cemetery ridge and sent meades men packing that kind of a legacy bonded men made them commit that little bit more to the esprit de corps they stood watching him now uncertain faces he knew rumours were already spreading among the men they knew something serious had happened in the command bunker earlier today they knew a dozen british soldiers had been arrested disarmed and locked up tongues were wagging with the increasingly persistent rumours that something big was imminent the news the british officer had brought that a new offensive was about to be launched was hardly a big surprise to wainwright he along with every joe huckabee in the trenches knew the british had been pulling in units from all over the empire talk of that and other halftruths chinesewhispered rumours had managed to filter their way along the entire length of the sheridan line that young officer had merely confirmed the truth of it the british are massing their resources for an offensive men and the spearhead of that offensive will be none other than this very sector the men stirred a wave of unease rippled across them the th virginia will be in the first wave the men shook their heads incredulously they all knew what that meant appalling losses as the landing boats spilled them out on the shingle on the far side the enemy would be pouring a withering wall of gunfire on them from their entrenched positions enfilade fire on the right from the shattered end of the williamsburg bridge on the left from the ruins of the factory it would be a massacre he could see they were all making the same silent assessment wholesale slaughter but that isnt the worst of it boys the second wave said wainwright he paused waiting for the mens murmuring to die down they needed to hear this hear this clearly the second wave will include eugenics his voice was drowned out by the roar of the men nearly three hundred voices raised in alarm disbelief anger and mostly fear he raised his arms to hush them despite the fact that these men trusted obeyed and respected their colonel the noise continued unabated he pulled his sidearm out of its holster and fired a shot for the second time in as many days the mens voices quietened until all that could be heard was the uneasy shuffling of feet on gravel i believe he began make this good james make this very good for a long time for many years now i have believed that we are no longer fighting for a confederate cause that we have become no more than cannonfodder meat for the grinder in service of british interests this time the men did roar in unison a roar of support for someone who had dared to say what every man privately thought dared to say a thing that would guarantee an undignified traitors execution against a brick wall there wainwright stroked his chin it is said and for that i am now a dead man across the river devereaus men filled the bottom floor of the factory and half filled the bombdamaged floor above rows of booted legs dangling over the rough edge where the floor had collapsed long ago they will not allow us to retreat he continued he and the men gathered here knew exactly what that meant directly behind the front line units of the french foreign legion patrolled federal troops falling back without approval from high command would be considered deserters and shot on the spot still many of them must be considering that option he mused far better to run and hope to evade the execution squads than stay and face those eugenic monsters from the south the factory echoed with the mens response clamouring voices that beat around the empty pockmarked walls of the building i his voice was lost in the noise i do not believe he stopped the men werent going to hear him silence for the colonel bellowed sergeant freeman the effect was almost instantaneous if not complete freeman glared at the few men still muttering to each other they hushed quickly under his withering gaze devereau tried again i do not believe we should fight in this war any more now the factory was silent no i do not believe in it any more he shook his head slowly i do not have faith in our generals and i no longer have faith in our government of the union of northern american states a lone voice towards the back of the factory whooped ya say it colonel shouted another our home towns our cities our states our nation is a nation under foreign occupation make no mistake men we are already a conquered people conquered not by the angloconfederacy but by france and their allies austria prussia switzerland and a dozen other nations that im sure many of you have never even heard of he laughed a hollow laugh we werent beaten on some battlefield we didnt fight the good fight and lose no we did far worse we invited our conquerors in the factory echoed with angry raised voices devereau hushed them again by raising his hands this is the time men i believe this is the real fight not brother against brother not american against american but men of america against the british and devereau paused there was going to be no unsaying this he glanced at maddy standing back and to one side of him giving him the space on the small podium of ammo crates she nodded slightly she knew what he was going to say and men of america against the french the men stirred uneasily whispered we once shared a nation with those lads on the other side of the river we could fight for that nation again chapter new york wainwright nodded thats what i said gentlemen a joining of forces an uprising goddammit he balled his fist and punched his own thigh angrily ill call this exactly what it damn well is a mutiny the word hung heavy in the open air it bounced off the far wall of a collapsed building ricocheting like a gunshot mutiny he said again and it starts here with the th virginia the men roared support for that more than that boys more than that were not going to stand alone we shall be joined by others the th alabama to the north of us will join us and next to them the th maryland and every other regiment along the sheridan the men roared jubilantly several forage caps catapulted into the air out of the huddled mass of shabby grey uniforms wainwright smiled triumphantly punching the air with his men of course only he knew that was a lie hed made no contact with their fellow regiments up the line not yet at least he was counting on their support banking on it in fact surely they were going to follow the example set by the th but hear this men he raised his gun again to fire to quieten them down but they hushed anyway hear this men we will be supported by regiments on the far side of the east river by federal troops from the union of northern american states a mixed response from the men perhaps that announcement was a step too far for some of them to take after all for every man standing in front of him the men across the river the north had always been the enemy wainwright realized he was committed now he had to rally these lads make them see they needed each other needed those lads of the th massachusetts theyre men no different to you or i americans no different to us you know we shared a dream once a language a heritage a belief in a land of the free he saw some heads nodding he heard voices raised in ones and twos once a hundred and forty years back we foolishly chose separate destinies but now do you see do you see we can share a common goal once more we can have one american nation again be masters of our own destiny he stopped and realized his words bouncing back at him from the far wall were doing so across a sombre heavy expectant silence my god maybe i misjudged the mood of my men whos with me the ground between the command bunker and trench suddenly erupted with a deafening roar of whooping ragged voices he was sure must have been heard by devereaus men on the far side of the river he fired his sidearm into the sky again and again until the magazine was empty and its click was lost in the deafening cacophony all the while as he grinned and cheered he desperately hoped he could make good on his promise that the alabama boys of the th at the north end of manhattan and the th beyond were already signed up to the idea of this rebellion and ready to stand together with them whether they were or not though he realized there was no turning back now devereau nodded smiled the mens cheering voices reverberated through the ruins of the factory he hadnt been certain his men were ready to take such a drastic step as this to extend a hand of kinship across the river to the confederates he had only suspected perhaps even hoped that they might feel the same way as him but looking at them now jubilant faces every man roaring a huzzah of support we could actually do this he turned to look at maddy and becks maddy was grinning and giving him a big thumbsup really we could actually do this perhaps this mutiny could achieve so much more than merely buying time for these two mysterious young time travellers to fix their machine devereau was still not entirely sure he could believe what theyd told him despite all the images and gadgets theyd shown him it felt too unreal too much like a wish or a dream that would vanish the moment you reached out for it regardless the wheel was turning the die already cast time travel and alternative histories whether that really existed or not here was a very real chance for everything to be changed perhaps this rebellion might really spread along the entire length of the front line like a virus tens hundreds of thousands of soldiers north and south turning round and confronting their foreign puppetmasters even if miss carters assurance that she could rewrite this unhappy history was to come to nothing the mutiny by itself might just bring this eternal war to an end devereau found himself joining in a cry roared from his throat in unison with his men the noise filled his ears made them ring and what a wonderful deafening roaring noise it was it sounded like the cascade of water a dam crumbling beneath the weight of millions of tons energy unleashed a dreadnought train approaching a storm front descending it sounded like walls tumbling liberty bells chiming government buildings being stormed it sounded like a revolution it sounded like hope chapter new york maam you are but a lady my men are perfectly capable of attacking and taking that communications bunker negative cut in becks the communications bunker will contain sensitive equipment that could be damaged by a conventional assault we cannot allow that risk i suggest an alternative strategy wainwright was rather taken aback by the young ladys somewhat forthright manner what then how many british troops garrison the structure she asked wainwright shrugged usually it is two sections twenty thirty men no more becks turned to maddy that is acceptable the pair of them had only just crossed the river on devereaus motor launch off the back of the boat a couple of northern soldiers had been unspooling a big drum of insulated communications cable and as they stood now just outside wainwrights command bunker communications officers from each side were debating how best to feed the cable inside and wire it up to permit a direct line between both colonels as maddy had been quick to say their uprising was going to live or die on the strength of how effectively the two colonels communicated you think you can take it on your own asked maddy affirmative i calculate a higher probability of success without significant equipment damage than she cast a gaze at the halfstrength company of soldiers wainwright had assembled for the job than these maddy waved her silent before she blurted anything that might sound rude becks is very special said maddy quickly shes not just a pretty face wainwright frowned maam i appreciate you come from a very different time to ours but the arithmetic of the situation is still the same twentyfour armed and welltrained british soldiers in there and you expect one young lady is going to becks is a combat unit wainwright looked at her frowning stroking his chin a what shes a genetically engineered human with a siliconwafer processor brain shes extremely tough extremely strong and extremely quick in short shes something of a killing machine the colonel eyed her up and down are you telling me this young lady is not not human maddy shrugged not really his eyes suddenly widened my god he gasped do you mean to say shes a a eugenic maddy shook her head im not really sure what those are but i guess the best way to think of her is as an organic robot robot i have not heard that word what do you mean maam robot like say like a machine machine he looked at her again but she is not constructed of metal and wires no no she isnt maddy shrugged but she might as well be wainwrights eyes narrowed suspiciously you are not making sense maam look were wasting time here said maddy we need the communications hub and we need it intact trust me she smiled becks can handle that i will need guns said becks casually of course you do replied maddy patting her shoulder and im sure colonel wainwright here will give you all the guns youll need wont you colonel wainwright looked at his men standing in several rows across the rubblestrewn assembly area you say she alone can do this yup look if she can punch out a dinosaur i think she can manage a few soldiers wainwright stared at her for a moment excuse me maam i must have misheard you i thought you just said your men colonel cut in becks could provide useful backup a perimeter round the bunker should be established to ensure no additional british troops are able to reinforce the garrison what occurs inside the perimeter and inside the bunker she produced a cool smile is best left to me maddy nodded trust me shes right wainwright studied them both not quite sure what to make of them for sure they were from some other world their manner their dress the words they used but this one girl taking a bunker on her own you look unconvinced colonel said maddy he looked over her shoulder at his men waiting patiently just out of earshot my men myself we have signed our death warrants as of this moment we are all dead men walking unless my friend colonel william devereau assures me you truly have this machine that can rewrite our world with a better one he cocked a thick eyebrow this is something i have to take on trust since i have not seen this device nor for that matter has colonel devereau witnessed it working it works said maddy otherwise becks and i wouldnt be standing here he shrugged my point maam is that i have entrusted the lives of my men to the truth of your story and now you ask that i trust that this young woman can make a successful assault on a defended position entirely on her own affirmative said becks look said maddy we dont want to trash this place right so an extended gunfight is probably not a good thing becks is the alternative you have to trust me and look if she fails maddy shucked a shoulder casually then you send your boys in how about that wainwright turned to becks you believe you can do this on your own becks trained her cool grey eyes on the confederate colonel we should proceed directly we are wasting valuable time chapter new york private sutter stared across the rubble from his guard position a short section of trench leading down four steps to the entrance to defence structure the official name for the communications bunker he and the other lads on garrison duty were not meant to officially know it was a radiosignals hub for this section of the front line which was stupid seeing as how the dish and antennae array were quite visible far above them perched on the partially cavedin roof of the tall building beside the bunker a twisted trunk of wires snaked down the open front of the building from exposed floor to exposed floor all the way down to the ground and into the bunker no they werent meant to know what this place was and it was drilled into them to refer to it only as defence structure should he ever be captured and interrogated by the enemy for intelligence defence structure could mean anything a turret a machinegun emplacement an artillery station sutter shook his head not that those useless peasants in blue across the river were ever going to do much more than quiver in their boots and hunker down in their entrenched positions like cockroaches hiding in a dirty kitchen and perhaps they were right to quiver private sutter mused hed heard from lancecorporal davies whod heard whispers from someone working in regimental equipment procurement that something big was most certainly afoot an offensive of some kind had to be all sorts of rumours were beginning to surface and the men in his platoon were itching for a scrap to get themselves stuck into playing at being security guards for a small concrete box that did little more than broadcast propaganda messages across this part of the line well that wasnt the kind of soldiering sutter had signed up for he leaned against the sandbags bored gazing down a track of cleared rubble a track just about wide enough for a single vehicle and flanked on either side by banks of brick and debris and dust it had been an important road once on the corner of the building beside him he could make out a faded sign spotted with rust th avenue used to be one of new yorks main streets he recalled someone telling him doesnt look like much now through the open door to the bunker he could hear the muted clank of a kettle going on the stove the click and clatter of dominoes being dealt the dirty laugh of someone telling a joke theyd probably all heard a dozen times or more he sighed bored witless and missing afternoon tea as well marvellous he was halfway through wondering whether one of the lads might actually think to bring him a mug of tea when he saw someone walking down the cleared track ahead a lone figure it seemed yes just one and a little closer now he could see it was a woman a woman private sutter hadnt seen a woman since he and the lads had replaced the last poor bunch of boredwitless guards three months ago she was walking quite purposefully towards him sutter grinned a little female company thatd be rather nice for a change he picked his white helmet up and put it on tightened the strap beneath his chin and then took a step up the ladder and out of the trench so that he could be seen more clearly halt he called out to the woman his carbine in his hands but aimed at the ground she was hardly a threat after all the woman kept walking purposefully towards him oblivious to his challenge closer now he could see she was wearing a confederategrey officers cape more than that he could see she was quite beautiful the face of an angel pale and smooth long dark hair cascading down her shoulders miss he called out again then almost apologetically im going to have to ask you to stop where you are her stride remained unbroken and now she was off the track and clambering up the bank of rubble towards him miss please he found himself reluctantly raising his carbine i need you to stop right where you are love closer now just a dozen yards climbing steadily up skittering rubble towards him she was smiling sutter wondered whether this was a windup or perhaps a test he knew this area of the line was being inspected for battlereadiness if so hed already let this young lady get far too close he was going to get a sharp rebuke if this was a test halt or i shall fire he challenged angry with himself this time she did finally stop another six yards uphill four or five more strides and shed have been right beside him identify yourself sutter barked her smile widened my name is becks her cape flapped he thought a breeze had caught it lifted it it was only as something glinted in the air between them that he understood it was the movement of her arms that had stirred the cape sutter felt a punch in his throat that left him winded gasping for air he dropped the carbine his hands reaching up to work out why his open mouth didnt seem to be letting in a breath then he felt something odd sticking out he looked down to see the hilt of a bayonet protruding from beneath his chin right i see his foggy mind understood that he had a bayonet lodged in his throat he found himself sliding forward dizzyheaded slumped on to the sandbag in front of him he looked up at the woman as she stepped carefully over him she really was quite beautiful she dropped down into the trench beside him and yanked the protruding blade from his throat sutter gushed dark blood on to the sandbag beautiful she really is like an angel his mouth flapped open blood spilling over his lips and down his chin as he tried to ask her if thats what she was she smiled at him please die quietly now she said in an almost motherly way as she covered his mouth with her hand chapter hms defiant all she could see staring up at the bunk above her all she could see were fleeting images of the bodies large and small lined up head to toe at the side of the street just like sacks of rubbish sal realized she didnt really have a word that described how she felt right now empty hollow is this shock im feeling am i in a state of shock the bunk creaked as lincoln stirred on the mattress above one booted foot hung over the side he was far too long in the leg for these cramped bunks she could hear the gentle thrum of faroff engines vibrating through the carriers hull the quiet murmur of men along a passageway the faint clang of pots and pans in a galley about thirtysix hours thats about all she remembered liam saying as she and lincoln were taken aboard the carrier and some army doctor quickly inspected them about thirtysix hours hed said something about the carrier picking up troops then heading north and they were getting a lift part of the way and then she was here stretched out on this bunk in the vessels sickbay and she suddenly realized how completely exhausted she felt as if the mattress beneath her had somehow drained her of life sucked the very blood from her veins and left a withered husk lying on top of it she saw their bodies glassyeyed dead animalhuman faces gazing up at the blue sky samuel his small ragged mouth hanging open frozen in an uneven o of terror she watched them being tossed on to the back of a vehicle like so many sacks of oatmeal she heard one of the men say the bodies were to be processed and fed to the huffaloes then she saw some other creatures new types of eugenics large shaggy bullfronted animals with vaguely horselike heads and slender hind quarters and doglike creatures with heads that reminded her of baboons both types seemed to have the dull eyes of dimwitted beasts faces that lacked emotion or expression not like samuel and his fellow runaways new breeds ones less intelligent less inquisitive less likely to question their lot controllable she closed her eyes reluctantly too tired to keep them open but knowing that against the smooth dark canvas of her eyelids she was going to see samuels bloodspattered face once again several stops actually said captain mcmanus were collecting the rest of the regiment the rest liam frowned theres more of you on this ship eight hundred and thirtysix if my memory serves me six hundred and twentyseven men and officers of the regiment twentyfour hunterseekers and fifty huffaloes and of course the carriers crew and support personnel a hundred and twentythree in total he sipped his tea but we have three companies of men spread out across the virginia countryside on various manoeuvres patrols peacekeeping he smiled peacekeeping the term didnt sit well with what hed witnessed earlier this morning when weve got them all aboard we shall head north and set down outside new wellington new jersey its at the mouth of lower new york bay said captain mcmanus theres a carrier dock there well be stopping to resupply the regiment and refuel the carrier before heading north again you and your friends can get off there if you wish liam nodded hed noticed there was a buzz of activity going on aboard the ship junior officers scurrying to and fro with clipboards under their arms is there something happening mcmanus looked up from his teacup the officers mess was small little more than a space for three bench tables and stools either side the walls decorated with regimental trophies and grainy sepia group photographs of smiling young men in smart formal dress uniforms overhead a glass chandelier swung gently from the low ceiling tinkling softly from the vibration of the carriers engines they had the officers mess to themselves a little situation appears to be developing up north that needs to be dealt with mcmanus shrugged nothing my lads cant handle it was obvious to liam the officer wasnt going to give him any more on that liam stirred a teaspoon in his china cup absently while bob looked down at his tea studying a pattern of leaves floating on the surface my ordering the disposal of those eugenics said mcmanus thats troubling you isnt it to be honest yes liam picked up a hardtack biscuit off a plate between them and turned it over and over not really hungry not really sure why hed picked it up something for his hands to do yes it is they were older genics ones designed and grown a while back some of them were twenty even thirty years old they were unreliable liam dangerous he sighed back in the s they produced tens of thousands of them for all sorts of different roles mcmanus shook his head good grief even as household workers cooks butlers would you believe and for those sorts of tasks they needed to be intelligent enough he sipped his tea weve learned a lot about eugenology since then how its far easier to design the shape and musculature of a creature than it is to design how it will behave what it will think these days we know better the eugenics are crafted with far simpler minds mcmanus shook his head it was madness looking back now with hindsight madness to have created eugenics intelligent enough to for example read and write to hope we could grow creatures who would be our engineers technicians doctors and assume they could be controlled like pets those creatures liam looked up at him are you saying those creatures were smart enough to read and write mcmanus shrugged most of them were the oldclass manual labourers more intelligent than the heavylifter genics we produce now but not by much he studied liams troubled frown look liam i think you are making the mistake of thinking of these creatures as some form of natural life they are not they are organic products bone and muscle machines nothing more and when a machine starts acting unreliably then it is time for it to be dismantled otherwise people get hurt bob muttered something was going through his head liam glanced across the table at him he looked troubled as well liam wondered whether his support unit felt some sort of kinship with the eugenics after all from what he could guess theyd all sprung from the same science they were machines that had gone bad and quite dangerous he leaned forward across the small table i shall be honest with you liam i wasnt quite sure whether we would find your stepsister and friend in one piece they are really very lucky to be alive i spose lord knows how many more of those things are still out there most of the oldgeneration genics have been rounded up and processed but i think there are still quite a few hundred scattered among the confederate states runaways living in derelict dwellings or living wild in woods and mountains it is a problem that needs to be addressed and one day i suppose we shall have to track down the last of them but its not something we can do right now why not mcmanus looked like he was going to ignore liams question lets just say the british army is being kept very busy at the moment he changed the subject you and the others what are your plans once we have dropped you off a return to the safety of ireland may i suggest liam shrugged we were going to visit new york you know it really is as if you have arrived from another world entirely mcmanus studied him intently did you really not know that new york has been a war zone for nearly seventy years liam nodded uh yes of course maybe me an bob and the othersll go explore the west instead mcmanus nodded it would be a much safer excursion for you i believe it is still an unspoiled wilderness if you seek the far western mountain states like new wessex and new albany i have heard from white bear that there are still tribes of indians living in that wilderness eight hundred and twentyfour said bob the other two looked at him uh eight hundred and twentyfour personnel said bob you have itemized that number of personnel but initially you said there was a total of eight hundred and thirtysix personnel that leaves twelve unaccounted for mcmanus made a face ah well i am no mathematician a klaxon sounded softly mcmanus looked up we shall be descending shortly for a pickup if youll excuse me chapter new york well can we use it becks crouched beside the antennae array a motorized rotating platform two foot in diameter topped with a dozen aerials like bristles from a hairbrush above them a flared coneshaped dish of fine aluminium mesh maddy shivered as a fresh breeze whipped across the rooftop from where they were on top of one of the tallest buildings still standing she could make out most of the shattered remains of new york a scarred landscape of jagged broken buildings like the stumps of rotting teeth a landscape of crumbling concrete grey with a dash of green here and there where nature had decided to make an early start reclaiming the land for itself down below following the twisted trunk of cables over the lip of the roof was the familiar outline of times square although shed discovered from devereau it had been renamed place dlibertaire last time the frenchrun north had held the city this side of the east river she felt dizzy looking down she stepped back from the edge and turned to becks quietly studying the antennae array so what do you think the support unit nodded thoughtfully the dish can be used to project tachyon particles the antennae platform may also be useful hmmm maddy pushed her glasses up i guess i can figure out how to hook up the platform with our computer system its just an electrical motor yeah we should just take the whole thing affirmative she left becks inspecting the bottom of the platform and crossed the rooftop towards where wainwright stood with a couple of his men we can make use of it she said we just need to get it down in one piece wainwright nodded good i shall have my men help your uh your his gaze wandered over her shoulder to the huddledover form of becks his voice trailed to nothing maddy had the distinct impression he was going to say your eugenic my men are telling me she killed every last man inside the entire garrison maddy nodded shed arrived in time to see the last of the bodies being carried out of the bunker and becks standing outside the entrance her pale face splashed with ribbons and dots of drying blood and a friendly did i do good smile stretched across her lips it had actually made her shudder not a single prisoner taken said wainwright quietly what on earth is she her mission priority was capturing the antennae intact not im afraid to take any prisoners she decided it would be too difficult to explain to wainwright that the lives shed just taken with her bare hands were those that never should have been lived anyway the bloody corpses lying outside the bunker were men who would be living very different lives once more once history had been corrected but her imagination flashed images of the short and brutal struggle that must have gone on inside it made her shiver at the thought that she sal and liam shared the archway with two creatures bob and becks who could tear the three of them to ragged shreds if the notion popped into their heads if a line of computer code decided it was a mission priority to answer your question colonel you ask what is she she turned to look at becks now on her back inspecting the space beneath the array platform disconnecting the power cables shes a killing machine a combat unit from the future i suppose you could think of her as an advanced type of one of your eugenics good god his eyes widened i would prefer not to think of her it as that he uttered becks is a she not an it youd hurt her feelings if she heard you say that she forced a chuckle the laugh died in her throat and you miss carter what about you his eyes narrowed are you some artificial construct some sort of superwarrior in disguise a eugenic once upon a time i was a computergames programmer someone good at sitting down and tapping away at a keyboard thats me she shrugged im no one special im afraid a breeze tugged at them sent dust devils skipping across the rooftop have you sent your message colonel wainwright nodded hed broadcast a rallying call to the regiments up the line before they dismantled the array they could only hope his stirring speech would do its job and other confederate troops further along would signal they intended to join the mutiny but thered been nothing so far we shall hear from them soon he smiled im sure then we should get started dismantling this thing said maddy she looked up at the blue sky then southwest towards the horizon where a distant bank of cloud promised them an overcast day later on who knows how long weve got until the british come for us wainwright followed her gaze indeed chapter new wellington liam and the others stood on the gun deck just in front of the forward turret a dome of plated metal ten feet high and two dozen in diameter lined with knucklesized rivets two long artillery barrels protruded from gunnery slits for the moment covered with a protective tarpaulin they watched as the carrier slowly descended towards new wellington through a ghostly white sky of thinly combed clouds to their left the east coast of america to the right the surly grey atlantic ocean ahead of them he could see a gridlike blanket was spread beneath the prow of the carrier roads streets avenues cutting the city into a chessboard of suburban industrial and business districts look said liam pointing towards the coast the misty sky above new wellington was haunted by the spectral silhouettes of a dozen elongated sky ships several of them similar in profile to the carrier on which they were standing i see eleven said lincoln no twelve if im not mistaken sal screwed her eyes up as she spotted faint dark slivers further out above the sea and more coming in she looked at the other two do you think every one of them is full of soldiers i guess those are other british regiments liam tugged at the borrowed dufflecoat pulled the hood up against the fresh wind something big is under way thats for sure closer to them close enough to see the detailing of decks and gun turrets and the large segmented central gasballast tanks a carrier almost identical to theirs was settling into a dockside berth with the echoing of a horn like a distant whales song and a faint roar of compressed gas it blasted the open ground beneath it a space the size of at least two football pitches end to end with a blizzard of snow and nitrogen gas it seemed to settle on its own cloud a white cushion that slowly billowed outwards and finally faded revealing the acres of tarmac dusted with snow liam could see four other similar landing strips each one towered over by a pair of docking cranes hundreds of feet high as they watched the freshly landed ship was embraced fore and aft by the cranes swinging round until they snugly locked on to the vessel holding it like a babe in arms as the last of the nitrogen cloud cleared the bottom of the ships hull began to open and loading ramps emerged they watched the peppercorn dots of tiny figures disembarking and slowly forming into orderly ranks on the landing strip liam and sal looked at each other a wordless exchange that liam knew meant she was thinking the same thing yet another sight another amazing sight that was never meant to be he looked out again leaning his elbows on the brass rail at the vision another moment in time that he knew he was never going to forget like the inland sea of cretaceous texas and that sweeping plain dotted with herds of dinosaurs or the glistening wall of chain mail and armour of richard the lionhearts advancing army a horizon of fluttering pennants and waving pikes the sturdy frames of trebuchets in the distance moments etched into his memory as permanently as letters carved into marble he realized that if by chance he died tomorrow in his short life hed already seen more things heard tasted smelled experienced more of history than any person any historian could ever dream to hope for now thats quite something eh sal she nodded silently picking out her own details to remember lincoln in turn stared wideeyed and ashenfaced and this this is but a portion of the might of the british army he uttered liam nodded aye more where this lot came from id say god his courtroom bawl was robbed of its power and left little more than a fluttering whisper gods teeth six hours after arriving over new wellington waiting their turn in a queue of leviathans floating in the sky enormous dark and brooding like anvil clouds their carrier finally got its turn and landed amid its own blizzard of snow and the first companies of the black watch disembarked captain mcmanus was busy along with every other officer organizing their companies on the landing pad their men were going to need billeting in the camps around the docks for the duration of the stopover supplies ordered and secured shoreleave rota to be arranged for his men equipment arms and ammo damages to be repaired and shortfalls to be requisitioned a million and one things for him and every other junior officer to attend to so his farewell was necessarily brief i should return home to ireland if i were you liam oconnor theres much afoot and itll all be happening north of here liam knew better than to question him further mcmanus was already saying far too much the young officer studied him and then sal who returned his gaze with a cold glare i suspect you think of me as a coldblooded murderer perhaps she said nothing he took her silence as agreement i have seen what these creatures can do not just the runaways but our very own trained eugenics if it were my choice then thered be none of these aberrations in this world man has no business rewriting natures work he tugged the chin strap of his helmet tight but there it is the genie is out of the lamp we are where we are he offered them a crisp salute and a warm smile i am just relieved you were both unharmed he regarded them one after the other a rather strange family you make if i may say so he offered liam his hand and you sir strangest of the lot if i believed in such things i would say you had dropped out of the sky from an entirely different century ah well liam grinned ive always been a bit behind the times so mcmanus let his hand go tipped a nod at them all and turned to head back to his men waiting patiently in the shadow of the carriers hull the time travellers watched the captain go the afternoon thick with the noise of boots and harnesses sergeants barking orders like trained rottweilers and the clank and clatter of supply trolleys rolling down the ramps what now said sal north said liam he looked at the others new york weve got to find a way back home right unless we hear otherwise from maddy that is bob nodded affirmative shes in trouble said sal it was stating the obvious she needs our help liam nodded we need to get there as quickly as we can he glanced up at the sky still another half a dozen carriers hanging there like storm clouds waiting to descend and disgorge troops before this lot head north and flatten whats left of new york chapter new york maddy hooded her eyes as she looked upwards becks and a technician from wainwrights regiment second lieutenant jefferson were busy securing the antennae arrays motorized platform to the top of their archways mound of brick it needed to be securely fixed not wobbling in any way it would have been steadier on the ground beside their crumbling home but then it would have been too low and obscured by the craters lip jefferson suggested mounting it on the top of the overshadowing stump of the williamsburg bridge support but it would have meant running out a lot of cable cable that could easily be snagged and severed on the dense nest of twisted sharpedged metal above them more than that she felt insecure not having the array right beside them from the bottom of the platform a trunk of cables looped down the side of the skittering bricks through a hole in the roof and down into the back room there it snaked across the gritcovered floor through the sliding door into the main archway past the computer desk over the small scooped crater towards the perspex tube to the metal rack holding the displacement machine maddy had spent most of yesterday spitting curses as she fiddled around the back of the rack cursing that she suspected had rather taken aback sergeant freeman watching on curiously half guesswork half consulting the schematics diagram shed made a while back she hooked up the data cable via the computer system the power cable feeding back via the computer system for computerbob to control and finetune the orientation of the dish of course computerbob wasnt aware of any of that just yet the networked computers were offline right now and would remain so until they got the generator turning over yet another job on the to do list their generator was simply finished with more precisely the motor the fuel tank had ruptured when a part of the ceiling collapsed all they had of their fuel was the dregs sitting in the bottom of the tank the rest had spilled out and filled the back room with the stink of diesel however the alternator and the voltage regulator were undamaged and only required an alternative source of mechanical input another motor to generate a usable electrical charge the answer to that problem was straightforward in theory if not in practice they needed to juryrig a motorized vehicle of some sort devereaus regiment an infantry regiment didnt have a single truck jeep tank to offer the only two possibilities the colonel could offer to maddy were to cannibalize their solitary motor launch for its feeble outboard engine or to try to disassemble and relocate the armys ageing generator buried deep in their defence bunkers wainwright had something more promising to offer one of their older tanks slowly rusting in the compound between their defence bunkers one of the mark iv georgian models hed said and devereau seemed to know what he was talking about southern chicken friers chicken friers maddy looked at them both wainwright nodded thin armour plating and badly designed heat transferred from the engine through the whole vehicle makes it like sitting in an oven but also the fuel tank is poorly positioned and exposed added devereau one could aim gunfire to damage the fuel tank knowing the fuel would flood downward into the vehicle and indeed wainwright nodded not called the frier for nothing as she watched becks and jefferson finished securing the mounting on the far side of the east river a swarm of men in blue and grey were already busy with sparking welding torches working industriously on the makeshift raft that was going to float the old mark iv tank across to them colonel devereau was busy overseeing the repairing of the abandoned trench system both he and wainwright had agreed that to defend the far side of the river the confederate side would be a pointless exercise as the defences were all aimed the wrong way northwards towards the river the british would be arriving from the south so it was to be here on this side that both regiments were going to hold the ground together the abandoned trench works had a commanding position over the flattened ruins that sloped gently down to the river if the british really were planning an amphibious assault this was where it was going to land a kill zone if they could make proper use of the trenches maddy had asked why theyd do that an amphibious landing why didnt they just parachute their men down behind their defence line from one of those big sky navy ships she got two blank stares parashoot devereau frowned what the devil is that never mind he followed her gaze towards the sparks on the far side of the river tis a heartening sight is it not our men working alongside each other yes i just hope we have enough time devereau nodded a warrant for his own arrest had arrived this morning delivered by an officer wearing the dark blue almost black uniform of the union intelligence division accompanied by a foot patrol of foreign legionnaires word had inevitably found its way up his chain of command already hed been hoping to hear news that the men of the th maine up along the east end of the sheridansaint germain line were going to be the first to follow suit and join them but so far hed heard nothing he looked to his right down along the sweeping curve of the river among the faroff jagged spikes of ruined buildings he imagined his fellow northern officers must be curiously watching the flurry of activity over here wondering how long devereaus foolish mutiny was going to last it would last a great deal longer if you had the spit to make a stand alongside us matters were no better for colonel wainwright a warrant had arrived from richmond for his arrest on a charge of mutiny he and wainwright had spoken briefly this morning on their temporary phone line the news hed been hoping for from that side of the river hadnt materialized wainwrights broadcast inviting the other confederate regiments up the line to join them had either not been received or as he suspected they had not the will or courage to join their fellows the last detachment of men from the was due to cross the river later on today and join them in digging in on this side just under six hundred men and officers in all not much to withstand the might of the british army and quite possibly a regiment or two of elite french foreign legion too he suspected discreet meetings had already occurred between generals at the very top of both sides agreements made to temporarily work together to crush this little mutiny quickly he looked at the lines of trench works being dug deeper and reinforced with sandbags and timber struts they extended parallel to the river from the support stump of the williamsburg bridge towards the cracked and sooted ruins of the bryson glue factories as brooklyn followed the east river up and merged into queens men would be positioned in the factories with perfect enfiladefire positions down on the shingle and the approach it was here though here in this open space this five hundred yards of bombedout rubble and craters flat ground that sloped down to the river it was here where there was space for dozens of landing craft to drop their ramps simultaneously that they were going to have to hit them the hardest and it was dangerously close to this precariously frail dome of bricks in which the supposed time machine was located their first line of defence was the borderline a long straight trench running from the bridge support to the glue factory the second line of defence was the horseshoe a hastily dug trench that followed the perimeter of the large bomb crater in which the brick mound nestled at the very bottom finally if and when the horseshoe was overrun there was the fort the entrance to the girls archway had been reinforced with a small nest of sandbags and support bars and topped with a roof of more bags and shovelled dirt it was a bunker in which three gatlinggun teams would be stationed firing out through gunnery slits where well make our last stand if it comes to that he buried that thought beneath a reassuring smile we shall hold this ground long enough for you to activate your machine and write us a brandnew history miss carter i am quite certain of that this is a good piece of ground to defend chapter new wellington new wellingtons streets were clogged with vehicles motorized and horse drawn refugees all attempting to head south to avoid the coming fight word was already spreading right now along the port citys main street it was a motionless logjam a deafening turmoil of raised angry voices snorting unsettled horses and rattling combustion engines the pavements either side were filled with pedestrians laden with possessions on their shoulders and backs liam and the others found themselves standing beneath the porch of a hardware store watching the tide of foot traffic traipsing past them its like everyones leaving uttered liam whats going on asked sal did mcmanus tell you she spat his name out like badtasting phlegm theres something going on in new york said liam he said something about a new offensive more war is it grumbled lincoln has this corrupted world not had enough of it already but if the fightings going to happen up in new york why is everyone here running away this is far enough from the fight isnt it not far enough answered a gruff voice behind them they turned to see an old man in the store behind them hed opened his door without their hearing you not heard the rumours then rumours liam shrugged aye it is the british are attacking the old man wafted his hand like that was old news that much everyone knows about lad no theres talk this time they gonna be fightin with experimentals once again he nodded at the people streaming past them news was in the morning papers some dock workers down at them landing bays caught sight of a bunch of newtype tubebreeds liam looked at sal and the others unsure whether the old man was referring to the hunterseekers or the huffaloes stupid fools they dont give half a cent whatfor about the things they unleash on us over here crazyminded monsters bred to kill its only america right he shook his head angrily bad enough we got tubebreeds all over the country in every farm every factory but crazy ones been bred and trained just to kill its no wonder its got everyone ajitter now they scared theres gonna be another prestons peak he nodded out at the congested street twentyfour hours from now this place gonna be a ghost town an i guess ill have to board my shop up from looters an mebbe head south myself until they made sure they gathered up all their monsters and got em back in cages again god knows i dont want to be the only fool in town if they gonna lose control of em all over again right said liam nodding anyways the old man frowned you an your friends comin in to buy some stuff ah no we were just sort of getting out of the way of the well this aint a darned hotel he glanced at bobs hulking form hunched over to fit his bristly head beneath the awning above his porch youre blockin me up from proper customers you better scoot off me boards that or buy somethin liam sighed all right all right were going he led the way down three steps on to the pavement and into the bustling crowd against the flow all manner of people rich and poor billycock hats to flat caps lace bonnets to threadbare shawls a tide of anxious city people all grumbling curses and muttering rebukes as liam waded against the trudging tide an hour later they were standing on the side of a road heading northeast out of new wellington still choked with vehicles and carts heading southwards making painfully slow progress but moving at least seems like everyone north of here is leaving said liam he wondered why so many civilians would have bothered living so close to the front line anyway after all according to mcmanus the war was an ongoing struggle a constant ebbing and flowing of the front line which stretched westwards across new york state pennsylvania ohio illinois with minor skirmishes here and there every summer that shifted the line half a mile one way then the other but it was a stalemate war wasnt it a war with which people had grown used to living grown used to it rumbling on quietly in the background like a thunderstorm passing by people manage thats what they do except of course not now not with rumours of a big push going around not with rumours of killer eugenics being deployed not too far away from them its silly said sal the eugenics werent dangerous not the ones that took us anyway were they she looked up at lincoln pitiful beings he said if truth be told they were quite sad creatures liam couldnt help wondering what to make of the eugenics looking at the flood of people going past he could understand their fear back in that farmhouse the attack had seemed ferocious quite terrifying at the time and yet now he realized those creatures had just been a band of runaway workers frightened for themselves just doing their best to scavenge and survive but if theyd been a frightening sight he couldnt begin to imagine what military eugenic creatures must be like mind you hed already met some right the hunterseekers they hadnt seemed so bad he shuddered with the thought of something there must be other types weve not yet seen we should get going the road looks like its clearing up a bit we should make better time now were out of town how far is new york from here bob information a hundred and eleven miles ahh well thats all right liam smiled thats not so far to go then shall we chapter new york oh my god cried maddy she turned to becks standing beside her in front of the computer desk its actually working she could see the soft amber standby light of the fourgang plug socket and spike protector weve got enough amplitude coming in affirmative maddy ducked down and punched on the nearest of the networked pcs beneath the desk one of the monitors winked on she switched on the next one and the next until all nine computers were busy whirring at different stages of booting up maddy wanted both of the colonels to see this although she knew they more than half believed her story it would do no harm for them to see this machinery stir to life she trotted across the floor skidding on loose grit and skipping over the thick flex of power cable running out through the raised shutter door it snaked round the low entrance to the fort and turned left along a freshly dug trench for twenty yards before rising up over the rear trench wall and across several yards of rubble and weed wasteland towards the opened rear engine hatches of wainwrights mark iv tank the engine casing bulky and pitted with rust juddered unnervingly like a feral cat trapped in a hatbox it was spewing a thick cloud of smoke from an exhaust pipe at the top of its boxshaped iron turret the tanks labouring engine was spinning a flywheel around the wheel was a cambelt a loop of thick leather taken off the vehicles drive shaft and leading instead to their battered and sorrylooking generator theyd hauled it out earlier and set it up beside the tank the belt was turning the generators own internal rotor and armature down the slope towards the river she could see wainwright and devereau standing above the borderline devereau squatted down and talked to someone in the trench wainwright smoking his pipe and looking out across the river hey you two colonels she shouted above the rumble of the tanks badtempered engine they both looked her way and she waved them over its working we got power she waited for them to jog over and then led them back down into the trench following the cable past the fort and ducking inside the archway across the floor to where the row of computer monitors were all now showing the same desktop wallpaper shed put on several days ago an image of homer simpson good grief gasped devereau unsure what to make of the wall of grinning faces maddy pulled a seat out and sat down at the desk computerbob you there this this yellow face said wainwright is the face of your computer uh she looked at the monitors oh no hes just a a she wrinkled her nose doesnt really matter a dialogue box appeared on the monitor in front of her hello madelaine it appears a significant malfunction has occurred he was seeing the wreckage of the archway behind her that or he was registering internal problems with one or more of the networked computers i also detect two unauthorized personnel in the archway thats ok bob thats ok they have my authorization to be here affirmative wainwrights jaw hung open you have a machine that can talk to you oh yeah bob hes well computerbob not of course to be confused with bob whos a well sort of a guyshaped computer and a copy of computerbob and some of becks actually who by the way is also a copy of computerbob she looked up at the colonels and realized she was losing them just think of becks here and this computer system as family sort of family said wainwright looking at devereau not really any the wiser bob we got hit by a time wave a big one this is apparent the wave was caused by lincoln being here in and not back where he should be that is the most likely conclusion what is lincolns location now we do not have that information said becks hello becks hello computerbob maddy wrapped her knuckles impatiently on the desk save the lovein for later you two we need to send them a message right now the last known location said becks was the window opened near the fbi training academy quantico virginia that was five days ago correct i have those coordinates in my event log theyll have been making their way to us said maddy how far is it information two hundred and twentysix miles they shouldve made it back by now then surely she pouched her lips unless theyve decided to stay put and wait for me to open a window right where we dropped them off this is an equally likely possibility maddy balled her fist and cursed both colonels exchanged a bemused look at her colourful choice of words hang on she held a finger up i can give them all the time they need say a whole month if thats what they need to we cannot hold the british for a whole maddy shook her head relax relax this is time displacement we can open the portal up as soon as the machines charged up enough say in about twelve hours time but i could set the timestamp to open a space one month from now do you see with time displacement all time past present and future is effectively now as long as youve got enough energy to reach it easy as easy peas a cursor flashed across the dialogue box negative what diagnostic on the displacement machine indicates the tertiary downstream phase analysis module has failed we cannot at this time open a window in the future she banged her fist on the desk why is it always so freakin arghhh she shook her head does this mean your machine cannot operate asked devereau maddy sighed no no it just means we have to wait this out in realtime she shrugged stupid me i was hoping for the easy option she settled back in her chair all right all right plan b then we pick a place roughly halfway between new york and quantico and give them what two days no three days time enough to make sure they can get there from now asked devereau she nodded then noticed the look of concern on both mens faces we can hold on here that long cant we her eyes went from one to the other right i mean you know if they attacked say right now your men could hold this ground for three days the officers eyes met it was wainwright who broke the long silence it will depend what force they throw at us and of course how quickly they have decided to respond to news of this mutiny and how well our men will fight added devereau wainwright nodded the officers in my regiment i know will fight to the death as men of rank we all now face firing squads if we were to surrender the enlisted men they would face a british military prison devereau nodded grimly a similar fate awaits our officers but i think my men will fight well because there can be no retreat if the south attack the legionnaires will be lined up behind us ready to shoot anyone retreating so she was still waiting for an answer three days then wainwright stroked his chin to be certain you can promise us this new history if i can pick them up and drop them back in yes and if lincoln is still alive she suspected bob and liam were probably fine so far together they seemed to have been able to weather anything and sal would probably be fine with them looking after her but lincoln the guy was a loose cannon a bigmouth a hothead anything could have happened to him over the last week then our men will give you your three days said wainwright what do you say william devereau nodded this is a good defensive position maddy turned back to face the webcam on the desk ok computerbob three days rendezvous from now we just need to pick some place halfway between here and quantico somewhere relatively quiet and peaceful if possible affirmative we got enough charge to send a broadrange signal affirmative information my diagnostic has also picked up calibration errors on the transmission array affirmative said becks a replacement component a conventional radio communication dish has been connected i can run the recalibration with you bob well you two sort that out now she turned to wainwright and devereau either of you got any relatively uptodate maps we can look at we need to pick a place for our guys to get to chapter new wellington sparks danced up into the night sky from their campfire one of several dozen they could see up and down the side of the roadway refugees heading south and those on foot like them stopping at the side of the road for the night to rest eat and perhaps sleep they were cooking cobs of corn theyd plucked from a field earlier this evening over the fire somewhere across on the other side of the road someone was roasting coffee beans over theirs and someone else salted bacon its cooler tonight said liam sal snuggled beside him nodded you all right sal he said she nodded again her eyes on the fire glistening i know he started look i know what happened was hard hard she whispered hard was a lazy careless word to use for what theyd witnessed i i keep seeing it liam you know she looked up at him i see samuel looking at me looking right at me when they shot him he was her voice faded to nothing together they stared at the fire in silence watched the cobs slowly blacken on the edge of the fire i feel she chewed on a fingernail i feel strange like im like im not who i used to be not the same saleena i used to be liam nodded weve both seen a lot you and me its like my old life my parents my home my school friends all thats become someone elses life not mine any more do you know what i mean aye he said softly me too it feels like you me and maddy have been together for years although she knew exactly how long it had been a hundred and fiftyfive days seventyfive bubbletime cycles plus five days for me it is said liam six months in and another six months in the twelfth century and another in dinosaur times he looked at her quizzical you know what ive lived a whole year longer than you since we were recruited i know she looked up at him tilted her head to look at the tress of grey hair by his temple you do look older well id be seventeen now i suppose mock serious i went an missed me birthday she smiled and punched his arm lightly happy birthday then he reached out and prodded one of the charred cobs with a stick still too hard to want to eat yet on the other side of the fire lincoln was muttering something to bob about his childhood something to do with skinning hares youre right though liam said after a while about what bit that were different people now you me and maddy ive seen things done things that i think have changed me like what well i killed a man so i did really he nodded the fight for nottingham killed a soldier with me sword he looked at me was staring at me as i did it to him like i dont know sal it was like he wanted me to know him in his final moment like he wanted me to make sure i remembered him forever liam shook his head and it worked i see him every night in my dreams that same fella the same face do you ever dream of the moment when foster recruited you liam closed his eyes not recently since nottingham it had been this man over and over haunting his sleep i used to i do she said almost every night i remember every little detail i see it all every night like a holomovie shed told him once about how shed been recruited the fire sal nodded every morning i wake up and want to cry because its like ive just left my parents my mathaji baba all over again i can barely remember my parents he said he tried to remember them and struggled to conjure their smiles their frowns in his mind only one memory successfully gave him their faces a fleeting recollection of holding in his hands a badly faded photograph of them in an old tin frame he shook his head how could that be the only decent enough memory hed managed to hang on to but theres this thing liam this odd thing he gave up fishing for another mental image of ma and da they were gone people from someone elses life now what what odd thing my memory of foster saving me from that burning tower theres this moment when the building finally begins to collapse its horrible she shook her head and winced at that sensation of the floor collapsing beneath her feet of falling and the fire beneath waiting for her to drop into it as if she was falling into hell itself im falling liam but beneath me spinning beneath me theres this soft toy a teddy bear a blue teddy bear it belonged to one of my neighbours mrs chaudhrys little boy i used to babysit him he shrugged whats so odd about that because ive seen it liam the same bear the exact same bear in that antique shop near us chapter new wellington on the other side of the fire lincoln grimaced confused frustrated how can a world be so very different from the absence of one man muttered lincoln it seems a highly illogical notion a man such as myself even he scratched at his dark beard i had hopes of making some mark but to cause an entire new world to come into being from my not being there i still struggle to make sense of this since all time past present and future exists at the same time it is logical to say the future has already happened said bob his eyes warily scanned the night around them as he spoke therefore all events are predetermined to happen a certain way every event every human is a part of that sequence of events he looked at lincoln the predetermined sequence you would call this history can tolerate the absence or alteration of minor events your influence on the outcome of the american civil war was a significant event surely it is important that you tell me more about the life ahead of me then for me to make all the correct decisions in my life in which i end up as this wartime president of the north negative you do not need to know the events of history the circumstances of your life and what is in your own nature will conspire to direct you correctly but there must surely come many moments in my life ahead where my destiny might hang on the fate of lincoln shook his head trying to think of an example of the simple toss of a coin or even the distracting smile of a pretty woman if the course of your life was dependent on such marginal variables you would be a minor sequential event and your absence would not have caused this time wave bob cocked his head as he fished for an appropriate saying from his database destiny has a plan for you lincoln gazed at the flames as if in their flickering momentary shapes hidden answers lay waiting to be discovered in other words you are saying i must trust my instinct all that you will be already exists in you said bob the human mind is a store of data memories the memories plus the behavioural template you inherit genetically define you lincoln nodded he thought he understood the gist of that hed once had a conversation very similar to this with his father a simple uneducated man but wise beyond the grime on his farmers hands we are all that we see and what our forefathers have seen and in the last few days he had seen some very questionable things those creatures for instance creatures capable of intelligent thoughts and speech reading and writing for gods sake treated like possessions like objects things to be dispensed with or recycled when broken to know a creature has humanlike intelligence and yet still treat it like a yard dog worse to treat it like cattle he nodded i believe you may have a point there bob my father once just a moment bob cocked his head and started blinking lincoln scowled at him what the devil is the matter with you liam had stopped talking with sal both looked across the campfire at bob bob are you affirmative liam i am detecting tachyon particles at last said sal whats maddy saying to you bobs head remained cocked like a dog listening for his masters whistle just a moment i am compiling the message lincoln looked at the three of them one to the other as if they were all mad are you saying he is hearing miss carters voice liam shrugged in a manner of speaking presently bob nodded straightened up and looked at liam we have a rendezvous datastamp where asked sal more to the point when added liam seventyone hours fiftynine minutes three seconds three days to you and me said liam to lincoln location is thirtyone miles due west of our present location a location known as new chelmsford thirtyone miles sal looked at liam jahulla thats thats quite a trek for us isnt it liam thumbed his chin as he looked out across the night the direction in which they needed to go was going to take them away from the northsouth road theyd been walking along across countryside away from roads clogged with refugees away from new york quite deliberately shes found us somewhere safe to head towards its a walk so it is but its not so hard well make an early start tomorrow chapter new york wainwright sipped his coffee and smacked his lips approvingly and this is called instant coffee maddy looked at the jar on the side table beside their kettle thats right were a bit lazy in our time coffees as easy as slapping on the kettle and spooning granules into your cup she laughed none of this roastingandgrindingyourownbeans hassle it was a reassuring feeling having the power back on in the archway seeing the soft glow of computerbobs monitors and the hum of the displacement machine slowly recharging outside out of sight but still chugging the tank engine was turning over a mechanized badtempered mutter that sounded like it was ready to throw in the towel at the first hint of criticism the men were embedded in the trenches now both confederate and union soldiers merged into one fullstrength regiment between them dark blue and grey tunics side by side staring out at the broad moonlit east river and the broken skyline of manhattan beyond the british rarely do night assaults said wainwright returning to a discussion of their preparations he snorted a laugh something to do with being jolly unsporting he sipped his coffee of course that doesnt mean they wont try one this time they had a small team of men over on the far side of the east river watching for the first signs of the british approaching the telephone cable was still running across the span of water first sight and theyd make the call give a rough estimate of the size of the force then hasten back over the river in the motor launch i think however tonight we can afford to savour our coffee wainwright pulled a small dented hip flask out of his pocket colonel devereau a little mulekick to go with your instant coffee devereau smiled and raised his mug for the confederate to pour a measure of whisky into his coffee just a little not enough to keep your mother up indeed wainwright tapped his mug against devereaus and they both slurped a mouthful miss carter said devereau tell me more about time travel the idea of it i find wholly fascinating if a little confusing what do you want to know devereau looked stumped well to start with what is it like to actually travel in time she closed her eyes thinking its its very weird ghostly white youre in this space sort of between space in another dimension really because thats what youre doing leaving conventional spacetime and reentering it at another place earlier or later whats the phrase you just used asked wainwright another dimension thats it you understand the three dimensions right up down left and right forward and back ah you mean axes of motion miss carter said wainwright you are talking of those things yup spatial dimensions thats what we call them well in my timeline physicists talk about something like eleven spatial dimensions eleven axes of movement that makes no sense said devereau once you have up and down left and right forward and back what other direction is there well thats just it we humans cant visualize dimensions beyond three because thats the space in which we live but those other dimensions do exist whether we believe in them or not whether we can experience them or not look imagine a twodimensional world maddy pulled a sheet of lined paper off a pad on the kitchen table and laid it down between the colonels she grabbed a biro and drew a stick man on the page and heres fred living in this twodimensional world now fred can see and move around in four directions up and down left and right ok they both nodded she scrawled another stick character this time with a skirt and pouty lips and this is loretta now if fred takes a look at loretta he wont know if shes a boy or a girl why do you think that is both colonels stroked their beards thoughtfully what do you think fred sees when he looks at her a badly drawn stick lady said wainwright no he sees nothing but a flat line he can only look along the surface of the paper and if you put your head right down on the paper yourself you can almost kinda see things from his perspective loretta is just a line hell never see her luscious lips or girly skirt hell only ever see a line because he cant look down on or more precisely into this page he wont know shes a lady and so theyll never fall in love devereau frowned but can fred look up could he see us no even though were right here leaning over him because he cant comprehend in to or out of this pieceofpaper world he can never be aware of us she sat back in her armchair thats how as natives of a threedimensional universe we cant see or make sense of further spatial dimensions but just because we cant see them that doesnt mean theyre not there i see she wondered if he did so travelling in time she continued for fred it would be like floating him off this piece of paper and dropping him down again in the other corner that i imagine would be an unsettling experience for fred said wainwright im not too keen on it when i do it maddy replied it feels like falling they were quiet for a while outside of the archway somewhere in the night around a campfire some of the men roared with laughter if you are successful and this abraham linford lincoln abraham lincoln is returned to his correct time you say history will attempt to rewrite itself thats right tell me said devereau what will that be like for us for me james here our men what would we be aware of would we know it is happening she nodded youll see it coming its quite a thing to see would you describe what wed see miss carter asked wainwright well she looked at becks who offered her no inspiration just a calm passive gaze well its its a wall of reality like the front edge of a tidal wave a wave that starts as a ripple and travels through days months years decades centuries getting bigger and bigger and when it finally arrives she shook her head and closed her eyes goosebumps teased the skin on her forearms its like looking at i dont know like the crust of the earth has split and one edge is swallowing the other its as big as a mountain range but its all twisty and churning like liquid and it comes fast guys really fast you cant outrun it she opened her eyes devereau looked pale it sounds truly terrifying first time you see it she shrugged i suppose it is and when this wave reaches us miss carter wainwright splayed his hands what then you change the world changes change would this be felt in any way would it hurt be unpleasant no you just cease to be and another version of you appears simple the men exchanged a glance wainwrights eyes narrowed it sounds to me as if as if i will be destroyed by this wave vaporized maddy bit her lip he was actually quite right this wave would mean the end of me said wainwright the man i have become a lifetime of memories sweet and bad my family back in richmond all gone destroyed she wondered whether she should spin the truth a little make it sound a little more acceptable palatable for the southern colonel instead she decided to be honest with him yes it does sort of mean the end of you but she added quickly but also a new you another me wainwright frowned another me surely that would merely be another man who just shares my name and my likeness he looked at devereau william is this not us sacrificing our lives so that other men who look just like us can enjoy a better life perhaps devereau nodded slowly but james are we not dead men anyway the confederate colonels uneasy frown deepened our mutiny will be a shortlived one devereau continued id hoped the flames of rebellion would have spread further but well it appears now that we are in this alone there we are thats the way it is he sat forward the armchairs old springs creaking but colonel i put this to you what if by dying on a battlefield or being destroyed by this wave you could end this war banish both the french and the british from our shores and unite our separate northern and southern states once and for all and be able to achieve all of this in one instant is that not a good way to go wainwright studied his colleague for a long while eventually his frown gave way to a grin that spread beneath his moustache putting it like that colonel devereau he raised his mug and clanked it against his friends to foolish men who wish to change history chapter new york sergeant freeman squinted blearyeyed at the hazy sky beyond the strip of manhattan beyond the broad and sedate hudson river was new jersey the south freeman realized that where he and young ray were huddled near the top of a tall building he guessed must have once been a bank or something right here was the closest hed been to actually even seeing the south from where they were sitting on dustcovered stools looking out of a cracked window frame it looked no different to the crumbling ruins in which hed been living for more years than he cared to remember the rising sun coming up behind them picked out the skeletons of dockside cranes twisted and contorted the rusting hull of an old sherman ironside a navy ship scuttled nearly seventy years ago when the south made their second assault on new york he shuddered as a fresh breeze sent dust devils spinning across the open floor the wall to the east was completely gone exposing a crosssection of the buildings many floors he turned to look at all the old office things typewriters filing cabinets desks and chairs all of them coated in a thick layer of plaster dust and pigeon droppings the sun was filling this floor streaming in where the wall should be he shaded his eyes from the glare if he squinted a little he could just about imagine how this office must have once looked busy with activity busy with smartly dressed young men moving purposefully making money and the bigframed windows looking down on new york on all that promise and wealth and hopefulness a doleful smile slowly pulled on his leathery face helluva view folks musta had from up here he muttered sup sir freeman shook his head aint nothing ray just an old mans nonsense its darned cold sunrisell warm us up directly son he rubbed his hands together the young lad was right it was cold up here wind chill an all he shouldve asked the colonel if they could have taken a brazier up here with them at the very least several flasks of hot water or some such ray was looking up the long west side of manhattan island thin tendrils of smoke in the distance signalled the canteen fires of other southern regiments you reckon them other regiments upriver gonna join us too sir in due course im sure we just gotta make a show of things for a while he glanced back at the hazy labyrinth of bombravaged brooklyn our boys and them southern boys we just gotta make us a stand show them others upriver that we all are serious bout this rebellion that we finally finished with this war freeman doubted it was going to be that simple more than that he sensed that same doubt in their colonel beds all made up now nothing left to do but sleep in it sir freeman turned back to ray what is it son whats that the boy was pointing freeman followed the direction of his finger and squinted once again to make better use of his old eyes it looked like thunder clouds on the horizon made sense they were due rain sometime soon a row of heavily stacked clouds pass me them field glasses ray the young man fished them out of a pouch and passed them to the sergeant now then he said fumbling with the lensfocus dial let me just get a the bell grabbed maddy and hauled her out of a troubled dream she opened her eyes and found herself staring at the springs of sals bunk above for a moment with the gentle glow of the light bulb above casting a patchwork of shadows from its wire grille and the hum of the computers she thought all was well once more that the idea of a civil war still being fought across the rubble of new york had been nothing but her sleeping minds fun and games but then the long clattering trill of a bell again she turned her head and saw colonel devereau jerking awake in one of the armchairs he reached out and unhooked the phone from its cradle on the table yes maddy swung her legs on to the floor as wainwright stirred and becks ducked under the shutter and entered the archway devereau nodded solemnly as he listened then finally good man come back immediately he hung the phone up on its cradle theyre coming a moment later they were all emerging outside stepping into the glare of morning she followed the colonels along the trench pressing past grimfaced men already mustering checking their webbing their ammo pouches their carbines buttoning their tunics replacing forage caps with hard helmets up a short stepladder and out of the horseshoeshaped trench she joined them on the open ground sloping down towards the borderline and the river a motor launch was steaming across the glasssmooth water towards them leaving a rippling v in its wake becks stood beside her they are here looming low in the sky above manhattan like an archipelago of floating islands a fleet of giant sky carriers had arrived chapter en route to new chelmsford liam wiped sweat from his face the morning had started out so chilly now midday with the sky a rich blue and the sun hanging high it was a summers day come late traipsing across field after field punctuated by the occasional meadow and now finally in an apple orchard that seemed endless they were exhausted five minutes gasped liam ive got a stitch in me side he slumped against the trunk of an apple tree five minutes rest here then well carry on lincoln slid down beside him equally spent and grumbling about blisters on his feet sal didnt want to sit she knew if she did shed not want to get up again anyway more pressing matters i need to uh to go and liam waved her off dont wander too far ok she turned away and ducked down under the lowhanging branches of the nearest tree she could still see them which meant they could see her she walked a little further from them between rows of trees through grass tall enough to tickle her fingers she ducked down again under another cluster of appleladen branches and found herself on the edge of a clearing a glance backwards she couldnt see them any more although she could hear the gentle rumble of bobs voice good enough for modesty she turned back and was about to step round the back of the tree trunk beside her and into the clearing when she spotted it almost yelping with shock as she immediately ducked down into the long grass a eugenic it was sitting on the edge of the clearing huge one of the apelike ones a tiny head almost an afterthought emerging as little more than a lump from its huge shoulders she froze where she was petrified that if she moved again she might attract its attention she peered more closely at it it looked a size larger than the apes half as big again even more top heavy with musclemass but it was the creatures face that struck her no mouth or rather where a mouth should have been a short length of pipe emerged sealed at the end it also appeared to be wearing a skullcap of some kind she watched it for a good minute before suspecting it was quite dead liam squatted down in front of it and peered closely at its small face its eyes were open dilated and glazed they could hear it breathing air that rustled in through the slits of its nose and wheezed out like a blacksmiths bellows well its not dead i can tell that much the creature is in a stupor said lincoln sal reached out and touched its apelike face pale skin as smooth and as hairless as a babys the cap she thought it had been wearing a leather one seemed to be attached fixed in place to a band round its forehead by a pair of clips she looked at liam it comes off maybe he nodded go on i dont think this brutes going to mind carefully she undid one clip and then the other and gently eased the cap up off the band oh thats just gross beneath a scuffed glass cover they could see its skull had been scooped empty of brain in the cranial cavity through the scratched glass they could see something grey and ribbed the size shape and texture of a walnut it was penetrated by half a dozen small brass rods linked by wires to a control box that blinked an amber light information said bob electronic impulses sent through the rods to the organic tissue stimulate brain activity a much simpler version of the siliconorganic interface in my head liam puffed a queasy breath out mcmanus said they were controlling their creatures much better now so this is how they scoop the poor things brains out and shove in whatever that is instead it is a brain isnt it said sal aye but a tiny one like a rats or something sal made a face or maybe they grow these things without brains now said liam that somehow seemed a more palatable idea better than growing smart creatures and then lobotomizing them like this they heard a distant whistle sounding what was that asked lincoln mens voices echoed through the orchard they heard the clatter of machinery firing up liam shrugged maybe that was the end of a lunch break the light on the box suddenly changed from amber to green sal tilted her head does that mean its just turned itself on liam looked at the others uhh who thinks we better go sal nodded she popped the leather cap back on and managed to snap one of the clips in place before the eugenic stirred its small eyes twitched and flickered and then focused on sal for a moment oh jayzus whispered liam its woken up liam pulled sal back and stood in front of her easy there big fella his voice trembled the creature slowly pulled itself to its feet and stood erect for a moment easily two foot taller than bob its allblack eyes small and glistening like a spiders seemed to be studying them without the tiniest hint of curiosity then without any warning it turned round and pushed its way through the gap between the nearest two apple trees liam ducked down low under the branches and peered out after it to see the creature push through another row of trees into an area of the orchard busy being harvested he saw a dozen others like it leviathansized eugenics assembling around one end of what appeared to be some sort of combineharvester in the sky half a mile away he saw a sky vessel was slowly approaching descending just like the farming operation theyd seen in action a week ago he looked back at the enormous eugenic workers the sheer size of this particular type they made bob look pitifully small weve not seen this kind before said liam we should proceed said bob hunkering down beside liam we have twentyone miles to the rendezvous location liam nodded youre right chapter new york maddy spat grit out of her mouth oh my god that was close the artillery barrage began several hours after the british had arrived just as colonel devereau had said it would with every percussive thump of a shell landing on this side of the river the archway seemed to shower on them more dust and particles of brick they were partly protected from a direct hit by the mangled remains of the bridge overhanging them but the way their roof seemed to be shedding pieces she had no doubt a near enough miss would do as good a job as a direct hit she picked up the computer keyboard in front of her and turned it over pouring dust and grit out from between the keys on to the desk jeeez im surprised anythings still working in here her words were lost beneath another nearby thump that unleashed a shower of debris from above ten minutes of this bombardment so far and already maddys nerves were jangling one hit just one and im going to be entombed beneath an avalanche of bricks she had half a mind to leave the archway and stand outside in the trenches at least shed not die by being crushed becks was sitting beside the displacement machine protecting the rack of circuit boards from falling fragments the computer keyboard in front of her might still work with nuggets of brick lodged inside it thought maddy but she doubted the fragile electronics of the displacement machine would be quite so forgiving and what about the antennae array outside if it got knocked theyd have to reset it go outside stand on the crumbling roof and recalibrate it or god knows how offtarget their window was going to be worst still what about a hit on that old rustbucket tank outside still loyally chugging away no tank no power theyd be as good as dead in the water becks yes maddy theres no way were going to survive two days of this another heavy thump deposited a shower of debris on maddys head she spat out grit and shook her head sending another smaller shower of dust out of her hair and on to her lap we need to open the window now we cant do that maddy they may not be at the rendezvous coordinates yet becks queen of the freakin obvious i know that i know that but weve got to do something before we get hit both becks and bob had a local wireless range but neither of them could transmit a message to each other across more than a mile or two at best information the chances of a direct artillery hit are relatively low maddy equipment failure is far more likely to occur as a result of the cumulative impact vibrations well there you go we need to do something soon becks had nothing to offer another thud sent the monitors blinking out a moment later they all flickered back on oh this is totally not good becks weve got to do something she looked around her desk for inspiration come on come on what what do i do they should send a message to bob and the others let them know they needed to speed things up open the window much sooner than arranged at this rate in two days time there wasnt going to be an archway left nor trenches nor troops just a pockmarked wasteland of brandnew craters computerbob the dialogue box appeared in front of her yes maddy new message for bob proceed archway under attack need to open window at stated coordinates much sooner she bit her lip how much more of this can the equipment take another few minutes hours but then that question was balanced by another equally important one how far away were liam and the others from the extraction point there was simply no knowing its quite possible they were very close after all shed picked a place roughly twothirds of the way up from quantico to new york and a dozen miles westwards off the main highways somewhere quiet they might have been very close when they got the message they just might and that message was sent about eighteen hours ago they could be waiting right there twiddling their thumbs waiting impatiently for the window to open on the other hand they might be fifty or a hundred miles away struggling desperately to make it there in time window to open in ten minutes time said maddy end of message affirmative compiling message packet maddy called out becks if we open a window in ten minutes time then it will take approximately another twelve hours to recharge the machine for a second attempt maddy winced and cursed she knew that anyway becks was right they couldnt afford to panic and blow their accumulated charge she glanced across at the rack and could see all twelve green leds lit up a full charge and that had taken them the whole night and most of today with that poor old tank rattling away computerbob cancel that new message message cancelled i am ready for your new message maddy all right ok the message is this archway is under attack proceed to coordinates as fast as you freakin well can will watch for you with pinhole probe will open as soon as we see you end of message affirmative compiling message packet she turned to becks well open a pinhole window now and grab an image and if theyre not there well do it again in another say half an hours time and again and again this will drain the power so sue me she snapped then grimaced guiltily becks was only doing her job this way well at least get in a few free looks right before weve used up enough of the charge that we cant open a proper window correct then thats what were gonna do until we absolutely need to conserve whats left computerbob had been listening maddy shall i send this message please confirm yes confirm sending the message do it chapter new york new york devereau looked at the men huddled in the bottom of the borderline an artillery bombardment like this on a defensive position was more successful at draining morale than it was at whittling down the enemys numbers the shells were mostly pitting the sloping wasteland with new craters one or two shells had got lucky and caved in a section of the trench nothing that couldnt be hastily dug out and repaired before a landing arrived no it was the way it sapped the fighting spirit of the men that the bombardments damage was done left them feeling helpless impotent as the enemy pounded them from afar down the trench he could see sergeant freeman bellowing encouragement to the men around him a mixture of men from his own regiment and wainwrights virginians devereau grinned it was ncos like freeman that were the backbone of a regiment grimfaced veterans with a lifetime of scars and battlefield voices that carried over even the percussive thump of artillery shells landing men followed their generals and colonels but it was their sergeants and corporals they turned to for a reassuring nod in the heat of battle he was about to glance over to the horseshoe to check whether the tank was still running when he suddenly found himself lying on his back at the bottom of the trench watching a small avalanche of dark soil rain down on him instinctively he covered his face and closed his mouth as dirt began to cover him devereau tried to flail to get himself up but his arms and legs felt leaden and it was all of a sudden so silent the only noise was his heart thudding rhythmically the rumble of the artillery bombardment sounded like it was going on a thousand miles away a summer thunderstorm in another county he felt hands on him digging him out of the dirt pulling him up out of his temporary shallow grave a face right above him one of wainwrights confederates all beard and dirtsmeared skin beneath the brim of his helmet the man was shouting something but devereau couldnt hear what he was saying all he could hear was his pumping heart and that distant rumble i am all right he shouted back at the man not that he could hear himself not sure if hed shouted it or whispered it the man helped him on to his feet and devereau quickly patted himself down to make sure he hadnt been nicked by shrapnel the arterial thumping in his ears had become a shrill ringing that he imagined would drive him very quickly insane if it was a permanent condition he picked his forage cap out of the dark soil between his boots and put it back on straightening the peak he saw a dozen faces down the trench looking warily at him theyre watching you show them some bravado he pulled his sabre more a ceremonial addition than a practical one from its scabbard and held the blade close to his face using the polished surface as a mirror as he adjusted his cap and straightened his collar he gave himself an approving nod before tucking the sabre back knowing thered be a ripple of grins among the men either side the ringing in his ears was beginning to diminish and this time he could just about hear the confederate soldiers voice ir the arrage opped what he cupped his ear the man nodded over the lip of the trench stopped sir barrage has stopped devereau took a step up on to an ammo box to give him a good clear view ahead stopped yes they have he could feel the sporadic vibrations of impact and shockwave had ceased and now the cratered slope in front of them was bathed in a swirling mist of white smoke smoke he whispered the last volley of artillery fire had been establishing a smokescreen he turned to the confederate beside him theyre coming after the relentless noise of the bombardment the sudden calm was unsettling his ears the ringing diminished now to background hiss struggled to pick out the noise of the approaching british in that cloud of smoke somewhere theyd be crossing the east river now god knows how many landing boats sputtering across the water ready yourselves men he shouted across the silence check your weapons check you have ammo supplies to hand it goes far too quickly gentlemen he looked out again at the featureless wall of white drifting on the breeze he cursed that today of all days the weather was so still any other time a stiff atlantic breeze would have already whisked away much of the smokescreen sergeant freeman sir his voice returned from further up the trench are you ready for a scrap ready sir been ready all mornin colonel now ahm just gettin downright annoyed they takin so long he heard a ripple of nervous battlefield laughter make its way along the men devereau smiled good man that freeman then he heard it the faint droning putputput of a chorus of engines coming from somewhere out there on the river he reached for his revolver unclipping the holster and wrapping his gloved hand round its grip he pulled it out a little too quickly it caught and he nearly dropped it on the ground but he didnt the confederate next to him made a face hed spotted the fumble and offered devereau an understanding nod luckily none of the other lads had seen he sighed last thing his men needed to witness was just how scared their colonel felt he could hear the engines more clearly and make out now amid the swirling smokescreen the faintest outline of a dozen flattopped landing rafts approaching hed seen the south use these before huge rafts with raised sidepanels that dropped down as it beached each of these landing rafts was capable of transporting an entire company of men good god twelve hundred men two whole regiments in the very first wave he found himself momentarily robbed of breath steady yourself colonel he filled his lungs wait until they drop the ramps men he bellowed then well give em hell a defiant cheer rippled down the trench much closer now he could make out detail on the landing rafts the fluttering of company colours above the outline of an officer standing beside the helmsman at the back of each craft he heard the pitch of the engines drop and then finally a clatter and hiss as one after the other the dozen large landing rafts rode up the shingle and out of the water grinding to a halt he could hear the muffled voices of british officers barking orders behind their raised metal panels readying their men for the disembarking several nervous shots were fired from the trench sending sparks flying off the panels hold your goddamned fire roared sergeant freeman devereaus mouth was dry any second now he could hear the chorused voices of men down the slope they huzzahed at something being said to them a roar of confidence the roar of veterans certain that this little skirmish was going to be over before the last of the swirling smokescreen had blown away then he heard a bugle blowing simultaneously all twelve landing rafts dropped their panels they swung down heavily and crunched on to the shingle forming ramps devereau found himself transfixed at the sight of so many of them swarms of bloodred tunics and white helmets surging down off their rafts fire chapter en route to new chelmsford they passed through a small town east farnham another rural town one main street lined with shops selling farmers supplies hardware and tools one town hall and a church and clapboard homes and picket fences they were getting used to the occasional sideways glances from beneath the brims of felt hats and lace bonnets curious glances at their grubby and unfamiliar clothes and at bob in particular liam wondered whether they thought he was some prototype design of eugenic speaking of which he spotted a couple more of the lobotomized leviathans hefting bales of animal fodder off the back of a delivery wagon their lumbering movement was almost robotic like poorly operated machinery again he marvelled at their size ten eleven foot tall and perhaps eight foot from one rounded mass of shoulder across to the other could we not stop for the night in this town grumbled lincoln my feet feel like theyve been pulled through a knothole backwards liam nodded sympathetically he felt every bit as exhausted fifteen miles on firm hard tarmac was enough of a hike but across ploughed fields of thick freshly turned soil meadows of tall knotted grass through woods deep with spongy leaves hiding gnarly roots ready to trip you up he was just as spent they had about another sixteen miles to go thats what bob had said the last time hed pestered the support unit for an estimate aye i suppose we could do that weve got another whole day and a bit to get us there and thats not so far for us to do tomorrow they had no money on them to pay for lodgings not that he could see anywhere that looked like an inn or a hotel but a barn a shed an outhouse would be more appealing for a nights sleep than some open field he turned round to tell bob they were going to find somewhere on the edge of this town to stop for the day even though it was still only midafternoon they all needed a rest and there was more than enough time for one but bob had stopped in his tracks he was a dozen yards behind them frozen like a statue and staring listlessly up at the clear blue sky uh bob you all right i think hes receiving said sal liam looked around could have picked a better bleedin place his odd behaviour was attracting yet more curious stares from the townsfolk crossing the narrow main street he sauntered casually back and tugged on bobs sleeve hey big fella youre spookin the locals so you are bob ignored him busy catching and collating the tachyon particles winking invisibly into subatomic existence in the air around them your friend all right there young man asked a lady clutching a basket she stopped midstride and peered out from her bonnet shading her eyes from the afternoon sun oh hes fine said liam just a little tired maam she nodded and passed by casting one more curious glance back at them before crossing the high street uh bob how about we just walk a little while youre doing the message thing youre attracting attention bob remained rooted to the spot bob finally he blinked awareness back into his glazed eyes and looked down at liam liam he said i have just received a message from madelaine liams eyes widened well bob frowned at his flippancy negative the message does not indicate she is well the other two joined them now was it maddy asked sal affirmative a partial message the signal has been corrupted slightly message content is as follows archway is un tack roceed to coordinates as fast as freakin well can will watch for with p hole probe will ope oon as ee you liam looked at the others she sounds stressed thats never a good sign un tack sal frowned well thats under attack clearly she looked around at the others right liam cursed recommendation we should i know i know cut in liam we can forget about a rest he looked around up and down the main street he could see a couple of horses tethered to a rail outside one of the stores further along a flatbed wagon pulled by a pair of huffaloes was slowly rolling up along dusty tracks carved in the street too slow they were not following any road map to get to the rendezvous point they were merely going as the crow flies a straight beeline over fields over hedges through woods streams they needed something that didnt require a road he looked the other way up the street he saw the delivery vehicle still laden with bales of cattle feed a long flatbed hooked up to a motorized tractor above a small drivers cabin a chimney pot was impatiently puffing clouds of exhaust into the sky you sir are thinking of stealing that vehicle asked lincoln liam nodded it may not be the fastest thing on the road but faster than walking right sal and lincoln nodded all right then said liam i suppose we better go and uh borrow it chapter new york devereau counted thirty seconds of almost continuous volley fire from his men before the crackle of gunshots began to wane as empty ammo clips were expelled with the telltale ping of their carbines ejector springs a new bank of gunpowder smoke was slowly drifting down the slope from their trench as it thinned and cleared he could see that the shingle and the shallow water around the ramps were littered with the bodies of the dead and wounded a devastating opening salvo that at first appeared to have decimated the british but they were now starting to return fire and he could see that a lot of the crimson tunics lying half in and out of the lapping water were men who had instinctively ducked to the ground and were now picking themselves up and levelling their carbines divots of soil began to erupt along the top of the trench devereau found himself ducking down like his men as the british organized their covering fire his men were now firing independently as they replaced their clips firing opportunistic shots in singles and doubles over the sandbags devereau chanced another long glance his head foolishly above the line of sandbags for another half a minute he speedcounted forty maybe fifty british casualties not bad for their opening salvo but that was the best chance they were ever going to get to even the numbers now the british were dispersed across the shingle making use of the new craters and the grooves and dents of old building foundations and exposed basements of the small ruined humps of corner walls little more than resilient piles of old masonry still managing to hold together after so many decades of punishment a shot whistled past his left ear he cursed and ducked back down again devereau reloaded his revolver struggling with shaking hands to slide each bullet successfully into its chamber their best their only tactic would be to hold the british there on the slope keep them from organizing a cohesive advance on the trench and try to whittle them down one lucky shot at a time pick out the officers first he knew the british soldiers would be doing exactly the same targeting the sergeants corporal captains lieutenants in an attempt to leave their opponents leaderless he chanced his head above the sandbags again and quickly aimed his revolver firing all six rounds at the bullshouldered figure of a bearded sergeant gesturing frantically at his men the ground spat six clouds of dust and the sergeant ducked lower in the dirt most probably thanking his lucky stars for devereaus poor aim he stepped back down again into the trench and reloaded his revolver this time with a steadier hand sir freemans voice what is it sergeant theyre groupin up for a push thirty yards left of the stack sir there was an oven smokestack midway along the landing area the last remnant of a brick factory that had been here half a century ago little more than a ring of bricks shoulderhigh devereau peeked over the top freeman was quite right he could see the tops of white pith helmets coalescing behind the stack waiting for the command and the command would be answered by an eager roar from the men getting to their feet and the percussive rattle of covering fire from further along the shingle with one hasty assessment he could see this first go at storming the borderline was probably going to be successful some of them were likely to make it into the trench and then it was going to be down to handtohand fighting fix bayonets he shouted the confederate soldier standing next to him nodded and passed the order on as he fumbled his bayonet out of its scabbard aim your fire at the officers as they come up he added pass it on he tucked his revolver back in its holster and pulled out his ceremonial sabre this is how this war was fought in the beginning he told himself muskets and sabres and nerves of steel ready for it sir asked the confederate devereau stroked his chin and nodded how about you the man slotted the bayonet home beneath the muzzlelock of his carbine reckon i see em like you do now we on the same side now sir he heard a chorus of voices from downhill the british troops hyping up their adrenaline the chanting of three huzzahs each louder than the last the third ending with a roar that peeled along the entire length of the landing area here they come fire at will screamed devereau southern and northern soldiers stepped up together as one their carbines thudding down on the sandbags a ragged line of several hundred wavering muzzles tipped with glinting bayonets a wall of muzzle flash and smoke erupted as they lay down a withering barrage of fire at the british as they sprinted up the slope chapter en route to new chelmsford what in the name of the lord are you doing sir cried lincoln im trying to flippin steer the bleedin thing liam had two control sticks to work with after zigzagging back and forth across the narrow main street spilling giant bales of feed from the trailer behind them liam had the gist of how the control sticks worked nearly the left stick controlled the large tractor wheel on the left and the right stick the right wheel to turn right for example he realized he had to pull back on the right and forward on the left to go straight forward both sticks forward by the time hed finally figured this out the small town of east farnham was behind them littered with the chaos damage and debris of liams learning curve the tractor rolled down the dirt road out of the town flanked on either side by orchards of plum trees jayzus we did it gasped liam lincoln and sal clung on uncomfortably to the bucket seat inside the drivers cabin bob was standing outside on the nowempty flatbed liam thrashed the tractor as fast as it would go little more than the speed of an asthmatic jogger for a half a mile before finally pulling over to one side of the dirt track five minutes later they were on the move again a great deal faster now that theyd detached the trailer so which way liam shouted above the din of the rattling engine bob pointed off the dirt track they were running along across a paddock full of what looked like eugenically modified shire horses that way hold on said liam pulling the left stick back a little the tractors gigantic fat wheels rolled effortlessly over a wooden picket fence and across the paddock scattering horses that seemed to stand almost as tall at the shoulder as indian elephants information fifteen miles one hundred and seventysix yards in this direction right said liam gripping both control sticks with whiteknuckled concentration ok fifteen miles the tractor was romping along now bouncing alarmingly on the uneven ground swerving every now and then to avoid the unpredictable panicked movements of the shire horses flocking alongside it whoa sal pointed through the cabins mudspattered windscreen mind the the tractor rolled over a long wooden feeding trough sending splinters of wood and cobs of maize into the air never mind said sal liam crashed out of the far side of the paddock and swerved right to avoid running into an open barn a moment later they were rolling across a courtyard crisscrossed with laundry lines watch out look kids several children playing amid fluttering bed sheets scattered in panic before them oh jayzus im sorry im sorry liam bellowed through the open side window as they rumbled out of the far side across someones vegetable garden and over a cheerfully coloured timber playhouse they were rolling across a vineyard a moment later flattening row after row of budding grapevines sal pointed out a long line of greenhouses nestled between rows of vines she noted the look of shock on an old mans face as he stood in the doorway watering can in one hand and pruning shears in the other the tractors huge wheels churned a lane of soil mere inches away from him and the fragile framework of timber and glass hey liam you actually managed to miss something his face was rigid with desperate concentration ive never driven anything before in me life branches of a vine thrashed against the windscreen smearing it with grape juice liam said sal he was squinting through the slime of juice and grime on the glass too focused on seeing through it all to take heed of sal liam what sal squeezed his shoulder gently maybe someone else should be driving instead huh good god yes barked lincoln holding his head where hed whacked it against the cabins low roof liam nodded uh ok yeah thats probably a good idea he eased both throttle sticks back slowly evenly to prevent the tractor lurching one way or the other finally it came to a rest the tractors idling engine grumbling irritably at the way it had just been treated bob leaned over liams shoulder recommendation i should drive this vehicle liam nodded eagerly slowly easing his vicelike grip of the throttle sticks uh yeah i think that might be best chapter new york devereau looked around him for the moment not facing an adversary the floor of the trench was already a squirming carpet of bodies the dying and the dead red grey and blue tunics tangled with each other more british were dropping down into the trench swinging the balance of numbers against devereaus men a hundred different oneonone duels becoming twoonone were going to lose this trench quickly down the trench he could see sergeant freeman parrying and lunging with calm machinelike certainty behind the man a british soldier was getting ready to spike freeman in the back devereau reached for his revolver raised aimed and fired it empty through the drifting smoke he saw the soldier drop and freeman turn to see the fate hed just narrowly escaped devereau waved to join him and freeman began to pick his way over the bodies roughly shoving a couple of struggling men to one side before finally joining him sir this trench is lost we need to sound a retreat to the horseshoe freeman nodded his opinion as well it seemed aye sir the sergeant was reaching for the signal whistle on a chain tucked into his breast pocket when devereau caught sight of new movement the rearmost lip of the trench was suddenly lined with figures aiming guns down at them he heard a voice give a command and at once the air was thick with clouds of gunsmoke and the deafening rattle of gunfire amid the elongated scrum of struggling men down the entire length of the borderline trench men in red tunics were flung back against the muddy wall clutching ragged wounds those british soldiers still standing as the gunfire started to falter and empty ammo clips pinged into the air began to disengage from their handtohand duels and scramble back over the lip of the trench to beat a retreat down the slope colonel wainwright dropped down beside him with a bloodrush roar he scrambled up the far side firing his revolver wildly at the withdrawing british troops reckless fool james get down volley fire from further down the slope brought wainwright to his senses as plumes of dirt erupted beside him he dropped back down with a whoop of excitement the rest of the men in the trench carried his whooping cry and turned it into a regimentwide jeer at the beaten redcoats gathering back down on the shingle taking cover in the relative safety of the craters behind the ruined stumps of wall by the riverside freeman spat the whistle out of his mouth grinned at devereau hell sir we showed em some fight didnt we sir yes we did that sergeant he looked at wainwright moving down among the men swinging his sabre in the air triumphantly see to our wounded sergeant he squeezed past freeman and a dozen other men lofting their helmets above them on the tips of their bayonets helmets back on you fools he shouted finally standing beside wainwright colonel i thought the plan was for you to remain in the horseshoe whatever happened here wainwright shrugged guiltily true but it would have been a shame to lose a trench so early in the battle would it not william devereaus scowl eased it would at that well it seems you came down at just the right moment they watched the british troops rallying down on the shingle regimental sharpshooters firing off sporadic rounds up at the borderline to keep them from daring to press their attack down on them fact is they have a toehold on this side now he added wainwright nodded we could charge them they are still disorganized we have the height and the element of surprise but not the numbers there are over a thousand men down there and we have just under six hundred not enough our best bet is digging in and holding fast like ticks on a dogs back both men watched the british over the top of their sandbags engineers were hastily detaching the landingraft sidepanels and assembling them on the shingle creating rudimentary fortifications for them to huddle behind their wounded were being dragged to the relative safety of covered positions to be treated by a field physician devereau marvelled at their discipline under fire so quickly efficiently turning a complete rout into entrenchment temporary defeat into consolidation good god its no wonder half of this world is under the union jack he stepped back down into the mud turned to see wainwright squatting and inspecting the collar pips on the uniform of a dead redcoat and theyre just a regular line regiment william not even elite troops devereau nodded there was worse yet to come then perhaps one of the notorious regiments the black watch the grenadier guards the kings guard you did it both colonels looked up to see maddy and becks standing on the lip of the trench best get down here maam said wainwright they have sharpshooters as he spoke a single shot whistled close by maddy scrambled down into the trench oh my god was that aimed at you devereau nodded sternly yes becks dropped down beside her maddy looked around at the bodies splayed along the bottom of the trench some still stirring moaning she glimpsed ragged wounds puckered pink flesh dark blood leaking spurting she could smell the burn of cordite in the air but beneath that the other smells of battle sweat vomit and the murmur of pitiful voices of dying men she felt ill lightheaded and queasy wainwright noticed how quickly we forget what war actually looks like maddy swallowed palefaced choking back her own urge to vomit i uh i came to find you she took a few deep breaths i sent another message through to make the rendezvous sooner how soon i cant say but we have a way of knowing when theyre there and the moment they arrive we can pick them up when asked devereau it could be any time she replied a grin flashed across his face wainwright shared it then the longer the british fool about down there on the beach the better it is for us indeed devereau turned to maddy he lowered his voice and the moment you send your colleagues back to what year was it this world will change pretty soon after yeah sometimes immediately sometimes a few hours it is impossible to accurately predict the arrival time of a reality wave after a timeline event alteration added becks but it would be soon maddy reassured them she glanced around quickly at the shifting carpet of bodies soon enough that you know you could stop this fighting as soon as ive sent them back you mean surrender wainwright and devereau shared a look i wonder would this time wave arrive soon enough for us to both escape the firing squad maddy shook her head i i cant say when it might even be a day or so then i think we are in agreement colonel wainwright that we would rather fight on until the moment this wave arrives wainwright nodded complete agreement colonel devereau maddy puffed air all right but she turned and pointed up the slope towards the horseshoe trench and beyond that to the very top of the hump of bricks in the shadow of the overhanging ruins of williamsburg bridge the antennae array that has got to be protected whatever happens do you understand if it gets damaged then this is all over then we shall keep the fight down there for as long as we can said wainwright what of my tank is its engine still running yeah its running weve got power and the displacement machine is charged up and ready to use so thats good so our business is waiting then said devereau maddy nodded i find i do a lot of that in this business you know waiting she half smiled kinda sucks chapter new york captain ewan mcmanus looked up at the sky the low combedout clouds above new york were a beautiful salmon pink from the lateafternoon sun another couple of hours and it was going to be dark colonel donohue had his officers gathered around him company captains lieutenants sergeants were up next gentlemen word is the lancashire rifles have wet their toes and got a firm foothold for us over there as you can see he turned round and gestured past the sappers putting the final pieces of their landing rafts together to the far side of the east river the uh mutineers have two lines of defence a trench works running parallel to the river from those factory buildings there on the left all the way along to the remnants of that bridge on the right behind that they have a bowshaped trench which seems to curve beneath the bridge i imagine they will be treating that as a secondary defence position mcmanus craned his neck along with all the other officers to get a better look beyond those two defence lines were into the old northern defence line as im sure youre already aware a confederate regiment virginians i believe the chaps that up until recently were holding the ground were standing on right now have mutinied along with a northern regiment so we find ourselves in the rather unusual position of having a temporary understanding with the french high command understanding sir colonel donohue nodded neither side really wants this nonsense to spread so the french are prepared to let us go in on their behalf and sterilize the wound so to speak thats very trusting of them called out someone a ripple of goodnatured laughter spread among them quite so he smiled and more fool them heads nodded although it was still officially supposed to be top secret every officer in every participating regiment was well aware this little uprising was a convenient opportunity for the british to launch their final push against the north in fact this futile act of rebellion couldnt have come at a better time for them the french were prepared to hold back while the british stepped in and crushed it not knowing their intention was to continue pushing on punching through their norths front line and rolling up their eastcoast flank captain mcmanus sir i think this might just be a splendid opportunity to fieldtest our dreadnoughts before the proper fighting begins dont you yes sir take your company ashore as support for them but id really like to see how well our experimentals perform on their own all right support only yes sir rest of you can follow in the second flotilla best not have too many of our chaps nearby when those monsters get a sniff of the enemy colonel donohue turned round again to look at the landing area on the far side of the river a low mist of gunsmoke hung above it like a membrane and every now and then a distant crackle of gunfire was accompanied by another faint plume of bluegrey smoke winking into existence and god help those poor souls when that happens chapter near new chelmsford bob how much further now bob eased back on the throttle sticks as the tractors big ridged wheels rolled down into a shallow river and splashed arcs of spray either side of them information two miles one hundred and seven yards from this location the tractor emerged from the river on the far side leaving two deep ridges carved in the wet mud of the riverbank two miles affirmative then stop right here bob did as instructed easing the throttles down to an idle disengaging the gears and pulling a braking lever he looked at liam why sal nodded yeah were nearly there thats exactly why said liam he turned and pointed out of the mudspattered rear window of the cabin weve left a trail a blind man could follow if there were any policemen or militia called to find this tractor it wont be difficult for them it was approaching dusk the sun was casting a rosehued glow and long cool shadows across the pastoral landscape around them far away to the right a small village nestled among sycamore trees and chimneys leaked threads of smoke into a peach sky if we drive all the way to the rendezvous point he continued we could be leading a posse of coppers or soldiers right to the window its two miles from here if we get running we could be there in what twenty minutes or so bob nodded this is a sensible tactical decision lincoln groaned and pointed at his old boots one of them was flapping open at the front where a seam in the leather had split long hairy toes waggled through a threadbare sock my feet are as spent as a paupers purse oh shaddyah you lazybones liam opened the cabin door and jumped out on to the riverbank come on its not far now bob dropped down heavily beside him correct not far sal pushed lincoln out in front of her well be there soon enough chapter new york maddy looked at the monitor in front of her another fuzzy lowresolution blocky image of what appeared to be a muddy field full of long wooden sheds she could see a few trees and a sky growing dark computerbob was sending a narrowthread signal to the rendezvous location briefly checking every ten minutes for any density fluctuations and grabbing a pinhole image of the location at the same time it was slowly eating into the full charge theyd had on the displacement machine of the twelve green chargeleds three of them were dark now another dozen glimpses and they were going to be eating into stored energy theyd need to get liam and the others back to and bring them home come on liam where the hell are you he could make out six more landing rafts slowly chugging their way across the river devereau watched with growing unease as the soldiers still holding a position on the shingle behind their panelbarriers began to edge away from the middle of the landing area where the six boats seemed to be heading towards james he said in the gathering gloom wainwright was somewhere nearby wainwright he heard wainwright make his way along the trench a hasty word of encouragement and a pat on the shoulder for each man he passed presently he was beside devereau what is it devereau pointed and handed him his field glasses reinforcements coming wainwright squinted into the lenses adjusting the focus as he panned up along the boxlike hull of one of them the protective panels were up hiding whatever troops were inside he thought he caught the bobbing of a head over the top some sort of movement from within he adjusted the binoculars on the flag fluttering lifelessly at the back of the craft beside the helmsmans position if i could just see the regimental banner i can tell his words faded what what is it wainwright lowered the glasses black watch devereau knew them one of the british armys very best regiments he puffed his cheeks and forced a smile well then we shall have a more evenhanded fight this time round wainwright shook his head warily no william his voice a whisper for devereaus ears alone this isnt good the black watch are the regiment they have been trialling experimental units with experimental units the haunted look on wainwrights face told him more than he wanted to hear good god you dont mean eugenics yes devereau turned to look back at the river the six highpanelsided rafts were nearly all the way across the sound of their motors chugging and spitting in the stillness that had settled over this contested patch of cratered and weedstrewn wasteland he stroked his beard absently insistently then we must be sure to concentrate all our fire on those rafts on whatever monsters are inside wainwright nodded because whatever creatures are in there if they get into the trench the men should know this he added agreed devereau cupped hands round his mouth listen men the soft murmur of voices along the trench a hundred different whispered conversations ceased the rafts approaching those vessels out there contain eugenic units hed expected a roar of panic perhaps even the clatter of weapons dropping and the first of his men clambering out of the trench and making a run for it instead he was met with absolute silence and several hundred grimeencrusted faces along the line of the trench turned his way faces absorbing the meaning of what hed just said understand we cannot afford to let these monsters reach us is this clear frozen faces frozen expressions mouths hanging open yet silence still is this clear sergeant freeman took the lead aye sir whatever creatures step down from those rafts we will kill every last one of them we will gun them down before they even step foot on the shingle some of the men cheered unconvincingly check your weapons check your ammo and make ready he turned to look back down at the river of the six landing rafts hed spotted approaching the two on the left and two on the right had pulled slightly ahead beaching themselves in the spaces between the first wave of vessels the middle two were holding back what are they up to the panels dropped on the four flanking rafts and british troops wasted no time spilling down the ramps into the water some of his men began firing an uncertain ripple of gunfire the middle two whatever monsters they have for us are in those hold your fire freeman and several other ncos carried the order up the line and the firing ceased the last thing they needed to be doing as the panels dropped on the last two rafts was swapping out empty cartridges the black watch waded quickly ashore and found the covered positions on the shingle vacated by the first wave of men devereau found himself getting impatient cursing at the panels to drop anxious to see what horrors the eugenologists back in britain had conjured out of the coded chemistry of nature he heard a british officer barking an order and then a moment later saw several dozen small round grenades tossed on to the shingle they began to hiss as they spewed thick mustardcoloured columns of smoke his first thought was that it was a poisoned gas but then the men down there were not wearing masks and surely they would have tossed their grenades up the slope towards the trench wainwright cursed another wretched smokescreen hold your aim shouted devereau well hear the splash fire on my command several moments passed in a prolonged agonizing silence as the yellow mist thickened and spread along the shingle effectively shrouding the middle two rafts beginning to hide the other rafts as well then he heard it the clank of latches being released in unison somewhere in the smoke and the first splash of a ramp landing in the water fire the entire length of the trench was fringed with a ribbon of greyblue cordite smoke carbines firing rapidly one shot after another several machine guns spitting muzzle flash and stuttering a steady stream of bullets all of them into the yellow mist above the cacophany of gunfire he could hear the rattle and clang of rounds impacting on metal and something heavy splashing into the water something big the yellow mist was slowly thinning and spreading drifting up the slope towards them hiding what was in there for longer than was fair he squinted into the yellow managing to just about pick out the stump of the brick smokestack the head and shoulders of a soldier holding aloft a regimental flag too foolishly confident to keep down while the volley fire was still going on the edge of the leftmost raft and looming above the battlefield the ghostly outline of the bridge then something darker much closer than anything else more defined as it scrambled uphill towards them god help us he whispered as it emerged out of the last curling skeins of mist rolling uphill chapter new york humanlike in that it had two arms and two legs but that was the end of any anthropomorphous resemblance it towered over them almost as tall as a doubledecker tram almost as wide as a house as it emerged from the smoke devereau noted that it seemed to have no head however where a ridge of muscle and bone linked one shoulder to the other there seemed to be nothing but the slightest bump with pinhole dots for eyes and a tube where a mouth might have been closer as it charged up the last dozen yards of the gentle slope the creature looked more like some sort of machine a mechanical automaton covered in linking plates of thick metal that clanked together noisily as it lumbered forward he realized his men had stopped firing like him they were frozen in a state of horrified fascination fire he screamed the sparks of impacting bullets showered the ground around it the giants loping run faltered and finally ceased its enormous arms flailed angrily and devereau saw beneath the overlapping plates of metal glimpses of pale grey flesh spattered with dark droplets of blood the leviathan stumbled one final step forward before finally flopping heavily down on to its knees and then still shedding a shower of sparks from the gunfire concentrated on it it slowly keeled over like a felled tree lying across the trench one thick arm flopping down into the trench and crushing a man my god it took our entire regiment to bring it down out of the smoke emerged eleven more this time only half the men managed to concentrate fire on them the other half were already having to eject and replace empty cartridges the giants were on them in mere seconds standing over the borderline trench one or two of them even standing astride it swinging their huge metalplated arms down into the trench works their fists the size of beer kegs were enclosed in a variety of different experimental attachments some of them had iron cages from which footlong spikes protruded a couple of them had blades that looked like devereaus sabre welded to iron bands round their three fingers like impossibly long claws one of them even had a rotating saw blade powered by a chugging engine strapped to the creatures upper arm the men standing beneath them stood no chance gunfire from further along the line resumed one of the confederate machinegun teams managed to bring a second of the creatures down concentrating their stuttering fire on its chest as it collapsed devereau got a closer glimpse of a small head almost completely recessed into the chest two small dark eyes a mere gash for a nose and a pipe emerging from where a mouth should be curling round under the left shoulder armour plate to a pair of cylinders strapped to its back ten of these things still ten sweeping their spiked and bladed fists into the trench dismembering crushing eviscerating every poor soul within easy reach theyre killing us wainwright nodded we should fall back he was right remaining here within range of their brutal bladed arms was utter madness the trench was already lost at least with more open ground to cross to reach the horseshoe trench there was a chance the men deployed there could bring down a few more of them fall back devereau cried his voice lost amid the cacophony of screams metal on metal the clatter of guns the pebbledash clang of bullets sparking off iron plates he tried again cupping his mouth fall back the horseshoe added wainwright a bugle sounded the retreat and those men still alive still with arms and legs began to scramble out of the trench like startled crows from a field whats happening out there becks i will observe she said heading towards the shutter door from the distant noises maddy could hear it sounded like the british were trying their luck again on that first trench but this time round the nature of the battle sounded different less gunfire more voices shed heard the regiments bugler sound some signal she had no clue what that meant but could guess it probably wasnt good news oh god theyre coming she uttered she realized her whole body was trembling she hated the sound of her voice shrill and warbling like a little girl like a child why am i such a freakin dork she envied the colonels both of them cut from the same cloth leatherfaced veterans with the very same manner a dignified calm about them a gentlemanly formality what the british called a stiff upper lip and here i am trembling like some pampered chihuahua on a park bench bob do another probe maddy the last one was only seven minutes ago i know i know do it anyway information if we increase the number of times that we check for them we will drain the stored energy more quickly jesus i know that already just do it affirmative activating density probe becks squeezed past the entrance to the machinegun bunker and into the horseshoe trench that looped around the archway the men lining the dirt wall reinforced with sandbags and slats of wood waiting for the battle to reach them looked at her with bemusement it aint safe out here miss said one of them best get back inside i will be fine said becks shrugging off the comment thank you for your concern she found a space between two soldiers and stepped up on an ammo crate to get a look over the rim of the trench the rubblestrewn ground sloping down to the borderline was thick with men staggering uphill towards them many of them bloody beyond them she could see a pall of thinning yellow mist over the front trench and other men spilling out of it she could see several large silhouettes looming over the trench she counted nine of them what are those she asked the man beside her mmonsters called up from hell itself by them british they genics maam said the other grown from blood an body parts the man shook his head at the other aint no devils or demons from no hell thas all jus voodoo crock he sighed worse than that anyhow its nature all messed up in a way it shouldna be she nodded guessing what the soldier was saying genetically engineered units the first of the retreating men flopped down into the horseshoe further along wideeyed and gasping for breath jesus you cant yyou cant do nothin cant do nothin to stop them others collapsed over the edge and rolled down into the mud beside him they genics goddamn british is usin genics on us again she could recognize fear spreading among the men spreading like flames across a summerdry field of wheat these soldiers are exhibiting extreme stress reactions she calculated their ability to fight as severely impaired in fact she was almost certain by the looks on their faces that this defensive position was in danger of being abandoned she took a step up on to an ammo box so that she was standing head and shoulders above them attention she barked loudly faces pale and bloodspattered turned towards her information the large units ahead of us are genetically engineered combat units they are designed to withstand significant damage but they can be terminated theyre demons we cant beat what the devil sends no goddammit she shes right shouted one of the bloodied men we got us two of em i think i saw two of em go down concentrate your fire specifically on vulnerable locations said becks the circulatory system the nervous system chest and head she looked down at them sternly is this clear the men eyed her silently a single correctly targeted projectile will kill these units you will concentrate your fire on heads and chests she turned to look down the slope and saw devereau and wainwright staggering towards them she pointed at them look your commanding officers they will confirm what i have just said they huffed up towards them gasping wheezing among the last of the men making their way back from the borderline devereau spotted her standing out in the open what the hell are you doing woman get down she ignored his outburst as both men clambered over the sandbags and flopped to the ground beside her devereau stood up panting almost doubling over to get his breath i am quite fine she said to him you must sit down and recover now she reached out for him and wainwright and pushed them down until they were squatting on the floor wheezing for air she knelt down beside them rest your soldiers will need you to be combatready wainwright looked up slumped beside devereau against the dirt wall did you say combatready he wheezed affirmative he turned to look at devereau and managed a grin what a he huffed and panted what a remarkable young lady this one is uh devereau nodded a real trooper chapter new chelmsford information the rendezvous location is two hundred and fiftyseven yards ahead of us liam stared over the wooden fence at the muddy field beyond youre joking maddy chose a pig farm bob shook his head i am not making a joke at this time she must really hate us sal was almost retching from the overpowering odour of pig manure they are filthy animals its just mud and some pigs come on he pulled himself over the fence and landed with a glutinous splat on the other side ah now its a bit deeper than i thought the others clambered over one by one and joined him sal last muttering under her breath with each sinking step through the foulsmelling mud by the failing light of dusk they could see that the pigs in the field seemed to be congregated in a far corner feeding time presumably or perhaps it was some porcine social event going on which direction bob bob pointed a finger towards a space between two long and low pig huts liam led the way squelching until they hit some drier firmer ground i am detecting particles shes probing for us said liam hurry she needs to know were here he sprinted forward into the gloom towards the space between the huts finally there he jumped up and down and flapped his arms about this it he called back to bob am i in the right place affirmative what on earth is the fool doing now asked lincoln shaking his foot free of slop motion said sal hes trying to register on their density probe they joined him between the huts a moment later as the last rays of waning light from the sun faded beyond a horizon of gently rolling hills hey yoohoo were here maddy liam hopped excitedly come get us bob cocked an eyebrow you are aware she cannot hear us liam i know im just he grinned sheepishly im just ready to go home is all lincoln sat down on the edge of a water trough undid the laces of his boots and took them off he picked up one and began shaking out the gunk that had got inside it so we shall be returning to the year of sal nodded taking you back home mr lincoln i see he grunted there seemed to be a shade of disappointment in that it will be an odd thing returning to new orleans returning to work as a flatboat crewman she picked up his other boot and with a stalk of hay began digging at and flicking out the mud but that is not what youre going back to is it she offered him a friendly smile not any more right he looked up at her you are talking about this destiny you say i have yes i was a poorly educated woodsman with no money before all of this this misadventure when i return i shall still be a poorly educated woodsman with no money but one that is now smelling of pigs no she grasped his hand no abraham you have seen what i have seen right their eyes met for a moment this is all wrong she whispered this world and and those poor creatures intelligent creatures treated like objects machines tools your country fighting itself for over a century for what for other countries goals you you are the reason all of this has happened and only i can change that she nodded what am i he sighed but a penniless vagrant how am i to find my way from that to president you managed to do it said sal she frowned or will manage to do it after all you are quite stubborn arent you and quite rude so you are added liam thats always a help and she said squeezing his hand you know what the right thing to do is the right course to take with your life no one normally has the luxury of knowing which way their life should go you have acquired privileged knowledge of your future said bob this is a tactical advantage that you will be able to use to he stopped talking and held an arm out liam you should step back i am detecting particles liam sat down on the trough beside lincoln and not everyone gets to see all that youve seen mr lincoln and still get to go back to live their lives he shrugged sadly me and sal dont have that she nodded this is what we do now this is what well always do i suppose in front of them a portion of the darkening blue sky dotted with the first early stars began to tremble and squirm oh look said liam brightening heres our lift home chapter new york maddy could hear the fighting had resumed this time the crack and rattle of gunfire was much closer she was worried that something or someone would knock or damage the antennae array above it would take just one stray bullet thats all just one then this effort the sacrifice the bodies shed seen lying side by side like sardines in a tin all of that would have been for nothing becks was outside fighting alongside the men she could imagine the support unit was quite at home content covered in blood and mud doing what she did best she heard someone bellowing orders devereau she guessed followed by the deep throbbing burr of one of their heavy machine guns she turned to look out of the entrance she could see boots and drooping belts of ammo beneath the shutter the machinegun teams emerging from the fort and redeploying along the horseshoe its getting real close both colonels had insisted the three machinegun teams would be the last line of defence the fort would be their alamo clearly these plans were now fluid oh crud get a move on liam for gods maddy what the density probe has just picked up some movement repetitive not random correct grab an image affirmative she saw the lightmeter on the displacement machine flicker as energy was discharged despatched along the heavyduty insulated cables up through the jagged hole in the roof to be targeted by the array outside spacetime being discreetly teased open an unfathomable spatial dimension punctured with a pin hole she watched the monitor on the right as a blocky lowresolution image appeared the same image as last time a muddy field some sort of low hut a darkening sky but this time she could just about make out the blurred silhouette of some stupid fool caught midair doing star jumps liam thats them affirmative activate the window yes do it the lightmeter bars of leds like a graphic equalizer fluttered excitedly with the sudden expenditure of accrued energy two remote windows being opened simultaneously one a hundred miles south of here another in new orleans that was going to drain their charge completely the rest then was going to be up to them she listened to the displacement machines circuitry hum saw the green charge display silently wink to red one light after the other and the rest was going to be just waiting and hoping yet again another of the leviathans slowly collapsed to its knees the thick armour plating over its chest misshapen and twisted under the battering of a steady sputtering stream of highcalibre rounds blood was pouring down its front from numerous ragged wounds it flailed its huge bladetipped fists pitifully angrily got us another one roared sergeant freeman punching the air come along here this is good right here wainwright waved the other machinegun teams into position against the trench wall fire on those eugenics upper chest area there are gaps in the armour do you see devereau was studying the slope below illuminated now by crimson flares being shot into the night sky from their landing raft bathing the whole mudchurned and cratered battlefield with a flickering bloodred light beyond the six remaining eugenics clanking slowly uphill bearing the weight of their armour surely several tons of it each he guessed british soldiers were amassing in the borderline he could see officers moving among knots of men poised to step over the top and support the eugenics with a rush and there sitting astride sandbags a british officer calmly observing the events uphill from him through a pair of field glasses chapter new york becks watched with detached fascination at the brutal ruthlessness of these enormous beasts their arms swung tirelessly scooping out of the trench and into the air bloody parts of men and divots of dirt alike there were no moments of hesitation no doubts no confusion of morals or ethics as much thought devoted to the process of killing as an electric bandsaw might give to a plank of wood she could identify with that a world simplified down to the barest essentials to mission parameters and thats where her empathy her sense of kindredspirit with these curious monsters ended she too had her own mission parameters to fulfil one of the machinegun teams lay in tatters just beyond the nearest leviathan the thick barrel of the gun still smoking and aimed skyward on its tripod legs she ducked down low scrambling over the writhing bodies of the wounded between the giants thick legs at the same time that the genic sensed her movement below it she reached the machine gun pulled it off its mount and swung its aim up no armour plating beneath it the highcalibre bullets found plenty of soft flesh to rip through the genic flailed enraged the feedpipe that protruded from its small face flapping from side to side she heard a deep moan coming from its chest its throat a cry of rage and agony locked behind a sealed mouth the guns stuttering fire ceased as the overheated barrel choked on the ammunition belt but shed done enough damage blood rained down on her as the leviathan took several staggered steps finally flopping on to the downhill side of the trench she felt the ground vibrate with the impact of several tons of iron and flesh as another fresh flare exploded above the trench bathing them in an artificial crimson dawn she took in the state of play of the battle with one snapshot blink of her eyes two eugenics remained the last of them wreaking havoc further along the horseshoe she saw arcs of dirt and glistening wet viscera spinning up into the night sky the few men not maimed dismembered or dying were beginning to break and scramble out of the trench and run for their lives and two hundred yards downhill of all this the british soldiers were now advancing in three ordered and steady lines on their position colonel devereau was up and out of the trench attempting to rally the fleeing men wainwright was busy firing a carbine down the slope at the advancing british their bunker of sandbags and piled dirt the fort their last line of defence right outside the archway was sitting empty a mistake devereau she yelled her voice she chose a slightly deeper register than a normal human female almost masculine though not quite carried across the noise of battle devereau looked her way she pointed towards the fort and tossed the machine gun out of the trench towards him you must redeploy this in your final defensive position she bellowed devereau nodded a last stand from the fort perhaps that was already his intention with the half a dozen men hed managed to stop from running away the heavy machine gun and several yards of belted ammunition lying on the ground would help there were a few other men still alive in the trench gathered around another silent smoking machine gun trapped between the two leviathans cowering from the sweeping arc of gorecovered spikes and the growling spinning blade of the motorized circularsaw blade assessment heavy machine gun tactical value high acquiring a second heavy machine gun to fire out from their final position was worth the calculated hazard she pulled a sabre from the hands of one of the dead she vaguely recognized the mans dark face the grey flecks of coiled hair the beard his glazed sightless eyes gave her permission to take it and make good use of it becks pulled herself up out of the trench and began to make her way towards the last two leviathans skipping along the stacked sandbags like they were stepping stones across a babbling brook finally within striking range of the nearest of them she pulled the sabre back and using every fibre of muscle in her body to execute a low sweeping roundhouse blow the blade arced round biting through the coarse hidelike skin the muscle and bone of the creatures shin as thick as a human torso the bare foot a yard long with flexing toes as big as cooking apples flopped into the trench like a side of beef the genic missing everything beneath the cut lost its balance and fell over the thick plates of iron armour scraping and clanking as if a dumper truck had emptied a full load of salvaged metal on to a scrapheap already exhausted under the burden of its armour the leviathan struggled like an elephant with a broken spine desperate to right itself once more becks appeared over its small head looking down at two beady black eyes moist glistening by the light of the descending flare above them its eyes without whites looked as expressionless and void as the eyes of some giant insect and yet the glistening moisture around them tears she processed that observation in the few nanoseconds of a single computer cycle tears of anger she wondered or was it relief the spidereyes slowly closed as if knowing accepting even what was coming she thrust the sword down into the soft flesh beneath its feedpipe and the genic lurched giant ribbons of muscle all over its body flexing one last time then it sagged quite dead she turned in time to see the last leviathan collapse finally weakened from the blood loss of dozens of gunshot wounds again she eyesnapped an overall appraisal of the battlefield the british were only a hundred yards downhill she estimated no more than a couple of dozen men left alive in the horseshoe trench some of them firing sporadic opportunistic shots down the slope most frozen in shock and behind them out of the trench rushing past the stillchugging tank fifty sixty men fleeing limping scrambling for the distant safety of the ruins of brooklyn devereau seemed to have gathered a kernel of a dozen men most looking too badly wounded to make a run for it anyway they had the heavy machine gun at least wainwright joined her nodded at devereau herding the men towards the fort we must buy them enough time to set up the gun in there cried wainwright affirmative she pointed to the few other men along the trench i will delay the enemy order these men to redeploy in the fort and the archway this must be protected for as long as possible wainwright nodded he picked his way along the trench and started tapping the remaining few on their shoulders gesturing towards the archway becks stepped forward reached down for the stillsmoking heavy machine gun and hefted it up off its tripod with casual strength to rest it on her hip she aimed it downhill at the british now only fifty yards from her and began to fire chapter new orleans abraham lincoln stared at the street in front of him early evening it was busy with dock workers finishing for the day trappers and traders stowing bales of beaver pelts and indianfriendly trade goods aboard their flatboats raucous voices exchanged greetings and farewells in pidgin english and french the street clattering with the sound of metalrimmed cartwheels and shoed horses across the rutted dirt thoroughfare was the inn the very same inn hed squandered the last of his money drowning his woes in the bottom of a tankard it seemed to him to be more than a lifetime ago that hed staggered out on to that porch i am where you first found me he said sal nodded and this is where you have to be new orleans he smiled it seems to me to be a much smaller place now i guess so she looked up at him after all that you and me have seen i suppose it must do he laughed and what incredible things i shall im sure be the victim of sleepless nights until my dying day it must remain secret all of it she said you know you cant tell anyone about any of those things that happened if i am to one day be a president young lady i would be a fool talking of flying ships and animals that speak and machines that transport a person through time i would never stand a chance of being elected the people in this new country would not tolerate a deranged lunatic for a leader sal shrugged well lincoln scratched at his dark beard but i shall caution any man who will listen to me that this country will not prosper unless it is a united one he looked at her that at least is something i am permitted to say she looked at liam he was talking quietly with bob a few yards away she turned back to lincoln and shrugged i think you were always destined to say something like that anyway at least now you know why america cant go splitting itself up into pieces right they watched a portly businessman and his wife cross the street followed by several slaves carrying their baggage between them a small black boy tagged along in their wake barefooted and wearing little more than threads of clothing the last item in a procession of one mans property she found herself thinking of samuel looked up at lincolns dark hooded eyes and suspected he was thinking the same i believe there is much in this time to put right muttered lincoln before we can be the nation our forefathers dreamed of it was right then they heard the first sound of thundering hooves approaching cries of warning from further up the street the crash of barrels of whisky and ale rolling off the back of the runaway cart and thudding on to the hard dirt strip the spray of yeastexcited foam through split kegs liam and bob joined them standing back from the thoroughfare as the cart approached six wildeyed horses careened in a manic zigzag towards them they roared past shedding more barrels from the back of the cart in their wake they watched the horses and cart weave uncontrolled through the congestion ahead until finally the cart rocked over and shed the last of its load one of the cartwheels collapsed under the burden splinters of wood and shattered spokes arced into the sky a twisted metal wheel rim spun off on its own tangent they watched the cart still dragged along on its axle by the panicking horses until it was lost from sight the cart that killed you said liam he cheerfully patted lincolns back well not this time anyway mr lincoln bob nudged liam remember the secondary objective his voice rumbled quietly liam nodded he offered lincoln his hand been a pleasure to meet a future president so it has lincoln nodded and grasped his hand firmly i shall endeavour to do my best mr oconnor good lord willing youll do your country proud he smiled i know you will bob leaned forward secondary objective right right he looked at sal we have to go something else we need to take a look at he shook lincolns hand and smiled look after yourself mr lincoln i will that sir sal liam gestured up the street we need to check that out right now she nodded ill catch up a final farewell from liam and a terse nod from bob and they were striding swiftly up powder street following the trail of chaos to find its cause sal and lincoln looked at each other its been a funny old week hasnt it she said the tall young mans laugh sounded like a growl to say the very least maam you know she started knowing it was wrong to say much more to him certainly wrong to warn him of the grim fate that awaited him only days after the norths victory never mind lincoln cocked a brow curious what you were about to tell me something she shrugged just that that your face ends up on the fivedollar bill she smiled how cools that fivedollar bill lincoln looked surprised theyll have paper money of such value he shook his head amused by that sal glanced up the street she could still see liam and bob she didnt want to lose them though i have to go now she said so should you indeed she reached out grasped his hand and squeezed good luck ill look you up on the net and read all about you when we get back home she offered him a little wave turned away and then jogged up the street towards the other two lincoln watched the three of them go until they finally disappeared among the growing crowd of people filling the street curious to see what had caused all the commotion well then mr lincoln what now he looked down at his mudspattered trousers and flapping boots and decided that whatever his future his destiny was he stood a better chance of realizing it not smelling of pig poo he strode towards the quayside and the sedate mississippi river a glistening mirrorsmooth surface that reflected the setting sun chapter new york captain mcmanus walked slowly down the curved trench stepping as best he could on dirt and not on the limbs torsos faces of dead men these chaps even mutineers deserved better he held the white flag above him a handkerchief tied to the tip of a bayonet in his other hand he carried a lantern to be sure that the men huddled inside the bunker at the end of this long curved trench could clearly see his approach the bunker was little more than a mound of piled dirt and sandbags over a framework of wooden beams something clearly erected in haste by these men it stood in the looming shadow of an enormous bridge support alongside something else another hump like an eskimos igloo but made of tumbledown bricks instead of blocks of ice why here why a last stand right out here in this godforsaken wasteland it would have made far more sense setting up a defensive position in among the ruins of the factory buildings on the far side fighting passage by passage room by room his men would have taken a heavy toll reclaiming the ruins from them instead they chose this open ground it made no sense he stepped past a thick cluster of bodies many of them british he stopped for a moment to study the body in the middle a woman he shook his head through his field glasses he had seen her earlier the young woman had held the entire regiment at bay for the best part of five minutes handling an armitage amp burton gatling gun on her own firing from her hip no less firing until the thing had eventually overheated and jammed then fighting with her bare hands until finally she too had gone down good god he wanted to crouch down and get a closer look at her that could wait a matter to resolve first im approaching under a white flag he called out you chaps in the bunker can you see it stop right where you are a voice replied we can hear you well enough from there mcmanus nodded planted the bayonet in the dirt beside him placed the lantern beside it right then im sure you know why im here shall we call it a day gentlemen devereau turned to wainwright he was slumped on the dirt floor between two other wounded men clutching his side a shot had winged him as hed tried to provide some covering fire for becks one side of his grey tunic was black with blood theyre asking for terms james wainwright laughed wearily tell him were not in the mood to take prisoners devereau grinned he was about to turn round and repeat that for the british officers benefit but caught sight of the silhouette of maddy crouching in the entrance to the archway the faint glow of light coming from the row of computer monitors spilled across the concrete floor littered with the wounded and dying she glanced to her left at the british officer thirty forty feet along the trench then quickly scooted across the gap between her archway and the low duckdown entrance to the fort she hunched to scramble inside and joined devereau looking out through the firing slit at the british officer and his white flag you should surrender she whispered its done he looked at her your machine it has returned this lincoln to his correct time yes theres really no need for any more bloodshed tonight called out the british officer and when will this reality change whispered devereau maddy shook her head soon i cant say exactly when but soon do you have wounded men in there said the officer i can assure you your wounded will be taken care of your enlisted men junior officers ncos all will be treated humanely as prisoners of war you have my word for gods sake what are you waiting for asked maddy wainwright moaned softly william we should let our boys go devereau cupped his hands round his mouth will the confederate men be treated the same as the northerners a pause i offer you my guarantee none of the enlisted men no junior officer will face a court martial they will all be treated as prisoners of war devereau turned round to wainwright you hear that wainwright nodded smiled then it seems just you and i will face the firing squad thats better than wed expected he nodded accepting that gratefully but she looked at both men from one to the other but thatll take days weeks right a hearing a court martial that stuff takes time to organize look the new reality is coming i promise you it could come at any time now in five minutes five hours the soldiers in the small machinegun nest looked on in confusion at the exchange or perhaps never devereau shrugged that is a possibility isnt it she shook her head no i promise you this will all change come along gentlemen called the officer ill offer these terms one last time surrender she pleaded please just do it surrender its ok now things will be fixed i promise you let me ask you something miss carter what if i had died in this fight would this new reality still create a new me yes of course devereau glanced at wainwright both men shared a smile a silent agreement he turned back to the firing slit cupping his hands again all right you have it my men are coming out we are surrendering chapter new york dammit maddy glanced back over her shoulder at the hump of the archway i need to be there i need to be back inside she trudged along the bottom of the muddy trench along with the other soldiers her arms on her head as instructed british soldiers stood on top of the sandbags either side looking down at the defeated defenders she kept her eyes on the back of the man in front of her not daring to look up at them not daring to meet any soldiers eyes she did though glance once more over her shoulder i need to be inside when it comes if and when the time wave came standing out here beyond the protective reach of the archways forcefield she was almost certainly going to find herself merged with the reformed ground or welded in a ghastly and fatal way with a brick wall or a trash can or something thirty yards along the trench where some sandbags had collapsed into a small mound at the bottom was an easy step up out physicians and orderlies from the british regiment offered a helping hand to the wounded and maddy accepted a hand that pulled her up over the lip of the trench she muttered a muted thank you above her the sky was filled with the giant airships shed seen earlier today offloading troops over manhattan their spotlights flickered across the wasteland bathing it in dancing pools of brilliant white she could hear the rhythmic chugging of that old rustbucket tank still going reliable old thing faintly coughing and spluttering across the deathlystill battlefield the cratered wasteland was littered with bodies many of them stirring ever so slightly the orderlies were moving among them looking for triage cases to treat every now and then a solitary shot rang out battlefield mercy for those too far gone to save shed not seen becks for a while not since the density probe had picked up on liam and the others how long ago was that ten minutes half an hour she realized her mind was dulled with shock perception rendered unreliable as if she was stepping sluggishly through a dream becks she whispered to herself saying her name aloud triggered something she never thought shed actually feel for a support unit concern she always laughed at liams fondness for both bob and becks and now here she was actually worried she might just come across her corpse on the ground captain mcmanus regarded both american officers slumped beside each other against the earth works and sandbags inside their bunker he squatted just outside their low entrance he nodded slowly all right then he said finally if thats what you gentlemen want the northern colonel offered him a grim smile it is captain mcmanus pursed his lips nodded once more and stood up they were quite right of course neither of these two gentlemen were going to escape a firing squad for this act of rebellion examples would need to be made of them this way the way they wanted it would save them the misery of a few hours of waiting agonizing and the dishonour of being stripped of their rank insignia before being marched out into a courtyard at daybreak he saluted them both then stepped away from the entrance to give them a little privacy he turned to look at the soft paleblue light leaking out from beneath a halflowered metal shutter to his right he wandered over towards the shutter door and ducked down to look under it he could see a cracked and uneven concrete floor littered with badly wounded men many of them it was obvious werent going to survive their injuries long a lot of them were already dead he decided he should get an orderly in here as soon as there was one spare he sighed at the appalling mess and ruin battle made of such frail things as human bodies particularly the damage done by those experimentals the injuries spread out in front of him were quite horrific he was actually quite relieved the entire test batch of twelve had been killed theyd looked like they were out of control his own men would most probably have had to gun them down his eyes drifted up to the curious source of the soft glow of blue light a row of rectangular screens that flickered blurred images and bright colours he squinted curiously now what the devil is all this so devereau flipped open his holster and pulled out his revolver that went well i thought wainwright chuckled burbling blood from his mouth indeed he watched devereau absently stroke the handle of his gun tell me william do you really believe there are other might have been worlds out there or have we been led a merry dance by this girl i cant say you saw as much as i all those pictures he smiled i think i do believe her wainwright nodded it would be quite something if it is true maybe you and i will wake up in that world after we leave this perhaps wainwright reached for his own sidearm groaning with the effort of moving he laughed whats so amusing five years ago i think it was one of my sharpshooters called in to say he had a clear shot on you had a clear headshot and wanted to take it and what did you tell him i said no obviously why wainwright wheezed a sigh wish i could remember i dont know it felt unsporting devereau shook his head unsporting he laughed at that wainwright joined him groaning with pain as his body shook you know bill i have a feeling our broadcast signal our calltoarms to the other regiments was blocked somehow he winced took a deep breath i do believe our mutiny would have spread if only word had got out i cant believe it is only us only our two regiments that wanted an end to this ridiculous war nor i devereau buttoned his collar up carefully straightened the peak of his forage cap ah well we gave it a darned good try did we not colonel wainwright that we most certainly did chapter new orleans the trail of chaos led a quarter of a mile up powder street battered and split wooden kegs spilling liquor on to the ground and penniless vagrants clustered around each one eagerly filling their cupped hands they passed a woman with a broken leg howling for a physician an overturned bakers wagon that had spilled loaves across the track and a trappers bundle of beaver pelts and deer hides scattered across the way ruined and torn by hooves and wheel rims before finally finding themselves looking into the gated courtyard and stables of a brewery the cart came from here said bob a crowd of brewery workers had been drawn out to the courtyard from inside a twostorey brick building and were gathered around something they could see workers turning away ashenfaced doubling over and retching a woman screamed and ran from the courtyard past them excuse me miss what just happened asked sal the woman shook her head and gabbled something about the devils work then she was gone hurrying away as fast as her feet could carry her this is the contamination event said bob aye come on we should go and have a look they crossed the courtyard heading towards brickbuilt stables they could hear the horses inside distressed the clattering of circling restless hooves snorting and lowing behind the stable doors the crowd of people were gathered around something on the ground among the babble of frightened voices sal could hear snippets of whispered words witchcraft work of the devil a man with a loud voice was busy castigating the brewery workers on the evils of drink and that this was gods warning to them this was gods punishment they pushed their way through the crowd to get a better look not difficult since the gathered crowd was reluctant to draw any closer to what it was on the ground that had drawn them round finally liam bob and sal could see for themselves what it was the cause of the disturbance the cause of the runaway brewery cart liam stopped where he stood queasily covering his mouth with a hand jayzusmarynjoseph sal took another step closer and squatted down beside it dont touch it screamed one of the crowd of people it is a creation of evil a demon she ignored the warning and reached one hand out carefully towards it the monstrosity if she could believe in things supernatural then a creation of evil sounded like the perfect description for this pitiful ruin of a creature lying on the ground amid its own blood steaming offal and twisted sinews is that a person or something she whispered it was as if a slaughterhouse had dumped a days worth of offcuts and refuse into the courtyard amid the glistening purple and bloody gristle she could see the hindquarters of a horse still flexing weakly kicking spasmodically but worse still the stuff that she was sure would fuel a lifetime of future nightmares for her the bloodspattered head shoulders and upper torso of a man welded to the flanks of the same horse or perhaps it was a second horse as if god had decided to construct a centaur and in a moment of frustration and irritation had given up and hurled the failed mess down to earth her hand gently touched the dead mans head his eyes flickered open chapter new york maddy and the other prisoners were seated on the ground fifty yards away from the horseshoe trench guarded by only a handful of british soldiers it was clear to them that there was no fight left in the small ragged huddle of union and confederate soldiers she watched them processing the bodies of their own first checking for signs of life before pulling regimental collar tags from their necks and carrying the corpses down towards the rivers edge where they were being loaded aboard the landing rafts she noticed nearby a particularly dense mound of bodies with crimson tunics busy with orderlies squatting among them feeling for signs of life and there as a body was disentangled and carried away by a couple of them she saw becks she got to her feet and started to pick her way across the battlefield hey miss sit back down shouted one of the british soldiers guarding them maddy ignored him drawn to the pale face staring up through its own nest of bodies she pushed her way past an orderly and squatted down on the ground beside beckss cold still face dark blood caked the right side of her face trickling down from a gunshot wound to her temple becks the orderly a young man with freckles and jutting ears looked at her sympathetically you know this woman miss she said nothing by the look of it whoever she was she put up one hell of a fight his voice sounded far away she barely heard it instead she gazed curiously at the spatter of a tear on beckss left cheek for a moment wondering whether a support unit could actually cry then she realized it was one of her own she wiped her eyes beneath her glasses and sniffed im crying for a freakin meat robot she scowled angry with herself for being so pathetic and weak its a machine a tool thats all you moron becks she whispered becks im so sorry sorry for what sorry that i never bothered to get to know you like liam did maybe maybe she was sorry about that but then again wasnt it better not to treat these things as human as friends im sorry she whispered again stroking one of beckss dark eyebrows the one shed made a habit of raising every time she had a question she wanted to ask she was vaguely aware that the orderly was remonstrating with the guard whod come after her to give her some space that she wasnt about to run anywhere escape becks im sorry that we never just you know never just talked like liam did like sal did both of them quite comfortable with the idea of hanging out with bob and becks as if they were just like them human she traced a line down beckss cold cheek quite dead beneath the bodies lying across her were injuries she didnt need to see didnt want to see obviously too much catastrophic damage at once for her bodys selfrepair system to cope with the raised voices in the background were a million miles away muted some other place this moment was hers alone a chance to say goodbye her own time and space but the voices increased in number and raised in pitch and urgency voices all around her good god what is that she looked up at the orderly and the soldier both now silently staring into the sky the other orderlies too gazing openmouthed at the night sky above manhattan curious she turned to look in the same direction a horizon that twisted undulated a liquid reality of impossible possibilities the time wave everyone every soldier every officer every prisoner was now frozen in place looking at the roiling sky bewildered transfixed frightened and dumbstruck maddy youve got to move you have to be inside you have to be protected she looked towards the archway she could see orderlies stepping out of the shutter entrance to see what the commotion was all about run maddy run she was about to get to her feet when she suddenly realized she couldnt leave beckss body there that message locked away inside the support units mind there was a way to retrieve it and the memories that would preserve who she was a way to do it liam once did it for bob her chip she looked around found a carbine with a bayonet fixed to the end she reached for it expecting the guard or the orderly to bark a warning at her instead their eyes and everyone elses were locked on the sky panicking fumbling she tried to get the bayonet off tugging at it with a growing frustration how does it come off she tried twisting it and the fixing unlocked with a dull scrape she wrenched it off the barrel dropped the carbine and looked down at becks do it she would have to thrust the tip of the blade into her skull and dig around inside for that silicon wafer not much bigger than a memory stick a sim card she pressed the bayonets tip against beckss forehead just above her brow line do it now she tried to push down but couldnt if you cant do it then take the head take the whole head she moved the tip down to the soft flesh beneath her jawline cut cut cut i cant i cant she whimpered under her breath she looked up the time wave had rolled in from the atlantic and was now twisting and contorting manhattan like clay on a potters wheel moulded and remoulded like molten wax in a lava lamp and now it was crossing the east river maddy closed her eyes gritted her teeth and did what needed to be done then she got to her feet and started to run her feet slapped the ground noisily as she pushed her way past men staring listlessly up at the approaching wave so quiet so perfectly still just the sound of her panting breath her feet on rubble and a deep deep rumble that sounded like the earth itself was preparing to split open she dropped down into the trench slipping and falling in the bloodsoaked dirt on to her hands and knees she scrambled to her feet pounding down the last dozen yards past a young british officer who barely seemed to notice her his eyes glazed with wonder good lord quite beautiful she heard him whisper as she brushed past him past a pair of orderlies carrying a loaded stretcher between them like everyone else standing utterly motionless transfixed their task for the moment completely forgotten maddy reached the crumbling archway and cast a quick glance back at the sky the front of the reality wave was across the east river taking the armada of landing rafts and turning them into a million different things viking longboats roman triremes spanish galleons sea monsters she ducked under the shutter the floor was still littered with bodies a few of them barely alive and moaning deliriously from gunshot and bayonet wounds hands reaching up to her pleading for water across the archway she could see the computer system was still up and running that tank that beautiful old reliable mark iv rustbucket from an older time of this endless war was still running still feeding the archway with power bob she screamed as she picked her way over the splayed limbs of the dead and wounded men she saw a dialogue box appear on one of the screens although she was too far away to read the response its maddy she gasped activate a field now she collapsed against the computer desk gasping wheezing close enough now to read computerbobs response information insufficient power to include the entire field office then then do it just around me the cursor began to shift across the dialogue box caution there will be obstructions within the radius of course the archway had dropped by several feet in the air bob a portal midair i need to jump into it as the time wave arrives for a full second perhaps two the cursor blinked without a response then finally began to jitter to the right affirmative outside the shutter she saw loose dirt being scooped up by the air pressure just ahead of the wave she reached out for beckss head cradling it in her arms maddy climbed up on to the computer desk now bob do it now in front of her a portal shimmered open suspended three feet above the floor there was no knowing if that was high enough whether she was going to emerge into the unchanged archway reappearing up to her waist in the concrete floor undoubtedly fatal horribly fatal she jumped for the portal just as the wave arrived and tore the archway into a million different possibilities chapter pm september police precinct new york the police sergeant lurched violently in his seat the squad car rocking on its suspension whoa hey bill you nearly spilled my darned coffee police sergeant bill devereau turned to look at his partner uh sorry mustve dropped off for a moment there his partner nodded you can say that you were muttering like some juicedup crackpot bill devereau shook his head wide awake now i crazy i just had the weirdest dream yeah devereau narrowed his eyes stroked his chin thoughtfully the memory of it was fading fast blurring the clear definition of it vanishing like cream stirred into coffee a war or somethin like that new york was all just ruins like i dunno like stalingrad sergeant wainwright sighed im sure you aint the only one havin nightmares buddy their precinct had lost some men earlier today when the twin towers came down good men and theyd be lucky to find anything of them in those smouldering ruins they were going to be burying empty coffins for weeks to come devereau stopped stroking his cleanshaven chin it was weird in the dream i had a beard would you believe big bushy thing sergeant wainwright turned to look at him a beard his face cracked with a cavalier grin beard you kiddin me youd look a total idiot with a beard devereau nodded he checked his face in the wing mirror yes he probably would at that youre gettin too old to be on the beat bill seriously if you got to be catchin sleep like that on duty was up late last night thats all wainwright nodded thoughtfully his gaze rested on a bundle of newspapers dropped off outside a corner store tomorrows papers tomorrows headlines there was going to be only one story in every paper tomorrow guess theres gonna be a lot more sleepless nights for everyone devereau nodded the dream had gone blown away like morning mist along a riverbank all that was left was a nagging sense of trouble lying ahead a storm coming you got that right partner chapter new york maddy opened her eyes she must have blacked out for a moment there her glasses were askew on her forehead and there was drool on her chin she adjusted her spectacles wiped her mouth and sat back down in the office chair sheesh she whispered the corner of her desk shed been standing on was still covered in a thick coat of rustcoloured brick dust but it ended suddenly sharply a curve of dust then none beyond that her desk was as normal dr pepper cans pizza boxes scraps of paper and pens sweet wrappers and magazines but none of the debris that had cascaded from above during the artillery bombardment earlier she looked down at the floor no longer a crazy paving of fractured concrete littered with the broken bodies of men it was restored to how it had been a week ago the archway was no longer a crumbling ruin she looked down at beckss still face her hair tangled with drying blood there was a job yet to do but not now not yet she gently placed the head on the cabinet beside the desk turning beckss pale deathmask face away from her so she didnt have to look at it the monitors were all on several of them playing live news feeds bob you there hello maddy just a moment she heard the hard drives on each of the linked pcs begin to whir and click i am detecting multiple timeline continuity errors yes of course bob had extended a preservation field around her alone the rest of the archway including computerbob had not experienced the trauma of the last week information external date is registering as september we appear to be seven days outside our time envelope right she said yeah a bunch of stuff happened bob you recall abraham lincoln running out on us of course according to my internal clock we sent liam and the others to retrieve abraham lincoln two hours and sixteen minutes ago yeah well youre now out of sync we need to reset the archway field and go back to our normal deployment time you need to do that now affirmative maddy then weve got to open a window for liam and the others to bring them back i do not have a reliable data stamp for them my last data stamp is theyre not down in quantico virginia any more well need to use the data stamp before that one you should still have that sitting in your memory cache new orleans this does not make sense how did they get there she smiled wearily at the webcam its a long story bob ill talk you through it later ok chapter new orleans the mans bloodshot eyes focused on sal my my god its its you he gasped his mouth flapped open and closed a thick gout of blood oozed out from between his lips sal leaned close to him grabbed one of his hands and held it tightly you youre going to be fine no he wasnt of course he wasnt she looked at the awful turnedinsideout remains of two horses and one man one of the horses was still kicking the other already dead and so would this poor man be very soon he was so very far from fine bob knelt down beside her this was a density overlap error this man will not last i know she hissed glaring at bob to shut up liams face looked grey like he was going to heave but he somehow managed to hold the churning contents of his guts in check as he hunkered down beside them ive seen this before its a timewindow mistake he shot a glance at the dying mans face maybe hes a his eyes widened jayzus maybe hes a timerider one of us listen listen to me gasped the man struggling to find his breath between mouthfuls of blood i i tried warn you warn us what do you mean ppandora it was me pandora liam looked at sal back at the man you left that note in san francisco that was you yyes i my name jjoseph the mans eyes started to glaze to roll he was going into shock what is pandora asked sal his mouth gushed blood his hand began to spasm flexing and squeezing hers pandora what is it please his gaze focused back on her wwaldstein the end he knows his voice was little more than a rustling whisper sal leaned in closer till she could feel the tickle of his dying breath against her cheek youll be ok she whispered to him pointlessly squeezing his hand again as if that was going to help youre going to be fine you ssal saleena she looked at him their faces inches apart intimately close you know me she whispered you yyou are his hand began to spasm again gripping hers tightly painfully are nnot who you ththink yyou are his eyes rolled until only the whites were showing his hand crushing her then suddenly he released her hand with a lurch out of his nose came a fine spray of blood i know aabout the ththe his mouth gushed blood on to his chin and he sighed not so much a death rattle just a simple and protracted sigh of relief at escaping the agony but it came with words two very faint words she could have sworn thats what she heard him mutter as the poor man died it wasnt her mishearing him it wasnt a random contortion of mouth and tongue she was almost certain shed heard two distinct words a message for her alone the bear
