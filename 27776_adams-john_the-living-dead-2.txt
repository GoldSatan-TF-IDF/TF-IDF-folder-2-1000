introduction by john joseph adams turns out zombies really dont want to die when night shade books and i put the first the living dead anthology together a couple years ago which i will refer to hereafter as volume one we had the sense that zombies would be big but i dont think any of us realized just how big they would become when the book actually came out in september of it seemed like the timing was perfect that we would be hitting right at the crest of the zombies popularity but now it looks like theyve only become more popular in the intervening period spreading throughout an unsuspecting population like zombiism itself in the last couple years there have been a slew of new zombie entertainments released across all media there have been new movies quarantine rec deadgirl diary of the dead survival of the dead dead snow zombie strippers zombieland video games plants vs zombies dead rising dead space left dead left dead and a veritable horde of books pride and prejudice and zombies and its sequel books from several of the contributors to this anthology and even a star wars zombie novel called death troopers plus a film adaptation is in the works for max brookss world war z and robert kirkmans the walking dead is being made into a television series and all of thats just off the top of my headif i wanted to make an extensive list im sure it could be ten times longer if you were inclined to have zombies in all of your entertainment i expect youd have very little trouble finding things to watch play or read all of them chockfull of zombie mayhem but since zombies have continued to dominate the popular consciousnessand volume one was so popular with readers and criticsit was an easy decision to do a second volume of zombie stories after all even at words i couldnt fit everything i wanted to into the first book and while its obvious that the public cant get enough of zombies well i guess its just as obvious neither can i lets talk a bit about this anthology in particular and how it is similar to and different from volume one volume one was comprised entirely of reprints except for one original story by john langan but this volume is mostly original with a mix of selected reprints twentyfive of the fortyfour stories appear for the first time in this anthology with the popularity of zombies infecting the pop culture like it has more writers than ever have been itching to try their hand at a zombie story so it was not difficult to find writers eager to participate in the book i asked some of the top names in zombie fictionmax brooks world war z robert kirkman the walking dead david wellington monster island brian keene the rising and othersalong with some bestsellers and rising stars of the science fiction fantasy and horror fieldsto write me original stories and boy did they deliver for volume one i chose stories that i felt represented the best of the best and together showcased the range of what zombie fiction was capable of this time around because my intent was to include the best new stories i focused on finding the best material that had never previously appeared in a zombie anthology before so while nineteen of the stories are reprints theres a good chance thateven if youre a hardcore zombie fantheyll be entirely new to you to bring this introduction to a close lets bring it back to where it started why are zombies so appealing since volume one came out thats one of my most frequently asked questions its kind of a curious question as if theres some reason zombies shouldnt be popular do people ask nfl football players why football is so popular i cant claim to know exactly why it is that people love zombies so much but there are a number of common theories about their popularity zombies are an enemy that used to be us that we can become at any time a canvas writers can use to comment on almost anything a moralityfree way to fulfill a worlddestruction fantasy a monster that remains scary and cannot be easily romanticized im sure thats all part of it and we could continue to speculate ad nauseamim sure there are dissertations being written on the subject as we speak but one thing is clear zombies arent going to be dying off any time soon and wed better learn how to live with them alone together by robert kirkman robert kirkman is bestknown for his work in the comics field as the writer and creator of the critically acclaimed bestselling zombie comic the walking deadwhich is considered by many myself included to be one of the greatest comics series of alltime other comics hes written for include invincible haunt and the astounding wolfman he has also worked on many marvel titles such as marvel zombies captain america ultimate xmen the irredeemable antman and fantastic four despite all of these writing credentials this is his first piece of published prose fiction in the walking dead robert kirkman set out to tell a different sort of zombie tale most such stories focus on a brief period of intense dangera single night as in the original night of the living deador perhaps a few days or weeks and concern the characters eluding predators and obtaining the immediate exigencies of survivalfood shelter weapons the walking dead follows the characters for month after month after month in their grueling quest to stay alive and more importantly to stay sane the stories present searing portraits of disaster psychologysurvivors guilt depression and hopelessness as well as the grim humor and small acts of kindness that allow people to carry on the zombies in this world are an everpresent threat but for long stretches of the story they fade into the background and the emotional landscapes of the characters take center stage as they feud break down fall in love lose heart and ultimately endureor notfor this a gritty realistic world where no one is safe the characters learn the hard way that other survivors can be more dangerous than zombies and that the most dangerous foe of all is your own heart our first story shares this focus on human psychology this is a zombie story and a love story the story of an ordinary man in a terrible situation and of the woman who just might be his only hope to make it out alive she was dressed like a private detective from a lowbudget tv showa pair of slacks modest high heels and the most ridiculous trench coat id ever seen one of the shorter ones that hung just above the knees i couldnt help but laugh and it was obvious my reaction annoyed her but she did her best to hide her feelings as she pressed a finger to my lips quieting me and gently nudged me back inside my apartment wed been dating for nearly three months the next day was our anniversary and we were supposed to do something together i cant remember what now but she had some sort of last minute work obligation crop up she called to tell me she wanted to see me that night i had hung up the phone maybe five minutes before she arrived she must have called me on the way she had nothing in her hands no present i was suspicious as she closed the door she flashed a naughty grin and opened the trench coat its not an overstatement to say that that moment changed my life her slacks stopped shortly above where the coat ended shed cut the legs off of a pair of her pants and attached them to a garter belt she wore nothing else under the coat to say this looked slightly ridiculous wouldnt be a lie but in that moment i couldnt care less about how silly she looked she was gorgeous fullfigured in all the right ways dark hair bright eyes i instantly fell in love with her head over heels hopelessly smitten and all that i already knew she was smart funny kind and all that other good stuff but to see this work of genius these pant legs concocted to better sell the old nakedunderthetrenchcoat gag knowing how much thought and preparation went into something so completely and utterly sillyi instantly knew that this was the woman for me i proposed to her in that very moment she thought i was joking of course but when i did it again two weeks later properly and with a ring she accepted we were married six months later we were married four wonderful years before the world around us fell apart the world as we knew it quickly disappeared leaving us and everyone else lost without any hope of regaining the lives wed grown accustomed to diane died two weeks after we abandoned our home my name is timothy stinnot and if its christmas im twentyeight yes its as horrible as you would imagine growing up with a birthday on christmas an entire childhood of receiving exactly one more present on christmas day than my little brother only to watch him celebrate essentially a second christmas a few months later its not easy for a kid to overcome that kind of jealousy justin is probably dead by now i have no way of knowing for sure some days im jealous of him for that too my fatherwho i must also assume is now deadhad this saying when we were growing up if not today when it was usually just to get me to clean my room or some other chore id been avoiding he didnt really give me much advice that didnt have a direct correlation to something he wanted me to do at the time its really just another way to say dont put off until tomorrow what you can do today but his way was a little catchier of course these days ive altered the saying to better reflect the times now its if not right now when these days tomorrow is much less of a guarantee i should be sleeping instead im sitting next to the window looking down at the grocery store across the street listening to alicia breathe as she sleeps on the floor next to me i saw the store on our way in earlier tonight dads motto be damned it was much too dark to try anything then so i didnt even mention it to alicia maybe i wanted to surprise her maybe i just didnt want to let her down but i cant stop fantasizing about what we might find in that worndown abandoned building tomorrow so i should be sleeping but instead i sit here in this empty apartment surrounded by trash and belongings that werent quite worth taking when the owners left i alternate between staring at the store and watching the quiet rise and fall of alicias chest as she sleeps shes not the most beautiful woman in the world or at least she wouldnt have beenbefore now she very well might be blonde and boneskinny with a boyish figure shes pretty much the exact opposite of diane and not at all the type of girl i would have dated in my previous life have you ever heard of smurfette syndrome smurfette was the lone female smurf on the childrens cartoon of the same name the syndrome dictates that when a group of men have only one female the men in that group will grow to find her attractive no matter how much they may otherwise not be attracted to her if there where other females present the male desire to procreate takes over your brain and forces you to suddenly consider the only female available to be extremely desirable i desire alicia extremely when diane was still alive i used to think that i could never be with someone else if something ever happened to her i know its something people do all the time but i just couldnt imagine doing it myself it seemed like such a betrayal that was of course before diane died i never considered what complete and utter loneliness felt likehow tormenting it was and just how much that torment could make you desire to connect with someone we started out as a group of sixfive guys plus alicia i met up with them about six months ago almost a month after id lost diane alicia and i have been alone for two guess what happened to everyone else there was david nevergothislastname he lasted all of ten days rounded a corner as we were leaving town when the walkers got him he distracted them long enough for the rest of us to get away i never really walked out front much after that i do more now that its just alicia and i but even still not very often one of the things i love about her is how strong she is and brave things id never even say i was she is sometimes i feel like im the one protecting her but really were protecting each other i sometimes wonder what shed say on the matter the carson twins lasted a little longer than david we were at a used car lot trying to siphon enough gas out of the cars and trucks to fill the tank of a passenger van wed commandeered there were just four of us by that point and we really should have tried to get something with better gas mileage but i think we wanted a vehicle we could all sleep in carson onethats what i called him when i had to call him by a namegot his leg mangled up by a walker that had been hiding under an old ford taurus i dont know if it had done that on purpose or if it had ended up there by chance either way carson ones leg got mangled all to hell and we knew right away that he was done for soon to be one of themwe all know what the bite does carson twoi think it was two come to think of it i could have them reversed in this story that happened a lot anyway carson two saw his brother mangled up bleeding all over the asphalt crying and carrying onand he just loses it maybe it was a twin thing where he was feeling the pain of his brother but he wailed on that thing like a man possessed which isnt something you should ever docutting your fists up and rubbing open wounds on one of them is about the same as getting bit alicia james and i all yelled for him to stop trying to get him to see what was coming for him all his screaming and carrying on had drawn a lot of attentionthe kind that gets you killed the three of us ran away as carson two got torn to bits james and alicia hadnt seen as much of that kind of thing as i had they didnt talk very much for the next few days james was alicias fiancé they were both very young about the same age diane and i were when we got married before the whole damn world went to shit they were in love im getting upset just thinking about itthe three of us alonethem hugging and holding each other all the time the way they slept in a tangled mess stealing each others breath throughout the night me off to the side the worst thirdwheel situation in the history of the world i was still in agony over the loss of my wife and now here i was trapped with two honesttogod lovebirds i wouldnt have thought that this hell on earth could be made any worse but seeing those two so in love with each other somehow did the day he died james and i had been looking for medicine for alicia she had been sick for almost a week wed been out all day and it was starting to get dark when we headed home i was lost in thought agonizing over all the time i was likely to spend over the next few weeks watching james and alicia together seeing him watching over her tending to her every need reminding me of how alone i was how much i missed diane in a split second it was over when the walkers moved in and swarmed around him i watched unable to save him as they tore him apart just like that he was gone i mightve said that my prayers had been answered but then id have to stop and consider who it was that had answered them they got him was all i could say to her when i returned to camp she recovered from her illness in a few days even without the medicine she didnt stop crying until much later over time the spells between tears got longer and longer and we began to talk about the things we had each lived through i couldnt talk about what happened to james without crying something about being so close to it i saw diane slaughtered in front of me all the others and now james it was all too much both our hearts had been broken we were two people alone sharing in each others agony over what wed lost all we had now was each other after james was gone i started to notice things about alicia that i hadnt noticed before the point of her nose and how it was slightly off center the dent in the middle of her bottom lip the way her voice would crack ever so slightly when she got excited about something there was no tv and no movies so my mainno my onlypastime had become obsessing over alicia alone together we talked for hours day in day out about nothing in particular i told her all about diane and all that she had meant to me she talked about meeting james on their college campus i told her about my mothers horrible childhood relaying the stories id hear as a child when complaining about absolutely anything at all she told me about her sisters heart condition about the long trips to the hospital how she occupied herself in the waiting room no story too mundane no detail too personal we had nothing but time and so we talked as i look at her now sleeping on the floor beside me i realize ive never known anyone so intimately even diane had her secrets but when the world is falling apart around you secrets become just another luxury that you have to give upor risk dying for them it is a strange thing for me to feel like i am falling in love all over again my grief over the loss of diane has transformed into what feels like real affection for alicia but is it real do i really love her as much as i loved diane or do i just feel the need for companionship so badly that i would find a way to love anyone is this in fact just smurfette syndrome if it is i dont care my every waking thought for the last two months has been of alicia is she okay is she happy is she scared is she tired as i sit here watching her chest rise and fall as she breathes every so often letting out the faintest hint of a snore i find my thoughts of the grocery store below shifting away from what will i find for myself to what might i find for alicia what she might like to eat what things left behind by other survivors might she find some value in if there is anything left in that grocery store at all of course but i cant dwell on that i have to stay positive i have to sleep tomorrow well go to the store and find out what is left when we arrived here it had been getting dark and we had only had enough time to make sure this apartment was secure in the hustle of preparing for nightfall she didnt even notice that the window overlooks the grocery store shes unaware of the possibilities tomorrow could holdwhich is why she fell asleep right away and im still up obsessing over what we might find maybe theyll have saltine crackers i know she loves them and theyd still be relatively edible if a little stalethose things last forever tomorrow well know tomorrow did you see it the question wakes me alicia is standing near the window looking down i should have closed the curtains maybe her opening them would have woken me up and given me enough time to see the surprised pleasure in her smile too late now the news has been broken still the look on her face is full of hope and anticipation i love how excited she gets about little things even surrounded by all this death and misery i was going to surprise you i tell her oh thats so sweet the look on her face fades instantly as she begins to rush me out of our makeshift bed somehow i find even her impatience adorable now get ready im dying to see whats inside she says as she pulls the tattered blanket out from under me clothing is not something that is hard to findclothes that fit perfectly sure but theres a wealth of clothes a little too loose or a little too tight we cant really wash them so we change clothes every other day or so rotating through found clothes trying to stay as clean as we can alicia brushes her hair constantly not so much for appearance but to keep it from turning into a tangled mess we have a small bottle of shampoo but only use it once a week i made that rule because she blew through the last one so quickly i cant fault her for wanting to stay clean she still uses way too much toothpaste though the tube is already almost empty and weve only had it for a month i cover maybe a quarter the length of my toothbrush with toothpaste when i brush she uses the fulllength as if you could go down to the corner and buy a new tube when you run out ill need to make a point to look for toothpaste once we get into the grocery store and soap and definitely shampoo i tighten my belt to hold up my twosizestoobig jeans which i have to admit i have been wearing for almost three weeks they still look remarkably close to clean for as much walking as weve been doing the only other pants ive found are a bit tight i wore them for a day and it was miserable im searching this apartment for pants before we go tshirts i have plenty of i usually discard a few before ever wearing them in favor of newly discovered ones i favor the ugliest ones i can find because they always get a smile out of alicia i have a hot pink dont worry be happy tshirt that i just cant get rid of no matter how many times ive worn it just let me tie my shoes and ill be ready i tell her she impatiently hovers over me and feigns annoyance alicia always sleeps in her shoes just in case we ever have to leave in a hurry its a practice she has often tried to talk me into but i just cant sleep with shoes on my feet she watches me roll my eyes and then offers me a fruit bar have you eaten anything she asks as i tie my other shoe i kind of wanted to wait until we checked the place out before i ate anything wouldnt want to spoil my appetite alicia shakes her head at me you know thats never a good idea shes right im sure many people have rushed into such places looking for something to eat only to get eaten themselves we could find anything down there including a large group of walkers its never a good idea to do anything dangerous on an empty stomach i eat a blueberry fruit bar its stale and hard to chew but its the best weve got after i choke it down we make our way to the grocery store we very rarely find doors i dont know why but for whatever reason there arent a lot of doors left that havent been torn off their hinges nearly every door ive seen since all of this started has had at least one busted hinge especially places like gas stations and grocery stores a fair bit of looting took place early on before people really started thinning out sometimes i feel like youve almost got better luck finding a large supply of food in an abandoned residence than you do in a grocery store theyve all beenransacked i think thats the word im looking for most places known for having food have already been ransacked i suppose during that period a shitload of doors got torn off their hinges so as a result the insides of most places are dangerous as all hell the walkers can just come and go as they please seems like a lot of them like to be inside they seem to be drawn indoors perhaps because thats where they mostly stayed before i dont really know why and i dont much care all i do know is that when looking around in a grocery store like the one alicia and i are about to enter you need to be careful the carson twins had carried guns i dont know if they had them before or just found them along the way whatever kind of guns they were i never noticed didnt matter anywaywhen the twins died they took those guns with them ive never fired a gun i never really felt qualified to handle one i think if i had a gun id probably just shoot myself in the foot or worse its not like a toy the triggers actually require quite a bit of pressure or so ive heard the mechanics of the whole thing seem beyond me point stay steady shoot it seems so simple maybe im overthinking it but dont you have to cock most guns and arent they supposed to be cleaned regularly or else they jam up ive watched movies where people take guns apart to clean them and theres all kinds of little springs and shit inside that baffles me im supposed to somehow figure out how to take a gun apart and put it back together no fucking way then theres the sound which is the number one thing that will draw walkers to you firing a gun is like ringing the dinner bell you may think to yourself well how do you attack them then you dont or i dont anyway i run anyone whos smart runs you see one you go the other way if it hasnt seen you just keep walkingeven at a leisurely paceand youll be just fine shoot it and the next thing you know youre surrounded and then youll be dead guns just arent practical so if you find yourself in the middle of a large group of walkersgun or no gunyoure dead thats all there is to it only reason youd want a gun in that situation is so you can turn it on yourself before they tear into you thats another reason i dont carry one i know i might be tempted to do just that and i was always told growing up that suicide was a oneway ticket straight to hell not that i necessarily buy into all that but im hedging my bets or rather i had been i dont know if that should be a concern of mine anymore so i carry a knife youd be surprised how easy it is to push a knife into one of their faces if they get too close or you dont see them until theyre practically right on top of you which has happened to me exactly once you stab them in the face didnt kill it right away the time i did it more like made a handle on the things head for me to push it away with theyre not very strong i knocked it over and wiggled the blade around until it messed its brain up enough that it stopped moving alicia is what you would call petite so you wouldnt think a bat would be much use to her but thats her weapon of choice thing is you dont really have to bash a walkers brains in the idea is to knock them off balance and alicias a pro at that she knocks them in the head with that bat next thing you know theyre down on their side trying to figure out which way is up and by then were long gone alicia is walking out front she turns to me just before stepping into the store shushing me as if i dont already know to be quiet the windows in this place have all been smashed out and theres broken glass all over the ground so being quiet is going to be pretty much impossible if theres something in there were going to know it right away and vice versa the grocery store is dimly lit from the daylight outside the front area of the store is in clear view but anything past that fades into black quickly especially with our eyes adjusting from the brightness of the midday sun ive never understood why these types of places dont have windows anywhere but in the front the store is small not a bigtime grocery its old dated like its from the late seventiesthe kind of place that just never updated its look i would have hated shopping here before it would have reminded me of my childhood depressed me this is the kind of place diane liked nostalgic she would have called it get your flashlight out alicia whispers looks like ill be going into the back thats fine i certainly dont want alicia taking the big risks i can run faster than her thats the one thing im sure im better at in places like this turning the flashlight on causes me no end of anxiety im standing next to a wall of blackness fiddling around in my backpack for the flashlight when i finally get it out there are those few seconds that tick by between turning it on and pointing it at what youre going to see i dread those seconds theres no telling what the flashlight is going to show there could be a dozen walkers standing there patiently waiting to inform me that there will be no treasures to be found here and that i will soon be dead empty shelves for the most part thats what i see its at once a relief and a huge disappointment this place has been picked clean alicia is calling me over shes found some beef jerky usually thats one of the first things people grab but this box fell behind one of the checkout counters i find a can of opened pringles near a pile of other cans that have been stepped on id eat them stale and all but there are bound to be bugsor worse yet miceinside in the back of the store i struggle to spend the proper amount of time examining the shelves the meat section is in the back as you go down the aisles the putrid smell intensifies with each step i think this is as bad as its going to getuntil i take another nobody ever took the meat at any of the places wed been to the lack of refrigeration makes storing processed meats pretty much impossible i doubt anyone ever took so much as one package they just sit in the dark and rot even the animals know better than to eat it after a while they just tear the packages to shit treating us to the smell it stinks in here almost worse than the walkers youd think after a while you would become accustomed to all the smells of todays world no running water the stench of death hanging in the air at every turn really though they arent the kind of smells you get used to you spend so much time in the open air that you have no chance to build up a tolerance the good part about that is that half the time you smell the walkers before you ever see them of course if youre standing near a monthsold meat cooler in the back of a dark grocery store one of them could practically be standing right beside you and you wouldnt even know it and i dont it lumbers forward reaching for me with that blind grab they all do i step back quickly but careful not to back myself into a cornerid done that far too many times to let it happen again the walker comes at me turning the corner coming at me from the end of the cereal aisle and all i can think of is alicia you okay up there i yell to her oh my god timothy shes rushing down one of the aisles behind the thing coming toward us i cant see her but i can hear her footsteps as she rushes to my rescue im okay stay where you are dont her scream keeps me from finishing my sentence another walker has gotten to her i continue to struggle with the walker keeping its gnashing teeth at bay then manage to jam the knife into its neck id been aiming for its face but there was no time to try for a kill shot now pushing it aside i make a break toward the sound of alicias voice im still not quite sure exactly where she is i blaze across the aisles looking for her but shes farther away than i had thought i round the corner and see only a mass of dark movement is alicia beneath on top is she even here at all i only hear the grunts of a struggle i cant immediately tell that theyre hers but thenyes its her as i near the struggling mass i tuck my head down knowing what im going to do with my arms stretched out at either side i tackle the beast i knock it free from alicia and the thing and i roll off of her in an instant i swear i hear the sound of bone breaking from the impact as if im demolishing the thing i fear thats only my imagination as i roll on top of it alicias safety is still my only concern and i never once consider that im wrestling a walker with no clue as to where its mouth is or how in danger of being bit i might be i can feel its fingers clawing at my thigh and my only instinct is to get away but by then its got meits fingers locked in a death grip around my thigh and my arm im hitting it kicking at it with my free arm and leg with all my might and i dont even know what im hitting suddenly i realize i have my eyes tightly shut and so i open themjust in time to see alicia bathed in light bringing the baseball bat down on the walkers head she bashes its skull in with a single blow my arm and thigh now releasedalicia has saved me she stands over me with the bat watching the walkerdead for real nowcollapse into a heap alicia collapses shortly after alicia she offers no response i can barely stand were you bitten i crawl over to her shes concealed in darkness i cant see any blood i dont know if shes hurt or if her malnourished body couldnt take the strain of all this exertion whatever the case i have to get her out where i can see her to the road where its safe and welllit i begin dragging her frantically toward the light no time to lift her upthere could be more of them i get halfway to the exit before i remember the broken glass in the front of the store so i drop to my knees and gather her onto my lap nearly toppling a nearby shelf as i use it to support me as i force myself to stand i think i hear rustling as i lumber out of the store a figment of my imagination and not more of them i hope out in the street i gently lower her down to the pavement i examine her face no blood her shirt no blood her pants the samebut there are rips and tears in her clothing and its possible she received a scratch or a minor bite not yielding much blood the shoes pop off with little effort having not been untied and retied in more than a days time getting her pants over her hips is another matter shes always insisted on wearing snugfitting jeans or at least as snugfitting as she could find she claims she doesnt want to risk having her clothing get caught on something during an escape but i think that fashion is the last part of civilization shes willing to let go of as i start to pull her shirt off she wakes up helping me the rest of the way theres not a scrape on her must have been exhaustion from the struggle she smiles up at me and the emotion of the moment shifts were starting to feel safe now how do i look she asks it sounds cheesy but i say the first thing that comes to mind perfect nearly naked completely vulnerable in the middle of the road directly in front of the grocery store out in the midday sun she sits up and pushes me onto my backside checking me for wounds is just a formality ive heard of at least two different cases where the adrenaline rush and the shock of the attack kept a person from realizing they had been bitten for several hours never witnessed this first hand but i never like to risk anything laughing to herself as she struggles to pull off my shoes she begins to undress me the urgency in the moment is gone she takes her time by the time alicia begins unbuttoning my pants i have my own shirt off i smile at her nothing to see here i tell her and so we survived again our third such closecall together we seem to be good luck to each other i look into her eyes and she smiles back at me in relief theres no feeling more exhilarating than the feeling of being in no danger immediately after escaping mortal danger i try to stand up wanting to get dressed and go back inside and find my knife but alicia pulls me to her and kisses me and whatever danger i just put myself in for her this is worth it if i had a large gash on my ankle in the shape of a bloody bite mark that meant i only had a matter of hours to keep living this would still be worth it shes kissing me im kissing her and despite my instincts screaming for me to stop we continue on kissing faster and more passionately i cant help but question her actions right here i ask she tells me to shut up funny thats what i wanted to say to myself there are any number of things that could come up this road in one way or another once we were watching a gas station surrounded by walkers trying to figure out the safest way to get inside when a band of marauders arrived in a large truck i remember a meanlooking woman with a sword who nearly singlehandedly staved off the walkers while other members of her group broke in to clean out the place i hate to think about what could have happened had they found us inside they certainly didnt look like the kind of people wed want to get to know thats how things are now running into another group of survivors is just as dangerous as finding a group of walkers you never know how people are going to act at least the walkers are predictable i dont want to think about what would happen if anyone were to come walking up the street right now so i dont alicia and i lose ourselves in each other i dont know what brought this onmaybe it was her waking up to me stripping her down seeing me labor and stress over her wellbeing or the general excitement of the whole ordeal but whatever it is i dont care it is only the second time weve made love diane please forgive me you may find yourself thinking about how uncomfortable it would be to have sex in the middle of an open road next to a ransacked grocery store littered with shards of broken glass dont dwell on it this rural road already has large patches of weeds growing up through the cracked asphalt soft little patches of lawn in the middle of harsh pavement between that and our discarded clothing we do just fine when its over my mind is racing the one thing weve never talked about is how she really feels about me we spend every waking moment together but we do that because we have to if there was anyone else to talk to maybe she would favor them instead maybe i would too but i doubt it no this is real the look in her eyes when she looks at me thats love i may not know much but i know what that looks like she may not feel it for me as strongly as i do for her but its there i can tell alicia loves me she loves me i think to myself at first excited and then burdened with the guilt of officially having a new relationship after losing diane less than a year ago my mind races as i return to the grocery store to retrieve my knife thats not something i can just leave behind id reconciled myself to never loving again after i lost diane ive learned to live with it i remember her and it makes me sad that was my burden the pain i carry inside me alicia i thought liked me and was with me because i was all that was available she found comfort in my arms i was fine with leaving it at that this is something else entirely this makes the relationship real shes getting over james im getting over diane and we have mutual feelings for each other this isnt something i can take lightly this is something i have to treat with respect thats what alicia deserves she deserves to know the truth there were a few houses in the area and a lot of daylight left we decided to explore them and see if we could find more supplies over the course of the day we found clothes another bottle of shampoo some soap toothpaste and a whole mess of food canned soup crackers and various things that were either completely unspoiled or edible but only if you were really hungry there were a few walkers milling about in or around the houses but we saw them early and easily avoided them this was a small miracle as distracted as i was i couldnt stop thinking about what i had to tell alicia what i was going to say to her tonight by the time we returned to the apartment across the street from the grocery store darkness had already come the thing that kept running through my head all daythe thing i had to tell aliciawas how james really died the day james died it had just been the three of usjames alicia and ifor weeks i missed diane so much my grief over losing her was still fresh in my mind i like to think i wasnt myself i just wanted things to go back to the way they were before and knowing that that would never be possible made me more angry than id ever been in my life they say people are capable of doing things when theyre grieving that they would never consider otherwise seeing diane die right in front of me scarred me watching those things tear into her unable to do anything about it seeing the terror in her eyes as she screamed for help only to see her life fade away moments later there are things that were now forced to deal with on a daily basis that i dont think we should have ever had to deal with i loved diane alicia loved james i didnt want to see her go through that much pain i didnt want to kill james but i thought about it he and i were alone that day all day i knew that if he were to die maybe i wouldnt get diane back but at the very least i wouldnt have to see the two of them together anymore i wouldnt have to see in them exactly what i wanted for myself i had opportunities my knife in hand his back to me i wouldnt have even had to see his face in the end i couldnt do it it was too much i could never go that far i couldnt kill him myself luckily it was a dangerous world we were living in the day was nearly over we were talking deciding whether or not to search one last house for medicine before starting our journey back i saw them coming he didnt there was a moment just after he saw themtoo latethat he looked at me screaming for help in that moment i could have stepped in and helped him fight them off instead i stepped back everything id been thinking about that day affected that splitsecond decision immediately i realized what id done and i suddenly wanted to help him but by then it was too late there were too many of them james was dead it was only a seconda brief moment where the pain of seeing them together had reached a crescendo within me and made me do that awful thing people were dying every second of every day most everyone id ever known was probably dead whats one more i thought whats one more if it means ill be happier whats one more if she never has to know what ive done but now alicia loves me and i cant keep this from her any longer maybe we were meant to be together maybe diane and james were meant to die maybe that was necessary to bring alicia and me together to ensure our survival standing in the apartment moonlight filling the room from the open window i embrace alicia and tell her i love her she responds in kind like i knew she would i take one final look at her and take a mental snapshot of the alicia who is unaware of the evil i have done then i tell her everything i tell her because i love her i tell her because i respect her i tell her because i hope shell forgive me when im done the look on her face surprises me she looks at me not with anger but with sorrow she looks at me as if i told her id killed myself and maybe thats what i just did the man shed fallen in love with was a lie she starts crying and before long is sobbing heavily i didnt expect the screaming im sorry i say she begins pounding on my chest with her fists hitting me repeatedly but its all i can say im sorry im sorry im sorry i weather the storm its what i deserve before long her anger fades and she collapses i embrace her and we cry together for a while all we have to lean on is each other neither of us can get through this alone she has forgiven me i think as we lie together in the darkness im all she has she cant stay mad at me forever the fact that i told her has to count for something doesnt it she has to know this is something i regret that it will haunt me for as long as i live i think it will be a long time before things will be back to normal between us but well get there and when we do our bond will be that much stronger now that there are no secrets between us were going to have to make the best of this world around us if were going to survive everything is going to be okay thats what i think as i drift off to sleep alicia sobbing in my arms the sun of a new morning shines through the open window waking me the bedding beside me is colder than it should be i reach for alicia but shes not there my eyes open i look around gone shes gone and shes taken all our food all our supplies and all of our weapons whether shes meant to or not she has killed me i wont last more than five days alone truth be toldwithout her i dont want

stories its a universal human urge to leave the world a better place than you found it and to pass on to your children a world where they can have a happier more prosperous life than you had this has mostly been the case throughout human history as everexpanding infrastructure and knowledge have generally made life more secure and comfortable generation after generation through innovations such as fertilizers vaccines antibiotics indoor plumbing and electronics but now adults are facing the despairing sense that todays youth will experience significantly more hardship than the previous generation as todays young people confront a world of economic ruin and environmental catastrophe that they had no hand in creating recent works have grappled with this generational guilt in different ways one of the bestknown examples is cormac mccarthys novel the road a postapocalyptic story in which a father attempts to guide his young son through a devastated landscape all the while knowing that their situation is hopeless the notion of enduring anything to protect your children is a primal one and one of the worst things that most people can imagine is being helpless to aid their children our next story deals with this theme in a powerful way for a generation facing the prospect of bequeathing to their children a shattered world one fear stands out even more than being helpless to protect your child that you yourself might be the architect of your childs undoing when kendrick opened his eyes grandpa joe was standing over his bed a tall dark bulk dividing the morning light grandpa joes beard covered his dark chin like a coat of snow mom used to say that guardian angels watched over you while you slept and grandpa joe looked like he might have been guarding him all night with his shotgun kendrick didnt believe in guardian angels anymore but he was glad he could believe in grandpa joe most mornings kendrick opened his eyes to only strangeness dark heavy curtains wooden planks for walls a brownishgray stuffed owl mounted near the window with glassy black eyes that twitched as the sun setor seemed to a rough pine bed and that smell everywhere like the smell in mom and dads closet cedar grandpa joe told him grandpa joes big hard hands had made the whole cabin of it one board and beam at a time for the last six months this had been his room but it still wasnt really his spiderman bed sheets werent here his gi joes tonka trucks and matchbox racetracks werent here his posters of blade and shaq werent on the walls this was his bed but it wasnt his room up and at em little soldier grandpa joe said using the nickname mom had never liked grandpa was dressed in his hickory shirt and blue jeans the same clothes he wore every day he leaned on his rifle like a cane so his left knee must be hurting him like it always did in the mornings hed hurt it long ago in vietnam im going trading down to mikes you can come if you want or i can leave you with the doggirl up to you grandpas voice was morningrough either way its time to get out of bed sleepyhead doggirl the woman who lived in a house on a hill by herself fifteen minutes walk west was their closest neighbor once upon a time shed had six pit bulls that paraded up and down her fence in the last month that number had dropped to three grandpa joe said meat was getting scarce hard to keep six dogs fed even if you needed them the dogs wagged their tails when kendrick came up to the fence because doggirl had introduced him to them but grandpa joe said those dogs could tear a mans arms off dont you ever stick your hand in there grandpa joe always said just because a dog looks friendly dont mean he is especially when hes hungry can i have a coke kendrick said surprised to hear his own voice again so much smaller than grandpa joes almost a little girls kendrick hadnt planned to say anything today but he wanted the coke so bad he could almost taste the fizz it would taste like a treat from willy wonkas chocolate factory if mikes got one youll get one for damn sure grandpa joes grin widened until kendrick could see the hole where his tooth used to be his strawhole grandpa joe called it he mussed kendricks hair with his big palm good boy kendrick you keep it up i knew your tongue was in there somewhere you better start using it or youll forget how hear me you start talking again and ill whip you up a lumberjack breakfast like before it would be good to eat one of grandpa joes famous lumberjack breakfasts again piled nearly to the ceiling a bowl of fluffy eggs a stack of pancakes a plate full of bacon and sausage and homemade biscuits to boot grandpa joe had learned to cook in the army but whenever kendrick thought about talking his stomach filled up like a balloon and he thought he would puke some things couldnt be said out loud and some things shouldnt there was more to talking than most people thought a whole lot more kendricks eye went to the bandage on grandpa joes left arm just below his elbow where the tip peeked out at the edge of his shirtsleeve grandpa joe had said hed hurt himself chopping wood yesterday and kendricks skin had hardened when hed seen a spot of blood on the bandage he hadnt seen blood in a long time he couldnt see any blood now but kendrick still felt worried mom said grandpa joe didnt heal as fast as other people because of his diabetes what if something happened to him he was old something could that sixpoint we brought down will bring a good haul at mikes well trade jerky for gas dont like to be low on gas grandpa said his foot slid a little on the braided rug as he turned to leave the room and kendrick thought he heard him hiss with pain under his breath and well get that coke for you whaddya say little soldier kendrick couldnt make any words come out of this mouth this time but at least he was smiling and smiling felt good they had something to smile about for once three days ago a buck had come to drink from the creek through the kitchen window kendrick had seen something moveantlers it turned outand grandpa joe grabbed his rifle when kendrick motioned before the shot exploded kendrick had seen the buck look up and kendrick thought it knows the bucks black eyes reminded him of dads eyes when he had listened to the news on the radio in the basement hunched over his desk with a headset kendrick had guessed it was bad news from the trapped look in his fathers eyes dad would be surprised at how good kendrick was with a rifle now he could blow away an empty chef boyardee ravioli can from twenty yards hed learned how to aim on max payne and medal of honor but grandpa joe had taught him how to shoot for real a little every day grandpa joe had a roomful of guns and ammunitionthe back shed which he kept lockedso they never ran low on bullets kendrick supposed he would have to shoot a deer one day soon or an elk or something else the time would come grandpa joe said when he would have to make a kill whether he wanted to or not you may have to kill to survive kendrick he said i know youre only nine but you need to be sure you can do it before everything changed grandpa joe used to ask mom and dad if he could teach kendrick how to hunt during summer vacation and theyd said no dad didnt like grandpa much maybe because grandpa joe always said what he thought and he was moms father not dads and mom didnt go much easier on him always telling grandpa joe no no matter what he asked no you cant keep him longer than a couple weeks in the summer no you cant teach him shooting no you cant take him hunting now there was no one to say no no one except grandpa joe unless mom and dad came back grandpa joe had said they might and they knew where to find him they might kendrick put on the red down jacket hed been wearing the day grandpa joe found him hed sat in this for neverending hours in the safe room at home the storage space under the stairs with a reinforced door a chemical toilet and enough food and water for a month mom had sobbed bolt the door tight stay here kendrick and dont open the door until you hear grandpas danger wordno matter what she made him swear to jesus and shed never made him swear to jesus before hed been afraid to move or breathe hed heard other footsteps in the house the awful sound of crashing and breaking a single terrible scream it could have been his mother or father or neitherhe just didnt know followed by silence for one hour two three then the hardest part the worst part show me your math homework kendrick the danger word was the special word he and grandpa joe had picked because grandpa joe had insisted on it grandpa joe had made a special trip in his truck to tell them something bad could happen to them and he had a list of reasons how and why dad didnt like grandpa joes yelling much but hed listened so kendrick and grandpa joe had made up a danger word nobody else in the world knew not even mom and dad and he had to wait to hear the danger word mom said no matter what by the time kendrick dressed grandpa was already outside loading the truck a beatup navy blue chevy kendrick heard a thud as he dropped a large sack of wrapped jerky in the bed grandpa joe had taught him how to mix up the secret jerky recipe he hadnt even given mom soy sauce and worcestershire sauce fresh garlic cloves dried pepper onion powder hed made sure kendrick was paying attention while strips of deer meat soaked in that tangy mess for two days and then spent twelve hours in the slowcook oven grandpa joe had also made him watch as he cut the deer open and its guts flopped to the ground all gray and glistening watch boy dont turn away dont be scared to look at something for what it is grandpa joes deer jerky was almost as good as the lumberjack breakfast and kendricks mouth used to water for it not anymore his jerky loaded grandpa joe leaned against the truck lighting a brown cigarette kendrick thought he shouldnt be smoking ready kendrick nodded his hands shook a little every time he got in the truck so he hid his hands in his jacket pockets some waddedup toilet paper from the safe room in longview was still in there a souvenir kendrick clung to the wad squeezing his hand into a fist we do this right well be back in less than an hour grandpa joe said he spit as if the cigarette had come apart in his mouth fortyfive minutes fortyfive minutes that wasnt bad fortyfive minutes then theyd be back kendrick stared at the cabin in the rearview mirror until the trees hid it from his sight the road was empty as usual grandpa joes rutted dirt road spilled onto the highway after a halfmile and they jounced past darkened abandoned houses kendrick saw three stray dogs trot out of the open door of a pink twostory house on the corner hed never seen that door open before and he wondered whose dogs they were he wondered what theyd been eating suddenly kendrick wished hed stayed back at doggirls she was from england and he couldnt always understand her but he liked being behind her fence he liked popeye and ranger and lady di her dogs he tried not to think about the ones that were gone now maybe shed given them away they passed tree farms with all the trees growing the same size identical and kendrick enjoyed watching their trunks pass in a blur he was glad to be away from the empty houses get me a station grandpa joe said the radio was kendricks job unlike dad grandpa joe never kept the radio a secret the radio hissed and squealed up and down the fm dial so kendrick tried am next grandpa joes truck radio wasnt good for anything the shortwave at the cabin was better a mans voice came right away a shout so loud it was like screaming and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find itand shall desire to die and death shall flee from them turn that bullshit off grandpa joe snapped kendrick hurried to turn the knob and the voice was gone dont you believe a word of that you hear me thats budoublel bullshit things are bad now but theyll get better once we get a fix on this thing anything can be beat believe you me i aint givin up and neither should you thats givinup talk the next voices were a man and a woman who sounded so peaceful that kendrick wondered where they were what calm places were left mobilization at the vancouver armory thats from the commander of the washington national guard so you see the man said there are orchestrated efforts there has been progress in the effort to reclaim portland and even more in points north the armory is secure and running survivors to the islands twice a week look at rainier look at devils wake as long as you stay away from the large urban centers there are dozens of pockets where people are safe and life is going on oh yes the woman said of course there are theres a learning curve thats what people dont understand absolutely the woman sounded absurdly cheerful everybody keeps harping on longview the man said longview as if it were a normal everyday place kendricks stomach tightened when he heard it but thats become another encouraging story contrary to rumors there is a national guard presence there are limited food supplies theres a gated community in the hills housing over four hundred remember safety in numbers any man woman or teenager whos willing to enlist is guaranteed safe lodging fences are going up roads barricaded were getting this under control thats a far cry from what we were hearing even five six weeks ago night and day the cheerful woman said her voice trembled with happiness grandpa joe reached over to rub kendricks head see there he said kendrick nodded but he wasnt happy to imagine that a stranger might be in his bed maybe it was another family with a little boy or twins but probably not doggirl said the national guard was long gone and nobody knew where to find them bunch of useless bloody shitheads shed saidthe first time hed heard the little round woman cuss her accent made cussing sound exotic if she was right dogs might be roaming through his house too looking for something to eat theres talk that a bay area power plant is up again its still an unconfirmed rumor and im not trying to wave some magic wand here but im just making the pointand ive tried to make it beforethat life probably felt a lot like this in hiroshima yes the woman said from her voice hiroshima was somewhere very important call it apples and oranges but put yourself in the place of a villager in rwanda or an auschwitz survivor there had to be some days that felt exactly the way we feel when we hear these stories from seattle and portland and when weve talked to the survivors just ahead along the middle of the road a man was walking kendrick sat straight up when he saw him balling up the tissue wad in his pocket so tightly that he felt his fingernails bite into his skin the walking man was tall and broadshouldered wearing a brickred backpack he lurched along unsteadily from the way he bent forward as if bracing into a gale kendrick guessed the backpack was heavy he hadnt ever seen anyone walking on this road dont you worry grandpa joe said kendricks neck snapped back as grandpa joe speeded up his truck we aint stoppin the man let out a mournful cry as they passed waving a cardboard sign he had a long bushy beard and as they passed his eyes looked wide and wild kendrick craned his head to read the sign which the man held high in the air still here the sign read hell be all right grandpa joe said but kendrick didnt think so no one was supposed to go on the roads alone especially without a car maybe the man had a gun and maybe they would need another man with a gun maybe the man had been trying to warn them something bad was waiting for them ahead but the way he walked no matter what mom had said kendrick kept watching while the man retreated behind them he had to stop watching when he felt nausea pitch in his stomach hed been holding his breath without knowing it his face was cold and sweating both at once was that one kendrick whispered he hadnt known he was going to say that either just like when hed asked for a coke instead hed been thinking about the mans sign still here dont know grandpa joe said its hard to tell thats why you never stop they listened to the radio neither of them speaking again for the rest of the ride time was joseph earl davis iii never would have driven past anyone on the road without giving them a chance to hop into the bed and ride out a few miles closer to wherever they were going hell hed picked up a group of six collegeage kids and driven them to the centralia compound back in april but joe hadnt liked the look of that hitcher something about his walk or maybe times were just different if kendrick hadnt been in the car jesus as his witness joe might have run that poor wanderer down where he walked an ounce of prevention that was what it had come to in joe daviss mind drastic measures you just never knew that was the thing ereh llits the mans sign said in the mirror receding into a tiny unreadable blur yeah im still here too joe thought and not picking up hitchhikers was one way he intended to stay here thanks a bunch for asking freaks clustered in the cities but there were plenty of them wandering through the countryside nowadays actual packs thousands maybe joe had seen his first six months ago coming into longview to rescue his grandson his first his fifth and his tenth hed done what he had to do to save the boy then shut the memories away where they couldnt sneak into his dreams then drank enough to make the dreams blurry a week later hed seen one closer to home not three miles beyond the gated road not five miles from the cabin its face was bloated bluegray and flies buzzed around the open sores clotted with that dark red scabby shit that grew under their skin the thing could barely walk but it had smelled him swiveling in his direction like a scarecrow on a pivot joe still dreamed about that one every night that one had chosen him joe left the freaks alone unless one came at himthat was safest if you were by yourself hed seen a poor guy shoot one down in a field and then a swarm came from over a hill some of those fuckers could walk pretty fast could run and they werent stupid by god but joe had killed that one the pivoting one that had chosen him hed kill it a dozen times again if he had the chance it was a favor to both of them that shambling mess had been somebodys son somebodys husband somebodys father people said freaks werent really deadthey didnt climb out of graves like movie monstersbut they were as close to walking dead as joe ever wanted to see something was eating them from the inside out and if they bit you the freak shit would start eating you too you fell asleep and you woke up different the movies had that part right anyway as for the rest nobody knew much people who met freaks up close and personal didnt live long enough to write reports about them whatever they were freaks werent just a city problem anymore they were everybodys problem can you hold on dad my neighbors knocking on the window thats what cass had said the last time theyd spoken then he hadnt heard any more from his daughter for ten agonizing minutes the next time hed heard her voice hed barely recognized it so calm it could be nothing but a mask over mortal terror daddy dont talkjust listen im so sorry for everything no time to say it all theyre here you need to come and get kendrick use the danger word do you hear me daddy andbring guns shoot anyone suspicious i mean anyone daddy daddy shed called him she hadnt called him that in years that day hed woken up with alarm twisting his gut for no particular reason that was why hed raised cassidy on the shortwave two hours earlier than he usually did and shed sounded irritated that hed called before she was up my neighbors knocking on the window joe had prayed he wouldnt find what he knew would be waiting in longview hed known what might happen to cass devon and kendrick the moment hed found them letting neighbors use the shortwave and drink their water like theyd been elected the rescue committee they couldnt even name one of the women in their house that was cass and devon for you acting like naive fools and hed told them as much still even though hed tried to make himself expect the worst he couldnt really if he ever dwelled on that day he might lose his mindand then what would happen to kendrick anytime joe brought up that day the kids eyes whiffed out like a dead pilot light it had taken kendrick hours to finally open that reinforced door and let him in even though joe had used the danger word again and again and kendrick had spoken hardly a word since little soldier was doing all right today good hed need to be tougher fast the kid had regressed from nine to five or six just when joe needed him to be as old as he could get as joe drove beyond the old tree farms the countryside opened up on either side fields on his left a range of hills on his right thered been a cattle farm out here once but the cattle were gone wasnt much else out here and there never had been except for mikes nowadays mikes was the only thing left anyone recognized mikes was a gas station off exit with portapotties out back and a few shelves inside crammed with things people wanted flour canned foods cereal powdered milk lanterns flashlights batteries first aid supplies and bottled water and gas of course how he kept getting this shit joe had no idea if i told you that id be out of business bro mike had told him when joe asked barking a laugh at him last time hed driven out here joe had asked mike why hed stayed behind when so many others were gone why not move somewhere less isolated even then almost a full month ago folks had been clumping up in longview barricading the school jail and hospital had to be safer if you could buy your way in being white helped too they said it didnt but joe davis knew it did always had always would things like that just went underground for a time thats all times like these the ugly stuff festered and exploded back topside mike wasnt quite as old as joesixtythree to joes more cumbersome seventyonebut joe thought he was foolhardy to keep the place open sure all the stockpiling and bartering had made mike a rich man but was gasoline and ricearoni worth the risk i dont run joe guess im hardheaded that was all hed said joe had known mike since he first built his cedar cabin in after retiring from his berth as supply sergeant at fort mcarthur mike had just moved down from alberta and theyd talked movies then jazz theyd discovered a mutual love of duke ellington and old sitcoms mike had always been one of his few friends around here now he was the only one joe didnt know whether to hope his friend would still be there or to pray he was gone better for him to be gone joe thought one day he and the kid would have to move on too plain and simple that day was coming soon that day had probably come and gone twice over joe saw a glint of the aluminum fencing posted around mikes as he came around the bend the end of the s in the road although it looked more like a prison camp mikes was an oasis a tiny squat store and a row of gas pumps surrounded by a wire fence a man and a half tall the fence was electrified at night joe had seen at least one barbecued body to prove it and everyone had walked around the corpse as if it werent there with gas getting scarcer mike tended to trust the razor wire more using the generator less these days mikes three boys whod never proved to be much good at anything else had come in handy for keeping order theyd had two or three gunfights there mike had said because strangers with guns thought they could go anywhere they pleased and take anything they wanted today the gate was hanging open hed never come to mikes when there wasnt someone standing at the gate all three of mikes boys were usually there with their greasy hair and their pale fleshy bellies bulging through their tootight tshirts no one today something was wrong shit joe said aloud before he remembered he didnt want to scare the kid he pinched kendricks chin between his forefinger and thumb and his grandson peered up at him resigned the expression he always wore these days lets just sit here a minute okay little soldier nodded he was a good kid joe coasted the truck to a stop outside the gate while it idled he tried to see what he could the pumps stood silent and still on their concrete islands like two men with their hands in their pockets there was a light on inside a superwhite fluorescent glow through the picture windows painted with the words gas food in red he could make out a few shelves from where he was parked but he didnt see anyone inside the air pulsed with the steady burr of mikes generator still working at least it didnt look like anyone had rammed or cut the gate the chain looked intact so it had been unlocked if thered been trouble here it had come with an invitation nothing would have made those boys open that gate otherwise maybe mike and his boys had believed all that happytalk on the radio ditched their place and moved to longview the idea made joe feel so relieved that he forgot the ache in his knee and leave the generator on bullshit tire tracks drew patterns in hardened mud mikes was a busy place damn greedy fool beside him joe felt the kid fidgeting in his seat and joe didnt blame him he had more than half a mind to turn around and start driving back toward home the jerky would keep he had enough gas to last him hed come back when things looked right again but hed promised the kid a coke that was the only thing and it would help erase a slew of memories if he could bring a grin to the kids face today little soldiers grins were a miracle his little chipmunk cheeks were the spitting image of casss at his age daddy shed called him on the radio daddy dont think about that dont think dont joe leaned on his horn he let it blow five seconds before he laid off after a few seconds the door to the store opened and mike stood there leaning against the doorjamb a big ruddy whitehaired canuck with linebacker shoulders and a pigskinsized bulge above his belt he was wearing an apron like he always did as if he ran a butcher shop instead of a gas station mike peered out at them and waved come on in he called out joe leaned out of the window where the boys at he called back theyre fine mike said over the years joe had tried a dozen times to convince mike he couldnt hear worth shit no sense asking after the boys again until he got closer the wind skittered a few leaves along the ground between the truck and the door and joe watched their silent dance for a few seconds considering im gonna go do this real quick kendrick joe finally said stay in the truck the kid didnt say anything but joe saw the terror freeze his face the kids eyes went dead just like they did when he asked what had happened at the house in longview joe cracked open his door ill only be a minute he said trying to sound casual ddont leave me please grandpa joe let me ccome well ill be damned joe thought this kid was talking up a storm today joe sighed mulling it over pros and cons either way he supposed he reached under the seat and pulled out his glock mm hed never liked automatics until maybe the mids when somebody figured out how to keep them from jamming so damned often he had a mossberg shotgun in a rack behind the seat but that might seem a little too hostile hed give kendrick the remington gauge it had some kick but the little soldier was used to it he could trust little soldier not to fire into the ceiling or his back joe had seen to that how many shots joe asked him handing over the little birder kendrick held up four stubby fingers like a toddler so much for talking if youre coming with me i damn well better know you can talk if theres a reason to joe sounded angrier than hed intended nowhow many shots four that time hed nearly shouted it come on in mike called from the doorway ive got hot dogs today that was a first joe hadnt seen a hot dog in nearly a year and his mouth watered joe started to ask him again what the boys were up to but mike turned around and went inside stick close to me joe told kendrick youre my other pair of eyes anything looks funny you point and speak up loud and clear anybody makes a move in your direction you dont like shoot hear kendrick nodded that means anybody i dont care if its mike or his boys or santa claus or anybody else you understand me kendrick nodded again although he lowered his eyes sadly like mom said damn right exactly like your mom said joe told kendrick squeezing the kids shoulder for an instant his chest burned so hot with grief that he knew a heart attack couldnt feel any worse the kid might have watched what happened to cass cass might have turned into one of them before his eyes joe thought of the pivoting bloated freak hed killed the one that had smelled him and his stomach clamped tight lets go remember what i told you joe said yes sir hed leave the jerky alone for now hed go inside and look around for himself first joes knee flared as his boot sank into soft mud just inside the gate shit he was a useless fucking old man and he had a bouncing betty fifty klicks south of the dmz to blame for it in those happy days of vietnam none of them had known that the real war was still forty years offbut coming fastand he was going to need both knees for the real war you dig and he could use a real soldier at his side for this war not just a little one closer joe said and kendrick pulled up behind him his shadow when joe pushed the glass door open the salmonshaped door chimes jangled merrily like old times mike had vanished quick because he wasnt behind the counter a small television set on the counter erupted with laughterold canned laughter from people who were either dead or no longer saw much to laugh about eeeeeeedith archie bunkers voice crowed on the screen old archie was so mad he was nearly jumping up and down it was the episode with sammy davis jr where sammy gives archie a wet one on the cheek joe remembered watching that episode with cass once upon a time mike was playing his vcr mike whered you go joes finger massaged his shotgun trigger as he peered behind the counter suddenly there was a loud laugh from the back of the store matching a new fit of laughter from the tv hed know that laugh blindfolded mike was behind a broom one of those school custodian brooms with a wide brush sweeping up and back and joe heard large shards of glass clinking as he swept mike was laughing so hard his face and crown had turned pink joe saw what he was sweeping the glass had been broken out of one of the refrigerated cases in back which were now dark and empty the others were still intact plastered with budweiser and red bull stickers but the last door had broken clean off except for a few jagged pieces still standing upright like a mountain range close to the floor yall had some trouble joe asked nope mike said still laughing he sounded congested but otherwise all right mike kept a cold six months out of the year who broke your glass tom broke it the boys are fine suddenly mike laughed loudly again that archie bunker he said and shook his head kendrick too was staring at the television set mesmerized from the look on his face he could be witnessing the parting of the red sea the kid must miss tv all right got any cokes mike joe said mike could hardly swallow back his laughter long enough to answer he squatted down sweeping the glass onto an orange dustpan weve got hot dogs theyre suddenly mikes face changed he dropped his broom and it clattered to the floor as he cradled one of his hands close to his chest ow shit on a stick careful there oldtimer joe said cut yourself goddamn shit on a stick shit on a stick goddamn shit on a stick sounded like it might be bad joe realized he hoped this fool hadnt messed around and cut himself somewhere he shouldnt have mike sank from a squat to a sitting position still cradling his hand joe couldnt see any blood yet but he hurried toward him well dont sit there whining over it shit on a stick goddamn shit on a stick when mikes wife kimmy died a decade ago mike had gone down hard and come up a christian joe hadnt heard a blasphemy pass his old friends lips in years as joe began to kneel down mikes shoulder heaved upward into joes midsection stanching his breath and lifting him to his toes for a moment joe was too startled to reactthe whatthehell reaction stronger than reflex which had nearly cost him his life more than once he was frozen by the sheer surprise of it the impossibility that hed been talking to mike one second and joe snatched clumsily at the glock in his belt and fired at mikes throat missed shit the second shot hit mike in the shoulder but not before joe had lost what was left of his balance and gone crashing backward into the broken refrigerator door three things happened at once his arm snapped against the case doorway as he fell backward knocking the gun out of his hand before he could feel it fall a knife of broken glass carved him from below as he fell slicing into the back of his thigh with such a sudden wave of pain that he screamed and mike had hiked up joes pant leg and taken hold of his calf in his teeth gnawing at him like a dog with a beef rib fucking son of a bitch joe kicked away at mikes head with the only leg that was still responding to his bodys commands still mike hung on somehow even inside the fog of pain from his lowerbody injury joe felt a chunk of his calf tearing more hot pain he was bitten that was certain he was bitten every alarm in his head and heart rang oh god holy horseshit he was bitten hed walked right up to him they could make soundseverybody said thatbut this one had been talking putting words together acting likeacting like with a cry of agony joe pulled himself forward to leverage more of his weight and kicked at mikes head again this time he felt mikes teeth withdraw another kick and joes hiking boot sank squarely into mikes face mike fell backward into the shelf of flashlights behind him kendrick joe screamed the shelves blocked his sight of the spot where his grandson had been standing pain from the torn calf muscle rippled through joe clouding thought the pain from his calf shot up to his neck liquid fire did the bastards have venom was that it mike didnt lurch like the one on the road mike scrambled up again untroubled by the blood spattering from his broken nose and teeth i have hot dogs mike said whining it almost joe reached back for the glock his injured thigh flaming while mikes face came at him mouth gaping teeth glittering crimson joes fingers brushed the automatic but it skittered away from him and now mike would bite and bite and then go after the little soldier mikes nose and mouth exploded in a mist of pink tissue the sound registered a moment later deafening in the confined space an explosion that sent mikes useless body toppling to the floor then joe saw kendrick just behind him his little birding gun smoking face pinched hands shaking holy jesus kendrick had done it the kid had hit his mark sucking wind grandpa joe took the opportunity to dig among the old soapboxes for his glock and when he had a firm grip on it he tried to pull himself up dizziness rocked him and he tumbled back down grandpa joe kendrick said and rushed to him the boys grip was surprisingly strong and joe hugged him for support straining to peer down at his leg he could be wrong about the bite he could be wrong let me look at this joe said trying to keep his voice calm he peeled back his pant leg grimacing at the blood hugging the fabric to flesh there it was facing him in a semicircle of oozing slits a bite and a deep one he was bleeding badly maybe mike had hit an artery and whatever shit they had was shooting all through him damn damn damn night seemed to come early because for an instant joe daviss fear blotted the rooms light he was bitten and where were mikes three boys wouldnt they all come running now like the swarm over the hill hed seen in the field weve gotta get out of here little soldier joe said and levered himself up to standing pain coiled and writhed inside him i mean now lets go his leg was leaking the pain was terrible a throb with every heartbeat he found himself wishing hed faint and his terror at the thought snapped him to more alertness than hed felt before he had to get little soldier to the truck he had to keep little soldier safe joe cried out with each step on his left leg where the back of his thigh felt ravaged he was leaning so hard on little soldier the kid could hardly manage the door joe heard the tinkling above him and then impossibly they were back outside joe saw the truck waiting just beyond the gate his eyes swept the perimeter no movement no one where were those boys lets go joe panted he patted his pocket and the keys were there faster joe nearly fell three times but each time he found the kids weight beneath him keeping him on his feet joes heartbeat was in his ears an oceans roar jump in hurry joe said after the drivers door was open and little soldier scooted into the car like a monkey the hard leather made joe whimper as his thigh slid across the seat but suddenly it all felt easy slam and lock the door get his hand to stop shaking enough to get the key in the ignition fire her up joe lurched the truck in reverse for thirty yards before he finally turned around his right leg was numb up to his kneefrom that bite oh sweet jesusbut he was still flooring the pedal somehow keeping the truck on the road instead of in a ditch joe looked in his rearview mirror at first he couldnt see for the dust but there they were mikes boys had come running in a ragged line all of them straining as if they were in a race fast they were too far back to catch up but their fervor sent a bottomless fear through joes stomach mikes boys looked like starving animals hunting for a meal kendrick couldnt breathe the air in the truck felt the way it might in outer space if you were floating in the universe a speck too far in the sky to see grandpa joe kendrick whispered grandpa joes black face shone with sweat and he was chewing at his lip hard enough to draw blood grandpa joes fingers gripped at the wheel and the corners of his mouth turned upward in an imitation of a smile its gonna be all right he said but it seemed to kendrick that he was talking to himself more than to him itll be fine kendrick stared at him assessing he seemed all right he was sweating and bleeding but he must be all right if he was driving the truck you couldnt drive if you were one of them could you grandpa joe was fine he said he was mom and dad hadnt been fine after a while but they had warned him they had told him they were getting sleepy and they all knew getting sleepy right away meant you might not wake up or if you did youd be changed theyd made him promise not to open the door to the safe room even for them no matter what not until you hear the danger word kendrick felt warm liquid on the seat beneath him and he gasped thinking grandpa joe might be bleeding all over the seat instead when he looked down kendrick saw a clear puddle between his legs his jeans were dark and wet almost black it wasnt blood hed peed on himself like a baby are you sleepy kendrick said grandpa joe shook his head but kendrick thought hed hesitated first just a little grandpa joes eyes were on the road half the time on the rearview mirror the rest how long before your mom and dad got sleepy kendrick remembered dads voice outside of the door announcing the time its nine oclock cass worried it was getting late worried they should get far away from kendrick and send for grandpa joe to come get him kendrick heard them talking outside the door plain as day for once they hadnt tried to keep him from hearing a few minutes kendrick said softly five or ten grandpa joe went back to chewing his lip what happened kendrick didnt know what happened hed been in bed when he heard mom say their neighbor mrs shane was knocking at the window all he knew was that dad came into his room shouting and cradling his arm blood oozed from between dads fingers dad pulled him out of bed yanking kendricks arm so hard that it popped pulling him to his feet in the living room hed seen mom crouching far away by the fireplace sobbing with a red face moms shirt was bloody too at first kendrick had thought dad had hurt mom and now dad was mad at him too dad was punishing him by putting him in the safe room theyre in the house kendrick were bitten both of us after the door to the safe room was closed for the first time kendrick had heard somebody elses footsteps then that scream they stayed for ten minutes maybe not long then they said they had to leave they were getting sleepy and they were scared to come near me then they went away for a long time for hours kendrick told grandpa joe all of a sudden i heard mom again she was knocking on the door she asked me where my math homework was she said you were supposed to do your math homework kendrick had never said the words before tears hurt his eyes that was how you knew grandpa joe said kendrick nodded snot dripped from his nose to the front of his jacket but he didnt move to wipe it away mom had said not to open the door until grandpa joe came and said the danger word no matter what good boy kendrick grandpa joe said his voice wavering good boy all this time joe had thought it was his imagination a gaggle of the freaks had been there in casss front yard waiting for him so hed plowed most of them down with the truck so he could get to the door that was the easy part as soon as he got out the ones still standing had surged thered been ten of them at least an old man a couple of teenage boys the rest of them women moving quick hed been squeezing off rounds at anything that moved daddy had he heard her voice before hed fired in the time since hed decided the voice was his imagination because how could she have talked to him said his name hed decided god had created her voice in his mind a last chance to hear it to make up for the horror of the hole his glock had just put in her forehead daddy it had been cass but it hadnt been her blouse and mouth had been a bloody dripping mess and hed seen stringy bits of flesh caught in her teeth just like the other freaks it hadnt been cass hadnt been people said freaks could make noises they walked and looked like us the newer ones didnt have the red shit showing beneath their skin and they didnt start to lose their motor skills for a couple of daysso they could run fast the new ones hed known that everybody knew that but if freaks could talk could recognize you then we cant win the thought was quiet in joes mind from a place that was already accepting it ten minutes little soldier had said maybe five joe tried to bear down harder on the gas and his leg felt like a wooden stump still the speedometer climbed before it began shaking at ninety he had to get little soldier as far as he could from mikes boys those boys might run all day and all night from the way theyd looked he had to get little soldier away joes mouth was so dry it ached were in trouble little soldier joe said joe couldnt bring himself to look at kendrick even though he wanted to so much he was nearly blinded by tears you know were in trouble dont you joe said yes the boy said we have to come up with a plan just like we did at your house that time a danger word kendrick said joe sighed a danger word wont work this time again kendrick was silent dont go back to the cabin joe said deciding that part its not safe but mom and dad might this time joe did gaze over at kendrick unless it was imagination the boy was already sitting as far from him as he could against the door that was a story i told you joe said cursing himself for the lie you know theyre not coming kendrick you said yourself she wasnt right you could hear it that means they got your father too she was out in the front yard before i got inside i had to shoot her little soldier i shot her in the head kendrick gazed at him wideeyed rage knotting his little face thats it little soldier get mad i couldnt tell you before but im telling you now for a reason just that quick the road ahead of joe fogged doubled he snapped his head up aware that he had just lost a moment of time that his consciousness had flagged but he was still himself still himself and that made the difference right he was still himself and just maybe he would stay himself and beat this damned thing if you could stay awake then you might stay alive for anotherwhat ten days hed heard about someone staying awake that long maybe longer right now he didnt know if hed last the ten minutes his eyes fought to close so hard that they trembled therell be rest enough in the grave wasnt that what benjamin franklin had said dont you close your eyes daddy casss voice he snapped his head around wondering where the voice had come from he was seeing things cassie sat beside him with her pink lips and ringlets of tight brown hair for a moment he couldnt see little soldier so solid she seemed you always talked tough this and tough that da nang and hanoi and a dozen places i couldnt pronounce and now the one damned time in your life that it matters youre going to sleep the accusation in her voice was crippling we trusted you and you walked right into that store and got bitten because you were laughing at archie bunker i trusted you daddy silence then i still trust you daddy suddenly joe felt wide awake again for the last time in his life listen to me i cant give you the truck joe said i know we practiced driving but you might make a mistake and hurt yourself youre better off on foot rage melted from kendricks face replaced by bewilderment and the terror of an infant left naked in a snowdrift kendricks lips quivered violently no grandpa joe you can stay awake he whispered grab that backpack behind your seatits got a compass bottled water jerky and a flashlight its heavy but youll need it and take your remington theres more ammo for it under your seat put the ammo in the backpack do it now kendrick sobbed reaching out to squeeze joes arm pplease grandpa joe stop that goddamned crying joe roared and the shock of his voice silenced the boy kendrick yanked his hand away sliding back toward his door again the poor kid must think hed crossed over joe took a deep breath another wave of dizziness came and his chin rocked downward the car swerved slightly before he could pull his head back up joes pain was easing and he felt stoned as if he were on acid he hadnt driven far enough yet they were still too close to mikes boys so much to say joe kept his voice as even as he could there were only two people who could put up a better fight than me and that was your mom and dad they couldnt do it not even for you that tells me i cant either understand his tears miraculously stanched kendrick nodded read revelations a billboard fifty yards ahead advised in red letters beside the billboard the road forked into another highway thank jesus the words flew from his mouth nearly breathless ill pull off when we get to that sign at the crossroads when the truck stops run hear me fast as you can no matter what you heardont turn around dont stop its twenty miles to centralia straight south theres national guard there and caravans tell them you want to go to devils wake thats where id go when youre running stay near the roads but keep out of sight if anyone comes before you get to centralia hide if they see you tell em youll shoot and then do it and dont go to sleep kendrick dont let anybody surprise you yes sir kendrick said in a sad voice yet still eager to be commanded the truck took control of itself no longer confined to its lane or the road and it bumped wildly as it drove down the embankment joes leg was too numb to keep pressing the accelerator so the truck gradually lost speed rocking to a stop nose down its headlights lost in weeds feeling in his arms was nearly gone now too i love you grandpa joe he heard his grandson say or thought he did love you too little soldier still here still here now go go joe heard kendricks car door open and slam before he could finish he turned his head to watch kendrick to make sure he was doing as hed been told kendrick had the backpack and his gun as he stumbled away from the truck running down in the embankment that ran beside the road the boy glanced back over his shoulder saw joe wave him on and then disappeared into the roadside brush with trembling fingers joe opened the glove compartment digging out his snubnose his favorite gun he rested the cold metal between his lips past his teeth he was breathing hard sucking at the air and he didnt know if it was the toxin or his nerves working him he looked for kendrick again but he couldnt see him at this angle now do it now it seemed that he heard his own voice whispering in his ear i can win i can win i saved my whole fucking squad i can beat this thing joe sat in the truck feeling alternating waves of heat and cold washing through him as long as he could stay awake he heard the voice of old mrs reed his sixthgrade english teacher saw the faces of little bob and eddie kevner whod been standing beside him when the bouncing betty blew then he saw cassie in her wedding dress giving him a secret gaze as if to ask if it was all right before she pledged her final vows at the altar then in the midst of the images some he didnt recognize something red drifting through a trackless cosmos alive yet not alive intelligent but unaware hed been with them all along those drifting sporestrands gravitating toward a bluegreen planet with water and soilfiltering through the atmosphereresthomegrow a crows mournful caw awakened joe but not as much of him as had slipped into sleep his vision was tinged red his world his heart was tinged red what remained of joe knew that it was in him awakening using his own mind against him dazzling him with its visions while it took control of his motor nerves he wanted to tear to rend not killing not eating not yet there was something more urgent a new voice he had never heard before must bite panicked he gave his hand an urgent command pull the trigger but he couldnt hed come this close and couldnt too many parts of him no longer wanted to die the new parts of him only wanted to live to grow to spread still joe struggled against himself even as he knew struggle was doomed little soldier must protect little soldier must must must find boy kendrick had been running for nearly ten minutes never far from stumbling before pure instinct left him and his mind woke up again suddenly his stomach hurt from a deep sob he had to slow down because he couldnt see for his tears grandpa joe had been hunched over the steering wheel eyes open so wide that the effort had changed the way his face looked kendrick thought hed never seen such a hopeless helpless look on anyones face if he had been able to see mom and dad from the safe room that was how they would have looked too hed been stupid to think grandpa joe could keep him safe he was an old man who lived in the woods kendrick ran his legs burning and throat scalding he could see the road above him but he ran in the embankment like grandpa joe had told him out of sight for an endless hour kendrick ran despite burning legs and scalded throat struggling to stay true to the directions grandpa joe had given him south stay south centralia national guard devils wake safe by the time exhaustion claimed kendrick rain clouds had darkened the sky and he was so tired he had lost any certainty of placing his feet without disaster the trees once an explosion of green had been bleached gray and black they were a place of trackless unknowable danger every sound and shadow seemed to call to him trembling so badly he could hardly move kendrick crawled past a wall of ferns into a culvert clutching the little remington to his chest once he sat his sadness felt worse like a blanket over him he sobbed so hard he could no longer sit up straight curling himself in a ball on the soft soil small leaves and debris pasted themselves to the tears and mucous that covered his face one sob sounded more like a wail so loud it startled him grandpa joe had lied mom had been dead all along hed shot her in the head hed said it like it hardly mattered to him kendrick heard snapping twigs and the back of his neck turned icecold footsteps running fast kendricks sobs vanished as if theyd never been he sat straight up propping his shotgun across his bent knee aiming finger ready on the trigger he saw a small black spider crawling on his trigger wristone with a bloated egg sack about to give birth to a hundred babies like in charlottes webbut he made no move to bat the spider away kendrick sat primed trying to silence his clotted nose by breathing through his mouth waiting maybe it was that hitchhiker with the sign he thought but it didnt matter who it was hide that was what grandpa joe said the footsteps slowed although they were so close that kendrick guessed the intruder couldnt be more than a few feet away he was no longer running as if he knew where kendrick was as if hed been close behind him all along and now that hed found him he wasnt in a hurry anymore i have a gun ill shoot kendrick called out and this voice was very different from the one hed used to ask grandpa joe for a coke not a little girls voice this time or even a boys it was a voice that meant what it said silence the movement had stopped that was when grandpa joe said the danger word kendricks finger loosened against the trigger his limbs gave way and his body began to shake the woods melted away and he remembered wearing this same jacket in the safe room waiting waiting for grandpa joe there had never been a gunshot from grandpa joes truck kendrick had expected to hear the gunshot as soon as he ran off dreading it grandpa joe always did what needed to be done kendrick should have heard a gunshot go back kendrick said although his voice was not so sure this time he cocked the remingtons hammer just as hed been taught kendrick waited he tried not to hopeand then hoped ferventlythat his scare had worked the instant kendricks hope reached its peak a shadow moved against the ferns above him closer breakfast grandpa joes watery voice said again zombieville by paula r stiles paula r stiles is the author of more than two dozen stories her work has appeared in nature albedo one the zombie anthology history is dead shine writers of the future xxiv jim baens universe space and time and in many other venues such as the south african magazine something wicked where this story first appeared she is also the editor of innsmouth free press from to stiles served as an aquaculture extension agent with the peace corps in cameroon west africa resident evil a video game set in a haunted mansion combined polygonal characters with prerendered backgrounds and was one of the first games in the survival horror genre following the model of alone in the dark the game has spun off numerous sequels as well as three feature films starring milla jovovich and written by paul w s anderson most recently the mad maxinspired resident evil extinction the most recent video game in the franchise resident evil is set in africa which has provoked some criticism of the games handling of racial imagery the author of our next tale says i kept hearing they wanted to do a resident evil movie set in africa and i groaned a little thinking about how many boring clichés theyd come up with for that then i thought well self why not do your own take on an african zombocalypse stiles made the protagonists of the story peace corps volunteers because she used to be one aids was already at epidemic proportions in cameroon by the time i left in and thats a pretty scary atmosphere to be in for two years she says so when i was hearing people talk about the zombocalypse as if it would be this catastrophic event i kinda laughed and thought you know i should just write a zombocalypse tale thats a metaphor for aids in africa its not actually the first aidsinafrica metaphor tale ive written probably wont be my last either the gendarme had wandered out into the middle of the road his already wellfleshed form had swelled to bursting and his skin once the color of the stash of dark chocolate wed traded for in yaoundé looked almost as green as his stained army uniform he looked like hed been from the bulu a tribe down in the south region near the port of douala down the railroad line from yaoundé he stood there waving his arms in a parody of his old contrôlepoint routine of stopping bushtaxis and other traffic to check their papers hunt up the odd bribe our taxi a gray peugeot stuffed with ten live passengers and driver cleared the hill and slammed down on all four wheels into a nasty pothole we hit the gendarme about dead center five meters later to the tune of abbas dancing queen which the hausa muslim driver had been blasting on the peugeots tape deck the gendarme flew up over the roof landing hardand in pieceson the paved road behind the car the driver didnt so much as ease off the gas just as well wed all sooner stop for a cobra than a zombie that was pretty spectacular josie said she was a reasonably goodlooking blonde and my housemate crammed half onto my lap and half up onto the armrest of the right rear door that might sound like a good thing but only if youve never been stuck in a peugeot with ten other people for three hours on a tropical afternoon our only break was the halfhour wed spent on the side of the road to allow the six muslims in the car to pray and the rest of us to pee yeah pretty spectacularif you like blood and guts splattering all over the road i said bet hed have stopped if the guy had been muslim since he was obviously a gendarme he couldnt have been muslim so im sure the driver thought it was perfectly reasonable to run him down josie said cameroons president just before everything had gone to zombie hell had been from the south his predecessor had been a fulani muslim from the extreme north thered been bad blood between the muslims and the government ever since considering this was a country where a muslim friend had once told me that his christian neighbors were cannibals because they ate cats and a good host always popped the top off your beer in front of you to prove he or she hadnt poisoned it it was a wonder the driver hadnt turned around and run over the gendarme twice josie and i were the only nassaras foreign whites in the car technically i was chineseamerican not white but cameroonians didnt make those distinctions with americansexcept when they expected me to do kung fu like bruce lee didnt help that my name really was bruce or that id clear six feet easily in my bare feet they got a lot of martial arts flicks over hereused to anyway before running over the gendarme may not have been such a hot idea his guts had gotten snarled on the roof of the car and now dangled through the driversside window like a sausage brand of fuzzy dice and bumped against the drivers shoulder they smelledliterallylike shit the driver ignored them hed probably smelled worse we rolled across the bridge over a river of sand and into maroua provincial capital of the extreme north region of cameroon if you had to get stranded someplace during a zombie epidemic you could have done worse than maroua the place looked like a city out of arabian nights the local hausa and fulani muslims were friendly rich and regionally wellorganized they lived in large walled compounds along treelined streets the walls whitewashed or cementcrépissagé mudbrick with wells inside and fruit trees some of those civic features had helped save most of the citys population that and the usually dry climatemixed savannah and desert during the initial outbreak wed all just shut ourselves up and waited wed only gone out heavily armed for food and other necessary supplies many nights id lain in bed listening to the zombies claw and bang on the tolle gates in the morning wed venture out to club and burn any walking dead in sight nobody took them on at night even now the taxi bumped past the main taxi park an open flat place of beaten red dirt near one of the round hills that just popped up out of the landscape this far north the taxi park was surrounded by dusty green trees with lowspreading limbs we were only a days journey south of lake chad not all that far from the sahara as we passed the park i spotted two men torching a zombie dog they had it staked down with a spear and were burning it in sections from the tail up i could see its dry ribs shining in the afternoon sun all the way from the taxi the dog snapped at its tormentors as they danced around it i loved animals and i pitied what that dog had been but there was no way i would have tried to save it now the driver dropped us off at our compound in the safe part of town josie and i peeled ourselves out of the taxi along with the rest of the passengers after stretching the kinks out of our backs we snagged our equipment from the overstuffedandstrappeddown trunk the passengers stood by looking over their shoulders as the driver handed out the machetes matches and canned goods wed looted during our shopping trip down south even with the curiosity that anything we nassaras did generated our equipment postoutbreak was too ordinary to mark josie banged on the gate no one answered but that wasnt uncommon she got the tin gate open while i hauled out our bags the driver took off as soon as hed cinched things back up with strips of black rubber inner tube called caoutchouc josie and i liked to joke that the entire country was held together with it keeping an eye out we tossed the bags in through the gate quickly and slammed the door behind us the virus had raged during the rainy season the previous year and had gotten into the water supply the traditional clearing of the savannah brush by fire in december at the beginning of the dry season had helped considerably with suppressing the initial epidemic christmas had passed fairly uneventfully with the end of january and the reheating of the weather though some isolated outbreaks were starting up again josie and i had come back from yaoundé the country capital not far north of douala just in time the compounds dogs cujo i and ii came bounding up to us for a headrub as soon as we came in like most cameroonian dogs they barely came up to josies knees they reminded me with a twinge of the zombified dog id seen in the taxi park a tawny cat from our small colony lazed on a chair on the porch wed had some feline mortality initially but theyd learned fast to avoid zombie rats and the like they mostly stayed inside the compound now the day guard adamou woke up in his chair near the cat and came down off the porch scratching his head and yawning bonsoir adamou i said he nodded and waved distractedly then went back to his nap he wasnt big on helping out with heavy lifting were here josie shouted toward the house it was a cement ranchstyle structure with a tolle roof barred windows and an open front porch nothing youd ever see in out of africa buckets and panniers were lined up under all the eaves from the last rainy season we had a well and running water still ran in the pipes sporadically but less and less often since the beginning of the outbreak we kept the water in big containers and we always boiled it before we drank it or bathed in it that cut a bit into our supply of propane tanks and the rate of indirect infection from the virus in strict epidemiological terms was pretty low but nobody wanted to end up like that gendarme from brushing their teeth in the morning two of our group came out onto the porch there were still nine nonmissionary foreigners that we knew of in the regionfive volunteers from the peace corps three of us here in town two italian aid workers and a couple of young tourists whod just been passing through when everything had gone to a hot place in a hand conveyance back home cyndi and roger had decided to stay in their village up near waza national park the rest of us had wanted everybody to stick together wed heard rumors that poachers had spread the virus to some of the animals in waza facing off with a zombie elephant no thanks but roger and cyndi felt differently personally i thought roger was just being his usual antisocial asshole self and that cyndi stuck with him out of loyalty she was still dating him after all but it wasnt my decision or anybody elses but cyndis and rogers with everything wed lost we werent about to curtail each others freedom on top of it how was zombieville alicia one of the italians asked she meant yaoundé after brazzaville in the congo but it could have applied to any large city even maroua just eight months ago she was a tall thin brunette who smoked a lot more now than before the outbreak josie and i looked at each other we didnt much want to talk about our trip especially considering wed barely made the last train to ngaounderé that was liable to leave yaoundé for a while but our buddies needed a report messy as usual i replied whole sections of the city are overrun at this point everybody whos still got a pulse has gone back en brousse as far as we could tell though the muslims are still running a closed marché and the like the peace corps admin office is picked pretty clean but we found some medschloroquine and mefloquineand some antibiotics that we dont think are too spoiled hows the situation back home that was silas our third volunteer he was a big black guy in his forties who looked like hed been born in the marines hed have gone with us if he hadnt broken his leg in a motorcycle accident a few months back hed left family back in the stateshadnt we allbut hed probably been the least homesick of us until the outbreak now he spent a lot of his time working a twoway shortwave radio hed found in the marché while laid up burning through car battery after car battery hoping to get an answer sometimes he did from the oddest places like siberia or bosnia or cape cod but most of the time he just got static nobody told him to give it up we were all hoping along with him i hadnt heard from either my mom or my sister in san francisco since before the outbreak didnt expect to either but you know you like to hope josie shook her head to silas question its total radio silence the last anybody heard things were getting pretty ugly nothing your contact on the cape hasnt already told you about zombies hating salt water that was before the rainy season beganend of february or march maybe who knows what its like now now was january if we hadnt heard from anybody else in the us by now that meant we probably never would the country was gone and italy and the rest of europe and the americas and asia and australia all gone at least as far as civilization was concerned drowned in an apocalyptic flood of mostly dead carrion beasts with the shelflife of rotting hamburger and here we were in cameroon west africa cut loose like the rest of the expats scrambling to make a living to make a permanent life and put down roots in a country where wed expected only to have a passing adventure for two or three years needless to say it had been a shock all round that we were stuck here for the duration not even a year had helped us get used to it cameroon is a radically different culture from any in the west you think youll be fine and then you get here andwell youre not always fine psychovacs hadnt been all that uncommon among volunteers before the outbreak they were no longer an option the rest of the world had succumbed so fast but not africa africa cradle of humanity and civilization had simply shrugged and collectively said to this latest pandemic you want a piece of homo sapiens get in line and somedaymaybe not so soon but somedaywed spread out once again and repopulate the world pushing aside another hominid species this time homo mortuus it was only a matter of time but now it was january and the yellow harmattan wind was rolling in off the sahara pushing the rains south and drying everything out including the zombies a good time for a little zombicide alicia said we have some bad news of our own josie looked down and started scuffing the red dirt probably not too keen to face whatever alicia had to say i decided to face it straight on maybe it would hurt less i looked back and forth between alicia and silas what silas took the plunge we havent heard from roger and cyndi since before you guys left im sorry bruce alicia said i know you three have been worrying about them uh that was over two weeks ago i said feeling my stomach clench up into some serious heartburn i felt a sudden need for a shot of gordons gin they didnt answer just looked grim no bushtaxi notes josie asked finally looking up nothing i wanted to go out and pick them up silas said shaking his head but the others argued that wed better wait for you guys what with my bum leg youre the ones with the connections and experience and we only really started to worry a few days ago shit i said josie didnt say anything she didnt need to wed had a little business going for a couple of months now cleaning out centers of zombie infection it kept the money coming in so nobody complained silas was right we were the logical ones to go find out what had happened to roger and cyndi just like wed been the logical ones to go down to zombieville and reconnoiter well we cant go right now josie said with her usual practicality its only two hours to sunset and way too hot well go tomorrow at sunrise sunrise wasnt until six am but she was right you couldnt get much done in the cameroon heat after nine in the morning especially in the north and evenings werent a good time to be outside the bandits who had infested the roads of the region for many years had been some of the first to get zombified like that gendarme on the road their rotten minds kept them at their old habits sure being halfdead slowed them down but cameroonian nights were dark in a noisy taxi wed get no warning of an attack josie and i only got some sleep that night because we were so tired we tried a little fooling around but dropped off in the middle of it right before dawn in le grande matin we set off in a bushtaxi not long after the first call to prayer for the day wailed out to the muslims from mosques all over town bushtaxis looked like milk trucks with holes cut out for windows but they were sturdier than car taxis when it came to zombie attacks along the way we saw a zombie giraffe come out of the trees and stagger along the roadside in a parody of a live giraffes stately walk trying to outpace us no doubt most of its mottled hide had worn off in patches or was hanging in strips around its long legs its tendons looked so brittle it was a wonder it could keep its feet even so a pride of verymuchalive lions on the other side of the road just lounged on large tree branches wistfully observing it from a distance they knew better than to try that kind of meat i wondered if the virus might even end up saving the wildlife they sure were venturing out of waza with increasing boldness all the more reason to persuade roger and cyndi to come back with us even if it turned out they were fine we got hit up for a job as soon as we rolled into town around eight the sousprefet himself met us at the little taxi park sousprefets were federal government officials in charge of the arrondisement around a township a big city like maroua had a prefet instead in addition to at least one local mayor and a chef for each tribe this guy was an anglophone from the northwest region above yaoundé which meant he was probably even more industrious than the muslims the superefficient inhabitants of the two anglophone regions and the neighboring francophone west region had a mutual hostility with the other seven francophone regions which sometimes got anglophone officials lynched in the south during times of unrest like national elections it wasnt so bad up here where the anglophones and the muslims shared a work ethic and a common cause against our nowdefunct federal government probably why the locals hadnt replaced this guy with a muslim a longrunning joke was that the country would never elect an anglophone because hed make everybody work and nobody wanted that the sousprefet seemed happy to see a couple of western nassaras and chatted for a little while with us in english then he told us he needed our services even before we mentioned our own mission the job would pay our rent for the next couple of months cfa or its equivalent in supplies to burn out a house of zombies youd think people wouldnt use paper money or coins anymore but you cant carry that much in supplies everywhere you go and there was no way in hell anybody would take credit the payer probably wouldnt honor so money still got passed around increasingly tattered and with different countries on it but still useful a bit like the bottles people still brought to bars in exchange for beer and soda because some enterprising souls were still making both the sousprefet and his gendarmes could have done the job themselves but this was in the compound of a local traditional chef nassaras were good for the more delicate zombicide jobs being from a foreign tribe we werent supposed to have a stake in the local politics so we had a rep for being impartial josie and i discussed it we wanted to get over to see roger and cyndi right away but we already knew from experience that whatever condition they were in theyd probably been in it for two weeks already besides we could really use the money and the sousprefets goodwill if things had gone sideways with them we agreed to do it we stocked up on kerosene in the marché buying it in old plastic palmoil bottles there was red sediment at the bottom of each one any petroleum product was strained through a cloth to get out the dust but that wasnt percent successful that would matter for a car but not for our purposes zombies would burn just as well with dirty kerosene theyd shut up all the infected living and dead inside a large hut in a compound nobody had been out for seven days that made the job a simple one of torching and watching it burn slicing and incinerating the zombies who tried to escape the only glitch came when a woman burst out of the burning hut clutching a baby we nearly hacked her before she screamed and the baby started howling zombies dont talk they can make a weird sort of grunt with air coming out through the vocal cords but they cant talk or scream we doused both woman and child with gin my own way of dealing with the outbreak so i always had some on me to disinfect them as best we could then we pronounced mother and child clean this practice didnt usually thrill the local muslims but they were fine with the logic of cleaning off zombie virus as long as the booze didnt make the person drunk judged living again by the nassara zombiehunters both survivors were taken away gently to be fed and given a real bath and that was the job wed insisted on the cfa up front that would have been not quite a hundred bucks american if the us still existed normally wed have pocketed it and gone back to maroua in high spirits but we werent here on business or fun we were here to check up on two of our own the sousprefet grabbed two gendarmes and led us there himself he seemed to know what we were in for but our friends being nassaras hed probably been hesitant to go in if you find anything well pay the usual rate he said this seemed awfully generous until he took off down the road with the two gendarmes without paying us first figured we wouldnt get any backup though i could see the holdoff on payment roger and cyndi might be okay and if they werent he might want the house after we burned it out the cement walls wouldnt be damaged nor the tolle roof the compound was ominously silent as we let ourselves in through the gate with a little macheteprying we went in machetesfirst once we established that the coast was apparently clear we brought in our bottles of kerosene we laid them out along a line on the dirt path up to the cement porch dropping small matchboxes as we went wed long since learned how to play zombiehunting like a video game you wanted to lay down ammunition coming in along the routes where youd be most likely to come hellforleather back out screaming and scrambling to avoid those clutching hands and snapping teeth zombies werent too fast and they werent too bright they didnt last all that long either maybe six months but once they got fixated on you theyd keep coming and theyd run you down if you didnt burn them pin them or find sanctuary the house was probably bigger than would be comfortable or safe for a single volunteer or even two peace corps admin had made some weird decisions in the past about security on that score not that it mattered now id learned fast during training to take care of my own safety as much as possible in fact josie and i had bonded then over our cynicism about some peace corps policies wed been in community development before the outbreak if you can believe it we busted into the house fast machetes and matches out we thought we were ready for what wed find we werent the house had an open plan to allow for the february heat in the middle of the dry season it had three bedrooms coming off a huge airy living room that shaded off into a back porch with big clay pots round and red in the middle of the living room near a wooden couch that had been turned over and smashed lay a zombie it had been staked down with a metal spike through the ribs impressive whoever had done it must have used a sledgehammer the zombie kept trying to get itself free but couldnt do so without ripping itself in half even so it was still trying scrabbling feebly at the cement floor it took me at least a minute to recognize roger his face had bloated up and slid sideways in the heat his guts had burst out onto the floor he had to have been dead for most of the past two weeks the soiled tshirt gave him away wed been in training together and he was still wearing the shirt our group had designed along with the usual peace corps uniform of jeans and hiking boots that we were wearing for the job a lot of volunteers eventually went native in their clothing styles switching to cooler tailored cotton pajamas and flipflops not roger sweet mary mother of god josie said recognizing him at the same moment she looked ready to puke i wasnt surprised she and roger had dated for about a week in training before she found out he was an asshole training relationships usually burned fast and furious then guttered out just as fast thats one way to put it i could see her having a few issues walking in on a zombified person shed once fooled around with as our voices echoed i realized that the house seemed awfully quiet as if someone was hiding further in holding his or her breath if cyndi had been zombified why would she be hiding from us why not attack where the hell was she i sidled up to josie sound really carried off glosspainted walls and polished floors i leaned close and whispered i think cyndis still in here she nodded and whispered back you think we should check before we clear the house and start burning cyndi had never liked josie being a tad jealous about the training fling but josie was a pro she wasnt going to let that stop her from finishing the job wellyeah at the very least wed need to make sure wed located every zombie in the place or we might not get paid somebody had staked roger to the living room floor somebody who seriously didnt want to die or get zombified it was probably cyndi but that didnt mean she was still human we catfooted down the hallway toward the bedrooms covering each other machetes can be pretty effective especially considering how much practice wed gotten in with them but they were closeup weapons which meant we could get infected by body fluids or a bite if we didnt watch it no way in hell did i want to get infected and end up like roger or that gendarme on the road from ngaounderé josie came behind me watching my back one of the fun parts of being a guy was getting to be on point as i snuck down the hallway i thought i heard a noise i stopped dead josie ramming into my back what the hell is that i whispered josie was practically clinging to my shoulders then i heard it again it was a whimper it came from down the hall we edged into the room the noise was coming from the closet somebody was hiding in there we eased up to either side machetes raised high then at a signal from josie i yanked open the door good thing we didnt stand right in front of it whoever it was came right out of the closet flailing around with a big spear we almost hacked her to pieces right there even as i recognized cyndi but then she started screaming at us actual words mostly curses hey i yelled backing up fast from the spear hey cyndi calm down its bruce and josie cyndi didnt seem to notice josie and i had to dodge and hop around the room until i managed to hack the spear in half with my machete josie clomped cyndi over the head with the butt of hers that dazed cyndi long enough that we were able to get her down and tie her up i guess she finally realized then that we werent zombiesthey dont tie you up just eat you raw she started to cry so we stopped trying to tie her up we chivvied her out of there checking the backyard to make sure it was clear and burning everything flammable as we went we managed to save a photo album and some letters though we werent sure if they belonged to cyndi or roger last we torched roger or i did that is on the front porch josie sat on top of cyndi to squash her ongoing hysterics and to keep her from watching while i went back into the living room to take care of the thing that used to be her boyfriend sorry about this roger i said just because hed been an asshole when he was alive didnt mean he deserved this nobody did i doused him with kerosene coughing at the smoke oozing through the house while he grunted and snapped at my hands then i lit a match it took five or six but he went up the grunting didnt get any more intense as the flames took him if anything it died down he moved aimlessly around while he burned finally something popped or broiled or idontknowwhat inside what was left of his brain and he settled down on the floor to smolder mostly in silence aside from the odd pop and crackle and that was the end of roger the second end the final one i hoped i backed away with a shudder and went out onto the porch leaving the doors open to get better circulation for the fire that sure as hell wasnt how i wanted to close out my peace corps service we took cyndi back to the taxi park after an alcohol bath got our money from the sousprefet and caught a car taxi back with no other passengers it cost a little extra to get the whole car but it was worth it we were covered with dried sweat already the heat of late morning wringing out more and cyndi was acting pretty claustrophobic about halfway home cyndi started to get semicoherent and more than thankful that was actually worse because then she had to tell us all about how roger had been bitten by a zombie rat out of nowhere and turned a few days later how shed survived the past two weeks being chased around the house by her zombie boyfriend afraid to go out in case she was attacked by more zombies damn that was almost as bad as ending up like roger on the way back the driver took a detour to pick something up from his house so we ended up coming in on the same road wed taken the day before from the train station in ngaounderé the remains of the dead gendarme our taxi had hit lay all over the road the limbs still moved feebly suddenly i needed a really stiff drink but wed used up all my gin for disinfectant purposes id have to go dry until we got back to the house arrêtez i shouted to the driver stop stop the car the driver thought i was nuts but he pulled over we hadnt paid him the full fare yet he wouldnt leave whatre you doing josie said getting out with me cyndi just huddled in the back seat of taxi im not leaving that poor bastard in the road i started getting the kerosene and matches out ahhh she said following my line of sight to the twitching arms and legs we didnt even bother to gather the body parts together too much risk of infection we just went up and down the road in the noon heat pouring kerosene on the pieces and setting them on fire i hoped that somehow it gave that gendarme some peace i hoped id never have to do the same thing to josie and i hoped that if i got unlucky too someone would give me the same mercy the anteroom by adamtroy castro adamtroy castros work has been nominated for several awards including the hugo nebula and stoker his novels include emissaries from the dead and the third claw of god and two collaborations with artist johnny atomic z is for zombie and v is for vampire which comes out in october castros short fiction has appeared in such magazines as the magazine of fantasy science fiction science fiction age analog cemetery dance and in a number of anthologies i previously included his work in the living dead and in lightspeed magazine his story collections include a desperate decaying darkness and tangled strings people throughout history have had many different conceptions of what an afterlife might look like the greeks imagined the sunny fields of elysium and the unending drudgery of hades the vikings imagined that great warriors would go to an endless kegger in valhalla dante imagined hell as a massive multitiered pit the image of the underworld as a place of fire may have been inspired by the volcanic island of crete and the word gehenna associated with hell is named after a fiery garbage pit outside jerusalem but what sort of an afterlife might await those who have been transformed into zombies the most bonechilling horror of the zombie subgenre has always been that the plague turns us into things we dont want to be things capable of committing depraved acts that would have appalled the people we used to be castro says we laugh when the hero of a zombie story blows away the shambling rotter in his pathbut we tend to forget that the rotter used to be a person and might have even been a human paragon stephen king wrote about his rabid st bernard cujo from the novel of the same name you cant hate the dog the dog always tried to be a good dog but something got into him something that eliminated free will from the equation how would cujo feel if somebody returned to him the capacity to understand what hed done how would a human being your mercy killer who knew you well in life and weeps for you even as he does what he must presses the rifle barrel against your forehead with a gentleness that renders the gesture more a goodbye kiss than a murder he even apologizes to you calling you by name and telling you how sorry he is you do not understand the apology or recognize your name or even appreciate that you are being put out of your misery you only know that you have been prevented from shuffling forward the atavistic impulses that drive your rotting limbs still urging you toward the very man who is about to end you you dont attempt to evade the bullet because that kind of problemsolving is beyond you you simply moan in protest and then he pulls the trigger and the world fills with fire and your head comes apart in an explosion of bone and blood and brains the wall behind you drips with everything good you were in life and everything obscene you became in death your best friend will tell himself that youre in a better place now and here we leave him wishing him well whether he manages to survive or at least dies without becoming infected because his story is unremarkable there have been many thousands just like it in the world plagued by the living dead but your own story is not yet done in fact your story might never be done and this is why you wake an infinite distance away blinking on your back beneath a sky that is neither dark nor light but rather a shade of gray that reminds you of sheets that have gone unwashed you are naked to the kind of air that raises goose bumps on your skin and assures you that youre once again alive you are hungry but it is not the hunger that you have been feeling in the days since the contagion turned you into a thing neither alive nor dead it is the hunger a human being feels the hunger of skipped meals the hunger of a body beginning to tremble from need but not yet forced to desperation it is not pleasant but it is better than what you felt as a corpse a gnawing painful emptiness powerful enough to drive ambulatory meat its cold the air has the kind of chill only possible in caves the dirt against your back feels dry and so solid that it might as well be concrete but there is no warmth in it no sense that it has ever known sun or sprouted so much as a weed but thats not the force that makes your face contort in pain a flood of unwanted memories has reminded you of the man you were in the world before everything turned to shit and taken you through every shambling step of the journey you began when you rose as one of the living dead you recall facing people youd once known and seeing only meat hearing the screams of somebody who had been wounded and left behind and feeling only hunger digging with your bare hands through the steaming belly wound of a victim who begged you to finish her off and knowing only the compulsion to shovel more of her sweetmeats into your idiot maw you remember exactly the long minutes she lasted and you remember failing to see her as a living thing even when she called you daddy you remember losing interest in her after her heart stopped staying near her only out of indecision walking away after she sat up a thing hollowed out both body and soul noticing but not caring that she tried to follow you but fell behind with every step as a mindless walking corpse preying on the warm you were spared these memories as whatever you are now something capable of knowing what they mean you will never be able to escape them you will never be able to forget what it had been like before to watch that bulge in your wifes belly grow until it became a great big promise of imminent life to hold the squirming little miracle in your hands unprepared for the sheer intensity of the love that seized you as you looked into the babys indignant face to feel that wonderment again the first time she smiled at you to live for the moments when she laughed to watch her run around you in circles her laughter like music to hold her in your arms as the world turned to shit and the skies filled with soot and everything you saw became an atrocity clutching for you both you will never be able to forget the way shed fallen into a lasting silence well into the plague after your wife died from a simple fever one that killed without forcing her to rise you will never be able to forget watching your daughters exhausted sleep while foul things moaned on the other side of a flimsy wall you will never be able to forget telling her without waking her that you would never let the bad things get her that you would never become one of them that you would never let her become one of them either you will never be able to forget the long weeks of bitter struggle that followed you will never be able to forget the moment when your own chances ran out or the way she regained her powers of speech and called you daddy just before you put an end to her you weep until you have to stop from sheer emotional exhaustion only when you fall silent for a moment do you register the many other wails in the wind standing hurts the ground is covered with a thin layer of concentrated grit that irritates your skin where it adheres to the soles of your feet you wipe the particles away with a brush of your hand but more accrues with your next step which makes a nasty crunch as you sink a millimeter or so into the surface your bodys going to have a hard time generating enough warmth to replace what the dirt leeches from your flesh and while you should be better off standing than you were lying flat on your back the air is no real improvement its thin frigid and tasteless your lungs derive no nourishment from it the surrounding landscape is just as barren the gray plain extends to a gray horizon that feels farther away than any you would have found in any desert on earth there seems no obvious dividing line between dirt and sky no border drawn that mitigates this emptiness by establishing any kind of limit there are no distant hills no sense that any one direction is preferable than any other if you had to guess you would say that there might might be a dull glow somewhere off to what you arbitrarily decide to be east but that might be imaginary too it might just be your eyes imposing detail on a landscape that otherwise offers none this is not the same thing as calling this flat purgatory uninhabited because it happens to imprison many thousands of other people crouching or sitting or lying down as far as your eyes can see wherever they come fromand you can only assume that it must be the same place you have come fromthey have been plopped down at equal distances hundreds of paces apart and they all remain alone unwilling to expend the energy it would cost to get up and form groups there are many weeping and many screaming but most are just stewing in their own silence finding enough torment within the confines of their own skulls another memory comes to you a man who had been shot in the knee the round had turned his leg to a broken twig trailing along at a sickening angle as he used a rifle butt to lever himself across a city street strewn with corpses and garbage and broken glass for some reason you had been the only one of your kind still ambulatory and this promised great things for you as you shambled toward him announcing your approach and your intent with a low moan that made the doomed figure try to crawl faster by the time you were within twenty paces of catching up with him he was looking back over his shoulder once for every yard he managed to crawl by the time youd halved that distance he was shouting empty obscenities calling you a stinking bastard when you halved the distance again he was swinging his ruined rifle like a club offering a threat that deterred you not at all once you came within reach of him he clubbed you in the belly knocking you on your back and he cried out with the savage glee of a neanderthal who had just managed to spear the attacking tiger he spent the time it took you to get up dragging himself another five yards but then collapsed gasping another sweep from that rifle put you down a second time but this time he only managed to retreat half the distance before you were on him again too late he decided to do what he should have done the first time which was club you in the skull and hope he could do enough damage to your brain to smash the terrible miracle that kept you moving but by now his strength was fading he only succeeded in flattening your nose adding your own clotted blood to the gore already painting your lips you fell down again and got up again this time he had only crawled a foot he swung the rifle again and this time did not knock you down but only drove you back a step or two which was not far enough at all no longer able to summon voice he whispered one last defiant fuck you before giving up on the rifle he could no longer lift and trying to fend you off with his bare hands that slowed you down for longer than you can now believe maybe an hour as the magnificent doomed bastard continued to refuse to submit the best you can say about him is that there was a little less left of you by the time he was done the worst is that it didnt help him and that he really should have saved a bullet for himself afterward you took your time starting with his face while he made the few sounds he still could reliving that now just one returning horror out of manyand wishing for something solid in your stomach so you could vomit something other than airyou finally understand why none of the other people you see would stir themselves to approach any of the others all of these people are haunted by the people they killed the flesh that they ate and the loved ones who lived to see them become something reeking of the grave that wanted to drag them into the same bottomless darkness who would want to see another human face with that on their conscience like them you want to just sit alone and stew in your misery but then something drives you forward anyway you select one of your closest fellow prisoners a pale fat mound sitting on the ground about a hundred paces away she looks up long enough to see you coming but then turns her attention back to the dirt and doesnt move at all as you cross the gulf between you as you draw near you see that her skin is just as colorless as the sky except for the places where particles of grit now cling like parasites shes not obese not really but she has enough excess flesh to form a donut around her waist there is a tattoo on her arm but its an old one and has become a faded purple smudge that no longer conveys whatever it had once been meant to signify when you stop before her she glances at you her weariness heavy enough to fill up a world what do you want what is this place she barks a bitter laugh did you just arrive is it hell she shifts her weight just enough to set the excess flesh jiggling a sad little dance that gives the impression of life for all of two seconds before inertia reasserts herself and the rolls of flesh once again take on the character of stacked corpses for long minutes you imagine her intent on waiting you out but theres little point in that not here in this place where every direction is exactly like every other and then she murmurs i was a nurse what i was a ward nurse at an old age home the floor where they kept all the patients with dementia it was the last stop theyd already been through the forgetful stage the confused stage even the dangerous stage most people dont know about when their frustration with a world they no longer understood turned them unreasonable and violent they didnt come to me until theyd forgotten who they were and what theyd lost most of them were bedridden and some were so weak with age that they didnt have enough energy to move muchbut always always there were some whod gotten it in their sixties or fifties when they were still ambulatory with energy to burn i even had some in their forties from time to time one a college professor with a beautiful little wife twenty years younger than him an exstudent who had to watch as her robust middleaged husband suddenly started turning into an old man only two years into their marriage he could run a marathon every day that one and we let him walk up the hallway and back up the hallway and back up the hallway and back nodding a kind hello to us on every pass never remembering that hed ever seen us before understand we knew that he was in a terrible situation we knew that he didnt deserve what had happened to him but for a long time it was almost pleasant getting that smile from him every few minutes he wasnt unhappy not at all he didnt know it was a care facility he just thought it was a hotel and figured that hed be able to return to his life if he could justif he could just find his room he just needed to find his room i always thought if i ever come down with it let me be like him it wouldnt be too bad if all i cared about wasfinding my room you dont understand why shes telling you this it seems random not the answer to your question at all as she winds down you come within a breath of interrupting but then she continues after a while he got worse the smile went away he forgot everything else but the shuffling walk up and down the corridor and the skin of his face went slack like a blanket draped on a chair he was no longer looking for anything there was nothing behind his eyes but the next step and the step after that he was transferred to another facility so i never found out what happened to him but when the dead rosewhen they started coming after usthe look on their faces was nothing new to me they looked like everybody in my ward some of the people i ended up with called them names like those things and those sons of bitches but i always remembered the old people on the ward the ones whod also forgotten everything and had also never asked to become what they were i never forgot that it wasnt their fault that they were just looking for something they couldnt have anymore her tired gaze long fixed on the dirt manages to move upward long enough to meet yours some of us may have been evil bastards before but what we did after the infection took us was just the infection it wasnt our fault unless gods a total maniacit wouldnt condemn us to hell and it hasnt i believed in hell i still believe in hell it may have taken me a long time to figure out but this place isnt even remotely terrible enough to be hell thenim sorry i dont get it she stabs the dirt with her thumb and draws an angry circle one that fails to connect back to itself as the curve comes around to its starting point she rubs it out and draws it again once again breaking the curve at the point where it should become perfect you get the impression that she has spent much of her time here however long thats been trying and failing to make this one simple shape and then she says after what weve donewhy would anybody already in heaven want us there the size of it almost knocks you over you spin in place taking in hundreds thousands of immobile figures with all that horror behind them and nothing that offers comfort in front of them there must be millions all told maybe hundreds of millions or even billions the poor abused world getting pretty damn unpopulated by attrition by the time your own life was ripped out you might be looking at much of the earths population but for those lucky few fortunate enough to suffer so much damage when they died that the terrible phenomenon was unable to affect them the lucky few who had not been tainted you say but thats so fucking unfair she nods without sympathy before returning to her hopeless drawing the whole things unfair isnt it you stumble away so blinded by despair and horror that you dont even thank her for the information you are still stumbling as you pass the next hopeless figure and the next figure after that the ones who look up at you and the ones who dont the ones who seem halfmad and the ones who act that way because its the only rational response to an irrational eternity you want to scream at them raise an army of them and march together toward that light in the east the one you now know to be the eden that will never let you in you know that you will never get another to stand with you let alone walk with you they all know they carry the taint they all know that while theyre not quite damned theyre as close to damned as human beings can be without actual consignment to the pit and then the rage rises out of nowhere and you throw your head back and you howl at the empty sky you know exactly who youre yelling at but you dont care you only know that what happened wasnt anybodys fault or even if it was somebodys if the plague was some exotic bug escaped from a government lab or something nobody who caught it had ever been given a choice you were no more responsible than loving family dogs gone rabid or sane men turned violent by tumors in their brains you dont deserve this emptiness this punishment that amounts to no more than the stubborn refusal to judge you you scream until you run out of breath and stand there panting as you wait for an answer but nobody answers nobody answers you scream again and this time you face the gray sky and try to bring forth a pattern in the miniscule differences in shade between one patch of emptiness and another the face of a kind and benevolent or even stern and maniacal creator looking down on you taking note of what you say and either changing his mind or smiting you for your temerity in daring to criticize him but again though you scream for a timeless time maybe longer than you existed as one of the living dead maybe longer than you existed as one of the warm no face emerges you are alone and again you wind down and sink to your knees and face the prospect of doing what all these other lost people have done which is sit your ass on some forsaken patch of dirt and let the years the centuries the millennia accrue like dust you want to thats the terrible thing you want to but the bastard has left you with one thing worth doing and so you lurch back to your feet and begin to trudge forward stopping in front of every immobile before moving on to the next aware that there may be millions or even billions left to go but not caring at all because you have nothing but time she was just a little girl your little girl it may take about as much time as it takes some mountain ranges to crumble to dustbut sooner or later youll find her when the zombies win by karina sumnersmith karina sumnersmith is the author of

writers workshop and works parttime as a bookseller at bakkaphoenix books torontos science fiction and fantasy bookstore she says she is currently battling a novel the ending of george romeros night of the living dead is pessimistic about human nature but seems optimistic about the chances of human survival in the face of a zombie pandemic after all come morning we see squads of militiamen rounding up zombies and consigning them to bonfires however in the sequel dawn of the dead we are presented with the reality that the zombie plague cannot be contained and will continue to expand exponentially and irreversibly and by the time day of the dead rolls around the world is completely dominated by zombies and only a few clusters of survivors remain the final outcome seems inevitable sumnersmith writes in a discussion about the apocalypse i joked that someone should write a story set after everyone has been eaten or turned into zombies what would the zombies eat what would they do when theres no one left to infect once id considered the consequences a total zombie apocalypse seemed not horrific nor comedic but tragic its not just that everyone has died but that we have died and yet continue to stumble through the ruins of our world with no way to understand or acknowledge whats happened or mourn the loss of everything we once were when the zombies win they will be slow to realize their success word travels slowly on shambling feet it will take years to be sure that there arent still humans hiding in high mountain camps or deep within labyrinthine caverns that the desert bunkers are empty the forest retreats fallen that the ships still afloat bear no breathing passengers and then victory yet the zombies will not call out to each other or cry in relief or raise their rotting hands in triumph they will walk unseeing beneath telephone wires and over cell phones computers radios they will pass smoldering rubble without thinking of smoke signals trip on tattered bed sheets and not consider making flags they are zombies they will only walk and walk and walk the word spreading step by step across continents and oceans and islands year by year and the word to them will feel like hunger when the zombies win their quest to eat and infect human flesh will continue unabated they will have known only gorging only feasting they will not understand the world as anything other than a screaming buffet on the run yet there will be only silence and vacant rooms where once there was food and the zombies in their slow and stumbling way will be surprised stomachs once perpetually distended will feel empty and curve inward towards their spines the strength of even animated corpses beginning to fail without fuel they will look about cloudy eyes staring and they will groan unbreathing lungs wheezing as they try to push out enough air to ask slowly hungrily brains but there will be no one left to find only each other zombies they will learn do not taste good when the zombies win they will become restless there is little to do when one is dead their old pastimestheir favorite pastimeswill hold no satisfaction they will shamble down streets arms outstretched as they groan and wail yet inspire no fear together they will pound on doors beat on windows with decaying hands until the glass shatters hide in rivers and lakes stumble after cars on the highway but the cars will all be stopped forever in park the breaking glass will elicit no screams and no swimmers hands or feet will break the waters surface to be grabbed when the doors burst open there will be no one cowering behind there will be no people to stalk no food to eat no homes to build no deaths to die lost and aimless they will turn as if seeking a leaders guidance and find none with zombies the only leader is the one who happens to be walking first so they will walk alone all of them alone with no destinations only the need to keep putting one unsteady foot in front of the other over and over without end the world is a big place to wander even when inhabited only by the dead when the zombies win they will not think of the future there will be no next generation of zombies no newborn zombie children held in rotting arms the zombies will not find comfort in each other will not rediscover concepts like friendship or companionship will not remember sympathy or empathy or kindness they will not learn or dream or even know that they cannot they will build no buildings fix no cars write no histories sing no songs they will not fall in love for zombies there is only an endless todaythis moment this place this step this need this hunger this hunger unrelenting and the streets will begin to crumble and windows break and buildings fall cities will burn and flood towns will be reclaimed by grassland and forest desert and ocean the human world will go to pieces decaying to nothing as empty eyes stare when the zombies win they will not fear they will not laugh or rejoice they will not regret they will not mourn and the world will turn and turn seasons burning and freezing across the landscape the sun flashing through the sky and they will continue when they zombies win they will not stop they will still moan and cry and whisper on and on until the lips rot from their faces their vocal cords slide away they will never truly think again never know the meaning of the words they try to utter only flutter endlessly on the edge of remembering still they will try to speak bone scraping on bone as their ruined jaws move and they will not know why one by one they will fall in the streets they will fall legs no longer working arms too broken to drag them forward inside buildings they will fall tumbling down stairs and collapsing in hallways slipping behind beds and in closets curling into the gap between toilet and wall not knowing not seeing not understanding these trappings of the places they once called home they will sink to the bottoms of rivers and oceans and lie down in fields and tumble from mountainsides and fall apart on the gravel edges of highways one by one they will stop moving flesh and bone and brain too broken to do anything more and in that silence and stillness they will struggletrapped and ruined they will still yearn still hunger always reaching for that which was taken from them that which they granted to so many of us in such great numbers to stop to sleep to rest just rest and let the darkness come mouja by matt london matt london is an author and filmmaker who lives in new york city he is a graduate of the clarion writers workshop and a columnist for torcom this story is his first piece of published fiction he has no less than three escape plans should the zombies take manhattan the samurai were a warrior caste in feudal japan who wore distinctive armor and often fought with a sword in either hand one long a katana or tachi and one short a wakizashi or tantō though they were feared because they had the authority to execute any commoner who displeased them they were bound by a strict code of honorbushidowhich demanded they commit seppukuritual suicideshould they dishonor themselves samurai have had a massive impact on popular culture everything from westerns the magnificent seven and a fistful of dollars are remakes of akira kurosawa samurai movies to star wars the film is heavily influenced by the kurosawa film hidden fortress and darth vaders helmet is modeled after a samurai helmet our next story explores what happens when these highly trained soldiers face off against their first horde of zombies the author says lore would have us believe that samurai were almost superhuman in their devotion but of course people are people i wanted to create a character who is a slave to what he is much as the zombies are slaves to what they are i studied film at nyu where i had a passionate interest in kurosawa and horror cinema seven samurai essentially has the same plot as most zombie movies protagonists improve the defenses of a location deal with social problems among the survivors and then fight off the horde londons primary resource in writing the story was the hagakure by tsunetomo yamamoto a samurai howto pamphlet written in the eighteenth century its opening line is i have found the essence of bushido to die in other words when you have a choice between life and death then always choose death which somehow seems appropriate as a leadin to a zombie story from the window of his guard hut takashi shimada watched the trees three of the mouja lurked at the edge of the forest on the far side of the rice paddies takashi could just make out their shapes through the thick misty rain that made the flooded paddies seem to boil two of the figures at the edge of the forest were men in muddy tunics caked with blood the third was a woman her kimono shamelessly open takashi watched waiting as the shadowy figures shambled toward the village it did not matter if they traveled one mile per day or a hundred the dead were coming and they carried with them a hunger for human flesh a loud twang pierced the silence like the string of a shamisen harshly plucked an arrow whizzed through the air cutting through raindrops as they fell to the earth it struck one of the men in the forehead splitting his rotting skull like a ripe kabocha undeterred the other mouja lumbered forward as the mans body fell to the ground in a heap in the next hut over seiji stood motionless unwavering since letting the arrow fly his falcon eyes peering into the distance takashi wondered if seiji was admiring his precise shot or if his mind was elsewhere asking himself why he had come to this inconsequential farming village to fight these monsters all of the samurai had doubted their mission since arriving at the village though none of them shared their concern with the otherssuch behavior was unbefitting of a samurai seiji finally lowered his bow then knelt on the ground after a moment of silent meditation he drew an arrow from his rabbithide quiver nocked it and rose to his feet once more when the mouja first arrived it was discovered they only fell when struck directly in the head by an arrow sword or spear takashi recalled the samurais confusion as they watched the creatures approach the village looking like blowfish their bodies riddled with arrows seijis technique was so precise he never wasted an arrow when only a few wandering mouja appeared at a time the other samurai left it to him to eliminate the threat watching the fluid elegance of seijis ritual put takashi at peace seiji raised the bow so that the horizontal shaft of the arrow was level with his eyes he extended his hands his movement loose and calm his knuckles were curved as if he held two tiny teacups in his fingers had takashi been the one holding seijis bow he would have found it difficult to fire at a woman he might have needed seiji to place a nimble hand on his shoulder and remind him that it was not a woman anymore seijis drawing hand opened like the wing of a bird and with remarkable grace he let the arrow fly it was a perfect shot the arrowhead pierced the womans eye erupted out the back of her skull and passed through the remaining mans eye socket as well the arrow continued on finally coming to rest in the soggy bark of a lilac tree takashi looked away feeling the vomit crawl up his throat he wondered whose grandmother dead and buried years before that had been he wondered whose father too slow to escape the mouja had just been defiled in this new world bushido was just a specter lurking in the dark caves of samurai minds takashi knew a curse had fallen over the five islands that none could die without rising as a perverse rotting thing mindless and hungry for flesh to obey the honor laws was to set a place for death at ones own table edo kyotofor all takashi knew all of the major cities had already fallen this little village would have been defenseless but the farmers had known that the mouja were on their way so they had sought out a champion they had found takashi at a trading post and begged him to take up their cause it was a hopeless task they needed an army to stand a chance but hell was coming and honor dictated it is better to go down fighting protecting those who could not protect themselves bushido or no doing anything was better than sitting around and drinking sake awaiting the inevitable so takashi had agreed and recruited a few other ronin to join him in protecting the town look alive seiji called from his window the words were a suggestion as much as a greeting i am going to retrieve my arrows you never know when we may need more than we have shout if you see anything that needs killing seiji bounded from the hut and splashed across the rice paddies the rain beating down on his gray cloak when he reached the three mouja corpses seiji checked to make sure they were truly dead by prodding them with his katana takashi marveled he had not even seen seiji draw his sword other samurai had been recruited to defend the village but takashi would have traded any two of them for another seiji he was more dangerous with a fish knife than the others were with swords days earlier isao the youngest among the samurai protecting the village had been watching seijis unmatched accuracy at work your aim is perfect every time he had said what is the trick the trick seiji had said is not caring if you hit the target the rain stopped as the sound of roaring water faded takashi came out of his reverie on the edge of the forest seiji was examining his arrows one shaft had broken two inches below the fletching so seiji snapped off the arrowhead and kept it the other arrowthe one that had killed two mouja with one shotwas fine once the gore was stripped off after sliding the arrow into his quiver seiji started back across the paddy field but then suddenly froze his ears pricked up and he looked like a thirsty buck at a stream from his expression the cause of his concern was clear he was being hunted with the slightest motion of his head seiji turned takashi followed his gaze through the trees he could see a chubby bearded man wearing a leather armor breastplate and deerskin chaps with a brown bandana around his head his face was ashen his eyes the color of bird droppings the mans left arm and his teeth were missing and a ropy line of blood and saliva dribbled from his mouth if not for the beloved hatchet slung across the mans back takashi never would have believed it was minoru poor minoru the first of the samurai to fall had now vacated the funeral mound where the others had buried him he stood leaning against a tree staring at seiji with a hungry mouth and those swirling eyes all of his good humor was gone only the hunger remained seiji raised his sword into a medium stance and looked at takashi as if to ask should i takashi had to tell himself that this creature was no more minoru than a palace raided by bandits was still a kings home minorus mind had new tenants takashi nodded to seiji then looked away he shut his eyes as he heard the heavy thud of minorus severed head hitting the ground as seiji returned to takashis hut the young samurai isao came running up to the rear window masters masters come quickly he shouted the villagersthere was something they didnt tell us about the outlying homesteads we just found out theres a hunting lodge about an hours walk from the center of town long walls strong wooden building apparently an old woodsman used to live there but he died a few years ago master takashi master seiji the farmers say there are rifles hidden in the lodge master toshiro wants to go get the rifles do you think the rifles will fend off the mouja takashi and seiji ordered two farmers to take their posts and followed isao to the town square on the way they passed the fields where old men and women not fit for sentry duty were up to their elbows in murky water they harvested the rice impassively these farmers were a simple people simple and simpleminded they had no music no art no higher purpose all they cared for was the harvest and they would defend the harvest at any cost their only drive was to feed their families daisuke toshiro and the mayor were waiting for the other samurai by the old well in the center of town the situation was as isao had described toshiro was shouting at the mayor furious that he had not told the samurai about the rifles but of course the farmers had kept it secret in tough times samurai could be just as greedy as the mouja consume just as much ronin were known to burn villages rape daughters steal property and even kill men for no reason daisuke was in favor of retrieving the rifles but not so close to dark toshiro and isao wanted to fetch them right awaytoshiro for the adventure isao out of fear the young one did not think they would last the night without stronger arms takashi agreed with daisuke at least three samurai would have to go to the hunters lodge and leaving the villages defenses so thin at night would be suicide toshiro slapped the ground with both hands dont you see you fool with those rifles we could fight them from a safe distance we lost minoru because he was forced to get close to the mouja and draw his sword rifles can be fired from a safer distance than bows we must retrieve these weapons now the boy is right the sun sinks quickly the darkness calls those foul things like a hungry dog to supper we need the guns in the hope that seiji could sort out this mess takashi turned to receive the skilled warriors advice but when he looked the samurai was gone this argument was not his concern slaying the foul creatures and protecting the villagers were all that mattered to him so takashi was the deciding vote he was the leader after all they would wait until morning and at dawns first light he daisuke and isao would set out for the hunters lodge to retrieve the guns day turned to dusk and the sun splattered the western ridge with fire takashi squinted at the horizon the silhouettes of the monsters looked like scarecrows jutting up from the crest of the hill overlooking the village master takashi master takashi isao again he ran up to takashi breathless it is toshiro master he told me he was going off to the hunters lodge alone he is going for the guns takashi felt his stomach tighten into a thick knot they could not spare a man without assistance toshiro would be lost and with him the village takashi ordered isao to take his bow and join daisuke at the barricade he posted most of the townspeople at the river where the water would slow the creatures enough for the farmers to pierce them with their spears takashi then ran to seijis post to tell him what had happened and together their swords glinting in the light of the setting sun they made for the hunters lodge regret crept into takashis mind to leave the village when so many mouja were on the move when so few villagers were primed to defendthe desertion shamed him his fear unbecoming of a samurai fogged his mind all the way through the woods on occasion seiji halted their progress and drew his sword just long enough to finish off the mouja that lay tangled in ferns along the path it is fortunate we have encountered so few on this journey seiji said as he wiped his blade clean if our luck holds up toshiro may still be alive when we find him as they walked takashi noticed groves of flowers lined the hillsides the trees had white pink and yellow blossoms each dripping gemstones of rain the samurais thoughts wandered back to the village hopefully the farmers had picked up the patrols seiji and he were missing the farmers vigilance would be integral to their survival if they kept the watch they might just make it through the night apprehension coiled around takashis throat like a serpent he should have left seiji in charge of the villages defense and taken daisuke with him to the lodge but the truth was takashi feared what hid in the everdarkening woodland his concern for his own life and the knowledge that seiji was at his side kept him feeling safe so he chanced to leave the village with weakened defenses and tried to stay optimistic perhaps they would retrieve toshiro and the rifles return safely and defend the village with great success his gamble still might pay off they stepped through a small grove of trees and saw the hunters lodge in the distance the building was the same width as the farmers cottages but three times as long about the size of a small barn seiji stepped cautiously toward the building i smell blood takashi said but seiji ignored the warning and entered the lodge takashi sniffed the air scanning the trees inside the floor was sprinkled with dry hay tanned animal skins hung from the walls a dusty bedroll took up one corner of the room a hunched figure bathed in shadow crept around the far side of the lodge a large clay pot smashed to the floor as the figure tore open a storage crate he pulled out a long stiff bundle wrapped in blankets and began to unravel it toshiro takashi called out the rugged samurai turned to face them the barrels of three muskets were visible in his arms he grinned his teeth flashing in the darkness and laughed a monkeys laugh you see this he spat on the floor with these we can take out those filthy mouja for sure and you were going to let them just sit here and collect dust ha takashi was about to reprimand the stubborn fool when seiji said we must go at once he made for the door the instant seiji opened the door he slammed it shut again he took a pitchfork from a rack of tools on the wall and slid it through the door handles barring the entrance they are upon us seiji said at least twenty load those muskets we must fight a cacophony sounded outside the lodge rotting fists banged on the walls the windows the door even the ceiling takashi could hear unbearable suffering in their groans the creatures were starving the samurai each grabbed a rifle seiji swiped toshiros weapon away from him we do not have the time or ammunition to teach you how to aim carrying a gun in each hand seiji ran to the window and fired the first rifle then took the other and slew a second mouja takashi aimed out the window on the opposite side of the lodge and fired into the crowd assembled there the lead ball struck one of the mouja in the throat the creature gurgled and kept moving forward takashi gritted his teeth and stabbed the wounded mouja in the head using the barrel of the musket as a spear it collapsed outside the window dropping from view seiji tossed the two muskets to toshiro reload he demanded drawing his sword a flash of glinting steel left three of the dead in pieces outside seijis window takashi released his second round incapacitating another mouja so only an infinite number remained behind him he heard toshiro fumble with the ramrod trying to pack the gunpowder into place as soon as he finished seiji snatched the muskets then aimed them out the window and fired off two quick shots i would also like to fight i am not your student toshiro barked as takashi hurried to the center of the room to load another round seiji grabbed takashis rifle and threw it to the ground he kicked the muskets from toshiros hands sending them skittering across the floor forget it seiji said it is no use takashi toshiro draw your swords for the last time better we go down fighting with steel in our hands but the despair of seijis words only seemed to energize their blades takashi rushed to the window and began to jab and thrust piercing the brains of any mouja close enough to strike toshiro and seiji matched takashis tactic they struck down dozens in this way and the bodies piled up in front of the windows obstructing the approach of the others ha ha toshiro whooped were making our own barricade of flesh perverse but effective time moved fast in the thick of battle bodies accumulated in three mounds outside the windows of the lodge before long the windows were covered completely with the windows blocked the chamber darkened and the foul noises dampened but the smellthe smell penetrated them it saturated their clothes and skin even their topknots the samurai retched at the overwhelming reek of death even seiji was not immune takashi covered his nose perhaps the smell will fool them into moving on if we wait they might pass by leaving us behind so we may escape toshiro appeared hopeful but seiji gave them a skeptical look i am sorry my friends but the only way we are leaving here is mindless and hungry a noise broke the silence louder than before but it was something different not the groaning of the creatures takashi looked up and wiped his blade it was coming from the ceiling the woodenslatted roof creaked and shifted under the weight of something is that the wind toshiro asked no seiji said them the roof collapsed in a hail of splinters and bodies the samurai screamed squinting against the flurry and flailed their weapons they hacked at the waterfall of ghouls that rained down on them from above black blood spattered the wallsthe hunting lodge became a butcher shop as the bodies continued to fall to the floor quick strikes from the samurais blades destroyed them takashi leaped into the air attacking the mouja before they could drop down into the lodge he stabbed the head of one of them and the body brought his weapon to the floor as it dropped as he struggled to remove his sword from the skull of one of the fallen he chanced a look up and saw a mouja dangling above him about to fall seiji cried out takashis name and pushed his comrade out of the way he grappled with the mouja as it fell upon him toshiro hurried to the rescue he stood over them following the moujas head with the tip of his blade the thing was a young man no older than nineteen toshiro pushed his blade straight through the young mans earbut it wasnt really a young man anymore it was a dead thing seiji sat up clutching his bloody hands the creature had bitten off the third and fourth fingers of his left hand he glanced at takashi expectantly toshiro backed away waiting for takashi to make a move takashi had always viewed seiji with a certain invincibility and seeing him in that state unable to shoot barely able to wield a katana it set takashis heart on the edge of a blade seiji howled his body snapped rigid and flailed about on the floor his muscles hardened his skin turned to the color of the ocean depths and his eyes clouded like dirty cubes of ice he emitted one last sound a sound like steel against a rough stone beneath the grating noise takashi discerned a single wordkaishakunin seiji retained none of his masterful dexterity in the afterlife his stiff legs fought to propel him forward limping and forcing every jerky step his arms dangled his fingers could not flex his sword forgotten seijis mouth and shredded fingers dripped dark blood as they reached for takashi was seijis final word a request kaishakunin when a samurai committed seppuku the kaishakunin served as the principals second once the samurai had disemboweled himself the kaishakunin decapitated the principal to alleviate the immense pain it was a difficult job physically and emotionally was this what seiji asked of takashi it sickened him to think of destroying a great warrior such as this to kill a friend seiji lunged at takashi with a growl takashis blade flashed for all of seijis proficiencies his neck was no thicker than any other mans his head rolled into a dark corner of the room the silence that followed unnerved the remaining samurai takashi opened the door and inspected the area surrounding the lodge there were bodies all around but the rest of the mouja appeared to have vanished toshiro wrapped the muskets in the belt and blanket the way he had found them and strapped the parcel over his shoulder they may still be useful toshiro said as he joined takashi outside the lodge from a distance takashi was too stunned to lead the way so toshiro guided him back to the village the forest was dark without a torch takashi had no idea where they were going he was amazed that toshiro was able to find the right direction weaving between trees dodging exposed roots and not once did they come across what they both fearedmore of the mouja takashis thoughts were of seiji the elegant work of art that he had been forced to destroy no that he had chosen to destroy there must have been a way takashi could have saved seiji or at least preserved him in his undead state long enough to find a cure for this illness the wound was superficial with skill such as his a few short digits would not have slowed seiji for long a pain twisted in takashis stomach again a dull rotting pain tying his guts into knots it was tragic really what happened to seiji is there no honor left in this world takashi shouted over the noise there was a grumbling roar in the distance growing louder a man such as seiji deserved better i should not have cut him down toshiro i have dishonored myself i must face consequences for that but no takashi thought seppuku was not the way he had a mission he had sworn an oath it was his duty to protect these helpless farmers toshiro was not listening they had reached the ridge overlooking the town down in the pit the town served one final purpose it would act as a signal fire to warn neighboring villages that the swarm was on its way the houses were all aflame the air was polluted with acrid black smoke and countless mouja prowled the streets takashi couldnt see any people they must have been in the streets among the mouja driven only to feed on their families isao and daisuke were nowhere to be found looking down at the village takashis heart sank he fell to his knees and drew his tantō slowly and carefully takashi untied the sash of his kimono and pulled it open he tucked the sleeves beneath his knees he wanted to be sure to fall forward i swore to protect these people toshiro and i have failed this is my fault this is no ones fault toshiro said it was my decision to leave the village and this is the result toshiro you will have to be my kaishakunin once i make the cut be very quick and careful i do not want to return as one of those things when i am gone hurry to the next village you are fast in the dark perhaps you can warn them before those creatures arrive toshiro sneered he grabbed takashi by the collar no i will not allow you to do this better we go down fighting with steel in our hands besides two samurai with katanas are more powerful than the tallest tsunami we will take many of them with us we may even find survivors takashis eyes met toshiros intense gaze where seiji had skill toshiro had spirit takashi held out his hand toshiro grasped his arm and pulled him to his feet they drew their swords walking with deliberate steps down the ridge their eyes glowed with fire they navigated around the fallen bodies cutting down mouja whenever one came near takashi whispered these poor farmers they never stood a chance toshiro spat it is their lot to suffer at the center of town a crowd of mouja had congregated their shadows danced on the sandy ground like demons in the firelight one thousand cloudy eyes found the samurai at once the mouja charged takashi and toshiro swung hard blood and fire glinted on their blades category five by marc

appalled that the most disadvantaged people were bearing the brunt of the disaster i finished the first draft of this story in one sitting funny what happens when youre fueled by outrage also my childhood home in sacramento was almost flooded a few years back i was in los angeles at the time believe me its grim to get a call from your folks in the middle of the night and hear the fear in their voices as they tell you the leveewhich is less than a mile away from themis about to break remy listened to the wind beat the walls listened to the rain whip the windows since the power was out and it was after sundown hed lit candles in the bedroom and rest of the house he might have considered the thrashing beat a hip tempo if not for what hed heard over the batterypowered radio crackling on the dresser category five this hurricane was supposed to be the worst in a generation like nothing theyd seen yet the mayor had done little to get folks like him and marta out they were late seventies too poor to afford a car too old to venture far on their own they were black they didnt matter their home was ramshackle single story built long ago in a crumbling ward that sat below sea level and lacked the comfort of close neighbors on the radio hed heard that the th street canal levee was under assault by storm surge from lake pontchartrain if the levee failed the ward didnt stand a chance their home didnt stand a chance he sat next to marta who lay under thick covers eyes closed breathing fitfully he placed a wrinkled palm on the wrinkled forehead of his love her sweaty skin the color of coffee and sooty with age but still beautiful to him after fifty years of marriage remy touched her as he listened to the radios thick crackles to the broken bits of news to the random chatter other wards had been flooded hed made out that much the water had carried away cars and trucks had swept houses from their foundations and had caved in crypts and mortuaries freeing the bodies within thats where things got strange he thought hed heard reports that said disinterred bodies were coming back to life witnesses on the radio had sworn it was true supposedly dead bodies had writhed and flailed as floodwaters swept them along and when theyd washed against higher ground theyd clambered to their feet and walked walked he shook his head here people were spinning foolish tales about the walking dead when marta couldnt walk at all well get through this you n me remy whispered taking his wifes hand like we got through so much else she moaned softly marta had been sick for a long long time so long in fact that hed nearly forgotten what their life had been like before the disease ovarian cancer it didnt make sense to him since she was far past childbearing agenot that theyd had childrenbut her ovaries had become polluted just the same and the cancer had spread to her stomach and then her spine well get through this hon he repeated but didnt know how to make good on the promise if the levee broke how could he when most of the city had run off when the police and fire fighters had run off as well lightning flashed casting the room bright white and then thunder growled as fiercely as the apocalypse taking the radio remy shuffled down a dark hallway into a kitchen lit by candles he fetched more matches from a cupboard and then counted cans they had enough food for a week which would have been fine if the morphine hed dripped so carefully onto martas tongue with a babys eyedropper hadnt run out that very morning he couldnt call the hospital for more either because the landline was dead and hed never been able to afford a cell phone of course that was assuming the hospital staff hadnt left town which they probably had without morphine marta had nowhere to hide from the pain already it was becoming too much for her one moment shed be lying there peacefully and the next shed be mewling and balling her fists and crushing her eyes closed with such force that hed feel her agony like it was his own mewling that was the only sound she could make now remy looked into the living room at his trumpet which hung on the wall in a glass case above the fireplace hed put it away over a year ago when marta got so sick she couldnt sing along with him any more at times hed fooled himself into believing that folks had come to the bourbon street clubs they booked to hear his sharpnoted riffs but deep down hed always known theyd come for her achingly hourglass in formfitting blue marta would take the stage as quietly as an afterthought press her full lips to the mic and then float her voice sweetly robustly through a rooms smoky air in time with his trumpets plaintive moan jazz blues gospel rockshe could sing them all transform them all her soulful smoothrasping lullabies never failed to transfix to shake free what was hidden to soothe like promises of hope the damaged spirits of those who listened none more than his none more no more martas voice had been siphoned by the cancer what he would do to give marta her voice back to stop her constant suffering the radio crackled remy placed it on the kitchen counter and fussed with the dial broken he heard the broadcaster say th street canal leveemercy on our souls remy went cold with fear so it had happened he had to get marta outside and up onto the roof but how could he when he lacked the strength to move her fast enough to beat the coming floodwater suddenly an idea occurred to him he dashed to the utility closet whipped out his raingear an opaqueplastic poncho to cover his tweed jacket shabby white shirt and gray slacks and galoshes to cover his cracked oxfords and then as he grabbed a shovel he heard it a deep and distant roar that swelled like the charging thrum of a thousand battle tanksa sound hed last heard as a young man in the killing fields of koreauntil it shook the floor the walls the house the glass case surrounding his trumpet shuddered then cracked down the middle as plaster dust fell in streaks from the ceiling the roarnatures own terrible riffgrew so thick that he thought he might feel it slide against his fingers and then came a cracking trembling boom followed by a madstatic hiss the house groaned and held but for how long lightning flashed giving him a glimpse of the flood through the living room window a dark wave tumbled past followed by another and another grimy water flowed underneath the front door soaking fast across the carpet as the flood level surged against the sill and then he saw something else at first he thought it was debris held in place by opposing currents but then he realized it was the naked corpse of a manone washed from a cemetery and long dead judging by the decay the flesh was shriveled and fishbelly white the eyes were wormeaten and the jaw a skinless mandible opened and closed like the corpse was trying to describe the destruction it had witnessed open and closed open and closed the jaw opened and closed so much it made him think for a moment that stories of the dead coming back to life might be true remy chided himself for entertaining the silly idea when the corpse lashed out and grabbed the window frame he could only stare in disbelief as the thing pulled itself toward him through the roaring deluge and then slammed its rotted face into the glass the window shattered and let in a thick rush of black foulsmelling floodwater remy threw up his arms to protect his face from the glass as the thing clutched both sides of the window frame and stepped a twisted rotted foot onto the flooding carpet he continued to stare in shock not wanting to believe what he saw but unable to deny the truth before him alive alive the radio was right when the thing brought its other leg through the window and then reached for him remy snapped out of his fugue and swung the shovel the flat of the blade struck the things chest with a wetsack slap pushing it back but then it kept coming growl bubbling in its throat like it hadnt felt any pain at all he swung again striking the things face this time and the rotted skull imploded in a gush of pink the headless body took a final step before it collapsed splashing into the water which was high enough now to soak remys pants above the galoshes still clutching the shovel remy bolted from the flooding living room it wouldnt be long before the water flowed down the hall and reached the bedroom that thing was alive mind still reeling he slammed the bedroom door closed and then wedged clothes underneath it that would hold back the floodwater for only a minute or two but it was something at least holding the shovel under one arm he dragged the dresser to the middle of the floor then clambered on top of it and stood as straight as he could without hitting the low ceiling ill be right back hon remy said trying to keep the panic from his voice just wait there as best you can marta mewled gripped the blankets the morphine was wearing off and he felt her growing agony in his chest in his heart age had taken a toll on him but he knew it had taken more of a toll on the cracked offgrade ceiling he jabbed the shovel up again and again shattering thin plaster rending pink insulation splintering wormeaten beams finally he broke through brittle shingles and saw the night sky raindrops pelted his face as he wormed up through the ragged hole and then stood on the roof near a small brick chimney wind whipping his poncho by light of the moon he saw that the water had taken the entire neighborhood uprooting trees rolling cars flooding houses creating a trashstrewn sea in every direction he and marta could expect to be stranded for a long time too long and then he noticed flailing silhouettes flowing among the houses when lightning revealed what the moon hadntdozens of animated dead like the one that had broken through his window caught in the rushing floodwater rotted bodies broken bodies bodies with limbs missing bodies stripped of flesh some floated and thrashed while others strode through the chestdeep water straining to escape the vicious current over the din of rushing water came a flat plaintive sound moaning he realized a wailing chorus from the dead that rose up with a life of its own remy closed his eyes and considered his only choice god willing hed have the strength to hoist marta through the hole and onto the roof and then hed do his best to cover her with his poncho to keep her dry and hide her from the dead things that surrounded them but theyd still be stranded and marta would still be without her morphine below marta cried out in agony desperation shot through him what else could he do he scrambled around the roof looking for a safe way off but the water was everywhere rushing past in black whitecapped fury he scanned the surface for debris for a bobbing chunk big enough to use as a raft but again there was only black water black water and the thrashing floating bodies of the animated dead marta cried out again voice tinged with such pain such agony that remy moaned in frustration and blind emptiness as rage blossomed along with his fear he beat the chimney until his knuckles were bloody crying out himself his own anguish mingling with martas cries and the moans rising up from the dark water around him and then he felt a sudden calm come over him there was another way out of this another way for a moment he felt a flicker of doubt but another cry from marta decided the issue the animated dead moved with ease and felt no pain that much had been clear from the thing in his living room as unbelievable as it seemed he could not doubt what he had witnessed or question the opportunity that had been placed before him he wondered about martas voice as he lowered himself back through the hole in the roof and onto the dresser would it return when her pain disappeared he listened to the moans coming through the wall as clear as a backup chorus maybe the dead could do more than moan was that so hard to believe in the face of all this maybe the dead outside chose to moan their woe chose to moan in eulogy for the living who no longer grieved for them but such would not be the case with marta and him they would choose to do otherwise they had each other theyd always have each other remy clambered down from the dresser rushed to martas side and leaned over to kiss her forehead she opened her painstricken eyes do you trust me he whispered she blinked her eyes once slowly in reply always nodding he turned and opened the bedroom door the floodwater rushed in to soak the tops of his galoshes then chilled his calves then his knees the cold water kept rising as he sloshed back to the bed sat by martas side and stroked her forehead it had to be something in the water that brought the dead back it had to be close your eyes hon he said but she didnt close her eyes he knew she could sense his doubt his fear in fifty years he could never keep a secret from her she might have known what was about to happen too because she reached out gently pulled his face to hers pressed her lips to his ear and began to sing for the first time in so so long her raspy painetched voice scraped only the bottom of the notes she used to reach but it soothed his spirit just the same long enough and completely enough until the floodwater delivered them into their new beginning living with the dead by molly brown british science fiction awardwinner molly brown is the author of the novels invitation to a funeral and virus her short fiction has appeared

and the years best fantasy and horror many of these stories have been gathered in her collection bad timing and other stories in addition to writing prose fiction brown has written and appeared in a several short zombie films and some of her stories have been optioned for film andor television one of the challenges of assembling an anthology of zombie fiction is deciding exactly what constitutes a zombie story the term originated in the caribbean and originally referred to recently deceased individuals who had been brought back to life through magic to serve as slave workers after the word zombie was used in connection with the marketing of george romeros film dawn of the dead the term has mostly been associated with masses of mindless hungry undead who kill and convert the living in recent years the film days later and the video game left dead have depicted zombies as belligerent infected who arent actually undead however they are otherwise so similar to romero zombies that everyone calls them that and they can really be classified no other way but where do you draw the line in this anthology series weve chosen to take an inclusive view and expose readers to the broadest possible spectrum of zombie fiction which brings us to our next story one thing thats been interesting to watch is how the term zombie has fallen into colloquial usageie we often refer to people as zombies when theyre performing mindless tasks or planted in front of the television or in a state of emotional detachment even if theyre not trying to kill anyone on this view the defining feature of zombies is that theyre animate but not present our next story is a quiet tale of suburban life that explores this side of zombiehood i went to the park today and for the first time in five years alice looked at me as if she knew me alice used to be my best friend we were in the same class at school we used to do each others hair and borrow each others clothes until one night when we were both sixteen and everything changed the details dont matter now all you need to know is we were at a party in a basement and we both snorted something that we thought was cocaine but it wasnt the next thing i remember is waking up in the hospital with everyone telling me it was a miracle i was alive because the other girl was dead thered been a story in the local paper a couple of months earlier about a guy whod collapsed in the park he was declared dead on arrival at the hospital and was taken to the hospital mortuary a few hours later he woke up no one thought much about it at the time everyone just assumed hed been mistakenly declared dead when he was actually in a coma these things happen not oftenand never before in the kind of place where nobody dies without the whole town knowing about itbut they happen the man hadnt spoken once since waking they said he just stared into space i remember they interviewed some expert on the news who used a lot of big words just to say sometimes its like that when you wake up from a coma alice had been dead a little over twentyfour hours when she opened her eyes like the guy before her she never spoke or reacted to anyone or anything she just seemed to stare into the distance as if she was looking at something no one else could see a few weeks later they sent her home saying there was nothing they could do i wasnt that well myselfas everyone kept reminding me i was lucky to be alivebut i went to visit alice every day we would sit in her room with me talking and her staring straight ahead as if i wasnt there and every day as i left her mother would beg me to come back again tomorrow youre her best friend keep talking to her maybe you can bring her back when a fortynineyearold man named sam jenkins woke up the morning after hed died of a heart attack people finally began to suspect that something strange was going on this man was definitely dead the doctors insisted they were being especially careful about who they declared dead these days sam jenkins had been repeatedly checkedand doublecheckedfor any signs of life and his body had been cold when they finally allowed it to be taken to the mortuary like the previous two people to wake in the hospital mortuary sam jenkins never spoke unlike the other two sam jenkins had risen naked from his mortuary slab walked home without being noticed it was four am and the streets were empty and got into bed beside his wife by the time rosemary harold died of cancer theyd decided the problem must be something to do with the mortuary so they kept her body upstairs this didnt make any difference rosemary was awake the next day then everyone thought maybe it was something to do with dying in the hospital soas much as possiblepeople started dying at home once again no difference they all opened their eyes within twentyfour hours people eventually came to the conclusion that the problem was the townas far as anyone knew this wasnt happening anywhere elseso the next time someone died the body was immediately shipped to another state but the guy still woke up the other state wouldnt allow him to staythey said it was not their taxpayers responsibility to support another states walking deadso he was brought back here soon the dead fell into a routine of spending their afternoons in the park youd see them there from one oclock every day sometimes sitting on benches with their faces tilted up to the sun other times just standing in a kind of loose formation and every day at dusk they would go their separate ways returning to the homes theyd known in life some like alice were obviously cared for by the living alices mother always made sure that her clothes were clean and her hair was combed but others were not so comfortable with their dead on finding her husband in bed with her sam jenkins widow had at first moved into the spare room but having a dead man in the house soon became too much for her and she changed the locks with the result that her dead husband spent his nights standing on the front lawn it was around this time that i first heard the word zombie being used the first thing that happens when the dead start waking is not that they go on a rampage like you see in the movies its that you find out all your insurance policies are worthless sam jenkins had a life insurance policy with his wife as the beneficiary but the insurance company refused to pay out because they said sam didnt meet their definition of dead then alices mother got a huge bill from the hospital because her daughterbeing officially deceasedwas no longer covered by her health insurance the second thing that happens is property values plummet sam jenkins widow unable to pay the mortgage tried putting the house up for sale but nobody wants to buy a house with a dead man standing on the lawn even iflike sams widowyou try to make the dead man a selling point by explaining he deters burglars the third thing that happens is church attendances rise the fourth thing is they fall again as everyone comes to the conclusion theres no point in worrying about the afterlife if youre only going to spend it hanging around the park the fifth thing is all the jobs go as businesses tend to prefer locations where the dead stay dead the next thing that happens is the town itself begins to die as everyone who can get away gets as far away as possible until the only people left are the dead and those few who refuse to abandon them sometimes i go to the park and watch the dead together despite being all different ages and backgrounds they seem at ease in each others company the silence of the dead when faced with the living can seem awkward but when the dead are together their silence is a comfortable one their blank faces not so much vacant as serene and though their faces are far from expressive i was there one day as a newly deceased came to join them for the first time and i am sure i saw recognition in their eyes five years ago there were more than three thousand people in this town now there are less than three hundred as the towns living population continues to move away more of the dead are being left to fend for themselves with no one to dress them or comb their hair some of them were getting into quite a state until a woman named hilary frentzen stepped in the first thing hilary did was to get a shelter built so the dead would have somewhere to get out of the rain then she set up a charitable foundation to collect donations of food and clothing which she distributes in the park the dead do eat just not a lot every day hilary hands out slices of dayold bread donated by supermarkets and watches as the dead take one or two bites and then scatter the rest on the ground for the pigeons of course the pigeonsbeing dead themselves since the town council poisoned them all a couple of years agoare no more interested in the bread than they are not even the insects are that interested since the park was sprayed so every day before she leaves hilary picks up the leftovers shes tried giving them vegetables but the dead wont touch them if you ask her shell tell you that no matter how hard she tries she cannot get the dead to eat broccoli once as an experiment hilary bought a dozen chocolate cakes and took them to the park the dead didnt leave a single crumb behind she told me she cant afford to do that every day but now once every month or so shell buy them some chocolate cakes as a special treat even dead wasps perk up at the smell of chocolate which is another reason she doesnt bring it too often hilary used to get very annoyed when tourists turned up with portable sound systems playing thriller at full blast or shouting they dont want bread they want brainzzz but that kind of thing has been happening less and less since the state barricaded the highway and put up all of those quarantine signs and theres hardly been a single crime since the day a guy who was stripping the lead off a dead persons roof slipped and fell breaking his neck hes been in the park ever since walking sideways with his head twisted over one shoulder i dont think the dead feel any pain when i used to visit alice in her room id always ask her do you feel any pain do you feel anything but shed never answer then one day as we sat with me talking and her staring into space i picked up a pin and jabbed it hard into her arm she moved her head slightly just enough to look down at the pin you felt that didnt you i said does it hurt she went back to staring into space when she stood up to leave for the park the pin was still protruding from her arm i reached up and pulled it out she didnt notice the dead dont seem to age either eating only a few bites of bread a dayplus one piece of chocolate cake a monththeyve all lost a bit of weight but otherwise they havent changed id kind of expected their hair to keep growing but that doesnt seem to be the case which is probably just as well because the deads hair is invariably a mess someone living always has to comb it for them because for some reason they will not do it themselves the one exception to this is rosemary harold who died without a single hair on her bodynot even an eyelashbecause shed been in the middle of chemotherapy alice is one of the few dead people in the park who hasnt been reduced to wearing handmedowns thanks to her mother who still buys her new clothes when she needs them the first couple of years she used to take her to the mall which wasnt easy since the sales people didnt like serving the dead and wouldnt let her try anything on and there was one guard whod obviously seen dawn of the dead on television and would always follow them around scowling from the minute they arrived but alices mother persevered because she said it was the one time alice actually seemed to know where she was and why she was there she even claimed alice would invariably head straight for the most expensive thing in the shop just like she did when she was alive not that it matters now the mall is shut at one time this town had five churches four cafes six bars two auto dealerships three banks two primary schools a high school a motel a funeral parlour and a meatpacking plant which closed the day after a calfs head on a shelf in the freezer room was seen blinking all of them are boarded up now so are most of the houses the streets are full of abandoned dogs and cats its the live ones youve got to watch out for because theyre nervous my next door neighbour adopted a dead dog when i asked her why she said why not hes no trouble and he doesnt bark five years ago they said it was a miracle i was still alive three weeks ago they told me the miracle was coming to an end my organs were shutting down one by one all because of one stupid thing i did one night when i was sixteen people told me my only hope was to get out of this town before i died they told me it only happens here if i die somewhere else i wont wake up i wont end up with those zombies in the park im sure all those people were right but i knew something they didnt know ive been going to the same doctor since i was a kidhes the only doctor in town these daysand the last time i saw him he said he was going to tell me a secret remember i told you about when it all first started and how they shipped a mans body to another state to see if he would wake up and he did it turns out my doctor was sent along to accompany the body he was there when the man woke up and hed asked him what was it like being dead do you remember any of it and to his amazement the man had answered him he spoke i said my doctor nodded only that one time and never again considering what he said i thought it was best to keep quiet about it why what did he say all you need to know is there are a lot worse places a person could end up my doctor said as i left his office that last time than in the park i went to the park today and saw a dead man sitting on a bench with hilary frentzen combing his hair what is it about the dead that they refuse to comb their own hair for five years i had been telling myself that i would be the exception i would be the one who speaks who dresses herself who eats vegetables who continues to do simple things like comb her own hair but with every moment that passed these things seemed less and less important the next thing i knew i was standing face to face with alice and for the first time in five years she looked at me as if she knew me twentythree snapshots of san francisco by seth lindberg seth lindbergs short fiction has appeared in the anthologies phantom denying death the darker side brainbox brainbox ii haunting the dead jack haringa must die jigsaw nation and in the magazines not one of us twilight showcase gothicnet and chiaroscuro he is also a former editor of gothicnet and currently works as a sysadmin in san francisco where as the title implies this story takes place in nineteenthcentury photographs nobody is smiling the subjects sit rigid and stare out at you with cold serious expressions you might think humor hadnt been invented yet but actually cameras in those days had such long exposure times that no one wanted to hold a smile for that long people at least can be instructed not to move photographing animals proved more challenging one early photographer decided that the only way to get a pair of stray dogs to sit still long enough for him to take their picture was to shoot them with bullets stuff them and position their stiff lifeless bodies in front of his camera in the resulting photographs of course the dogs appear to be alive this brings us to our next story which also features photos of things that seem to be alive but arent photographs connect us to the past fading only a little over time especially compared with our memories which quickly become vague and distorted since the dawn of photography people have obsessively compiled photo albums keeping important memories locked safely in place with the advent of digital cameras its not unusual for a persons personal collection to run to hundreds or even thousands of images but what if all of that disappeared what if a handful of photos were all that remained to remind you of an entire world now lost our next story is about just such a collection and as in nineteenthcentury photographs in most of these photos nobody is smiling my exgirlfriend may used to accuse me of starting every story or joke straight in the middle like she had to ask a thousand questions just to figure out what the hell i was talking about id just babble on and shed have to route me back to all the concrete facts about the case at hand i cant help it im bad with beginnings im suspicious of them as they are life doesnt begin not really well life begins in the physical sense but as far as your memories go its not like that its not like one day you remember things the day before you didnt these memories kind of fade out back little moments like a vision of your dads face the way the back porch smelled the rest you got to fill in you suppose all together a lot like pictures really people all frozen in these expressions they never really have because you caught them in midmotion or something you have to fill in who it is and what theyre about based on that one moment so i was talking about them the other night but here they are for real twentythree snapshots of san francisco the last roll of shots i ever took the last roll i ever got developed the end of my brilliant amateur photography career i guess the roll had twentyfour exposures so im not sure why i only got twentythree maybe it got underexposed or overexposed maybe there was some kind of error when it got developed ill never know i lost the negatives so these prints are all i have freeze frame of me awkwardly leaning into a picture with may and her japanese pen pal kyoko mays got an expression from the tail end of a laugh kyoko has this half smile while flashing a peace sign at the camera for some reason im standing there looking like an idiot forgot to brush my hair my hands are shoved tightly in my pockets i made the mistake of putting my arm around may while kyoko was around before all this and may got all weird on me so im just standing there if you look hard enough you can sort of see alcatraz in the distance sitting in the waters of the san francisco bay behind that faded by haze is the marin headlands yes this was before everything happened maybe you think so because we were smiling in that picture but i think people smile for pictures out of habit really picture of the famous painted ladies victorian houses in old san francisco in a park in the middle of the western addition you can see a few people sunbathing in the grass just before it to the left ive never lived in houses like that but i bet its nice admittedly they look better in the post cards but theyre still quite pretty behind the painted ladies lies the whole san francisco skyline including the transamerica pyramid to the right you can see a pillar of smoke rising from the southern part of the city just may and kyoko hugging each other and grinning close up zoom on their faces so close you can see kyokos acne scars that old gray seconds tee shirt that mays wearing thats mine in the background people walk past and stuff i think this one was taken in the japantown peace plaza but i dont remember picture of my neighbor mr sumpter hes standing in the hallway wearing an old polyester buttonup shirt leaning to one side and putting his weight on one foot he has his head tilted and eyes open mouth closed one fist is clenched mr sumpters eyes didnt glow red when i took the picture it just looks that way now i think it was the flash from the camera i didnt know then what i know now the hallway frames mr sumpter you cant see where hes looking at but hes looking at a blank wall i was walking down the hallway and saw him like that i called out to him but he didnt say anything so i took a picture face of my roommate bradley hes grinning and the color of the photograph is bleached out by the flash his eyes are red too you can see that blond stubble of a goatee that he has and the blur in the corner is his hand holding a bottle of miller genuine draft this is important because it was the only alcohol he ever drank he wouldnt even drink miller lite or miller high life just mgd bradley was always a little bit weird i took this picture at a party we had in our apartment it got shut down a little after this because of noise complaints from my neighbors picture of may caught in a halflaugh may hated this picture the most though i personally think she looks really cute that thing in her hand is a bottle of beer i think but i dont remember what brand she drank behind are the windows of the apartment bradley and i shared you cant really see the view of the west side of the city that we got though yeah the smudges and rip on one side is from my fingers handling the sides once or twice too many group shot i dont remember a lot of these faces anymore the couple to one side those were mays friends the two guys in faded computer tee shirts those were my coworkers of course may kyoko and bradley are easy to spot im not in the picture because i was behind the camera you cant tell where this was taken but im pretty sure it was in my apartment at the party blurred picture of kyoko shes standing in the living room with one hand raised with half of her coat off she has her head tilted and her mouth is open but you cant quite see that she just got stuck that way putting on her coat kind of an odd time for it to hit the blurry black cloudlooking thing is the couch that bradley and i bought with our tax returns it doesnt look like a lot in the picture but it was really comfortable i think the picture got blurred because may was moving past me and bumped my shoulder this was just before we took kyoko to the hospital those big brick buildings are san francisco general hospital you can see all the cars in the parking lot and the crowd to one side i took this from across the street on potrero avenue picture of inside the emergency room waiting area you can see it was really packed in the corner the guy dressed in blue thats a security guard who got angry at me soon after this may you can see over by the side standing over something that doesnt look like kyoko but is her sleeping i think maybe just her shoulder and maybe a leg is all thats in the picture but she fell right asleep in the middle of the waiting area over at the corner you can see a television set note the four people watching it and one of them is just staring off into space you can tell his head is angled just a bit differently than the others but you have to hold the photograph up close to your face i think that was the last time i saw kyoko nice girl odd sense of humor i cant describe how i guess some people who learn english but dont speak it natively they get caught up with one word or two that just sounds interesting to them with kyoko it was words like susurrus shed fit it into any conversation she could i dont think she even halfunderstood what it meant she was just fooling around this is bradley and may at the jack in the box which was down by bernal heights which is pretty far south in the city without being south san francisco there are a lot of warehouses and stuff there you cant see what mays looking out the window at but its just the road i think there might have been a mcdonalds or something across the street im not sure but it was a pretty busy road behind bradley you can sort of see a figure that looks like someone standing in that awkward position again but i dont remember anyone like that when we were there so the picture probably just caught someone midstride picture of the fourcar pileup outside our apartment building id seen a few car crashes before but nothing like this one usually youd see a car crash and itd be two cars one dented and a bunch of people arguing not here though obviously the building to the left is ours the shattered window is the coffee house where i used to always get double mocha lattes with extra whipped cream in them those mochas ended up somehow tasting like some perfect mix of hot chocolate and coffee its one of the things i miss the most these days you can only see three of the four cars because the smoke from the first two is obscuring the last one thats bradley standing to one side with a stupid grin on his face near him are two cops if you look closely you can see one of them has a gun in his hand something i never noticed or even vaguely remember from the real event but there it is pictures dont lie the big car thats spun out and on the other side from the two other cars you can see by the shattered window thats a pontiac bonneville of a make and model thats nearly exactly like the old bonneville i used to drive around when i lived back in the midwest picture of our neighbors door note the scratch marks i think the doors were made of metal so whoever put their shoulder into this one had to have messed himself up although there are christmas decorations on the door it says less about the time of the year that all those awful events happened and more about just how odd my neighbors were i never knew their names i saw them once or twice seemed like nice people but the fact that they put up the christmas decorations in december and then never bothered to take them down well it seemed a bit curious picture of bradley and mr sumpter thankfully most of the blood here is mr sumpters but the bastard nearly took both of us down he was hiding in the trash bin and leapt out clawing at my face wed been alerted by this awful odor and were all keyed up what with all the blackouts and weird events in the city the two days before or we were just damned lucky anyways bradley has poor mr sumpter propped up here and is crouching next to him he looks a lot more exuberant than we were the camera sort of caught him in this smile so he looks more wideeyed and mad than he was even in death mr sumpters muscles have a certain rigidity like they all do just look at his neck its crazy some national guardsmen smoking cigarettes on the fillmore bridge over geary street across the street and over the bridge you can see some buildings and some graffiti up there and that little blues club i think the guardsmen were there to keep us from looting too much which now that i think of it would have been a pretty good idea none of us thought of it though you can just barely read the headline on the newspaper in the rack it reads chaos depending on what you read or which radio station you hear the cause is all sorts of things you know a virus or some kind of biological warfare gone wrong or gods vengeance or a comet ori dont know everything theyve got all sorts of excuses for this mess may was with me we were heading down the street to find a good corner store and to see if the atms were working again sometimes we had service other times we didnt we would have gone to the supermarket just a block back but the guard had camped out in the parking lot there was another one a few blocks away on eddy street but id never been there and besides i heard that the projects had gotten hit really hard and figured itd be better to stick to routes i knew bradley and me with our makeshift weapons at that point i spent a lot of time wishing i was a gun nut like my cousin back in ohio of course ten to one he got turned into one of those monsters and is using his prize semiautomatic ar that the government will never take away as a sturdy club bradleys weapon you can see is brightly coloredi think he had this weird idea that they were attracted to bright colors like bulls or something the whole idea being since theyre essentially exhumans creatures who have abandoned their intelligence for some razor sense of cunning that theyd be somehow animalistic in practice it never worked too well confused the hell out of one for a moment though which was just enough time for me to bash its head in mine was my louisville slugger you see when i came to san francisco i had this idea id meet all these young active people and every saturday wed hit the park and toss around a few balls or something and enjoy being in the california sun it never happened too foggy and everyone was always too damned stressed out about work guess i found a use for the bat after all kind of hard to tell whats going on here i took this picture while running to one side those bright yellow blobs right there i think thats the flash from guns the blur on the left side is someone else running away as well the guard dragged us out of our homes and there was a ton of us milling about in the middle of the street thats when a bunch of the creatures attackedand quickly too like cheetahs jumping into a herd of gazelle i saw two of them literally rip a woman in half before the guard started opening up on them the guardsmen were firing into the crowd they didnt even care this ones blurry the picture is tan theres some sort of large dark object in the center i dont know how this one ended up here i think i took the picture by accident but i keep it anyways group shot of refugees in a truck thats may there frowning and looking directly at the camera may was pissed that i wasnt going with her but there wasnt a lot of room on the truck anyways shed stolen my favorite tee shirt of my collection and was wearing it on the truck im not sure if it was extortion to try to get me to go or if she wore it out of spite knowing id probably want to stay word was that the presidio camps were only temporary the government already set up bigger more permanent facilities in the old internment camps they put all the japaneseamericans in during the second world war i heard about the slaughters in those camps but every once in a while i can imagine her up by mt shasta or someplace like that working in a field maybe doing laundry i dunno shot of bradley like the first shot of him the flash has sort of bleached out a lot of the color here look at the beginnings of a beard he has sometimes i look at this picture and picture right next to each other its hard to think that only a few weeks have passed between the two shots because he looks so much older in this one its set in his face a kind of constant panic and yeah his neck muscles are taut here and his emotionless grin too im pretty sure thats the muscles in his face constricting when i woke up he was stuck that way i slashed his throat a few minutes after taking this picture it seemed to take forever i cut into his neck and nothing happened at first and this dark blood began to flow and i remember flinching back like this was the first time or something thenthen he started screaming like he woke up and the panic hit me like a flurry of fists i shut my eyes and stabbed over and over again until the screaming stopped id killed before mostly with bradley but we had to when they come for you faster than anything eyes so desperate you learn to think on that level you get in their mindset and its okay before i killed bradley id killed or helped kill four of those beasts but when i did it i was a beast myself bradley was the first one i had to murder as a person no one should have to do that shot of my family i ran with for a few months down south by the castro after bradley died i thought i was dead no way i could hope to stand off against one of those things facetoface not even with my bat it was pure luck that got me in with some looters over by the haight then i wandered down into the castro after half of those guys died in an ambush the old guy with the rifle thats jamal peter and his boyfriend graham are in the center terence is the one saluting his wife alicias the one laughing and raising up the bottle of champagne they used to be both into computers or something before this whole mess the small one is karen always had a soft spot for her really picture of san francisco from the hills in south sf you probably recognize the transamerica building there are other buildings here but i cant name them the center bit of rubble there used to have a bunch of those buildings some people say the military bombed that area but im pretty sure it was just a gas explosion of some kind up on the hills to the left of the city you can see the lovely sutro tower as the fog rolls in like a white blanket to cover the city we were on our way out hearing about some army forming up on the peninsula it seemed like a good idea to me after karen died i justi knew i had to leave id had enough they say theres less of them out in the country but theyre more dangerous ones likely to stalk you for miles without you knowing i hear itll follow you like it has nothing better to do in the world dog you down until youre tired and afraid and used up any ammo or reserves you might have but i didnt care i was willing to take that risk recently ive started to think about may again to tell you the truth its like every once in a while i remember her just something little like the way her hair smelled or how confused she got by sitcoms never the important things just you know dumb stuff i wonder what it would have been like if i had gotten on that truck i dont know why i didnt go i think i was still in the predisaster mindset things werent working really well there towards the end it was a lot of little things you know the day those attacks started happening the day our civilization was brought to its knees all the rules changed with it all that petty bullshit it was nothing but we had no perspective to see that until the end but out of habit i pushed her away anyways i guess i still have pictures of her though no its not one of the beasts attacking me but it sure looks like one doesnt it this is actually a picture of the guy who developed my film for me i traded him my camera because i cant find film for it anyways he and i sort of set up this shot because we thought itd be funny he could mimic one of the monsters really well just sort of huff up and get all tense and bugeyed smart guy too havent found anyone that knew how to develop pictures until him he even had the chemicals some of them came out sort of weird but what can you do no matter what happens now even if i twitch out and become one of them i have my pictures i have my memories even if they are fragments i dont care i cant make a story out of my life its never worked out that way i just remember things as a collection of moments you have to fill in the rest thats maybe why i got so upset the other night the way people tell stories its dishonest they stretch those moments together they put a framework thats not there these pictures are my life at least at that time like memories only fragments impressions really like memories incomplete twentythree snapshots from a roll of twentyfour like the rest of my life those pictures came out odd some nights when i feel the cold breezes come off the pacific i stare up at the sky and the thousands of stars i never knew existed wondering how ill document these memories of mine the sunsets over the sea the valleys of redwoods that feel like sacred groves the trees that are starting to grow through suburban homes the people ive met both good and bad the scars on their faces the calluses on their hands is it right to live life knowing every detail will die ive never been good at endings either to tell you the truth i mess them up all over the place may could tell you that she used to tell me that my stories were all jokes without punch lines i never did figure out what she meant by that i bet kyokod say i was bad at endings too and bradley and karen in her own way so you might have to help me breathe in keep breathing shut your eyes then open them again take a good look around you then back at me try to remember every little detail no matter how unimportant freeze this split second in time its important this moment every stupid detail about it its you and me unwilling to forget were alive the mexican bus by walter greatshell walter greatshell is the author of the novels xombies apocalypse blues and xombies apocalypticon a nonzombie novel mad skillz is forthcoming on his website waltergreatshellcom greatshell says that the last real job he had was as a graveyardshift nuclearsubmarine technician and before that he was the general manager of the avon cinema a providence rhode island landmark in addition to writing he currently dabbles in freelance illustration numerous examples of which are available on his website in jack kerouac published on the road a lightly fictionalized memoir of his road trips crisscrossing the us and mexico the novel was written singlespaced and without paragraph breaks on a foot long roll of tracing paper that kerouac called the scroll it originally used the real names of kerouacs friends and acquaintances including the freespirited excon neal cassady and the poet allen ginsberg but their names were changed in the published manuscript at the publishers insistence to dean moriarty and carlo marx the book has been massively popular influencing artists from bob dylan to jim morrison to hunter s thompson most obviously in the latters road novel fear and loathing in las vegas on the road also seems to have exerted an influence on our next author who writes this story is an offshoot of my xombies storyline its about a young guy a college dropout who is bumming around mexico and has the extreme misfortune of being caught in the middle of a zombietype epidemicwhat i call the sadie hawkins day massacre almost every woman in the world simultaneously turns blue and goes berserk he adds i actually was a college dropout because once i discovered hitchhiking i was done with school i have all these notebooks of stuff i wrote while on the road hundreds of pages of obsessive beatnik musings that i hoped might come in handy someday who knew it would be for a zombie story tres estrellas de oro three gold stars on a green medallion possibly signifying the holy trinityor perhaps nothing at all it didnt matter what was important was that his two years of high school spanish were not completely wasted he was not just a college dropout with little money no prospects and all his remaining possessions stuffed into a rainsoaked dufflebag but a romantic figure a bohemian man of the world what did he need with aristotle and copernicus tres estrellas de orobeautiful this wasnt the bus he had started out on that one had been red and white with the words norte de sonora on the side but heavy rains had washed out the road and the bus had been forced to turn back all that headway south hours of travel just to return to the border and start over but it was okay he had nothing but time and no place he would rather spend new years eve than on a mexican bus going anywhere he had learned what was possible if you had a mapand timeand a little money just follow the dotted line it was near midnight when the second bus stopped the young man awoke from his doze and realized he had been drooling his neck hurt and his face was sore from being pressed against the vibrating window but he didnt dare move lest he disturb the beautiful canadian girl who was using his left shoulder as a pillow an elderly man across the aisle winked at him there was nothing to see outside but flat blackthe windows might as well have been painted over inside the bus it was dim and cozy with cigarette smoke drifting across the overhead reading lights muted spanish conversation simmered in the cabin and it wasnt necessary to understand the words to know what they were saying what now gears clanked and the bus moved forward weaving around a line of cars another highway accident thats allthey had passed enough of those the passengers relaxed as the bus swerved clear and gathered speed things were looking good but a moment later it abruptly stopped again with a hiss they waited perhaps there was still a chance this was only a short delay the sense of collective yearning was palpable forty people hanging on the edge of their seats then the driver turned off the engine and all hope collapsed without a word he opened the door and got out abandoned the passengers gave in to resignation actually there was a certain sense of relief as if everyone could now relax and be themselves no one was particularly angry or upset this was why he loved mexico the canadian girl came half awake taking her fragrant head off his shoulder whats going on she groaned nothing weve just stopped its probably a car accident or something where are we i dont know nowhere the mexicans were making a party of it cigarettes were lit snacks brought out and the volume of conversation increased a radio was turned on playing a live new years eve countdown from mexico city some folks got up to stretch their legs and the young man decided to do the same he would scope out the situation and bring the girl a full reportshow her he had everything under control as if a sixteenyearold girl traveling alone through the backlands of mexico needed reassurance from him outside it was quite a scene the bus was part of a long line of stopped traffic in the middle of the deserta festivelooking chain of lights spanning the void many people had gotten out of their vehicles and some were wandering down the road trying to find out what was going on there was a lit pemex sign ahead but the gas station itself was hidden by a dip in the fathomless landscape the young man wanted to walk down there and see but he was reluctant to venture too far from the bus what if the traffic started moving or the bus turned around and went back last thing he needed was to be stranded out here but he figured he was all right as long he kept the driver in sight so when that officious old character and some other men started down the hill he tagged along behind it was nice to be outside in the fresh air he had been a prisoner for hours afraid to budge and it was so stupid as if he had any chance with this incredible girl confidence with the opposite sex was not his strong suit his record with women was a catalogue of rejectionit was a rejection in fact that led to his dropping out of college and impulsively heading for mexico he tended to rush things that was his problem unrequited love was a bitch buthe couldnt help feeling that this situation was different for one thing this was mexicoa whole different universe for another he and the gorgeous canadian were the only gringos on the bus initially they had been in separate seats but jolly mexican ladies had insisted they sit together playing matchmaker for the clueless estudiantes embarrassed he had been all too ready to declineno no graciasbut to his amazement the girl came over and sat by him and from that moment on he was in love yethe didnt want everything to depend on a girl not again not here as he walked he tried to fully immerse himself in the moment in the extraordinary fact that he was alive here now on this beautiful godforsaken highway somewhere in mexico the gravel crunching under his feet the rolling horizon like a black cardboard cutout under dimly luminous clouds the tiny flecks of rain in the breezeit was all marvelous below the highway embankment he could see an army of tall pale figures with arms upraisedsaguaro cacti for a second he had a wild impulse to run down there a hike out into the desert would put things in their true perspective but he knew he wouldnt really do it the pemex station came into view an island of sickly fluorescent light it looked as desolate as a base on the moon now he could see the trouble there was another bus down there a sleek white charter bus straddling both lanes of the road it didnt look damaged but there must have been an accident of some kind because a lot of people were laying on the ground with a bunch of nurses giving them cpr not nursesnuns a busload of nuns other people were running around frantically yelling for help was he crazy or were some of the nuns chasing them the bus driver and his party ran to offer assistance other men joining them along the way until the group snowballed to twenty or thirty people they passed at least as many running in the opposite direction who frantically tried to warn them off shouting monjas locas locas but they kept going meanwhile police and military vehicles began arriving from the south pouring on their sirens as they sped along the shoulder of the road having fallen behind the driver the young man was about halfway down the hill when he realized he was walking into something very wrongand he stopped an olivedrab truck full of soldiers pulled into the gas station first before it could even begin unloading a group of peopleincluding several nunsrushed the trucks bed and leaped in among the surprised troops the canvas cover bounced cartoonishly from the violence within a police bronco stormed onto the scene and four smartly uniformed federal officers charged out shouting orders nuns rushed them and they disappeared from view was it the fluorescent light or did those nuns faces look weirdly blue at the same time the bus drivers posse was nearing the outer realm of glare from the gas station the mens elongated black shadows stretched behind them as though reluctant to get any closer but the determined hombres did not waver from their vantage it was likely they could not properly see what was happening to the police and soldiers weirdly manic female silhouettes rushed to meet them and in a second the two groups collided it was a massacre the thirty volunteers suddenly found themselves senselessly viciously assaulted tackled in flying leaps half of them were pinned to the ground before they knew what hit them their faces crushed under the searching mouths of their attackers stranger still some of these attackers were the accident victims who had themselves been receiving cpr only moments ago and more were jumping to life every second frozen in place the young man watched all this with increasing disbelief unsure of how to react but at the sound of gunfire he realized he was in over his head the bus driver obviously had the same thought as the rest of his party got caught up in the fighting he had an abrupt change of heart and ran for his life it was a close thing he was a heavy smoker and not young either but he could move when he had to come on man come on shouted the american it had occurred to him that he wasnt going anywhere without that bus driver the driver was faltering wheezing badly he had already run quite a distance and now the running was all uphill in desperation the young man sprinted down to him and took the drivers leathery arm around his neck halfcarrying him up the road the older man smelled of sweat and old spiceit reminded him of his grandfather as they retreated alongside the line of traffic they passed the bizarre spectacle of what appeared to be people making out in some of the cars mismatched couples locked in furious sexual combatthough the men were clearly not the aggressors in fact the women seemed to be sucking the very life from their reluctant male prey like spiders the american thought wildly black widow spiders a mans flailing leg kicked through a windshield spraying them with glass as they hurried by a car pulled out of line and drove down the steep embankment plowing into the ditch at the bottom truck horns brayed and they could hear small children screaming over it all was a shrill rising dinthe hyena laughter of the insane now the young man was tiring almost therealmost there they had crested the hill and he could see the bustres estrellas de orobut all around them things were getting sketchier by the second people were bursting from cars and fleeing in all directions with bluefaced monstrosities hot on their heels any second one of those things would notice them and it would all be over the number of scary maniacs was doubling as the victims revived and joined their ranksvery soon there wouldnt be anyone sane left from the direction of the gas station they could hear a demonic host approaching it was hopeless but nothing noticed themor perhaps they were beneath notice this shambling silent pair so ploddingly steadfast amid the general panicbecause suddenly they were there miraculously at the bus on the bus clambering up the steps and slamming the door behind them it was empty lupe lupita the driver called searching frantically but the bus was completely deserted it was also a ransacked mess the aisle littered with womens shoes and spilled luggage as well as teeth and tufts of ripped hair and bloodblood everywhereflung in drabs and spatters and hectic smears as by the hand of a mad impressionist it was just as well that the two men couldnt see much of this in the dark the only sound was a highpitched whine coming from the radio bad things had happened here as everywhere else but for now the bus was empty it was dark it was safe it was life for a brief moment the terror outside was muffled and remote the two exhausted men fell into seats crying and gasping for breath se viene abajose viene abajo the driver sobbed what the fuck is this man the younger man babbled what the fuck is going on out there whats happening to everyone la ley ya no está en vigor it must be some kind of chemical weapon a gas attack or some kind of mind control thingbut then why dont we have it it doesnt make any sense sea lo que sea no lo puedo creer they continued like this for a few minutes purging the raw adrenaline from their systems catching his breath a bit the driver reached into the overhead rack and turned off the radio he then pulled down two plastic bottles of milky liquid handing one to the american he said pulque and took a deep drink dont you understand im fucking losing it man im losing it a otro perro con ese hueso i dont understand a word youre saying i dont understand anything no entiendoyou get it shaking his head the younger man swigged from the bottle and nearly choked at the soapy medicinal tastehe had been expecting lemonade but the alcohol in it helped his shakes and he forced down another gulp reaching a decision of some kind the driver sighed and got up me he hartado de esto he said gravely alarmed the american caught his arm no what are you doing sit down man theyll see us the driver patted his shoulder saying gently hombre de muchos oficios pobre seguro he walked forward and climbed behind the wheel belting himself in then he smoothed his hair back and started the engine dude what do you think youre doing we cant go anywherewere blocked in bumper to bumper we should just wait here for help to come no siempre es fácil salir de un apuro i dont speak spanish seet down and shut up at the sound of the diesel things started happening again the naked blurred creatures outside suddenly froze into sharp focus gaping mouths and black eyes all trained on the bus there were hundreds of them now men women and children they came fast bodies slammed against the sides leaping for handholds while others swarmed the door and front windshield hard objects starred the glass quickly knocking out holes through which blue arms lunged like snakes the young man couldnt stand to look but worse than the sight was the sound of them no hay cuidaaado they screamed no hay cuidaaado the bus lurched forward smashing a dozen creatures against the rear of a trailer truck and shaking off the rest like fleas the impact destroyed what was left of the windshield but succeeded at ramming the truck a few feet ahead so that it rearended another vehicle then the driver shifted gears jumping the bus into reverse and slamming into the traffic immediately behind plowing a wide space in which to maneuver at once the american realized what he was trying to do a uturn it made a certain amount of sense because the northbound lane of traffic was clear but the narrow highway didnt look nearly wide enough to swing this huge bus aroundcertainly not before those maniacs out there got inside with the windshield gone the bus was open to all comers but surely the driver himself must know better than anyone what was or wasnt possible he was a professional flinching at each crash the american hung on tight and surrendered to hope a loud drumming of feet could be heard on the roof hideous blue faces were gibbering upsidedown through crazed windows it was now or never the bus driver cranked the wheel to its limit and backed over the near edge of the roadway his rear tires settling deep into the soft bank then he rolled the steering wheel hard to the left and gunned forward into the massing loonies with a lurch the vehicle came back onto the pavement turning in as tight a radius as was physically possibleand it was almost tight enough but nonow the front of the bus was dangling over the opposite shoulder one more correction was necessary one more reverse too late as soon as the bus stopped again those blue horrors were inside they came like locusts heedless of injury as they leaped and scrambled over the sill the driver produced an old machete from under his seat hacking furiously but it didnt slow them down one bit multitudes of hands pinned him down while a terrifying madwoman straddled him and crushed his resisting mouth under hers was it worse because he recognized her would it have been better if it was a stranger for the inhuman beast stealing the breath from don diegos lungs was someone he dearly loved who often kept him company on these long road trips since his wife had passed away his virtuous eldest daughter lupe they were inseparable as her mouth turned insideout filling him like a sack of live eels he convulsed as though electrocutedthen went limp watching the others come the american suddenly realized that they were familiar to him as well if only of brief acquaintancethey were his fellow bus passengers women for the most part though such a word hardly seemed to describe them now hags furies banshees blueskinned ghouls storming the bus as though it belonged to them and why notthey had paid the fare they came piling in like grubs brazenly naked or wearing only scraps of clothing their black eyes fixed on him with implacable cold lust old or young male or female they craved him backing down the aisle he felt like an object a piece of meat it was a new sensation being wanted and not as pleasant as he might formerly have imagined leading the pack was the canadian girl her pale perfect beauty now transformed into something washed up on the beach all jaws and cartilage and kelplike red hair that hair obscured her eyes but it seemed to him that they were messed upempty holes crying black tears she came fast and there was no place left to go but the restroom ugh no time to think about ithe fell inside and turned the latch as violent blows started falling on the flimsy door he pressed his back against it bracing his legs against the opposite wall they didnt give up they werent going to give up ever looking at himself in the mirror he thought this is it man now youre stuck like this trapped for eternity in a mexican toilet with women clamoring for his bodyit had to be a joke the thought wrung a ragged involuntary laugh out of him or was it a scream he clamped his hands over his mouth to silence it please god let it be a joke the pounding became more frenzied jarring his spine the whole bus shook with it as the door deformed in its frame blue fingers wormed in at the weak spots clamping tight and pulling with inhuman strengthany second they were going to rip the thing right off its hinges the man closed his eyes whimpering through gritted teethwhen all at once the hammering stopped as if by magic the monsters disappeared then he realized why the bus was moving the cause was simple the driver hadnt set the brake they were on an incline so the bus was rolling backwards it glanced off another vehicle then tipped sickeningly over the edge of the roadway and down the high bank veering sharply right from the angle of its tires it toppled over onto its side hitting the desert floor like a great carcass the young man emerged he climbed out of the vehicle and dropped to the sand vomiting his guts out he was dyed blue from head to foot soaked with raw sewage and the disinfectant liquid from the exploded toilet defenseless halfblind he expected to be attacked any second when no maniacs came for him he realized their fevered attention was being drawn elsewhereto a caravan of new arrivals he could hear the screams it was a hellish fly trap up there with more flies arriving by the minute down here in the dark he was already forgotten hugging his aching ribs he dragged himself as far from the road as he could a mile or more huddling under a bush amid stands of tall cacti at one time he would have been worried about snakes or scorpions but now he didnt care about much of anything he would wait here until morningwait for help to come then as if a switch was thrown he was out white he came to in a world of muffled whiteness with surreal ranks of cacti looming above him like sentinels it was fogdense morning fog his body hurt all over and he was cold curled up in a ball with his jacket collar around his ears it took him a second to remember where he was and whymuch longer to believe it how long had it been five or six hours at least everything was dead quiet maybe it was over stiffly climbing to his feet he hobbled back in the general direction of the highway just to see he was a little disoriented but it didnt matter if he went back the exact same way he had come as long as he found the road and a drink definitely a drink it was a long hike much longer than he remembered the terrain became very rocky he didnt dare consider that he might be lost when the fog clears ill see exactly where i am he thought but when the fog cleared there was nothingjust more rocks and a barren vista of brown hills topping each rise he kept praying to see something hopeful preferably a mercado with a cooler full of icecold sodasand was forever disappointed falling deeper and deeper into despair until by the time he finally did sight the road he had practically given up but there it was oh thank god he croaked it was the highway all right however a different more level stretch than the one he had left behind there was no trafficjam here no pemex stationthe lanes were clear in both directions hiking down to it he fell on the pavement with the gratitude of a shipwreck survivor but was he north or south of the pileup rather than heading into trouble he decided to stay where he was and wait for help to come to him which was just as wellhe couldnt move another inch his blisters had blisters but the thirst was getting out of control if someone didnt come along soonwell someone had to come along he got as comfortable as possible and waited as he sat there a couple of large black birds landed nearby it took him a minute to realize they must be vultures that was interesting sitting under the hot white sky and watching turkey vultures waddle along the opposite side of the road like fat little undertakersit was the corniest thing ever real vultures back and forth back and forth exactly as if they were pacing which they were of course it was too stupid an hour passed then two dozing under the makeshift cowl of his jacket he heard the truck before he saw it it was a big onesome kind of heavy construction vehicle it came rumbling around the bend of a hill and at the sight of it the american let out a hoarse cheer it was a huge red dumptruck bristling with armed men his body had stiffened from sitting so long it took a painful effort to get to his feet by that time the truck was much closer coming on fast its wheels were taller than he was and there was a railed walkway around the high cab on which several men were standing they were pointing at him and calling to the driver tears streaking his face the american waved his arms and shouted as best he could por favor por favor the truck slowed its passengers shading their eyes to see him better against the lateday sun he could see them well enough a harshfaced bunch in dirty coveralls bearing picks and shovelsa prison road crew escaped from their keepers he didnt care to him they looked like angels of mercy but at the last minute the truck swerved wide and throttled up crying no no the young man ran to intercept it to block the road if he had to im not crazy he shouted no estoy loco the truck grew bigger and bigger the truck took over the landscape expanding like the big bang until its right wheel alone was bigger than the entire worldthe whole universe a black rubber sky studded with shiny pebbles turning over on him the last thing he saw was stars the other side by jamie lackey jamie lackeys short fiction has appeared in atomjack magazine bards and sages quarterly drabblecast and in the anthology it was a

filmed night of the living dead for most of history human beings have been throwing up walls walls seem to offer protection from a hostile world and give us a sense of control of keeping people where we think they ought to be but walls definitely have a spotty history when it comes to their actual usefulness the magnificent great wall of china never really did keep the barbarians out nor did the walls of the roman emperor hadrian the berlin wall ultimately failed to keep germany divided and the strenuous efforts by the israelis to put up walls between them and the palestinians havent really proven effective can we have much confidence that walls would do any better against zombies and of course with any wall theres the question not just of what are you keeping out but also what are you holding in our next story is about fences about boundaries and being on the wrong side of them and of course about zombies the author says this story is about high school students almost twenty years after a zombie apocalypse and unrequited love i started thinking how the world would be different if there were zombies but theyd been driven back decades ago the zombies might still be a threat biding their time waiting to strike again or they could have all rotted away without anyone noticing the emotions in the story are what make it personal to methe need to fit in the fear and in the end the sorrow and regret no one has seen a zombie in my lifetime the twelvefoothigh electrified chainlink fence that protects us from the dead land passes behind my house and i used to stare into the woods for hours on end looking for zombies i saw a raccoon once peeking out through a broken window in a halfburned townhouse it might have been undead but it might not have been there used to be regular armed patrols on the dirt road inside the fence back when i was little but eventually the manpower was diverted to other projects federal troops still come around once a year in a tanker truck and burn back the vegetation in the buffer zone with napalm we have about fifty feet of scorched earth so that if they do come out of the woods we can see them before they get to the fence it keeps them from using trees to climb out too but like i said no one has seen a zombie for well over a decade some of the kids in my school want to take the fence down and see whats beyond it see if there are any people up in canada anymore but anybody who was alive during the apocalypse is set against ever taking the fence down just in case they always say just in case let them keep the dead land there was a group of guys in my high school who wanted the fence down they were idiots but they were cool and i wanted desperately for them to like me they threw katie over the fence because they could and because they wanted to prove that the zombies were gone katie and i were best friends best friends outside of school anyway shed always been kind of a dork and she didnt even drink or party anymore not since the previous fourth of july something had happened while i was away at a family picnic and no one would tell me about it anyway katie wasnt someone to hang out with in public since i wanted to be cool i was an asshole to her but she put up with it i didnt figure out why till too late she had thick glasses and curly hair and average everything else but none of this would have happened if she hadnt been so smart but she was brilliant and didnt bother to hide it from anyone so they picked her to hurl over the fence they were jerks but they werent murderers so i didnt think theyd do it till her body actually hit the ground on the other side they used the volunteer fire truck they put up that ladder meant to save people and stranded kittens and tossed my best friend into the dead land she landed in the fresh ashes and for a second everyone was silent then i started screaming at them which pretty much killed my hopes of high school popularity they laughed and opened some beers and settled in to see if the zombies would show up i cried and screamed for them to get her out until they punched me then i got my cell phone and called the police they left in a hurry after that all through it katie sat on the ground and stared at the fence she didnt look toward the woods once she didnt look at me either the police were no help they wouldnt get her out she was outside the fence she counted as infected it didnt matter that id been watching the whole time and that she didnt have a mark on her they couldnt let her in she might be a zombie they dragged me home and took my statement and i didnt see the guys again who tossed katie over i heard that they were taken away in the night and executed she was still there the next day sitting and staring katie i called through the fence are you okay she looked at me and her eyes filled with tears im not going to get out of here am i ill figure something out katie just shook her head and went back to staring her tears made trails through the ash that had settled on her skin id never touched the fence before i knew some people who had but i never did till that day i was watching katies tears and i reached out and grabbed onto the fence when i woke up my head felt like it had exploded and i couldnt move my arms katie was standing on the other side of the fence one finger reaching through the chain links are you okay when i woke up again she was still there thing really packs a punch i said it was made to put a zombie down long enough for a clean headshot at least she wasnt crying anymore but it was getting dark i got up slowly flexing my fingers to make sure they still worked i have to go home i know she whispered i touched her fingertip staying carefully away from the fence her skin was cold and dry i wanted to hug her ill get you out i tossed her a bottle of water and my peanut butter and jelly sandwich that night i called every government agency i could find a number for but they all repeated the same thing shes outside the fence she could be infected no one wanted to risk another outbreak i called the volunteer fire chief and he said the same thing so did katies parents i heard it enough times i started to half believe it after all i hadnt been watching her the whole time she could have been bitten i wouldnt know i skipped school and went straight out to see her are you infected i asked she looked the same as always but sometimes they looked the same sometimes they could even still talk of course im not she said i wanted to believe them so i could give up on her and mourn youd say that if you were that pissed her off you think im bitten you think id be horrible enough to want out of here if i was do you think i want to be the cause of another outbreak she pulled off her shirt then her pants and unhooked her bra all faster than i could think of a response see no bites she kept her underwear on shed whipped off her bra but left those on what about on your hips i said her face turned red as if she suddenly realized that she was standing in front of me almost naked how could a zombie bite me through my underwear and not leave any marks on them maybe it happened when you were going to the bathroom or something i said i stared at her searching for signs of the change i didnt get bit there she sounded close to tears prove it she didnt move i took a step back she was lost dead no worse than deada monster i started to walk away wait she shouted i swear i didnt get bitten then prove it i was drunk her voice shook i didnt know what i was doing and ive been saving up to get it removed what are you talking about she took off her panties very slowly then turned for my inspection there was no bite but she had a tattoo that i hadnt known about just below the crest of her pelvis my name she was crying sobs this time with painful gasping breaths between them im not infected her voice was different when she was crying id never heard it like that before im not i didnt know what to say to her how could i she was in love with me and some tattoo artist somewhere knew ithalf the school probably knew itand i hadnt she was my best friend is this what happened on the fourth of july she nodded and wiped her eyes but she refused to look at me you should have told me i finally managed what good would it have done i couldnt answer her i just didnt feel the same way about her and we both knew it im still looking for a way to get you out of there i love you she said her voice still sounded different i wanted to cry i ran home the next day she wasnt there there was a dark spot in the shadows of the woods it might have been blood but it might not have been where the heart was by david j schow david j schows most recent novels are gun work

that we wish would just go away worries fears doubts also bills advertisements and enemies and also of course rotting corpses them most of all alas in the case of zombies these things we never wanted to see again have returned and while they may run amuck in our streets cause our civilization to collapse and bite and convert our neighbors and friends at least we can be consoled by the knowledge that they can be stopped by a bullet through the brain and that this timedammittheyre staying down its troubling when something youre trying to get rid of comes back once when all the laws of reason and common sense say it cant but how much worse is it when that same unwanted thing keeps coming back over and over again as children many of us were given nightmares by a warner bros cartoon in which a family goes to ever more elaborate lengths to abandon its incredibly annoying dog only to have the dog show up at the front door again and again and again if the cartoonists thought this sort of thing was amusing they were wrongits terrifying a fact stephen king well understood when he wrote his story the monkey about a cursed toy that simply cannot be disposed of our next story combines these two ideas its bad enough when a rotting corpse comes crawling home but what if it turns into a habit victor jacks ambled through the back door to ruin their lives on thursday which was a pain since victor had been pronounced dead the previous saturday stubborn sumbitch renny reached under the bed for the ballbat he was on hands and knees forced to paw around until it finally came out with dustballs and hair kitties chasing it renny who was allergic to animal dander sneezed earpoppingly this trebled his rage rennys life was one that victors backfromthedead encore was designed to ruin barbs was the other just now she was backed into a corner shrieking like an ingenue in a fiftyyearold horror film unlike those world war ii heroines she was naked renny still had his socks on apart from his timex he was garbless but for the baseball bat this he refused to yield in the name of mere modesty victor looked a bit shaggy having been deceased for the better part of the work week his shoulder blades butt and legs down to the heels were blueblack with dependent lividity his eyes were so crusty that one was welded shut his hair was lank and wild the most alive thing about him his skin tone hung somewhere between catgut and bottled pigs knuckle he crackled as he moved that would be rigor he had obviously been walking for some time at each of his joints the dry flesh had split into gummy wounds with chafed and elevated flaps the distance from the morgue to barbs bedroom was about twelve pedestrian miles provided that is victor had come here directly after sitting up on his slab and deciding to ruin their lives renny thought and that pissed him off even more rennys next explosive sneeze spoiled his aim he wiped his nose with his forearm barb kept screaming totally out of character for her and renny wished in a mean flash that she would either faint or die enough at the crack point it was the batting that mattered not the invective the bulb end of the bat smashed victors dead left ear deep into the dead left hemisphere of his dead brain victor wobbled and missed his zombie grab for renny he didnt have a chance renny was foaming and lunatic swinging and connecting swinging and connecting making pulp it was what he had ached to do to victor all along what he had fantasized about doing to victor just last week when victor was still alive his yelling finally drowned out barb who was still shrunken fetally into her corner her eyes seeking the deep retreat of trauma rennys eyes were pink with rage flecks of froth dotted the corners of his mouth he kept bashing away with the bat pausing only to sneeze and wipe victor put up as good a fight as a dead person could which is to say not much while the renny on the outside was cussing and bludgeoning the renny on the inside was smirking about several things number onezombie movies in the movies reanimated corpses boogied back from the dead with all kinds of strength and powers what a bagload cadavers had all the tensile strength of twicecooked pasta even in the movies you could put them down with a headshot what threat where deeper down renny was enjoying himself he thought barb watched too much cable when he had first proposed murdering victorjust as a hoot mind you nothing seriousshe burdened him with probable cause and airtight alibis and wherewereyouonthenightof ridiculous in a world where people simply dropped off the planet on a daily basis never again a peep you break his neck you dump him in the first available manhole the sewer is a disposal system end of story barb had wanted to play faithful and loving right up to the climax of the drama loving hah faithful not since shed met renny in the end it hadnt come down to murder but right now barb sure was reaping some drama things were so lively right now that renny had busted a workout sweat and barbs vocal cords were rawing he finally turned around and told her to shut up while what was left of victor jacks twitched in a pile on the floor the business end of the bat was a real mess is he dead said barb cowering i dont think hes gonna move no more right now renny would have wiped his begored hands on his pants his pants had been off since just after dinnertime he let his hands hang in the air as he looked around uselessly he said sheeeit slow and weary it didnt help how how did he hewei dontit just barb was still having a bit of trouble being coherent victor was always a stubborn sumbitch you know that one babe barb stood up and risked moving a little closer to what was left of victor maybe he you know didnt really die went into a coma or something barb victor was dead he was dead last week and he was still dead when he walked in on us he is the deadest thing i ever saw you knocked his head off she said dully stopped him didnt it whatre we gonna do renny hes allehh shush what were gonna do is call the morgue and tell them some pervert snatched the body and mutilated it and dumped it here as a joke some old boyfriend of yours you can make up a description nobodyll bug us what makes you so smart renny had to stop a moment to ponder a good answer to that one i mean you think theyll buy it there she went again barb was one of those people who strolled through life obliviously thinking a call to the police would sling her free of any sort of trouble now she was just as convinced that the authoritiescapital awould swoop down at any moment to point jaccuse babe just dream up a good description say he was a mexican in a green windbreaker but renny id never go out with no mexican and how come i have to say hes my old boyfriend i mean renny sighed held her by the shoulders met her eyes well deal trust me please he forced a smile for her it was like jamming a finger down his throat to chuck up an emotion he needed to divert her to say something that would get her mind off police procedure so he said uhgot any towels renny mopped off barb brought a big hefty bag renny stuck the bat back under the bed touching it again made him reexperience the sheer satisfaction of pounding ole victor right back into death and this gifted him with a healthy and urgent erection barb glimpsed what was coming up and managed to finish him off before the police came knocking once again she told renny that shed never done that with victor and renny smiled and stroked her head keeping to himself the private notion that barb could probably suck the stitches off a hardball through a flexistraw victor jacks would never have hung with a china doll renny would never have been tempted by one either then the authorities arrived and renny and barb set about making up stories funerals never were much of a hoot neither barb nor renny had rsvped many in their combined fortyodd years but this time they dutifully duded up in basic black and held hands and dabbed at crocodile tears as the rearranged remains of victor jacks were boxed up and delivered six feet closer to hell half an hour after the services both of them were naked and neither of them was very depressed most annoying of barbs bedplay habits was her wont of lighting off to the toilet as soon aswell right after renny had once joked about it i make all that effort to give you something babe and you just go piss it away barb had made a face crude her face told him not funny then hideho off to the can again fine renny grunted manfully and rolled to his right side his favored side for dozing swell in the bathroom barb watched herself in the mirror for a long time not quite sure what her surveillance was in quest of victor had hit her in this bathroom hed also done it to her same day in the tub which was too small for love victors tendency to boil over all at once was frightening a pit bull on a very iffy leash thought barb whether it got hostile lifethreatening might depend on a dozen factors when it last ate whether it was pissed off whether it liked you whether it liked your smell victor jacks had been like that but when victor got to the part where he put his big hands all over her large powerful warm hands unbuttoning and unzipping her making her naked and telling her she was wanted touching her in places only she touchedcurve of ass inside of thigh underside of breast smoothshaven armpitoh my he made her moist filled her up she would practically hallucinate and she had always slept gorgeously afterward the sex was never violent between them only the occasional backhand was barb knew she would never get around to enjoying the way men apologized every time after they smacked her when she had met victor jacks she was a waitressnewlyturnedexoticdancer petitechested with good hips and sturdy if not long legs she figured it was virtually the same aggravation for better tips and weirder hours she fancied she needed more weird in her life she got victor all he lacked was a puff of smoke to appear in when victor had met barb he was comfortably into pharmaceutical dexedrine pops and on the cusp of crystal meth he made do with the odd frameweld for rubsrich urban bikersand bashed bigblocks for musclecar meatheads with too much leisure cash he paid barb to tabledance and made her sit just sit while he looked at her management did not approve victor did not make a scene he merely smiled and showed barbs bosses more money to barb whose concept of foreplay was someone bigger than her saying shut up and lay down this was romance with a big r indeed after a week of this bizarre courtship she went out with himand he stayed in with her when renny boone had met barb he was so chemicalfree you could almost see his halo to barb by this time shell shocked by two years of bikerspeed tantrums and eightball insomnia rennys wellcut bod and addictionless turn smelled like that myth come true the better life you look like you could use a rest renny had told her and so telling her he took her straight away to bed five days later the two of them were still trying to dope out some rationalization that might convince say a jury that she barb and he renny were meant to be but barb lacked the heart to dump someone as spontaneous and romantic as victor jacks truth was renny preferred barb as a rental and that victor wasnt such a bad dude hed even nailed the chronic carburetor wheeze suffered by butch rennys black impala truth was barb preferred victors flashfire spats to shaking her ass for the beery swine who bellied up to the runway at nasty tramps so truth held sway and victor stayed ignorant dangerous and sexy barb had renny for the topics she could never broach to victor and renny had barb the way cowboys have spittoons and they all lived happily ever after for about two more weeks until victor came back to the house unannounced to fetch his set of allen wrenches and well you can imagine the tool excuse had been victors cover story that afternoon unbeknownst to renny and barb victor had fallen in love againthis time with a smokable amphetamine called ice he was pretty saturated on top of his morning fistful of vitamins and when he walked through his front door and caught renny and barb doing the bone dance on his sofa bed the speed made his anger instantaneous his reaction time zero victor had snarled literally snarled lip curling he came for his betrayers his face bright crimson the sclera of his eyes pinking two steps closer he stopped stiffened pawed at his left arm and fell stone dead of the most concussive goddamned heart attack his mesomorphic build could contain victors fulsome romanticifcrazy heart shut down like a phone sex line with no callers and all that remained was for the coroner to scribble death by chemical misadventure into the appropriate boxwhile victor himself was trucked away to fill up another appropriate box which brings us back to barb in the bathroom she flushed the toilet flushed then blushed in a matchhead flare of anger as she remembered rennys idiotic joke about her having to urinate after sex she would never forget it crude renny could be so crude maybe dumb toodumb enough never to have heard of honeymooners cystitis an inflammation of the bladder that was easy to get when you had too much foreign juice rammed up your tubes and perhaps uncaring as wellmaybe renny didnt give a big manly damn what havoc fortyfive minutes of the missionary position could wreak on even a healthy girls poor need to pee in her mirror by nightlight she spotted a hickey on her neck crude but she loved the way renny liked to chew on her just nibble and bite and suck all the right places as though he was desperately hungry for her physically starving she always orgasmed first even when she tried to outlast him and once she was coitally zoned she really did want him to leave marks little ones shed see in the morning when she felt the delicious residual ache of their workout she liked to tease renny about all the women he must have learned his bag of tricks from if she had a headache or a rotten mood renny could bang it right out of her victor would never even touch her at her time of the month renny did not have that particular cultural problem he made her feel more desirable on her doggiest days and feeling desirable made barb feel womanly indeed renny even understood about her having to go back to work at nasty tramps now that victor was no longer winning the bread in fact renny had suggested barb rejoin the working world what a guy crude dumb uncaring and boyhowdy opportunistic yeah renny was a prize for sure prize catch of the day except that this day somehow victor had found time out from his busy schedule to come back from the dead this did not shock or befuddle barb overtly maybe shed seen too many monster movies and lacked the emotional capacity for astonishment she stared down her reflection eyetoeye and reminded herself that victor had done a lot of uppers in his thirtyodd years on the planet hell he was probably spinning in his new grave right nowat rpm the bathroom light was harsh it made her feel lonely she was fortunate to know that it was a loneliness she could drive away she wanted renny on her inside of her the fastest way she knew not to feel lonely anymore she found him semiconscious and semierect renny functioned best with a fiveminute nap between rounds barb woke him up with her mouth she didnt say a word but he awoke anyway they made a great deal of noise over the next halfhour renny always lasted longer once hed primed his pump his words they were both on their backs kicking away sheets to let their own sweat cool them off when barb said did you hear that hear what little scritchy noise like a mouse probably that stupid cat of yours no he doesnt make noises like that then it probably is a mouse this house is no listen renny listened if the thing making the noise was a mouse it was dragging off a dog for a bit of fun barb pounded his shoulder its under the bed jesus christ renny stayed calm and leaned overboard for a looksee from beneath the dust ruffle the baseball bat shot out like a piston hitting renny foursquare in the chin and making him see night sky it still had clots of victor drying on it then something whipsnaked tight coils around rennys throat and dragged him down to tussle renny made a gargling noise in the dark as he was reeled in discombobulated he thought he was being engulfed by a giant wiggleworm with a whole lot of little worms attached he dug his heels into the rug and fought to breathe barb was already making those screamy gasps that truly bugged him deep down it was a hand on his throat he peeled it off as he did another appendage trapped his hand renny pulled back and dragged his rubberlimbed assailant out from under the bedthe preferred place of concealment for seasoned traditional boogeymen it was victor again moreover it was victor as he had been buried that afternoon bones all smashed no head renny was instantly mummified in a barbwiretangle of leathery muscles and nonliving rubber flesh it was like trying to wrassle a waterbed what used to be victors arms and legsnow freed from bones and frameworkcoiled and constricted into tentacles that were much quicker than rennys fist they slithered snug around his windpipe his chest his stomach and renny could feel it comingthe big squeeze that would make the life jump right out of him now renny was making those screamy noises he was clawing at his own face when barb no longer wailing charged back from the kitchen brandishing the biggest meat cleaver renny had ever seen victor had threatened her with the cleaver once that was how shed known where to find it and barb had in fact seen too many monster movies especially the ones about psychos and kitchen implements you could get everydamnedthing on cable nowadays she hacked and chopped and slashed and hollered and only nailed renny by accident once the grabby victorthing began falling to pieces faster than a clay vase run through on the wheel with a cutoff needle tearing a suffocating creeper of skin free from his mouth renny flailed to a sitting position and sucked air barbyou cut me open goddammit i missed honey im sorry okay that thing was all over the place she helped him stand he was wobbly unused to needing help to being nearly beaten their feet buried in the desiccated meat on the floor she felt him shake he hugged her tight and genuinely i know i know babebut that thing is ole youknowwho again cant be no way she pressed her face into his neck not looking he lifted a scrap of nowinanimate flesh and turned it to the faint light so barb could see the tattoo a cherubic comic book devilchild looked back at her from a corona of flame aww shitits hot stuff renny yep jesus wasnt there anyone whose life hadnt been touched by harvey comics victor jacks had gotten his ink at a sunset boulevard parlor called skin illos at the behest of nikki who had been his girlfriend of record prior to barb barb had heard you could bleach tattoos by using a laser she hadnt been able to work up the spit to suggest this to victor prior to his very timely demise rennyhoni dont want to make you mad or nothin but but what if victoryou know keeps coming back every time we you and iyou know victor aint coming back again whatre we gonna do what i wanted to do originally dump him in the sewer whats left of him let the rats chow down guess were gonna need another hefty bag huh barb grimaced at the slicedanddiced assemblage of tissue on the floor it relaxed and settled shifting softly renny stared at it too panting with shiny eyes the sweat leaving his chin in droplets but first babehand me that meat cleaver the manhole cover weighed ninetyfive pounds give or take renny had the advantages of a pry bar and good upper torso strength thus were the headless autopsied dismembered brokenboned earthly remnants of victor jacks consigned to la county waste disposal network hacking victor into ittybitty bitesized morsels had given renny a peculiar thrillthe same excitement that had granted him a fullon chubby while bludgeoning vicbaby the first time sucker just wouldnt give it up renny had to admire that begrudgingly and if vicbaby somehow managed to make a third curtain call why thatd be the tits too because renny was starting to enjoy the new fun things he could do with his hands like what he might do if barb lost her marbles and started that gawdawful shrieking again nahh just a vagrant thought no problem there renny yanked his fingers clean and the lid seated with an iron clank an old pal of his had once broken three fingers by not letting go soon enough after chasing a frisbee into the sewer that made renny think again of barb maybe it was getting time to let her go true shed come to his rescue and handled herself well enough tonight but what if victor was some kind of curse or something specific to her you dont pull back your hand in time you lose and it wasnt his fingers that renny had been parking inside of barb most of the recent past just now in fact he was up for another bout his body urged him to hurry home to her she would be fresh out of her bath tasty and scented and renny wanted to ride her until she screamed for real do you hear something a noise or oh for christ sake barb im serious stop it feeling like a wiener renny backed out and listened to the doubletime of his own heart backdraft from his urgent need to climax soonsortalikeimmediately barb listened intentlyshe resembled a gradeschooler trying too hard to concentratenot for sounds from the heart but telltales of nearing monsters she was still head down ass up after coyly asking renny to do her that way and she clung to the mattress as though it could render her some psychic truth i dont hear anything babe except maybe your own paranoia bouncing back at us from the walls fed up he grabbed his smokes off the nightstand pretty glib he thought for a guy who was strangling on a rope of living dead ligaments about an hour ago i thought i heard the seat fall down in the bathroom my fault i left it up when renny strove to impress he could be the most courteous thoughtful man on earth then as he procured what he wanted he let the courtesies slide like tonight hed left the seat up on purpose a territorial assertion he knew shed notice yet tolerate the brilliant trick of rennys life was that he made sure people always noticed him when he was being a swell guy so there was less risk of him being singled out when he was being a turd of ethics voilahe was known far and wide for being fair wise and trusty no way hed ever sleep with another mans partner or murder someone or even think of doing the deed even to someone already dead renny could take blame artfully toowhamming it back the way a tennis pro returns a smartass serve like the toilet seat thing i admit i left the seat up babe your house your rules but that fuzzy cover on the tank makes it fall down again and shh he smoked in silence having scored his point barb took the cigarette from between his lips stole two quick puffs and replaced it as though afraid of being caught tampering with the evidence at a murder scene renny gave up and went to use the bathroom he left the seat up barb theres water all over the bathroom floor i think maybe your pipes are backing up roots maybe oh no is it allyou know messy just water like a big splash all over renny that brought him back quick enough what a man as he skidded in barefoot he caught barb shrinking and pointing something had just moved near the juncture of wall and ceiling above her cosmetic table renny squinted the something was lowslung slid along lizardfashion and was now watching them both coldly from seven feet up what the hell is it said renny a rat you ever see a white rat with no hair with eyes that big jeeezus renny barb could see pretty well in the dark after all wheres the bat renny almost chuckled ill get the damned thing whatever it is she stopped him open palm to naked chest no you wont either renny now ive been doin some thinking and youre a nice guy and a good man and a good male protector and all that and i havent been holding up my end on this deal and like you said this is my houseso let me do this its my turn when barb let loose with stuff like that it stopped renny deaf and dumb how could he even consider dumping a woman this good she watched his cigarette glow near the bathroom door you just stay right there and hit the overhead lights when i tell you okay yesm go the hundredwatter barb kept in the ceiling fixture blinded them the thing on the wall recoiled and dropped behind the mirror renny and barb heard it hit the floor and scrabble into the shadows see it i see it barb lied she shielded her eyes and groped around until she found the bat i dont see it renny could see the tail of barbs cat poking from beneath the dresser it was a miserable calico renny felt was responsible for every one of his sneezes since he and barb had linked up when it wasnt skulking around the kitchen trying to eat everything in sight it was shedding pounds of hair and clawing the furniture to ribbons it had some kind of inane cat name renny could not retain it didnt listen when barb told it no it never had it had probably knocked the toilet seat over numb little fart the tail twitched in that spastic way that announced the cat was revving up for the old chaseanddisembowel routine barb told the cat no loudly it didnt listen she tried to block it with her foot but the cat executed a tight dodge and zipped under the dresser way ahead of her there followed an unseen brief and violent encounter that sounded pretty awful though neither barb nor renny could see any of it the cats tail whapped barb in the chest the cat was no longer connected to it tufts of calico fur followed held together mostly by blood barb began making caveperson noises and wedged herself into the combat zone dealing short blind strokes with the bat the bureau began to scoot with each hit bunching the area rug the intruder darted out from the far side it looked like a hand barb its a hand what barb backed off frantic and holloweyed what what a hand i dont care it hurt my cat barb it ran under the bed renny stepped back from the edge just in case barb started swinging again hot for combat barb spun it hurt rumplecatskin the kill light was in her eyes she swept aside the dust ruffle two eyes returned her gaze from about a foot in then it charged before she could bring the bat into play and got a tight grip on her throat it was victors hand all right hed grabbed her throat enough times for her to make a lightning id whatever else had befallen victors mortal parts his right hand was still strong and mean as ever barbs wind was cut and in seconds shed see the purple spots victor knew exactly how to throttle her she collapsed into a heavy spreadlegged sitdown as renny dived across the bed not as fast as he could have been he didnt really want to touch it the severed wrist terminated in a reddishwhite bag of muscle like the fat nontapered tail of a gila monster renny grabbed that end and tried to yank it off goddamn it but this was getting to be much more trouble than anything was worth barbs face had shaded to mauve renny crawled in tighter bent back the clutching index finger and heard it pop as he broke it at the base joint shouldnt he just let it polish barb off would this all be over then nope he thought as he levered the middle finger out of the flesh of her neck no way he was going to be beaten and humiliated by disorganized body parts he cocked the finger away savagely and smiled when he heard it snap there were eyeballs on the back of the hand and they swivelled a full oneeighty to glare at renny the pupils dilated barb was sucking wind in big horsey gasps her face flushing crimson renny remembered the first time he had ever shaken this hand howyadoo victor jacks was the sort of guy whose very existence dared you to be better than him and promised to humiliate you if you tried the thumb and ring finger could not hang on alone apparently barb had smashed the pinky a lucky hit with the bat it jutted crookedly alienated from the choking operation renny pried the hand free and chucked it across the room as barb fell down the hand bounced from the wall to the floor leaving red impact smears clumsily it tried to locomote barb stumbled over and started stomping on it she got gook all over her heel slipped and nearly fell again this enraged her enough to bash the hand with the bat until it didnt move anymore both of them squatted down at a safe distance and got their first really clear look at it apart from the killer hand and about four inches of forearm there were victors eyes eyes that had always been the color of pastel blue enamel opaque eyes that did not deal in emotional shades with the hairtrigger flecks of silver buried deep like vague rumors of madness the eyes were seated across the first three knuckles on the back of the hand and looked roped down by strings of muscle and threads of optic nerve one eyeball had just been imploded by barbs deathdance at last renny could recognize the bulbous bag that hung off the far end of the wrist thats his heart the whole assemblage reminded renny of something that victor might jerryrig on his auto workbench he was known to be miraculous when it came to solving your vehicular woes with a bent coat hanger spit and a soldering iron his heart this was not the sort of news barb was eager to hear his heart oh goddddhow could it be his heart they took it out you beat him to pieces didnt you break his hand last time renny honestly could not recall i meanhe didnt have no head renny whatd the eyeballs do roll here by themselves as they watched the heartend caved in voiding blood in a final deathspurt it made a large wet wide stain on the finished wood of the nowexposed floor it appeared to renny as though it had farted it was kind of funny wow you really broke his heart she began slapping him the blows were openhanded and basically harmless renny goddammit thats not funny thats his fucking hand its been around my throat plenty of times and for a minute there i could actually see him like hed come back whole to beat me up again and its not funny barb was a pace and a half from an asylum her tirade petered out and left her sobbing renny did the right thing and tried to hold her she let him if he had given her a kleenex she would have dislocated his jaw okay okay sorry im such a jerk pangs of selfishness could occasionally make renny feel guilt or something like guilt more important right this minute was the abrupt deduction hed made while keeping an untrusting eye on the nolongermoving hand thing victor had been slabbed and guttedand had come walking back hed had all his bones busted and hed come blobbing back and renny had dumped victor in the sewer and victor had come back again from the sewer up through the toilet just like those urban legends about scubadiving rats and snakes and crocodiles all of which the eyeballhand resembled look babei know what this thing needs ill make sure there aint nothin left this time and how do you plan on doing that barb had regained enough of her equilibrium to peek at herself in the bureau mirror to ensure she didnt look too messed up renny lifted the interloper by its broken pinky he could feel himself piling up jungle smarts by the minute you got any charcoal starter out back it stank truly it sizzled when it burned a roundly unappetizing spectacle that barb forced herself to witness they both watched it cook down and renny periodically batted the chunks apart with barbecue tongs until it was reduced to black goo and bone ash barb plodded back inside to take her third shower in twentyfour hours there was just no washing victor off her life renny watched the goo smolder and bubble on the coals kind of like pork the smell he rubbed the smoke from his reddened eyes and finished up not really wanting to enter the house again he no longer wanted to play bed games with barb he just wanted to get some sleep by the time barb towelled off she discovered renny deep in slumberland igg shed have to change the sheets despite her shower a job for tomorrow she sat on what was de facto her side of her own bed successfully not waking her partner in crime renny was different she knew their relationship had turned flowers decay banquets spoil water evaporates and their sneaky victory had soured at first it had been a delicious shared secret now it had become a horrid quickmire that bonded them like a pair of panicked dogs struggling to uncouple she felt well dead inside to hammer a phrase blown out wasted spent scorching at the edges she did not want to feel anything so much as she wanted to feel nothing renny was sleeping with his mouth unhinged as usual just beginning to snore that snore would tell her that she was far far away from his thoughts she gently grabbed his nose and tilted his head so he no longer faced her the incipient snore died with a gurgle she felt unusually sensitized to the point where the dust on the sheets and comforter bothered her grit was in her eyes and she fancied more dust layered upon her soul like wet snow the thought that it might be the powder of dead bones made her start crying and she never stopped caught up in her own grief she missed seeing the tenacious little gob of charred protoplasm as it wormed past rennys slack lips to slide easily down his esophageal tract soon it would renew its work deep inside of him where the heart was good people by david wellington david wellington is the author of the zombie novels monster island monster

the zombie story back to its rootsa bunch of regular folks just trying to survive figuring out what theyre willing to do to make it and the horrible things they have to do after the end of the world after all the variations parodies and mashups the classic romerostyle zombie is still alive and well so to speak and still after all these years coming to get you the sun was coming down over the desert painting the red rocks a hundred different shades of purple silver and ocher and making spiky silhouettes out of the few creosote bushes that eked a living out of the barren land i watched the hot pink clouds scud by overhead for a while before turning my attention back to the fence then my heart stopped beating the dead man was only a couple feet away from candy when i saw him he was on the wrong side of the chainlink fence but he was leaning on it hard and it was starting to sway his clothes were bleached white by the sun and his skin was gray his lips had rotted away like most of his face and his teeth were huge and yellow and broken until they looked very sharp candy was three years old she didnt even look up thered never been a time in her life when the dead people werent around werent reaching for her gnashing their teeth at her thered never been a time when mommy wasnt right there to save her i wasnt going to let her learn different not until she was old enough to hold a weapon so i didnt shout at her didnt scream for the dead guy to back off i brought up my bow and nocked an arrow drew back nice and steady and took my time to aim my bow string twanged but my arrow didnt make a sound as it went right through the chain link and right through his skull the point came out the other side he fell down in a heap silently thank you girl scouts of america i thought i went over to candy then to get her away from the corpse they dont smell so bad anymorethe sun down here dries them outbut you can still get sick just by being near them and sometimes they arent as dead as they look candy was squatting down on the ground by the pump house that used to fill up the swimming pool she had a bunch of credit cards and she had laid them out on the yellow grass sorting them by color the plastic had gone white around the edges over time and the silver ink had rubbed off the numbers but the holograms still flashed back and forth in the sun as i reached down to pick her up look at the bird candy said pointing at one of them it flies if you close one eye then the other sure does pumpkin i said and kissed the side of her head its been a year and a half since i saw a bird i dont know when she ever had but she knew birds fly birds fly away people have to stay on the ground right where they are bruce and finster came out of the shade of the motel complex wearing gloves and bandanas across their faces i covered them with my bow while they dragged the corpse into the empty pool and set it on fire the bottom of the pool used to be painted blue but the paint had chipped away months ago and now the bare concrete showed through there were black scorch marks like flat craters all over the concrete the guys couldnt just drag the body out into the desert to rot away that would just draw more of the deadthey dont eat their own kind but once you destroy the brain all bets are off anything that could hurt us anything that would draw attention to us was dragged down into the pool and burned until there was nothing left but ashes and bones i didnt stick around to watch i took candy back to our room instead to let her play inside where the air might be stuffy but she couldnt just wander away then i went into the dark bathroom and stared at myself in the mirror for a while i did that every time i killed somebody i was looking for any sign of fear or weakness if i found my lips were shaking i made them stop if my eyes looked too wide i forced myself to squint if i had gone white as a sheet i held my breath until my color came back i could have been an actress you know before i was a dancer in vegasyes that kind of dancerbut i was saving my money to go to la then it got overrun and everybody there died guess it was a good thing i never got my big break this time when i stared in the mirror i didnt see anything looking back my face was there my cheekbones more hollow than they used to be lines around my eyes a little deeper blond hair bleached by the sun i looked even skinnier than i used to when i was dancing but there was nothing there in my face no expression at all i wondered if that was a bad thing if that was worse than finding signs of weakness there then i decided that was a stupid thing to worry about times like these you learned pretty fast what was important and what was bullshit and you let the bullshit go the rules were that when you even see a dead guy you had to tell vance i headed out leaving candy alone where i knew she was safe and walked down the row of motel rooms toward the reception office the place he was most likely to be as i stepped in through the glass doors i found about half of the survivors there it was the stuffiest part of the motel and there were no curtains on the windows so the desert light came glaring in but ever since the dead came back people tend to want to congregate in central places where they can see each other so reception is always crowded there were old folks logging in cans of food from the last foraging expedition and young guys bristling with weapons just standing guard good people all of them ive known plenty of the other kind but we left all of them behind of course simon was there tinkering just like always simon was the only one of us who couldnt walk because hed lost both his legs whether that happened before or after nobody knew because he didnt like to talk about it and if you pushed simon on something he didnt like to talk about he usually started screaming he claimed he had asperger syndrome when we first met him most of us just thought he was crazy a lot of us still thought he was a drain on our resources which is one thing we dont normally forgive but vance had refused to leave him behind when we headed south from scottsdale said he would come in useful eventually lucky guesses like that were what made vance our leader simon it turned out had a way with machines he could take them apart in his head and figure out why they didnt work and how to fix them hed put a truck back together from spare parts back at scottsdale and that was the only way we got out of that hell alive the truck had brought us all the way here before it ran out of gas and we couldnt find anymore when vance found the motel with the little creek running behind it it was simon who figured out how we could pump water up from the creek and survive in the desert just looking at simon you would never believe it he was maybe fifteen years old he had a mop of black hair that hung down over his eyes he was overweight even after a year and a half of eating no more than i had his fingers were pudgy and short and the nails were always cut down so far his fingertips bled with a couple dozen yards of pvc pipe though and some parts from the empty swimming pools pumps he gave us running water he gave us water for cooking and washing and even cleaning our clothes he gave us water to drink in a place where you could die in four hours without it when i walked into reception he was fiddling with an old clock radio from one of the rooms picking at a circuit board with those nonexistent nails of his i wanna build a radio transponder he said sos the army can find us i wanna build a computer so we can get back onna innernet in many ways simon still lived in the beforeor maybe he just took the extremely long view and assumed that this wasnt the end of the world just a momentary pause in civilization i wanna check my website check my traffic traffictraffic we can get the traffic lights back on vance stepped out from the back office and nearly tousled the kids hair he stopped himself before he actually touched himsimon does not like to be touched dont worry vance said you and me buddy were going to rebuild the entire world together simon looked up with an idiotic smile on his face i like to build things vance smiled back darcy he said turning to look at me you have something to report he probably already knew what had happened out at the fence bruce and finster had probably already let him know but he wanted to hear it again from me vance is not a big guy but you can see in his eyes that hes always thinking hes always two steps ahead which is how he keeps us alive nobody ever voted for him to be leader and he didnt have to fight anybody for the right he led us because he was always on top of things when the rest of us were just trying to survive one dead guy out by the southwest fence i got him with an arrow vance nodded and did you retrieve the arrow yeah i said he nodded and reached over to touch my arm most guys ive known they would have grabbed me around the waist or maybe patted me on the shoulder if they were trying to be pc vance squeezed my bicep i hear he was going for candy i shrugged not anymore he gave me another squeeze on the strongest part of me like he knew just somehow he knew what was inside of me and he approved a guy like vance back in before i wouldnt have bothered giving him a second look now id move into his room if he just asked three this month simon said his face curling up he looked like he might start screaming three one two three vance frowned thats right he said more than were used to i shrugged some months we dont see any sometimes we get a few we can handle it vance nodded but his brow was furrowed and i knew he was thinking of something he went over to the drinking fountain that simon had rigged up to be our main water supply an inchwide pipe stuck up out of the top of the box and there was a crank on the side that pulled the water up from the creek vance started turning the crank but you could see on his face he was still thinking simon he said is there any way to make that fence stronger the boy started bouncing up and down in his chair yeah lots of ways i wanna sink the posts in concrete and double up on the chain link and uh and uh we could lectrify it if we had some solar panels and theres barbed wire he stopped suddenly which wasnt strange for simon sometimes he just stopped talking and that was it he would be silent for the rest of the day sometimes it was just a pause while he worked something out in his head this time he started screaming vance was still winding the crank you had to pull hard to get water out of the little trickle of the creek and sometimes pebbles got in the pipe and you had to crank even harder this time vance was really working it his arm flashing around and around hed been too preoccupied to notice why he had to work so hard something was in the pipe something bigger than a pebble when he heard simon scream he stopped crankingand then everybody saw what set simon off a human finger was sticking out of the top of the pipe gray and mottled and topped with a broken yellow nail dont throw up dont do it i said rubbing finsters back when your entire food supply is comprised of tin cans you scavenge out of abandoned dollar stores you cant afford to waste a meal finster was looking green and starting to double over slowly he straightened up and started breathing deeply thanks i justulp he closed his eyes and turned away simon kept screaming sometimes when he got that way he wouldnt stop for hours this was a kid who used to freak out when his father couldnt find the right brand of chicken tenders for his dinner the new world was full of triggers and not a lot of comfort vance grabbed the finger out of the pipe and shoved it in his pocket so nobody would have to see it mike joe i want this system taken apart and all the parts boiled until its sterile he said the two men hed named rushed over to the water fountain to start disassembling it they were good people and they didnt wait until things had calmed down to get to work you okay now i asked finster hed gotten some of his color back yeah but what i asked that thing thatfinger it means bruce shook his head it doesnt necessarily mean anything the creek out back flows all the way from tucson he insisted some dead guy just lost his finger off the side of a bridge thats all or it could mean theres a horde of them downstream splashing around in our water supply finster said everyone looked at vance even simon stopped screaming long enough to hear what our intrepid leader would say he glanced around the room making eye contact with each of us then he shrugged we cant afford not to know for sure so we check it out one of vances rules was that nobody ever went outside alone when he decided to form a search party to go check out the stream he took almost everybody with him there were miles of canyons and gullies to check out washes that could hide hundreds of the dead from view that had to be explored in the end he left only a handful of us behind finster and myself to stand watch and to coordinate the search via radio simon whose wheelchair couldnt make the trip and of course candy candy never left my side the morning they left he had me do a radio check for him simon had rigged up a solar charger for a set of walkietalkies we found in an overrun police station and the radios had gotten us out of some pretty tight spots we depended on them but we didnt trust themyou couldnt really trust any technology from before that relied on electricity so vance went up to the top of a hill about a quartermile from the hotel while i went behind the motels detached laundry building and waited for him to call are you getting this he asked and i confirmed how about now good so we should be back in three days if it takes longer ill let you know ill be listening i told him i dont think were going to find anything if thats the case its still a good excuse to do some foraging turn up some more cans of food you sound worried do i i asked i was surprised id been keeping my voice very carefully casual i guess im always going to be concerned when we split up like this that was one of the first things id learned when this all began stay together let other people watch your backyoure going to be busy enough watching your front people who could work together good people who cared about each other stayed alive people who couldnt get along or who wanted to go it alone got weeded out pretty fast dont be well take the guns and therell be enough of us to take care of just about anything you know i wouldnt put any of us at risk unnecessarily i know i have to say im glad youll be back here safe though listenfinster has said some things when you werent around well a lot of the guys have but when youre alone with him he might try to take advantage of that fact im not following i said i know you can take care of yourself but he might offer his services if you catch my drift i laughed out loud i couldnt remember the last time id laughed well i said in the absence of a better offer maybe ill take him up on that vance laughed then too okay just make sure one of you is always watching the fence the conversation ended there because we didnt want to drain the radio batteries an hour later the search party left heading out through the big gate in the fence while finster and i waved from the roof of the reception building both of us covering their exit vance and his group took all of our guns but i had my bow i watched them go for hours winding in single file down the road that ran alongside the creek vance marching along tirelessly at their fore when are they coming back mommy candy asked i had her in a makeshift papoose on my back real soon we caught a couple of them today working their way up the creek vance said over the radio they were eating weeds and cactus anything they could find he sounded tired hed been gone for only a day but already hed covered ten square miles he was pushing himself and his people hard which made me nervous honestly darcy i didnt expect to see even one out here but im worried these might just be stragglers from a larger group how so i asked i spooned cold baked beans onto a plate for candy the walkietalkie cradled between my ear and my shoulder one of them was wearing a business suit one sleeve was torn off but his tie was still knotted around his neck he didnt look like a rancher or a tourist he looked like somebody who belonged in a big city im worried that were seeing people from tucson i stopped what i was doing and put down the spoon careful not to spill any food thatwould be bad i said when it happened when the dead came back to life most people in this part of the country lived in the big cities there were millions of them packed into small geographical areas that just meant that when the end of the world came there was more food for the dead they rarely ventured out into the desert which is why we had made our home there but we had always considered the possibility that the city dead would eventually exhaust their food supply and start wandering out into the country looking for more the dead are always hungry and they dont sleep its too soon to start panicking vance told me how are things back on the home front fine i said steeling myself he was right there was no need to get worriedyet finsters been a perfect gentleman simon took apart the cash register and now its in pieces all over your office he says he wants to build an electric water heater so we can have hot showers it would be nice he sighed all right ill check in eight hours from now ill be listening candy picked up a finger full of beans and put it in her mouth i watched her face curled up in concentration she was still learning such basic thingslike how to feed herself i smiled and she smiled back then ate some more i stood the next watch during which nothing happened candy played quietly while i walked back and forth on the roof of the motel making long circuits from the rooms back to the reception building to the poolhouse keeping my eyes open keeping moving so i didnt fall asleep the red rocks beyond the fence never changed and nothing moved a breeze picked up for a while which was kind of nice when my watch ended i sank down in a folding chair and sucked some water out of a bottle finster climbed up behind me and just stood there for a while not saying anything just looking out at the horizon i wondered if he was looking for vance the way i had been for hours then he put his hands on my shoulders and started to rub youre tense he said worried about them yeah i reached up to push his hands away then i stopped myself if something happened if finster made a pass would that be so bad it would help pass the time and it had been a very long time since anyone touched me like that there had been a time when id gotten too much male attention when it had been a drag but that was before it wasnt like vance was responding to my veiled hints after all i started leaning my head back eyes closed letting things happen the tension of eighteen months started draining out of me which as we all know by now is exactly when the bad things happen this time it was the radio squawking i sat up straight and grabbed for the walkietalkie were coming back fast vance said there was a lot of static and he was barely whispering but my heart raced as i made out his words get everything you can into the backpacks were going to have to bug out what did you find i asked whispering myself behind me finster crouched down to try to hear better about fifty of them all coming up the same canyon theyre spread out pretty loose and i think i havent seen them all theres probably more probably a lot more this is tucson go now get things readywe wont have time to pack when i get back understood i said and signed off i turned to face finster his face was as white aswell as white as a dead guys lets move i told him we cracked open one of the motel rooms we used as cold storage and found the back packs waiting for us on an unmade bed ten of them still halffull of stuff we never bothered to unpack bottles of purified water bags of beef jerky and boxes of hard crackers canned food is heavy and if youre carrying your supply on your back it slows you down into each pack we put survival gear camp stoves thermal blankets first aid kits knives lots of knives and other basic weapons as much water as we could shove into the packs if we were going to walk across the desert until we found another safe place we would need a gallon per day per person there was no way we could carry enough but the supply we had would just have to do finster and i didnt talk while we worked candy was slung on my back fast asleep she learned how to do that very early on when mommys busy you just go to sleepthats a survival strategy good girl i didnt feel bad about having to abandon the motel it had been a good place a shelter in a dangerous world and i had no idea where we would find anything like it again but the rules of this world are very clear when you have to move on you go and you dont look back the search party had taken all our guns which wasnt saying muchthey had two revolvers and a pistol between them and enough ammo to reload once i had my bow and my quiver and finster had a slingshot a hightech geek toy that could put a ball bearing through a dead guys skull at twenty yards we geared ourselves up and hauled the packs out to the motels courtyard so the search party could just grab and go it was only when all that was done that i realized neither of us had been watching simon nobody would expect the boy genius to help us get ready so i guess we just ignored him until it was time to get him prepared for the move vance and joe the two strongest men in our group had a kind of stretcher they had built so they could carry simon around it even had a little canopy to keep the sun off of him simon hated the thing though and we never brought it out until it was absolutely necessary just seeing it would be enough to trigger one of simons screaming fits hes probably in reception playing with the cable box wondering why he cant tune in the brady bunch or something finster said when i asked where simon was you check there ill look in his room i told him but he wasnt in his room finster shouted to say he wasnt in the office either i jogged back and forth across the parking lot calling him but got no response he didnt seem to be anywhere inside the fence then i spotted him and i nearly yelped in horror he was outside the fence lord knows how he made it all that way crawling around on his arms he had the gate open and had crossed both lanes of the highway beyond there was a stoplight out there that hadnt worked since before with a big electrical junction box at the base of its pole simon had the box open and was pulling wires out making neat piles around him sorted by color i called his name but he didnt even look up damn it i said exasperated this wasnt the first time simon had put us in danger and i doubted it would be the last i ran over to him my heart pounding the second i was outside the fence even though there was no sign of the dead in either direction i tried to grab his arm and lift him up but simon just went limp and his arm slithered through my hands simon come on we have to go busy busy building simon said vance says i can build vance says you have to leave me alone while im building sure i tried but right now we need you to build something inside the fence ill do that later simon said there was nothing for it i just didnt have the upper body strength to pick him up and carry him not when he was going to fight me i needed to get finster to help so i hurried back toward the gate shouting for finster to come help i dont know if he heard me or not he was pretty busy just then tucson had come for us hundreds of them maybe a thousand i hadnt seen anything like it since the last days of vegas their clothes hung on them in tatters and their flesh had shriveled on their bones they must have run out of food in tucson a while back and desperate hunger had driven them this far their eyes were cloudy with sun damage and their skin was covered in sores many of them were missing limbs or at least fingers but they all had their legs intact when i saw them i understood what had happened the fifty vance had found in the canyons were the slow ones the ones that didnt keep up this was the crowd that could still move at a good clip the ones that were still mostly healthy who had gotten ahead of the rest you always expect them to be an unruly mob shoving at each other and snarling at the ones who would rob them of their food it wasnt like that though they were barely aware of each other but all of them wanted the same thing they knew finster and i were inside that fence they moved in concert pushing forward all at once never making the slightest sound it was easy for the dead to take us by surprise because they were as silent as the grave they hit the fence like a human tsunami that side of the fence had been the strongest partwe had reinforced an existing fence there that had been made to keep out coyotes the dead had no trouble with it at all it came jangling down and they climbed over what was left finster was working overtime with his slingshot firing his giantsized bbs one after the other grabbing them out of a sack on his belt he was a crack shot with that thing and he didnt hesitate but he didnt waste shots either making sure every round he fired was a clean head shot that took down his target i could have run up and joined him and fired every single one of my arrows into that crowd in the time we had even healthy dead people move slow i could see right away it was pointless though neither of us had anything like enough ammunition finster i shouted stopyou cant get them all you have a better idea he asked me his eyes looked crazed and i thought he might be hyperventilating yes come on this way i grabbed at his arm and he followed come on the reception office has the thickest walls and we can get a couple of doors between us and them i told him dashing around the side of the pools pump house the dead were hot on our heels but we had no problem outrunning them i rushed out onto the pool deck with my bow in my hand an arrow already halfnocked good thing too because a dead woman in a pantsuit was already there waiting for me she came stumbling toward me with her arms out like she wanted to give me a big hug i put my arrow right through her eye and jumped over her as she collapsed but what then finster demanded we just wait for them to go away no we wait for vance and the others to come rescue us i told him why couldnt he see what we needed to do i saw a dead man wearing a police uniform come stumbling through the weak part of the fence and shot an arrow through his forehead just stick with me finster well be okay if finster screamed the dead woman id put down was still moving she had grabbed at the leg of his pants as he stepped over her he kicked at her furiously even as her teeth came closer and closer to his flesh one bite and it was all overnobody ever survived a bite i nocked another arrow but couldnt be sure of hitting her the way finster was jumping around its okay im okay he shouted as he stumbled away from her she didnt get me she was still crawling toward him so i put another arrow in her ear that stopped her i made it he said gasping for breath i he wasnt looking where he was going so happy that hed escaped a fate worse than death he didnt watch his step and he fell into the pool i rushed over to the edge of the pool and looked down hed fallen into the deep end and he was crying in pain one of his legs was bent the wrong way finster come on get up i shouted at him and he waved one hand at me to indicate he just needed a minute that he would get up any time now we didnt have a minute the dead were streaming around the sides of the pump house coming straight for us i felt candy stir against my back as she woke up why couldnt she just have slept through this i should have left finster there of course thats how it was supposed to work if you couldnt walk you couldnt survive but then simon couldnt walk either vance had changed some of the rules hed changed who we were hed made us into good people again given us something to live for take my hand i shouted at finster thrusting my arm down into the pool take my goddamned hand he blinked away his tears and struggled to get up when he tried moving his broken leg he screamed in agony i looked away to check on the dead they were very close now before i could look back at finster he reached up and snagged my arm i hauled him upwards pulling so hard i thought my arm might come out of its socket he got his free hand over the lip of the pool though and helped me pull him up stand up lean on me we have to run now i said once he was out of the pool think of it like a threelegged race okay he didnt say anything his face was a mask of pain but he hopped on his good foot his arm clutched tight around my shoulders we were still faster than the dead inside the reception lobby it was dark and cool once i closed all the window shutters the dead hammered on the steel core door from the outside their fists banging away at the wood veneer it was holding for the moment i locked it though i doubted any of them were smart enough to try to turn the knob then i headed into the back office where id left finster and candy i barricaded the door of the reception office as best i could shoving furniture up against it in a way that might slow the dead down for a minute or two candy had fully woken up by that point and wanted to know what was going on nothing honey were safe i told her and she believed me its amazing how trusting a threeyearold can be i had finster laid out on the desk his leg propped up on a pile of old file folders there was blood on his jeans that could mean one of two things either when hed fallen his leg had suffered a compound fracturewhich was very bador that hed lied when he said the dead woman hadnt bitten him which would be a lot worse the only way to find out was to take his pants off which i didnt have the time or the steady nerves to do just then i shoved my back up against the wall farthest from the door and sank down to sit on the floor i just needed to calm down i just needed to breathe carefully this didnt have to be the end for us we could survive this i wanted to cry i wanted to scream and bang on the walls with my fists and shout for the dead to go away and tear my hair out and curl up in a ball and throw up in horror i didnt do any of those things because candy was watching me very closely i could have been a good actress i could have won an oscar darcy finster said his breath coming in ragged spurts i want you to know something i want you to know how i feel since i may not get another chance and save it i told him which was maybe a little cruel but i couldnt afford to hear what he was going to say i pulled the walkietalkie off my belt and checked the battery still about twenty minutes of talk time left vance i said vance if you can hear me come in there was no response so i waited a minute and tried again after that i waited five minutes before i tried a third time meanwhile i could hear the dead in the lobby theyd gotten through the door somehow they didnt make any noise but i could hear it when they knocked over furniture or crashed into the walls how long did we have not very long vance come in please i said darcy whats going on i closed my eyes and thought about how much i loved that man this was the man who was going to save candy and me and finster vance we have a couple hundred of them here were locked in the reception office and cant get out you have to come save us i can see them vance said im about a mile away oh thank god i said oh thank you jesus stay with me darcy vance told me is everyone okay candy and i are fine finster broke his leg and its bleeding i didnt want to say what i suspected that he might already be dying of a bite wound understood hows simon holding up simon i asked as if i didnt know who he was talking about if hes screaming too much just let him play with his electronics vance was quiet for a second why dont i hear him screaming hes not in here with us i admitted the last time i saw him he was outside of the fence opposite the gate vance didnt respond for a while vance come in i shouted im still here darcy just trying to save my breath were moving fast you say simon is outside of the fence okay thats good it is vance sounded determined steadfast all of the dead are inside the fence maybe they didnt see him there maybe they just think youre the better meal since theres three of you he took his mouth away from the microphone but i could hear him giving orders joe bruce phil get down there and get that gate closedthatll give us a second or two arnold do you see simon down there take mary and just pick him up dont stop if he fights you just hold him still and pick him up yes damn it thats exactly what im saying no we are not leaving him behind we need him if were going to rebuild anything if were going to have a future vance i called vance what should we do i dont think we can get out of here without help tell me your plan hold on darcy he said and went back to issuing orders outside the dead started pounding on the office door the furniture barricade jumped every time they struck it was loud very loud in the tiny office and the air in there started to feel very stale vance please tell me how youre going to get us out of here i said the radio was silent vance please vance you son of a were not darcy i opened my eyes finster was staring down at me the barricade started to fall apart we cant we dont have the numbers if i tried i would just get all of us killed im sorry we got simon to safety if its any consolation hes going to be a big help hes going to teach us how to build things thatsno consolation at all listen you stupid motherfucker my baby is in here my little baby shes scared and alone and darcy it has to be this way were going to run away and hope the dead dont follow us i think theyll be too busy trying to get at you to notice thank you for that your sacrifice is going to let other people live my baby vance my baby is in here call me names tell me what an asshole i am if it helps vance told me i promise i wont turn my radio off until i know its over but im sorry thats all i can do for you what is he saying finster demanded i cant hear him mommy candy asked threeyearold trust only goes so far i guess i swore and screamed at vance then used every nasty obscene insult i could think of called him a prick called him impotent called him a traitor and a babykiller thought up some new names just for him but i knew even as the barricade collapsed and the dead poured into the roomeven then i knew he wasnt a bad man he was good people but these are evil times lost canyon of the dead by brian keene twotime stoker awardwinner brian keene is the author of more than a dozen

that walk all that remains today of the dinosaurs are their fossilized bones towering assemblages of which adorn museums around the world as children many of us gazed up at these skeletal monsters and imagined what it would be like if all these spines and ribs and skulls and teeth suddenly came to life and tried to devour us brian keene was likely one of those children he says this story is about cowboys dinosaurs and zombiesthe three things all little boys love i wrote this story after finishing a long serious novel i usually write something pulpy and fun after finishing something serioussort of like a palate cleanser science has learned a lot about dinosaurs who were once thought to be slow lumbering reptiles unable to cope with a changing climate we now know that dinosaurs were warmblooded and agile that they were nearly wiped out by a devastating meteor strike and that the survivors evolved into modernday birds a fact attested to by beautiful transitional fossils such as archaeopteryx one mystery that remains largely unsolved is what color dinosaurs were scientists had long assumed that dinosaurs were green like lizards or maybe gray like elephants but in recent years scientists have speculated that dinosaurs may have had more varied colorful patterns like certain kinds of snakes recent analysis of fossil melanosomes may provide some insight the dinosaur skin in our next story however could probably best be described as greenand mottledand rotting the desert smelled like dead folks the sun hung over our heads fat and swollen like that polish whore back in red creek it made me sweat just like she had it felt like we were breathing soup the heat made the stench worse our dirty handkerchiefs crusted with sand and blood were useless they stank almost as bad as the desert course it wasnt the desert that stank it was the things chasing us wed been fleeing through the desert for days none of us had a clue where we were leppo knew the terrain and had acted as our guide but he died of heatstroke on the second day and we shot him in the head before he got back up again we werent sure if the disease affected folks whod died of natural causes but we figured it was better to be safe than sorry since then wed been following the sun searching the horizons for something other than sand or dead things our canteens were empty so were our bellies we baked during daylight and froze at night all things considered id have rather been in santa fe i knew folks there had friends a girl from what wed heard the disease hadnt made it that far yet riding behind me and deke jorge muttered something in spanish ive never been able to get the hang of that language so im not sure what he said sounded like theres goats in the pool but it probably wasnt i slumped forward in the saddle while my horse plodded along my tongue felt like sandpaper my lips were cracked and swollen i kept trying to lick them but couldnt work up any spit they still back there i was too tired to turn around and check for myself still there hogan deke grunted reckon they dont need to rest dont need water slower we go the closer they get i wiped sweat from my eyes we push these horses any harder and theyre gonna drop right out from under us then well be fucked behind us janelle gasped at my language i didnt care according to the reverend it was the end of the world i figured rough language was the least of her worries the good lord will deliver us the reverend said even you mr hogan appreciate that reverend give him my thanks the next time you two talk deke rolled his eyes i grinned even though it hurt my lips we were an odd bunch to be sure deke and i had come to red creek just a month ago wed bought ourselves a stand of timber there and were intent on clearing it jorge had worked at the livery the reverend was just thathad himself a tent on the edge of town and gave services every sunday terry was just a kid couldnt have been a day over fourteen no hair on his chin yet but he shot like a man and i was pretty sure that he was sweet on janelle it was easy to see why women like her were hard to find in the west janelle was from philadelphia come to red creek after marrying a dandy twice her age dont know if she really loved him or not but shed certainly carried on when those corpses tore the old boy apart in front of the apothecary like a pack of starved coyotes red creek wasnt a big town but it was large enough that none of us had known each other until we fled together except for me and deke we were strangers thrown together by circumstance that made for an uneasy ride the first any of us heard of the disease was when a man stumbled into town one night feverish and moaning there was a nasty bite on his arm and a chunk of flesh missing from his thigh the doc took care of him as best he could but the poor bastard died just the same before he did he told the doc and his helpers about hamelins revenge thats what folks back east were calling it on account of some story about a piper and some rats the disease started with rats they overran an indian reservation back east which wasnt a surprise as far as i was concerned id seen the conditions on those reservations and figured those people would be better off sleeping at the bottom of an outhouse it was a terrible way to live the thing is these werent no ordinary rats they were dead guts hanging out maggots clinging to their bodies but they still moved and bit and whatever they bit got sick and died mostly they bit the indians the indians took ill and died off and the government didnt seem to careuntil the indians came back and started eating white folks by then it was too late the man told the doc about this and then died doc got some of the town bigwigs together and while they were having a meeting about it the dead fella got back up and ate the docs helpers then they came back and started eating folks too hamelins revenge spread fast hopping from person to person other species too before we hightailed it out of red creek i saw dead horses dogs and coyotes attacking townspeople in the streets and lots of dead people of course by then there were more corpses stumbling around than there were live folks lucky for us the dead moved slowly otherwise wed have never escaped even then it wasnt easy they swarmed trapping us inside the saloon we had to fight our way out burned most of red creek down in the process how do you kill something thats already dead shooting them in the head seems to work so does smacking them in the head with a hammer or a pickaxe or a length of kindling you can fire six shots into their chest and theyll keep on coming you can chop off their arms and legs and theyll keep wriggling like a worm on a hook but get them in the head and they drop like a sack of grain i glanced up at the sky squinting the sun hadnt moved it felt like we hadnt either our horses shuffled through the sand wobbling unsteadily janelle coughed i turned around to see if she was okay she fanned her hand in front of her nose when she saw me looking at her she frowned theyre getting closer mr hogan judging by the stench i know what do you intend to do about it i looked past her studying the horizon there were hundreds of black dotsdead things the population of red creek and then some every infected animal had joined in the pursuit too ill give the dead one thingtheyre determined sons of bitches i intend to keep moving i told her stay ahead of them we dont have enough bullets to kill them all and even if we did i reckon theyre out of range aint none of us gunslingers even if we were nobodys that good of a shotnot even your boyfriend there i nodded in terrys direction the boy blushed scowling janelle stuck her nose into the air i turned around again trying to hide my grin deke chuckled beside me shes taken a shine to you he whispered i shrugged it took a lot of effort to do so i was trying to work up enough energy to respond when something ahead of us caught my eye the flat landscape was broken by a smattering of low hills it looked like god had just dropped them right there in the middle of the desert jorge must have seen it too because he jabbered and pointed look there deke patted his horses flank we could hole up atop one of them hills make a stand shoot them as they climb up until we run out of bullets i reminded him then wed be surrounded we could drop boulders on them dont know about that but i reckon well make for those hills anyway maybe if those things lose sight of us theyll give up or maybe theres something on the other side water terrys tone was hopeful before i could answer him the sky got dark we glanced upward janelle screamed jorge made a kind of choking sound deke and terry gasped the reverend muttered a prayer i just stared in shock the sky was full of dead birds they moved like they were still alive circling and careening as one but slow parts of them kept falling off they stank the flock headed right for us dropping down like hail ride i dug my heels into my horses sides hoping she had more energy than i did apparently she had some reserves because she took off like lightning stirring up clouds of dust beneath her hooves dekes mare did the same keeping pace with us the others rumbled along behind us i looked around for some cover but there wasnt any head for them hills i shouted might be some trees or a cave i glanced over my shoulder to make sure that jorge understood the plan and what i saw stopped me cold janelle sat motionless face upturned gaping at the flock of dead birds her horse danced nervously beneath her terry held onto her horses reins and kept his own mount in check he was urging janelle to flee but if she heard him she gave no sign as i rode up to them terry fumbled with his shotgun his hands were shaking and he was having one hell of a time freeing it i grabbed his arm he looked up at me and i saw the fear in his eyes it echoed my own dont bother i said all youll do is waste ammunition skin on out of here he glanced at janelle but miss perkins ive got her you go on and ride he stared at me clearly reluctant to leave janelles side i reckon he had visions of coming to her rescue and then shed repay him by sharing his bedroll if we ever found a safe place to make camp but i went ahead and crushed those dreams we didnt have time for nonsense go on now i slapped his horse on its rear get it took off after the others and i turned to janelle i seized her horses bridle and gave it a tug the mare whinnied baring her teeth janelle did the same thing i hollered at them both as the birds drew closer i dont reckon janelle heard me over the terrible racket the birds were making frustrated i turned my horse around and kept a grip on janelles mount too my other hand clutched my colt i knew it was pointless as a defense against the birds but having it in my hand made me feel better i squeezed my mount with my legs and prodded her on hoping janelles mare would keep up with us she didfor about the first two hundred yards then fatigue heat and thirst took their toll she stumbled snorted and then sagged to the ground she didnt fall if she had that might have been it for janelle and me both instead the horse sort of eased down i snatched janelle from the saddle and plopped her down behind me she slapped my shoulders pulled my hair and insisted we go back for her horse i ignored her gritting my teeth i spurred my mount on even harder i only looked back once what i saw made me glad and sad at the same time screeching and squawking the birds fed on janelles horse covering it from head to toe pecking at its eyes and flesh but they werent chasing us anymore now that they had easier pickings deke and the others waited for us i shouted at them to go on wasnt any sense in wasting our momentary advantage the birds would strip that carcass soon enough then theyand whatever was left of janelles horsewould be back after us again along with all those other dead things loping along behind us we caught up with them and i found myself in the lead again deke and jorge flanked me terry and the reverend rode along behind i kept my eyes on the foothills and said nothing but i noticed the wounded hurt look that terry gave janelle and me the day grew hotter i wished it would rain we lost jorges horse before we reached the hills the rest of our mounts were stumbling badly the last of their strength spent jorge wept as he took a hatchet to the poor animal i wondered how he managed the tears i was so dry i couldnt spit let alone cry we all dismounted leading our horses the rest of the way i didnt much cotton to the idea but it was either that or let them keep dropping out from underneath us janelle complained about having to walk but none of us paid her any mind except for terry who offered to carry her he blushed withering under her scornful glare while the rest of us chuckled at the image of janelle riding piggyback on his shoulders across the desert the terrain changed becoming rockier soon enough we reached the foothills deke stopped us shading his eyes with his hands yall see what i see we looked where he was pointing and i whistled ill be damned there was a narrow canyon entrance wedged between two of the hills the landscape seemed to arch over it and for a moment it almost looked like a door then i wiped the sweat from my eyes and looked again nope no door just sloping canyon walls shadowed and probably a lot cooler than where we were standing lets make for that i said at the very least itll get us out of the sun for a spell and give us a place to hide might even be a stream or a pool the others seemed to brighten at this they picked up their pace even the horses seemed to sense that our luck was changing they trudged forward with renewed strength i looked back the way wed come there were a few birds circling in the haze from that distance i couldnt tell if they were dead or not but they werent heading in our direction there were however three small objects limping across the desert judging by their size and movements i figured them for dead dogs or coyotes they were too far away to be any real danger but i figured we should put some distance between them and us we made our way into the canyon mouth and again i was reminded of a door we went single filedeke and me in the lead and jorge and terry bringing up the rear a cool breeze dried the sweat on my forehead i smiled despite everything wed been through i suddenly felt better than i had in days underneath those sloping cliff walls the sun couldnt touch us with luck the dead wouldnt either the passage narrowed there was a slight but noticeable downward descent it went on like that for a while then the walls pressed closer i was just starting to doubt that wed be able to squeeze the horses through it when the canyon rounded a corner and opened wide i stood there gaping halfconvinced that what i was seeing was a mirage until deke cleared his throat behind me get a move on hogan whats the hold up see for yourself i moved my mount aside so that they could come through one by one they walked out of the narrow fissure and stopped sharing my reaction this sure aint on no map ive seen deke whispered no i agreed i dont reckon it is spread out before us from one horizon to the other was the biggest damned valley ive ever seen it was filled with all kinds of trees and plantsthings that had no business growing in the desert the lush green foliage was quite a shock after the barren wasteland wed just crossed a broad clear stream ran through the center of the valleynot quite a river but too big to be a creek the air in the valley was different it smelled just like the aftermath of a thunderstorm and it was more humid but not as hot as the desert had been although we couldnt see any the trees and bushes echoed with the sounds of wildlifedeepthroated rumblings and shrill birdcalls like nothing id ever heard before understand this wasnt just some desert oasis this was an entire hidden valley nestled between the surrounding canyon hills the terrain was unlike the rest of the desert i couldnt figure out how such a thing could be the reverend must have been thinking the same thing because he said if i didnt know better id think i was back home whys that terry asked because it reminds me of the forests back in virginia its an oasis deke said too big for that i told him its a whole valley janelle stared at the treetops swaying in the breeze how is this possible wouldnt someone in red creek have known about this does it matter deke shrugged whether they knew about it or not were here now i reckon the reverend ought to thank god for us cause as far as im concerned our prayers have been answered weve got shelter shade food and water these trees will hide us from those dead birds we led the horses down to the stream the thick undergrowth slapped our legs and brushed against our faces clouds of mosquitoes and gnats buzzed around our eyes and ears but we didnt pay them any mind unlike the dead the bugs only ate a little bit the horses drank eagerly we did the same laughing and splashing the water was cold and clear which struck me as odd thered been no snow atop the hills running in from the desert the stream shouldnt have been so frigid drinking it made my teeth hurt but i didnt care i gulped it down until my stomach cramped then i threw up and drank some more splashing water across my face whooping deke plunged into the stream and waded out until the water was up to his waist terry jorge and i stripped off our gear and followed him i turned back to janelle and the reverend who were watching us from the bank come on in i said through chattering teeth the waters fine i doubt that janelle smiled your skin is turning blue hell deke laughed my damn balls are shriveling up we all chuckled at that even janelle terry and jorge splashed each other deke ducked below the surface and came up sputtering i motioned to janelle and the reverend seriously yall should come in im fine here janelle said it wouldnt be ladylike the reverend shook his head im afraid that i cant swim mr hogan it aint that deep deke told him before the reverend could respond jorge interrupted whats he saying deke asked jorge put one finger to his lips and cupped his ear with his other hand i dont hear nothing terry said the bushes along the stream bank rustled the horses whinnied and glanced around stomping their feet i reached for my pistol realizing too late that id left it on the shore with the rest of my gear then the undergrowth parted and janelle and the reverend both screamed i was expecting another dead thingmaybe a horse or a personbut what charged out of the bushes was no corpse it was the biggest damn lizard id ever seen it stood on its hind legs towering over the horses about fifteen feet long from head to tail and probably weighing a ton despite its size the thing moved fast arms outstretched it ran on two legs towards janelle and the reverend each hand had three fingers the middle fingers were equipped with claws the size and shape of a grain sickle it had a big head and an even bigger mouth full of arrowheadsized teeth its tongue flicked the air as it made a hissing throaty sort of roar shrieking janelle dove into the stream the reverend ran after her i noticed that hed pissed his pants he paused glancing back and forth from the water to the lizard as if trying to decide which one he feared the most the creature slashed the throat of terrys mount the poor beast took two faltering steps and then fell over the other horses scattered as they did three more giant lizards emerged from the bushes and attacked them the cries the horses made as they were slaughtered was one of the worst sounds ive ever heard we hurried to the far side of the stream while the lizards busied themselves with their kills tearing and ripping sticking their snouts into the horses abdomens and rooting around i glanced back and noticed that the reverend had waded into the water up to his knees he stood there trembling watching in horror as the lizards feasted come on i shouted while theyre distracted he shook his head somebody has to help him janelle said one of you get back over there the hell with that deke said wading onto the shore i aint even going back for my gear you think id go back for him janelle gasped he is a man of god then i reckon god will keep him safe deke replied either that or hell meet god real soon ill get him terry splashed into the stream cursing i jumped in after him hogan deke yelled where the hell are you going get back here our guns are over there i told him were going to need them that was my excuse anyway deep down inside i wondered if i was doing it for janelle instead i waded after terry we made it about halfway across the stream before pausing the lizards were still eating so far theyd ignored the reverend he stood there glancing back and forth between them and us his chin quivered and his legs shook come on reverend i waved at him trying to keep my voice low the movement attracted the attention of one of the lizards it raised its bloody snout and snorted cocking its head sideways and studying terry and me id been charged by a bull once while crossing a pasture the lizard had the same look in its eyes as the bull right before it charged terry i whispered dont move just stay still he nodded the color drained from his face reverend i said keeping my voice calm and steady you need to get in this creek right now it dont matter if you cant swim terry and i will carry you but get your ass over here nodding he inched forward the water rippled around his knees his lips moved in silent prayer his eyes were closed thats it i whispered easy now nice and slow i glanced at the lizards all four of them watched us now they stood stiff and tense ready to spring one of them was missing an eye the left side of its face was a mass of scar tissue left over from some longago fight giants in the earth the reverend muttered leviathan it was hard to hear him over the churning water what its a bible verse mr hogan there were giants in the earth in those days only verse i know is jesus saves reckon ill take your word for it he stopped gasping as the water reached his crotch one of the lizards crept towards the stream ccold the reverend stammered its so cold thats okay weve got you terry give him a hand hogan deke called little busy right now i said the lizard on the bank lowered its head and sniffed the spot where the reverend had been standing the other three turned away from us and stared into the forest i followed their gaze and saw why the three dead coyotes id noticed earlier had followed us into the canyon now they stood under the tree line watching us with blank lifeless eyes one of them was missing an ear anothers broken ribs were sticking through its fur they didnt pant didnt growl they just stared flies hovered around them in clouds oh hell terry said the reverends eyes grew wider what is it whats wrong he started to turn around but i stopped him never you mind just give terry your hand lets get out of here before they decide to have us for dessert as terry reached for the reverends trembling hand the lizard on the bank leaped into the stream splashing water over our heads at the same time the dead coyotes lumbered into the clearing the other three lizards went for them the one with the missing eye seized a coyote in its massive jaws and shook the corpse back and forth the reverend and terry both slipped sinking below the surface they came up sputtering and flailing the reverend clung to terrys shoulders almost dragging him back down again the lizard surged forward squealing i splashed water at it in an attempt to scare it off but all i did was make it swim faster let go terry choked cant breathe sobbing the reverend clutched him tighter they both went down again and then the lizard was on them close enough that i could feel its breath on my face it smelled like rotten meat its jaws closed around terrys head and lifted him out of the water his legs and arms jittered and i could hear him screaming inside its mouth the creature gutted him from groin to neck with one of those sickleshaped claws while holding the reverend beneath the surface with its hind legs on the far shore janelle deke and jorge screamed i backpedaled unable to take my eyes off the slaughter the lizard was busy with terry and the reverend and paid me no mind neither did the other three they feasted on the horses and coyotes i stumbled out of the stream and shouted at the others to run without looking back we plunged into the forest panicked and terrified soon the greenery swallowed us we made camp inside a hollowed out tree id never seen anything like it before though id heard tell of some big trees out in california and reckoned this might be like them it was large enough for the four of us to sit inside comfortably the top had snapped off at some point but the trunk was still standing we were able to fashion a crude roof using leaves and branches there were bugs insidebeetles and ants and suchbigger than any id ever seen but harmless janelle was afraid of them but she was more afraid of what might be outside all we had was what had been in our pocketsa bit of paper and a pencil dekes compass a pouch of chewing tobacco janelles frilly lace handkerchief some money and other odds and ends it got cold after the sun went down we had no matches or flint we huddled together for warmth janelle fell asleep with her cheek resting on my shoulder when she breathed her breasts rubbed against my arm soft and warm that made everything wed been through almost worth it a few lizards passed by close enough for us to see them none of them were like the ones from the creek one was the size of a cow with a long neck and even longer tail it sniffed around the base of the tree but was more interested in eating leaves than it was in us another one a baby judging by its size had a bill like a duck one of the creatures shook the ground as it lumbered by trees snapped crashing to the earth we saw its legs and hind end but not the rest of it some of the lizards had feathers most didnt right before sundown the forest got real dark as something flew overhead i poked my head out and looked up through the branches i caught a glimpse of a flying creature with a fifteenfoot wingspan it reminded me more of a bat than a bird we stayed there all night we didnt talk much when we did it was in short hushed whispers so we wouldnt attract attention janelle and deke slept jorge shut his eyes but opened them every time there was a noise from the forest deke cried in his sleep but i didnt mention it to him after all i cried too only difference was my eyes were open what are they janelle asked the next morning big damn lizards deke told her i know that but where did they come from ive got an idea i said yall know about these big bones in the rocks that folks dig up out of the ground right sure deke replied theres rich people who collect them janelle nodded theyre called fossilsall that remains of the dinosaurs yeah i said thats the word i reckon these lizards are living versions of those fossils theyre dinosaurs the reverend might have disagreed with you on that deke said he seemed to think they were something out of the bible i dont remember any dinosaurs in the good book well the reverends dead i dont reckon hell be any more help janelle frowned you should be more respectful of the dead mr hogan i usually am but our recent experiences with the dead have soured me a bit its hard to be respectful of something when its trying to eat you but the reverend wasnt like those dead no he wasnt i reckon he was one of the lucky ones youre forgetting one thing deke said i thought dinosaurs were supposed to be extinct somebody forgot to tell them that jorge glanced at each of us as we talked clearly trying to follow the conversation his expression was desperate i smiled at him he smiled back and then pointed outside im with him deke said lets get out of here we need to find our way back to the desert i agreed but the dead are still out there janelle said theyre here in the valley too i reminded her but there arent any dinosaurs in the desert given a choice id rather take my chances with just the dead rather than worrying about them both deke rubbed the whiskers on his chin you remember how to get back to the canyon entrance no i shook my head i got all turned around when we ran i was hoping one of you knew the way neither deke nor janelle remembered and when we tried asking jorge he just stared at us in confusion and pointed outside again try your compass i told deke lets get a bearing on where we are and which direction well need to go he pulled it out wiped condensation from the lens and then stared at it whats wrong janelle asked damned thing aint working deke muttered its just spinning round and round like it cant find north let me see i tried it for myself sure enough the needle just kept spinning in a circle i handed it back to him how much did you pay for that five cents that was five cents too much it worked in the desert well it aint working now jorge pointed outside again we cant just go stumbling around through this valley deke said well get eaten that might be so i agreed but we cant stay here either then what do you propose hogan i say we head for high ground the valley is ringed by those hills i say we get to the top of one of them and then work our way back down to the desert should be easy without the horses thats another problem deke said with no mounts how do we stay ahead of the dead once we make it out of here i shrugged theyre slow and judging by the shape those coyotes were in yesterday id say the desert has been harder on them than it was on us long as we keep moving we should be able to outpace them with any luck theyll fall apart before too much longer and if youre wrong janelle asked i didnt have an answer for her none of us did soon as it was light we crept outside and held our breath when nothing charged out of the undergrowth we relaxed i shimmied up a tree and got a fix on our location the hills were there on the horizon ringing the valley pale clouds floated above them almost touching their tips i saw a few dinosaurslongnecked softeyed things with square blunt teeth chewing on the treetops they reminded me of cows i shuddered watching them warily big as they were they could have reached me in no time luckily they paid me no attention we set off on our trek through the valley i took the lead followed by deke and janelle jorge brought up the rear we went slowly communicating with each other through hand gestures the forest was full of animal noises but they werent sounds that i recognized there were croaking raspy grunts and long hisses and chirps that sounded almost but not quite like birdsongs the first sound we recognized was a tree snappinga loud crack like a schoolmarms paddle smacking someones behind we couldnt tell which direction it was coming from then we heard it crash to the ground the forest floor vibrated with the impact another tree snapped we caught a glimpse of the thinga tail as long as a stagecoach and hind legs taller than a barn it was walking away from us we hurried straight ahead not wanting to attract its attention we moved so fast that we didnt see the dead dinosaur until it lurched out of the undergrowth janelles shriek echoed through the valley deke and i dove to the side jorge stood there gaping as it towered over him staring down at him with one good eye i recognized the lizard right away it was the same one wed encountered the day before the missing eye and the scars on its face were unmistakable when wed last seen it the dinosaur was still alive apparently the dead coyote it had eaten hadnt agreed with it because now it was deadinfected with hamelins revenge it already stank a swarm of flies hovered around it its movements were sluggish but it was still quick enough to catch jorge he tried to run but it swiped at his back plunging its talons into his skin and lifting him off the ground jorge jerked and jittered like a drunk at a square dance he opened his mouth to scream and vomited blood instead the lizards claws burst through his chest then the dinosaur ripped him in half i grabbed janelles hand and forced her to run with me deke was at my side breathing heavily his cheeks were flushed i wanted to ask him if he was all right but couldnt spare the breath we plunged through the greenery heedless of where we were going or what was around us oneeye lumbered after us we couldnt see him but his steady thudding footfalls kept pace the ground started to slope upward the trees tilted forward then thinned out janelle stumbled and fell but i scooped her up in my arms and continued on dekes face turned beet red he was drenched with sweat not much farther i panted just keep climbing they nodded janelle tapped my shoulder indicating that she wanted down she was wobbly when she first tried to stand but soon regained her footing we scrabbled upward the vegetation thinned to scrub and the soil turned rocky huge boulders thrust from the earth i glanced back down into the forest and saw treetops swaying back and forth as oneeye passed beneath them then he lurched into sight without pausing he started up the hill its no use deke sobbed mopping his brow with his shirttail that things dead it wont tire itll just keep coming until we tucker out and then get us i aint gonna let that happen i said well how do you reckon you can stop it deke glanced back down at the dinosaur creeping closer but still a long way off we aint got any weapons sure we do i smiled patting the boulder next to me hogan youve lost your damned mind deke stumbled to his feet what are you gonna do spit at it no when it gets closer im gonna drop this rock on its head that was your idea yesterday remember will that work janelle asked i shrugged depends on whether i hit him or not we waited for it to get closer janelle got nervous but i calmed her down assuring her that my plan would work and it did when the dinosaur was right below us close enough that we could smell it again and hear the insects buzzing around its corpse deke and i rolled the boulder out over the ledge and dropped it right on the lizards head there was a loud crack like the sounds the snapping tree trunks had made oneeye sank to the ground the boulder tumbled down the hillside after a moment the twicedead dinosaur did the same cheering janelle and deke both hugged me then before i even realized what was happening janelle kissed me her lips were blistered and cracked from the sun but i didnt mind i pulled her to me and kissed her back we didnt stop until deke cleared his throat we ought to get going he said i reckon there will be more like him coming along shortly youre probably right i agreed lets go ill race you both to the top we scrabbled to the summit laughing and talking about our good fortune it occurred to me that we should feel bad about jorge and the others and i did of course but at that moment i was just happy to be alive and even happier about that kiss i felt something i hadnt felt in a long time hope that sensation crumbled when we reached the summit we stood there unable to speak janelle began to cry instead of desert spread out before us was more forestan endless sea of green treetops swaying as things passed beneath them no deke whispered this cant be right this aint on any of the maps i put my arm around janelle i dont think were on the maps anymore deke deep in the valley below something roared i glanced over my shoulder another dinosaur emerged from the forest its head was as big as a fullgrown buffalo and its teeth were the size of tent pegs it was obviously dead it might have escaped extinction but it couldnt escape hamelins revenge death is funny that way in the end it gets us all as we ran i wondered if one day folks would dig our bones out of the ground like they had the dinosaurs and if so which kind of dead wed be pirates vs zombies by amelia beamer

summer our next story is set in the same milieu many people dream of owning a yacht who wouldnt revel in the freedom to sail the seas while enjoying all the amenities problem is yachts are kind of expensivethe worlds largest yacht the foot project platinum owned by the crown prince of dubai is estimated to cost upwards of million in a former child actor named skylar deleon who once starred on mighty morphin power rangers took a yacht out for a test drive then tied the yachts owners to the anchor and threw them overboard thats one way to get a yachtat least until you get arrested and sentenced to death if people are willing to do stuff like that to get their hands on a yacht now just imagine what theyll be doing when boats become the only way to put some distance between you and the zombieinfested mainland this strategy may not always work out of coursejust take a look at the ending of zack snyders remake of dawn of the dead in which the survivors forsake the safety of a shopping mall for the freedom of the open seas with unfortunate results as the title implies our next story is a tale of piracy and zombies on the high seas a warning about how in a disaster empathy is often the first casualty and a reminder that though a plague of zombies may sweep away the world you knew the person you are and the problems you face often stay depressingly the same the noise a zombie makes when its eating someone is a lot like the sound of drunk people having sloppy sexgrunting and moaning and wet smacking kelly was in a rowboat below eating people you couldnt help but hear it over the sound of water against the ship we hadnt known there was a rowboat down there we hadnt known hed turn into a zombie what were we supposed to do when your friend turns into a zombie you have to do something wed grabbed him by his hands and feet and swung him like you swing a little kid and then we flung him into the water only he didnt splash he thudded we looked down over the side of the ship and swore the person hed landed on was smashed so badly we couldnt tell if it had been a man or a woman the other person in the rowboat had fainted sorry wed called both of the people in the rowboat woke up before they died they screamed we screamed and then we vomited off the side of the ship until our stomachs heaved dry and our noses ran and our eyes watered did you bring water we asked one another where is the water who has kleenex when was i supposed to get water we asked before or after the customers started rioting when we were running to the car or running to the pier we took stock of the ship ten paces from front to back no cabin no facilities no supplies no water it was the only ship left a replica of the niña columbuss ship the sign had said so when wed stolen it our phones didnt have service no one knew we were out here we wiped our faces on our sleeves and spat one of us had a box cutter we supposed we could use it to open our wrists if we had to we sat down to wait for help the sun was setting and it was going to be a cold night it takes a while to eat a person this would be the last thing that kelly taught us at trader joes hed trained us and introduced us around and let us know who was friendly and who wasnt hed brought us to the bay too after people had started turning into zombies in the coffee aisle maybe zombies could swim hed said but it would be a lot easier to defend your territory on a boat now there were three zombies in the rowboat they were quiet but for a soft moan now and again like the sounds we all made when hung over the whole bay was foggy with screaming boats of all sizes littered the water motoring or drifting there were screams from the emeryville shore and the berkeley shore and from oakland further south and inland and we thought we could hear them from the bay bridge and treasure island and across the water from san francisco the world was over and it wasnt even yet we were thirsty we looked over the side at the rowboat it was starting to drift away there were gallons of water in it safe plastic gallons plus backpacks that surely had clothes and first aid gear and food bedrolls oars those people were far better prepared than we were and see what it got them we looked at one another but the decision had already been made help wasnt coming if we were going to survive we had to lower our standards we lowered a length of rope cooing and beckoning to the zombies kelly grabbed onto it and started climbing up hed lost his glasses but maybe zombies werent nearsighted we swung the rope away from the boat and let it go dropping him into the water turns out zombies cant swim so we did the same thing to the other zombies they sank that was the one thing the ship had rope we took turns climbing down a rope and taking the water and gear from the little boat like the grinch stealing christmas and it felt like christmas after we had enough supplies to last a few days plus we didnt drop each other we cleaned up and then we did something secret we gave ourselves pirate names juicy liu highwater mark and justin case it seemed fitting wed stolen a boat wed killed kelly twice that made us pirates we were no longer the kind of people we thought we were so we had to give up something juicy volunteered to take the first watch she wouldnt be able to sleep anyway she said but then she kept me and highwater up singing a threehour tour over and over she didnt know any of the other words so she kept singing those when she got bored of that she sang row row row your boat voices from neighboring boats joined in for the first few minutes it made me believe that humanity could survive i dozed but came awake when she nudged me with her foot the singing was over juicy snuggled into my bedroll i paced the deck understanding why someone would sing its like making noise when hiking to warn the rattlesnakes if you were singing you were too crazy to be bothered so i started singing christmas carols because i couldnt remember any other songs then james taylor the beatles dylan i found that i knew all of the lyrics to in da club by cent so i shouted those a few times i thought i heard kelly rapping with me that was impossible but i looked for him anyway the water was calm and unbroken i woke highwater as the sky started turning a friendly blue i hadnt seen dawn in ten years or more not since early morning marching band practice in high school i watched the sky warm while i lay in highwaters bedroll and i remembered how everyone even cute girls looked lumpy in band uniforms girls with their hair up in the uniform hats like librarians librarians with chin straps marching in formation with books in their mouths instead of clarinets no way columbus sailed the ocean blue on this thing juicy said i dont even know anyone who can sail a square sail its got to have an outboard motor i squinted against the light juicy was beautiful its funny i had no recollection of her previous name and no desire to remember whatever it was had never suited her but where are we going to go highwater was sunburned and he smelled like the kitchen of a long john silvers at the end of the night i could still see the empty dock far off the port bow unless it was the starboard bow i wondered which way it worked if it was like stage directions avast a voice called down below in the water there was a little man in a little motorboat he pointed a little handgun at us we put our hands up trained by cop dramas put your hands down dya think id have bothered you if i thought you had weapons he said he had a smile like a fighting dog just toss your supplies over water and food blankets first aid whatever you got sunscreen especially he wore sunglasses the bastard but his bald head was a deep painful pink i mean it he said i dont want to waste my ammo okay okay give us a minute highwater said always the fast thinker what do we do he whispered i found that i was very thirsty were pirates i said sowhat juicy whispered we parlay i squirmed out of the bedroll came to the edge of the boat lets join forces man i called were resourceful folks the kind you want on your side we stole all of this stuff ourselves and dispatched three of you know those things nobody had said the z word yet and i didnt want to be the first the little man shot his little gun the three of us on the niña hit the deckwas that where the phrase came fromand waited my ears rang i mean it the little man shouted okay you win i called so we lost our supplies and the little man motored off this cant be a fullsize ship juicy said its maybe tentwelve paces from bow to stern maybe its a scale model i guessed we were going to die of thirst unless one of us turned into a zombie out of nowhere the way kelly had and then wed die of being zombies maybe dying of thirst wasnt the worst way to go the worst way to go i thought was being lashed headtohead with a decomposing skeleton and left to starve some king did that to his enemies back in the day when people could do things like that and not get put on trial for being a terrorist although probably youd still just die of thirst we searched the place now that we had daylight we didnt find any water but we found a whip lashed to the wall below deck whether it was a fullsized whip or just to scale i dont know it was big i went to show off and hit myself in the ear it didnt even snap back when phones and the internet still worked people on twitter had said that you could use whips to control the zombies that and how zombieism was an std incubating before it turned its victims those people had to be zombies by now due to their total lack of bullshit detectors but we were thirsty enough to try anything juicy took the whip from me she switched it without hitting herself it popped like when indiana jones does it she called for kelly a few minutes later kelly bobbed up out of the water so maybe zombies could swim maybe they were just lazy they needed external motivation juicy talked to him using the whip for punctuation she said his name he still responded to it which didnt bother any of us though maybe it should have he knew our names at one point someone did kelly climbed up the rope we dangled down for him he stood dripping onto the deck eyeing us as if we were a hundred dewy virgins he looked that way at all of us which probably upset juicy he didnt seem to remember that theyd been together but it was nice to have him back i told him so but he didnt say much we need you to attack them juicy said pointing shed picked out a nice little motorboat the kind that has a cabin with refrigerators and beds and a bigass water tank kelly made a noise like the incredible hulk and wiggled his hips like elvis i think he still loved juicy she told him to go wait in the water and act like he was drowning with luck he wouldnt look dead that way he smiled at juicy and he went it was like bioterrorism what we were doing it was like giving smallpoxinfected blankets to the native americans it was like taking someone elses towel off the hook on the locker room wall when theyre in the shower because yours got wetit was just plain mean we waved to the motorboat we pointed to kelly we pointed at the rigging or the spar or the mizzenmast whatever the sail was attached to there was no wind the elderly couple understood and they motored over to where kelly bobbed and waved they seemed like such nice people helping out a stranger like that we reminded ourselves that it was us or them the couple threw out a rope they pulled kelly out of the black water and by the time they dropped the rope and backed away he was wiggling onto their deck and then it was like an l l bean catalog gone terribly wrong flannel tearing and sensible shoes flying while kelly ate we argued about whether we should have done something differently we called our new home the superball itd had a different name before but the paint got messed up when juicy pulled the boat up next to the niña shes never been good at parallel parking but you should have seen her boldly swimming over to get the boat with the whip in her teeth her clothes all wet and clingy it was all highwater and me could do not to jump on her once we got aboard the boat i saw the way he looked at her and he saw the way i looked at her we were both ashamed of ourselves going after kellys girl although it wasnt like he was taking care of her anymore and hed always been flirting with other girls rumor had it hed been screwing around we let the old couple stay they obeyed the whip like kelly and it was their boat after all we started calling them homer and marge which are terribly oldfashioned names when you think about it their hair was thin and fine and pale and both of them were balding they wandered around on the deck moaning they were always together groping each other even kelly followed them around but they ignored him us pirates stayed inside the cabin that way all of the other boats that went past would think that we were already a ghost ship we would be safe back on shore it would be like every zombie movie youve ever seen here it was peaceful we played with the ouija board we found but we couldnt contact any ghosts youd think with this many dead people around we could find a ghost willing to talk we checked the radio but no one would talk to us on that either or maybe the batteries were dead i taught juicy some hymnals that i remembered from o brother where art thou also the chorus of a screamer by this band lordi called the night of the loving dead i couldnt remember any of the words except for the title but i sang it and she smiled even then i knew shed already chosen highwater they hadnt even kissed yet not in front of me but i knew it shouldnt have bothered me but it did juicy asked me to go outside the look she gave me when she closed the door told me she knew how i felt her eyes were wet with desire or maybe grief or need she couldnt stop herself she was trying to tell me i paced waiting for her to open the door i wanted to call out her nameher real namebut the only one i could remember was kellys i opened my mouth to say it just in case then i heard grunting and moaning and wet smacking the crocodiles by steven popkes steven popkes is the author of two novels caliban landing and slow lightning his short fiction has

to horror nazis and zombies are like peanut butter and chocolatevery evil peanut butter and chocolate that is dr mengeles gruesome experiments on living subjects german technological prowessas demonstrated by the v rocketsand hitlers obsession with supermen and the occult make it all too easy to imagine fiendish nazi experiments reanimating dead soldiers a wellknown example is the video game wolfenstein in which you play a lone american agent who must penetrate secret nazi labs crawling will all manner of grotesque monstrosities the recent horror movie dead snowwhich features a memorable scene in which one of the heroes chainsaws off his own arm after it is bitten by a zombieis about a group of tourists who inadvertently awaken a colony of frozen nazi zombies left over from world war ii it must be said that these examples and several others we could name are pretty campy with nazis used as a convenient shorthand for faceless evil our next tale is a completely different sort of story this is a tale told from the point of view of a world war iiera german scientist a man who loves his wife and child which makes his inhuman detachment about his work all the more chilling this is nazi zombies as high art a tale so full of plausiblesounding scientific and historical detail that youll start to wonder if maybe these sorts of experiments were real after all i could not make a silk purse from a sows ear but i went over the data again to see if i could find a tiny tatter of bright thread in the otherwise disappointing results there had to be a better use of a welleducated chemical engineer than cannon fodder willem my wifes uncle called me max he said a happy disembodied voice over the phone very sorry about your work and all that how was it going it didnt surprise me he already knew we didnt get the results wed hoped for i said but there are other areas in the war effort where fuel filtration research would be entirely applicable aircraft engines for instance no doubt he said chuckling however by an astonishing coincidence i was planning to call you anyway i have a good use for your skills oh really i said with a sinking feeling i had no desire to work for the gestapo uncomfortable work at the very least yes theres a doctor otto weber doing some very interesting biological work in buchenwald he can use your help what sort of work im sure id be the wrong person to discuss it with you not being a scientist or an engineer ill work out the details of the transfer and send round the papers and tickets i really ought to find out how i can be of service theres always the regular army im sure a man of your caliber ill be looking for your messenger fine oh and max yes weekly reports on everything and everybody all right of course i said you dont argue with the gestapo even my elsas uncle otto weber was a thin elderly gentleman once he had been quite tall he was now stooped with age his eyes were washed out and watery like blue glass underwater but his hands were steady as he first lit my cigarette then his own weber called them tote männer once he showed me their decomposing condition and singleminded hunger i thought the term apt weber was brought the first host in and had to keep the disease alive with new hosts from the gestapowhich they were always willing to supply though in small lots so he never had more than a few laboratory subjects at a time he was never told where that first host came from but he surmised south america later in when the laboratory was at buchenwald the gestapo supplied him with a slow but steady trickle of gypsies what he had discovered when i joined the project in was that infection was only successful by fluid transport from the infected host infection was in two phases and there were at least two components to the disease in one experiment weber took fluid from a toter mann and filtered three samples one through a micron filter one through a micron filter and one through a chamberland filter the micron wash caused full infection the micron also caused a partial infection involving quick and sudden pain followed by an inevitably fatal stroke he called this partial infection type ia the chamberland wash caused a particularly quick and virulent form of rabiesweber referred to that as type ib hence webers hypothesis of two components for a full infection one large and the other the rabies virus he had isolated a worm as the possible large component in that when collected and washed of any contaminants it seemed to cause an ia infection similar to the infection caused by the micron wash when the chamberland wash was recombined with the worm full infection ensued weber had even characterized the partial infections and the stages of the full infection i found it interesting that the partial infections were both dismal painful affairs while the full infection showed up first as euphoria followed by sleepiness and coma the subject awoke in a few days as a toter mann even so i was surprised that there hadnt been more discovered in four years after all weber had the tote männer themselves and their inherent ability to infect others the gestapo was willing to provide a constant if limited supply of hosts but webers horror of contagion was so strong that every step had to be examined minutely until he had determined to his satisfaction that he could properly protect himself and his staff dissection was a long and tedious process vivisection was almost impossible i suppose i could not blame him even a partial infection would be fatal and full infection always resulted in another toter mann no one wanted to risk that thus my first task was the design and construction of a dissection and histology laboratory where weber could disassemble the subjects in safety it was not a difficult task i came to buchenwald in july by the end of the month i had the design and began construction weber dissected his first wriggling subject by the first of september my fuel work had been much more interesting it was exacting exciting work with great applications here i was barely more than a foreman the war in russia seemed to be going well and i wondered if i should have protested more to willem but elsa and our son helmut loved weimar the city was pretty in a storybook way it didnt hurt that the bombers left weimar largely undisturbed instead striking in germany proper it lent the city a relative calm several young couples had taken over the empty housing this was early in the war and food and petrol though rationed were still plentiful i didnt work weekends and the three of us spent many summer days in the park on the ilm it occurred to me during those pleasant hours watching helmut playing in front of goethes house that this was perhaps a better use of my time than the factory or the lab within a week of opening the new facilities weber made some astonishing discoveries histological examination of the brain tissue of the tote männer showed how the worms nested deep in the higher functioning brainclearly explaining why there were only tote männer and not tote rats and tote cats he speculated that there could be tote gorillas and tote chimpanzees and went so far as to request animals from the berlin zoo the zoo was not cooperative weber reconsidered his new world origin of the disease and attributed it to africa or indonesia where the great apes lived it stood to reason that a complex disease found suddenly in humans would require a similar host in which to evolve prior to human infection however the worms were only one half of the disease the virus followed the nervous system through the body enabling worm entry into the brain but also enabling the growth of strong cords throughout the body this was further proof of the twocomponent infection model weber had developed in the case of partial infections of the worm or the virus the process only went so far forced by the absence of the virus to remain within the bodys major cavities the worm caused fevers and paralysis blocking blood vessels mechanically causing a heart attack or stroke the virus enabled the worm to penetrate directly into the brain leaving the heart and circulatory system intactat least for a while without the worm the virus merely crippled the nervous system causing fevers seizures and great pain the cords only appeared when both were present weber was convinced by the pathology of the disease that the tote männer virus was a variant of rabies but the biological history of the virus the worm and the virusworm combination was mysteriously speculative i dutifully reported this to willem along with descriptions of weber his assistant brung and his mistress josephine whom we had met at dinner in weimar earlier in the summer unsure whether willems desire for detail extended to the subjects i included the names of the last couple of gypsy hosts left from the buchenwald experiments and the newer jews we had appropriated from the main population of the camp weber was curiously reluctant to use the handicapped and mentally deficient and he hated using poles perhaps this stemmed from some event in his past of which i was unaware willem paid his niece a christmas visit visiting our laboratory only coincidentally he was impressed with our progress with the tote männer we will crush russia he said over drinks that evening weber paled there will be problems using the tote männer in winter he said obliquely eh willem looked at me speak plainly the tote männer cannot thermoregulate this doesnt show up in laboratory conditions but below ten degrees celsius the worms do not function properly by freezing they die and the host dies with them willem considered that we can clothe them weber grew excited they do not generate enough heat humans maintain temperature cats maintain temperature crocodiles do not they do not eatthe hunger for brains is no more than the desire of the disease to perpetuate the infectionthe way horsehair worms cause crickets to drown themselves they do not consume what they put in their mouths metabolism keeps the body temperature above ambient somewhat like large lizards clothing lizards would have no more effect than clothing tote männer i see willem said he patted down his vest until he located his cigarettes and lighter im going out on the porch for a smoke max will you join me weber looked as if hed swallowed a lemon he rose as if to join us but willem waved him back dont bother this gives max and me a chance to exchange a little gossip outside we lit our cigarettes and watched the snow fall its true what weber said we cant use them as soldiers i thought for a moment before answering comparing them to crocodiles is apt you cant make a soldier out of an animal and its too cold for them in the east then what good are they is this all for nothing i did not say they could not be a weapon tell me the crocodile simile is better than you know they are very fast and very strong there is so little to their metabolism that they are hard to kill and they are terrifyingyouve seen them you know we must be able to make some use of them i shook my head i dont know enough yet i need to perform some experiments weber has discovered the basic science now it is time to apply some german engineering willem nodded ill do what i can he grimaced two weeks ago the japanese attacked the americans the americans declared war on japan we declared war on each other they allied themselves with the british which brings them into the war in europe the americans are too far away they dont have the strength of mind to make much difference so we thought in the last war the point is i may not have much time to give the goal was to deploy tote männer to a suitable front and have them wreak havoc on the enemy while leaving our own troops alone the tote männer would terrify and demoralize the enemy our troops would march in behind them clearing the area of enemy soldiers and tote männer alike simple only we did not have a means by which we could create a large number of tote männer simultaneously or a means by which we could be sure they would discriminate between our soldiers and the enemy weber attacked the discrimination problem while i considered issues of scale buchenwald was too small and low volume to be useful to us auschwitz was more appropriate to our needs however auschwitz was already overwhelmed with the volume of its operation in october the birkenau expansion of auschwitz had begun it was scheduled to be complete in the spring willem had shown me copies of the plans it was clear that only minor modifications to the birkenau plans would accommodate our needs much more easily than building an addition to buchenwald or moving to auschwitz proper in january of i kissed elsa and helmut goodbye and boarded the train to krakow from there i took a car west it was beautiful country full of gently rising mountains over flat valleys curiously unspoiled either by industry or by the war auschwitz was a complex not a single camp like buchenwald there were several smaller camps near the headquarters birkenau was further west here construction was going on apace in spite of the winter weather the foundations for gas chambers and crematoria had already been laid but that didnt matter as far as i was concerned the addition of some larger chambers and holding areas was an insignificant change to a wellmanaged engineering project i went over the modifications in detail with the chief engineer a man named tilly willem had sent me with a certificate of authority that gave me the full support of tilly and the chief of the camps rudolf hoess even though they did not know the reason for the modifications i finished working out the details in two weeks i spent a few days in krakow i planned to move elsa and helmut into an apartment in krakow and then travel to work by automobile it was not far and the roads were good if that proved impractical in a hard wintersomething difficult for me to predict as the weather was now mildi could just stay in the camp for a few days or come home on weekends when i returned i found i had been gone just long enough for both elsa and helmut to miss me terribly it made for a sweet homecoming weber was reluctant to plan the move but saw my logic he was preoccupied with the discrimination problem since the tote männer were attracted to normal humans as hosts he had reasoned that it was easier to attract them to a particular prey rather than repel them from a particular prey he had performed several experiments with different hosts to see if there was any preference for differing types such as racial subtype diet or other variables he could control i looked over the data and noticed that there was a marked difference in attack percentages not according to his typing but to the time the subjects arrived at the camp those subjects that were at the camp the longest were the most attractive to the tote männer i showed my figures to weber he instantly grasped the significance in ways i could not the older inmates at buchenwald were considerably thinner than the newer inmates since the rations were short fat utilization caused excretory products to be exuded by the skin and from the lungs weber reasoned these were what attracted the tote männer immediately he called willem for a mass spectrometer and a technician to run it we were all very tired but elated at this new direction we decided to take a few days off elsa helmut and i went for a trip into the mountains birkenau opened in march of weber and i stopped work on the subjects except to keep an incubating strain alive and took the month to pack up the laboratory for the move in may we moved the equipment materials and tote männer to birkenau once the planning for the move was complete weber supervised the staff and aides willem had supplied elsa and helmut traveled down to krakow by train and took up residence in the apartment i had leased for them as for myself i left buchenwald and returned to berlin for meetings with representatives of daimlerbenz and i g farben the delivery mechanism for the tote männer still had to be devised the mood in berlin that spring was jubilant the army was driving towards rostov and trying for stalingrad sevastopol was about to fall to germany the use of the tote männer could only be necessary as a last resort a doomsday scenario the reich would never need it personally i felt the same still i had no wish to help in cancelling the project unless i could find better work so i met with the daimlerbenz mechanical engineers and utilized the i g farben labs i had brought with me a pair of tote männer for testing purposes not being a mechanical engineer the problem of deployment was more difficult than i had initially imagined tote männer were a curious mixture of toughness and fragility you could shoot a toter mann until he was merely chopped meat and he might continue to advance blowing apart his brain would kill the worms and stop him but the tote männer were so resilient and resistant to anoxia that they could still advance with their hearts shattered and their sluggish black blood pooled beneath their feet however their flesh was soft enough and loosely enough attached to their bones that heavy acceleration such as dropping them with parachutes would cause them to come apart clearly they had to be preserved long enough to reach their target the daimlerbenz engineers were the best on a chalk board they drew up several ways of conveying them to enemy lines the simplest idea was a cushioned cage dropped with a parachute an impact charge would blow the doors off the cage and the tote männer would be free the engineers didnt like the idea they said it lacked elegance and style i pointed out the tote männer could tolerate significant time without ambient oxygen operating as they did largely on a lactic acid metabolism they tossed the cage idea with abandon and attacked the problem again coming up with a sphere containing carefully restrained tote männer a compressedair charge would open the doors and break loose the restraints this had the advantage of being quiet i only donated a little knowledge here and there as needed letting their minds fly unfettered it is a grand thing to watch engineers create works of imagination with only the germ of a requirement a bit of chalk and some board to write on when they found i had brought a couple of tote männer for experiments they were overjoyed i tried to explain the danger but they did not listen until one of their own number hans braun was bitten he and his friends laughed but stilled when i came over wearing surgical gloves and a mask i carefully examined the wound but i already knew what i would find you are an idiot i said as i sat back it is a small bite it is a fatal wound i gave him a pack of cigarettes you have been killed by that thing out there but shut up i couldnt look at him tall healthy brown hair and a face in the habit of smiling you have been infected by tomorrow you will feel wonderful you will want to kiss and fondle your friends out of love for them then after a few days you willstill enormously happyfeel an overpowering urge to sleep sleep will turn to coma then after three days you will be one of those things out there his hands trembled i didnt realize no hans steadied himself there is no hope none he nodded and for a moment he stood straighter stronger i was proud of him do you have a gun i do is there a furnace where we can dispose of the body he nodded shakily will you accompany me i would be honored and i was after the funeral realizing the power and speed of the tote männer and the infection they harbored the daimlerbenz engineers were more careful in a couple of weeks my part was done and i took the train to krakow to have a long weekend reunion with my elsa and helmut the following monday i drove to birkenau to address the problem of tote männer production elsa had mixed feelings about the rental while she liked the apartment itself and the proximity of park jordana she found the leftover debris and detritus disturbing these were obviously jewish artifacts and elsas excitement might have come from a mixture of womanly wariness of another females territory combined with an aversion to having anything jewish in the house i assured her that the original owners would not be returning and she relaxed somewhat helmut had no reservations about his new environment finding small objects of indeterminate origin covered with unfamiliar characters fastened in unexpected places gave mystery to the place no doubt he observed i was more inclined to answer questions about this or that artifact than i was about the american bombers or air raid drills or what father did at work i protected my family as best i could from such things for the next several months we were collecting the breath and sweat of subjects into vials injecting the vial contents into the mass spectrometer and determining what was there then we concentrated the effluvia and tried it on the tote männer themselves immediately we found that the tote männer were not attracted to merely any object smeared with the test substances only when those attractants were applied to a possible host weber thought this quite exciting it suggested that the tote männer had a means of detecting a host other than smell in october of we hit on a combination of aldehydes and ketones the tote männer found especially attractive i synthesized it in the growing chemistry laboratory we had been using and applied it to a collection of test subjects control subjects who had no application of the test attractant were also present in the experiment and were ignored until the test subjects had been thoroughly mauled at that point the controls were attacked we made careful note of this as it would strongly influence how troops would recover an infected area after the enemy succumbed we had proved our attractant in the laboratory by the end of october of but the war appeared to us to be going so well our little military experiment would never be needed we would win the battle of stalingrad in a month and concentrate on the western front that changed in november the battle of stalingrad evolved into what i had feared a siege over a russian winter the red army began their counteroffensive along with the winter like napoleon the german army was stuck the germans lost ground in other places willem suggested if i could hurry up the program i should we were in part saved by problems encountered by the daimlerbenz engineering team developing a deployment methodology had been proved harder than the engineers had foreseen they had broken the problem into three parts the first and most easily solved was how to restrain and cushion the tote männer until they could be released the remaining two issues revolved around deploying on an advance and deploying on a retreat in both cases they resolved into two kinds of scenarios how to deploy the first time and how to deploy after the first time if secrecy was kept and willem assured us the enemy did not know what we were working on then the first deployment would be relatively easy deploying on a retreat could be as simple as leaving sealed containers transported by trucks to the target zone to be opened pyrotechnically by remote control similar containers with additional cushioning could be released by parachute but once the secret was out and the allies were looking for tote männer delivery devices we would need a means to overcome their resistance this had stalled the daimlerbenz engineers i saw presentations of stealth night drops blitzkrieg raids with tanks carrying large transport cartsone enterprising young man demonstrated a quarterscale model trebuchet that could catapult a scale model container holding six tote männer as much as three kilometers behind enemy lines not to be outdone his work partner showed how bracing a toter mann could enable it to be fired from a cannon like a circus performer these issues so dwarfed our own minor problems that we were given for the moment no close scrutiny and i had the opportunity to address shortcomings in our own production in february russia won the battle of stalingrad willem warned us that we would have to expect to send tote männer against russian troops before long i argued against it it would be foolish to waste surprise in an attack that could not work at least it would not work until summer i went home and spent a week with elsa and helmut each morning i sat down and drew up production schedules scrapped them smoked cigarettes and tried again in the afternoon i played with my son it was cold in krakow and with the war not going very well heating fuel was hard to come by i was able to requisition what we needed due to my position but even i couldnt get coal for the theater or the restaurants often we spent intimate evenings together with just ourselves for company i didnt mind elsa and helmut were company enough all that spring willem told us of defeat after defeati dont think we were supposed to know what he told us i think we served as people in whom he could confide as his world crumbled germany retreated in africa the warsaw uprising the russian advance i buried myself in my work i resolved that if there were to be a failure in the program it would not be where i had control production was in my opinion our weak point webers approach to creating tote männer was haphazard and labor intensive i wanted something more robust and reliable something more industrial i came to the conclusion that our production schedule had to revolve around the progression of the disease for three days there was a strong euphoria often the new hosts tried to kiss anyone who came near them presaging the biting activity of the fully infected toter mann sometime on the third day the host fell into a sleep that progressed rapidly into coma breathing decreased to almost nothing the heartbeat reduced to a slow fraction of the uninfected body temperature dropped to nearly ambient though the infected were able to keep some warmth above room temperature the coma period lasted as long as five days though we saw it end as soon as three arousal was sudden so often precipitated by a nearby possible victim that i came to the conclusion that after three days the toter mann was ready to strike and merely waiting for the opportunity after that a toter mann was mobile for as much as ten weeks though during the last weeks of infection the toter mann showed significant deterioration therefore we required an incubation period of six days minimum effectiveness could not be counted upon after eight weeks this gave us a target window if we wanted for example to deploy on june first we had to have infected our tote männer no later than may twentyfifth this was the time domain of our military supply chain the first order of business was to synchronize the incubation period i performed a series of experiments that showed that as i suspected once the coma period had been entered the toter mann was ready to be used however there was unacceptable variation in the time between exposure and coma we couldnt reliably produce tote männer in six days the new chief medical officer mengele delivered the necessary insight zyklon b was the answer though the standard zyklon b dose would kill the subject quickly a reduced dose weakened the subject sufficiently to allow infection almost instantly commander hoess was able to supply me with enough experimental data that i could proceed with my own tests we introduced the gas waited for ten minutes then sprayed the subjects with an infecting agent the remaining three days were sufficient for subjects to recover from the gas just in time to provide healthy hosts for the organisms this method had the added bonus that the same production chambers could serve two purposes by november when the march up italy by the allies had begun and germany seemed to be losing on all fronts we could incubate as many as a thousand at a time six days after exposure the trains supplying the rest of the camp came in full and left empty so by using the empty trains for transport we could send tote männer anywhere in germany or poland delivery to the deployment launch point would have to be by truck we were ready now it was up to the daimlerbenz engineers to deliver our tote männer the last kilometer to the enemy christmas was uneventful weber and i worked on various refinements to an already prepared system without damaging it too badly my teachers back in berlin had taught me the idea of schlimmbesserung an improvement that makes things worse at that point the natural tendency of idle minds and hands to improve a working system into uselessness was our only real enemy given that we resolutely turned our attention away from the weapons system we had devised to a different problem we had discussed a year before why deliver tote männer at all the worm and virus were perfectly able to create tote männer for us why did we have to supply the raw material delivering a disease substance was perilously close to delivering a poison gassomething forbidden us from the previous war however we had already made some excursions into the territory with the production and delivery of tote männer attractanta colloid i had developed that would evaporate into the proper aldehyde and ketone mix the tote männer found so irresistible we had also attempted to deliver an infecting gas along with the zyklon b but the attempt had failed the worm succumbed to the zyklon b before the subjects creating an inhalant that carried both the worm and virus proved to be an interesting problem the virus was stable when dry and the worm could be induced to encyst itself however it took time for the worm to decyst and by the time it did the subject was fully infected with an undirected virus rabid humans made a poor host we went back to the colloid i devised for the attractant colloids are neither liquid nor solid but partake of the traits of both gelatin is a colloid by adding nutrients to the colloid so that the worm could stay alive and not encyst the virus could be delivered along with the worm when both were at their most infective stage it was interesting work for a couple of months weber was quite elated with it he called it the todesluft in may of willem paid us another visit this time he took both weber and myself aside and spoke to us privately it is clear the allies are preparing a counterinvasion the likely location is somewhere across from england on the coast of france he held the cigarette to his lips thoughtfully were ready i said boldly weve been ready for months what do the daimlerbenz engineers say willem breathed out smoke they have made several methods available to us since this is to be the first deployment we have chosen the retreat scenario we will place the tote männer in a bunker in the path of the allies and detonate it when they come are we expecting to be overrun willem shook his head of course not the tote männer are a backup plan only we will deploy them behind our own lines and only release them if we are forced past them if the front line holds we will not release them at all i nodded how many we estimate six thousand i thought quickly it takes six days for each group six thousand will take us thirtysix days willem smiled at me did you know of the expansions of birkenau commissioned early last year of course said weber they were a dreadful nuisance they are about to pay for themselves retorted willem i developed maxs original plans for birkenau beyond his conception the new facilities can serve as incubator how many at least forty thousand at once six thousand should not be a problem he pulled from his briefcase a set of plans i looked them over i was impressed with the innovations i saw this is better than i had hoped im glad you are pleased when can the first squad be ready i looked over the plans again and did some figuring on a piece of paper may if daimlerbenz can provide the bunkers and the transportation ive been assured this will not be a problem then we will be ready to deploy willem pulled a map from his briefcase our sources say we will be struck here he pointed to the map pasdecalais that is where our defenses are located and just three kilometers behind them our tote männer the allies will not know what hit them this was by far the largest group of tote männer we had ever attempted to create weber took a fatherly approach to them when the hosts entered the euphoric stage and called to him with affection he responded calling them his children and other endearments i found this unnerving when the tote männer were finally ready and installed into their transportation containers i was glad to see them go weber watched them leave with a tear in his eye i went home to my wife and son but of course the allies did not strike at pasdecalais but at normandy over three hundred kilometers to the southwest the tote männer were in their bunkers the daimlerbenz engineers had packed them like munitions there was no way to extract them without releasing them it was terrible timing all of the available tote männer were in calais and the next squad would not be ready for deployment until june three days willem conferred with his staff and said that if we could drop enough bunkers in the cerisy forest and fill them with tote männer we would let the allies overrun the forest and open the bunker at this point the new squad was just entering the coma stage wed found the tote männer were vulnerable to jostling during this period and had always transported them towards the end of the coma but desperate times require desperate measures willem and i led the crew that took the newly comatose tote männer eight thousand strong and trucked them to the forest meanwhile three large prefabricated bunkers were erected on the sites i barely had time to phone elsa to say i would not be home that night weber affectionate to the tote männer as before elected to stay and incubate the next squad i was just as glad not to have him along the bunkers were not particularly explosiveproof but would stop bullets they looked more like officers quarters than anything else we locked them and moved away to nearby trevieres this was june th by the afternoon of june th the tote männer would be alert when fired the bunker would first explode a smoke bomb containing the colloid and attractant we had devised to mask the area a few minutes later small explosives would release the tote männer and break the outside walls the tote männer would have to do the rest we hoped the smell of nearby prey would waken them to fury as we had observed in the lab the time passed slowly punctuated with small arms fire and a few large weapons the wind moved back and forth sometimes bringing us the firecracker smell of the battlefield and then replacing it with the pine smell of the forests the afternoon came an odd aircraft id never seen before called a storch was made available to us the pilot willem and i boarded the airplane along with the radio equipment the heavily laden craft took off in an impressively short distance and in a few moments we were high enough to see the bunkers and worse the advancing allies willem pressed the button smoke poured out of the three buildings i could not hear the reports as the internal explosives ignited but there was motionfurious motionthrough the smoke seconds later the advancing allies were running down the hill away from the smoke directly behind them were the tote männer the tote männer were much faster than the humans they pursued and more clever than ever i would have guessed one toter mann leapt from human to human biting and clawing not even pausing to enjoy the meal eight thousand tote männer poured over the allies guns didnt stop them they were in and among the soldiers so quickly none of the supporting artillery or machine guns could fire the smoke switched over them and we could no longer observe fly over them willem ordered so we can look down sir we will be shot fly over them i say willem shouted and brought out his pistol or i will shoot you myself we flew over the churning mass of tote männer and humans they took no notice of us all of their attention was focused on the horrifying apparitions among them good said willem grimly return it was a safe bet that each of the tote männer had likely managed to bite at least three soldiers assuming an overlap of twenty percent that meant better than thirteen thousand allied tote männer would be awakening in a week this was a conservative estimate assuming the infected soldiers would not infect others during the euphoric period we landed and general marcks himself joined us willem told him of the adventure and the antitote männer equipmentmostly flame throwers and protective jacketswaiting in trucks not ten kilometers distant the allied invasion would not succeed and it did not the allies so demoralized by the reichs new weapon were unable to advance german bombers were able to sink support craft in the channel the war stalled in western france all that summer when i returned to krakow in july to see my wife i still smelled of burning diesel and gunpowder she made me bathe before i could kiss her the daimlerbenz flying barges were deployed these i had not known about they were gliders filled with forty or fifty tote männer towed overnight by bombers and released near the front to land where they would the crashes released most of the tote männer but mechanical relays released the remainder willem informed us that there were now highly localized tote männer infections in britain where wounded men had been returned before they had turned completely and before the allies had realized what they were dealing with but the russians continued to advance they were no less ruthless than the tote männer and had devised a simple but effective defense any group of tote männer they found they slaughtered without regard to coincident casualties we estimated they were killing as much as percent of their own men with this technique but it was effective it was only a matter of time before they reached germany the allied advance had not been routed as wed hoped but only stalled as they tried to cope with their own problems had germany remained the fighting force it had been at the beginning of the war this would have been enough however now the allies had a foothold in france and would not give it up antiaircraft batteries were brought over the channel and the bombers could no longer eliminate the shipping soon the allies would figure out a method of containing the infection just as the russians had done a stalemate in this war would inevitably lead to an allied victory willem created the todeskommandos these were the last paratroopers still left in the luftwaffe they were infected without their knowing and dropped far behind enemy lines their mission was to spy on the enemy and return in two weeks time of course they transformed in less than half that time and infected the russians i refused to participate in this activity i would not be a party to infecting unwitting german soldiers willem did not press me at that point though i knew a day of reckoning was coming knowing this i persuaded willem to loan me one of the daimlerbenz engineerspreferably joseph bremer a friend of hans braun and the engineer who had later proposed the trebuchet i liked the way his mind worked willem sent him to me with the warning that something needed to be done about the russians bremer being a mechanical rather than a chemical engineer immediately saw solutions to the issues we had not solved we had to maintain the environment of the worm and virus for the duration of delivery and then spray it out into the surrounding area without shredding either weber and i had already determined that inhaling the inoculum would not infect the host unless some portion was swallowed the worm needed to actually enter the digestive tract to enter the blood stream the only result from a purely pulmonary inoculation would be a sterile partial infection it was bremer who devised an irritant to be added to the mixture the irritant would not be poisonous in any way but would cause a mucous flow from the nose the subjects would be forced to swallow it worked in birkenau experiments with great success by this time hitler had been sending vs against britain for a few weeks my purpose was to be able to replace the explosive in the v with a todesluft canister and infect the allies in their home territories once we had the todesluft device perfected we approached willem with it willem at once saw the possibilities but denied us the chance to try it out in a v instead he told us of a new rocket vastly more powerful and accurate it was to be called the v the bombers over berlin never stopped during that summer up until we released the tote männer auschwitz buchenwald and the other camps had been spared for some reason by july we had a version of the todesluft device ready for the v and after the first few reached their targets the allies realizing where our production facilities must be located started bombing the camps i had to drag weber from our burning laboratories he wanted to save his children i triggered the containmentfailure devices and incinerated the last remaining tote männer squads but saved inoculum samples and the todesluft devices to operate elsewhere it was curious the incubation pens and the holding areas were completely destroyed but the gas chambers survived the bombing i had thought to travel immediately to krakow to be with elsa but before i could elsa showed up at the camp weber elsa helmut and i were able to find safety in the basement of the headquarters building i managed to locate an intact phone and called willem to tell him where we were the bombing ceased in a day or so the inmates were taken care of and we had food and water power was restored the following day weber liked to be near us something profound had come undone in him he mourned the death of his squad over and over on the third day he accosted me out in the street as i cleaned up the front of the building could it have been the jews what are you talking about the failure of our tote männer i sighed the tote männer did not fail how can you say that germany is still losing the war i considered responding to this how could any single weapon ever win a war on its own it was our failure not any failure of the tote männer but that would only have encouraged him we havent lost yet he ignored that we made tote männer out of the jews perhaps there was a judengeist that impaired them what would you have done instead made them out of germans as willem did i should not have been so reluctant to use poles weber said and sat on the bench sunk in apathy i continued shoveling broken concrete and shards of wood out of the street willem showed up that night he was halfdrunk and i was surprised hed managed to drive all the way from berlin morose and untalkative he refused to speak until after dinner when elsa had taken helmut and herself to bed the americans are smarter than we are beg pardon i said ready to defend german intelligence it had to be the americans the british would not have considered it considered what willem stared at me of course how could you know they have been raining tote männer on berlin all over germany thats impossible did they drop them out of the bombers did they think we would be intimidated by smashed body parts willem shook his head nothing so complex all they did was harness them to a big parachute and then tie them together with a bow knot so they would not escape during transport then they shoved them out the back of a bomber on a strip line it undid the bow knot and released the parachute some of them were killed of course but so what between ours and the ones generated from their own ranks they have enough how were they released from the parachutes we found a windup spring clip when the spring wound down the clip opened and they were released diabolical simplicity i drank some wine there are tote männer in berlin i tried to frame it as a logical proposition i could imagine them lurching through the city there are tote männer all over germany there are tote männer in london from the v todesluft attack von braun even managed to extend the range of the v with a v attachment there are tote männer in moscow tell me weber how many tote männer must there be to become selfsustaining weber peered at him owlishly they cannot be selfsustaining eventually all of the raw material would be used up you are so comforting willem said dryly i stared at the wine bottle when will they reach here they were behind me when i crossed the border one day two days they move slowly but steadily and they will be brought here by our scent we had all underestimated them they were in the camp by morning they had broken through the barbed wire holding the inmates easily the inmates were bitten and mauled by the hundreds the guards died when they insisted on firing on the tote männer and the tote männer of course did not fall the scent of the inmates was so strong that it overpowered our own smells the tote männer did not know we were there we took care to remain hidden in the headquarters building with so many possible hosts around the tote männer ignored the buildings each time a few seemed to take interest there was another inmate to attack elsa refused to let helmut near the windows during a lull in the fighting she sat next to me as i watched through the window what are those things elsa said quietly her face was milk white but her voice was calm max uncle what are those things we call them tote männer i said is that what you were building in the camps is that your weapon yes she shook her head did they escape from another camp no willem laughed dryly the allies were kind enough to return these to us helmut must not see them yes i said more importantly they must not see us she nodded eventually the inmates were all infected we had discovered in experiments that infected hosts were ignored by tote männer but there were still so many of them our own scent remained undiscovered the tote männer wandered off in small groups heading east toward krakow the remaining freed inmates now euphorically infected hosts were not so ignorant as the tote männer they tried to enter the headquarters building willem and i defended the place as best we could hoess and mengele tried to gain entrance by sweet reasonableness and grumbled when we shot at them they wandered off arm in arm by the end of the third day after the attack we saw hosts finding small places to sleep that evening the camp was entirely still we have to leave willem insisted this was monday morning by wednesday night we would be fighting for our lives im ready elsa said those things will not hurt helmut i will kill him first i nodded it pleased me that elsa understood the situation where shall we go our tote männer are to the west and south their tote männer are to the north and east we have no petrolthe depot was blown up in the bombing what shall we do then demanded willem they are not very intelligentas i said a long time ago think of them as crocodiles they can use their eyes but largely they depend upon scent therefore we can block ourselves up in one of the gas chambers they are air tight we will smother said elsa no i shook my head we have three days i can devise air circulation it will be slow and diffuse up through the chimneys but i do not think it will be sufficient to cause the tote männer to attack the chamber we can hold out for help it took most of those three days to set ourselves up we had to change the locks on the doors so we could get ourselves out and convert the exhaust fans to give us a little air we stockpiled as much food and water as we could carry i even built a periscope through which i could observe the courtyard in front of the chamber and the areas around we were carrying one of the last loads into the chamber when a toter mann leapt on willem from the roof willem grabbed his pistol as he hurled the toter mann to one side weber cried out and wrestled with willem the toter mann attacked both of them finally willem threw down weber and emptied the clip of his pistol into the toter manns head he turned to club weber but weber climbed the wall and was gone willem turned his attention back to the toter mann which had ceased moving as its head had ceased to have any shape the worms wriggled out like thin spaghetti willem looked at me and held up his arm his fingers and wrist were bitten do i have any chance at all i shook my head well then he replaced the clip in the pistol perhaps i have time enough to kill weber for this dont wait too long i advised once you start to feel the euphoria you wont want to kill him at all i wont he nodded at me and i saluted him then i went inside the chamber and sealed the door which brings me to the present it has been ten weeks since we sealed the door of the chamber no one has come to help us sure enough the tote männer have not detected us though they often walk around the building sensing something our scent is diffuse enough not to trigger an attack but they do not wander off as the previous tote männer did they have remained worse instead of degrading in ten weeks as our experiments suggested they remain whole i am now forced to admit that the deterioration we observed in our experiments was more likely the result of captivity than any natural process i watch them sometimes a group of them will disappear into the surrounding forest and then return with a deer or the corpse of a man or child then they eat we never took an opportunity to observe their lifecycle it seems that once the initial infection period is over they can after their own fashion hunt and eat we ran out of water two days ago we ran out of food nearly a week before that helmut cries continuously the sounds do not appear to penetrate the walls of the chamberat least the tote männer do not respond i had planned to hold out longerperhaps attempt an escape or brave the tote männer and try to bring back supplies it is now september surely the impending winter would stop them then when they were dormant we could leave but in these last days i have witnessed disturbing changes in their behavior i saw one toter mann walking around the camp wrapped in a rug found in one of the camp buildings a small group of five or six gathered around a trash barrel in which smoldered a low fire at first i thought the disease might have managed to retrieve the host memories or that the hosts were recoveringboth indicated disaster for us we would be discovered but this is different the tote männer stand near the fires until they smolder and only then move away they drape blankets and clothes completely over their heads but leave their feet unshod whatever is motivating them it is not some surfacing human being but the dark wisdom of the disease itself they are still tote männer and will infect us if they can there is no hope of escape or holding out always the engineer i prepared for this i kept back a bottle of water in it i dissolved some demerol powder elsa and helmut were so thirsty they did not notice the odd taste they fell asleep in minutes i am a coward in some ways the idea of me my wife and my child living on only as a host for worms and microbes horrifies me death is preferable nor do i trust drugs the faint possibility they might come upon us in our sleep fills me with dread i have my pistol and enough bullets for elsa and helmut and myself if they find us we will be of no use to them i believe that you germany will triumph over these creatures though that victory will no doubt be a hard one the third reich will not live forever as we had hoped but will no doubt fall to the tote männer but good german strength must eventually prevail for my own part i regret my inability to foresee my own inadequacies and i regret that i must die here without being able to help i regret that elsa and helmut will never again see the sun and that they will die by my hand but you who read this take heart we did not yield we did not surrender here but only died when there was no other way to deny ourselves to the enemy you will defeat and destroy them and raise your hand over a grateful earth it is there waiting for you the skullfaced city by david barr kirtley david barr kirtley has been described as one of the newest and freshest voices in sf his work frequently appears in realms of fantasy and he has also sold fiction to the magazines weird tales and intergalactic medicine show the podcasts escape pod and pseudopod and the anthologies new voices in science fiction the dragon done it and fantasy the best of the year ive previously published him in the first the living dead anthology and in my online science fiction magazine lightspeed he also has a story forthcoming in my anthology the way of the wizard thats due out in november kirtley is also the cohost with me of the geeks guide to the galaxy podcast this story is a sequel to one that appeared in the first the living dead anthology in the skullfaced boy dustin and jack two recent college grads die in a car accident and rise as intelligent zombies dustincalled the skullfaced boy due to his injuriesorganizes hordes of mindless zombies into an army and declares war against the living while jack becomes his reluctant accomplice their rivalry over a girl named ashley eventually leads dustin to carve off her face as well when the skullfaced boy appeared on the pseudopod horror podcast it was very well received and several listeners requested more material set in the same universe so it was in the back of kirtleys mind for a while to possibly expand the story into something longer when i told him i was editing the living dead i encouraged him to submit a sequel story this is the first sequel ive written and its hard kirtley says for a long time i was stuck since by the end of the skullfaced boy the conflicts and agendas of the characters are all pretty much on the table my big break came when i considered creating a new main character park and so as not to repeat myself i made him completely different from my original protagonist jack jack is an ordinary young man sensitive kind of a doormat type whereas park is a very very dangerous soldier park watched from his car as a pickup screeched to a halt in front of the supermarket hed known they would come the armies of the living were on the march and the living needed food the pickups doors flew open and two figures leapt outa black man and a blond woman the man who was older maybe forty carried a shotgun he sprinted toward the store and the woman ran close behind him her hands wrapped tight around a large silver pistol the man threw open the entrance doors and vanished into the darkness while the woman waited outside keeping watch smart but it would not save them park slipped from his car his scoped rifle clutched to his chest he crept forward using abandoned cars as cover finally he lay down on the asphalt and leveled his rifle at the pickup a dead man in a green apron wandered around the side of the building he spotted the woman groaned exultantly and stumbled toward her his arms outstretched the woman took aim at his forehead park pulled the trigger at the same moment she did the report of her pistol drowned out the soft pinging that his round made as it drilled a neat hole through her pickups gas tank the dead mans skull smacked against the pavement and the woman lowered her gun she didnt notice the gas pooling beneath her truck park sneaked back to his car and got in he waited watching as the woman took down several more of the moaning dead who strayed too close later her companion emerged pushing a loaded shopping cart the woman hurriedly tossed its contents into the bed of her truck while the man dashed to the store again this was repeated several times the commotion attracted an evergrowing audience of moaners which the woman eyed nervously finally the man and woman leapt into their vehicle and peeled out the pickup careened across the parking lot and the dead men who staggered into its path were hurled aside or crushed beneath its tires park donned his black ski mask pulled his goggles down over his eyes and started his car he tailed the pickup along the highway keeping his distance when the truck rolled to a stop he pulled over too and got out the man and woman fled from their vehicle and into a nearby field which was crawling with the dead park followed them through the grass and into the woods he watched through his scope as the pair expended the last of their ammo and tossed away their guns and then they stood back to back and drew machetes against the clusters of moaners who continued to stumble from the trees all around park approached using his rifle to pick off the nearby dead men one shot to each head cleanly destroying each brainwhat was left of them he pointed his rifle at the living man and shouted drop it the man shouted back who are you what do you want park shifted his aim to the woman and said now i only need one of you alive wait the man said damn it he tossed his machete into the brush there okay and you park told the woman she hesitated then flung her weapon away as well park said turn around kneel hands on your heads they complied park strode forward and handcuffed them both up he said move the pair stood and marched the woman glanced back at park eyes front he ordered she gasped oh my god to the man she hissed frantically hes one of them the ones that can talk the man turned to stare too his face full of terror eyes front park shouted the man and woman looked away after a minute the woman said quietly are you going to eat us i dont intend to park said so why do you want us she asked its not me that wants you park answered who does then the man demanded for a long moment park said nothing then he removed his goggles exposing dark sockets and two huge eyeballs threaded with veins he yanked off his ski mask revealing a gaping nose cavity bonewhite forehead and cheeksa horrific skullvisage youll see he said as dusk fell park drove down a long straight road that passed between rows of corn in the fields dead men with skull faces wielded scythes against the stalks crops said the man in the back seat those are crops beside him the woman said what do the dead need with food to feed the living park answered for the first time her voice held a trace of hope so well be kept alive some are it would seem park said and mei he wondered he just didnt know in front of his car loomed the necropolis its walls clumsy constructions of stone twenty feet high crews of skullfaced men listlessly piled on more rocks the woman watched this her jaw slack she murmured what happened to your faces park glanced at her in the rearview mirror the car bounced over a pothole and the mirror trembled as he answered faces are vanity the dead are beyond such things he pulled to a stop before a gap in the stone wall the dirty yellow side of a school bus blocked his way he rolled down his window from the shadows emerged one of the dead a guard this one did have a facenose and cheeks and foreheadthough the flesh was green and mottled a rifle hung from his shoulder he shined a flashlight at park then at the captives for the commander park said the guard waved at someone in the bus the vehicle rumbled forward out of the way and park drove on through the woman said that one had a face that one is weak park snapped still enamored with the trappings of life and so here he is far from the commanders favor park drove down a narrow causeway bordered on both sides by chainlink fences every few minutes he passed a tall steel pole upon which was mounted a loudspeaker beyond the fences scores of moaners wandered aimlessly in the light of the setting sun the man and woman lapsed again into silence plainly they could see that this army of corpses presented a formidable obstacle to either escape or rescue park remembered the first time hed come here almost three months ago pursuing a trail of clues upon beholding the necropolis his first thought had been the city that never sleeps he passed through another gate and into a large courtyard end of the line he said as he opened the door and got out a group of uniformed dead men with rifles and skullfaces ambled toward him their sergeant said you again park isnt it whatve you got two park replied man and woman the sergeant nodded to his soldiers who yanked open the car doors and seized the prisoners as the pair was led away the sergeant said to park all right come on park was escorted across the yard from a loudspeaker mounted on a nearby pole came the recorded voice of the commander once you were lost said the voice but now youve found peace once you were afflicted by the ills of the flesh the hot sun made you sweat and the icy wind made you shiver you sickened and fell and were buried in muck you were slaves to the most vile lusts and you gorged yourselves on sugar and grease but now now you are strong and the only hunger you feel is the hunger for victory the hunger to destroy our enemies to bend them to the true path by the power of your righteous hands and teeth once you were vain preoccupied by the shape of your nose the shape of your cheeks you gazed into the mirror and felt shame shame is for the living let them keep their shame we are beyond them above them your face is a symbol of bondage to a fallen world a reminder of all that you once were and now rightfully despise take up your knife now and carve away your face embrace the future embrace death park was taken to a nearby building and led to a room piled high with ammo clips and small armsthe currency of the dead he filled a duffel as he made his way back to his car another skullfaced man came hurrying over and called out hey hey you park looked up the man gestured for him to follow and announced the commander wants to meet you this is what park had been waiting for he dumped the duffel in the trunk of his car then followed the man to an armored truck they drove together toward the palace the building had been a prison once but now hordes of dead laborers had transformed it into a crude and sinister fortress the truck arrived at the palace then stopped in a dim alley park got out and was led inside he surrendered his handcuffs to an armed guard walked through a metal detector then retrieved them he was shown to a large chamber against the far wall stood two thronelike wooden chairs in one of which sat a slender skullfaced young man who held an automatic rifle across his lap beside him sat a skullfaced girl with long auburn hair she wore an elegant white gown and park imagined that she must have been very beautiful once the man in the chair wore a military uniform as did the row of a dozen skullfaced men who stood flanking him park stepped into the center of the room welcome said the man in the chair i am the commander this is my wife he gestured to the girl beside him and my generals he waved at the assembled dead and you are park sir park said youre quickly becoming our favorite supplier park was silent the commander leaned forward and regarded him tell me park how did you die park hesitated a moment then said friendly fire when my base was overrun and hed been damn lucky in that those who died after being bitten by the dead always came back as moaners as the rest of his company had the commander said you were a soldier scout sniper sir the commander nodded good he added wryly i like the look of you park you remind me of myself thank you sir but tell me the commander went on why do you keep bringing us the living im grateful but you cant still need the reward you must have plenty of guns by now i want to do more park said help you convert the living end the war the commander settled back in his chair yes he said thoughtfully perhaps you can help us well discuss it after dinner dinner the word filled park with dread fortunately he had no face to give him away she reminded him of his grandmother a woman in her seventies naked gagged and tied to a steel platter when she was placed on the table and saw a dozen skullfaces with all their eyeballs staring down at her she began to bray into her gag and thrash against her bonds the commander who now wore his rifle strapped to his shoulder said to park guests first park leaned over the woman who whimpered and tried to squirm away he wanted to tell her im sorry i have no choice he bit into her arm tore the woman screamed park straightened and began to chew no flavor at all the dead couldnt taste though he did feel a diminishment of the perpetual hunger that the dead bore for the living the commander turned to the skullfaced girl and said now you my dear she began to feed soon the others joined in when it was over park looked up and noticed that the living man and woman hed just brought in were now present they stood in the corner naked and trembling held up by dead men who clutched them by the arms what now park wondered the old woman was moving again moaning the commander ordered her released he murmured we eat of this flesh and proclaim death to the woman he added rise now in glory go there wasnt much left of her really a crimson skeleton festooned with gobbets the thing that had once been a woman dragged itself off the table and lurched as best it could toward the exit now the commander said we have a bit of afterdinner entertainment some fresh material he waved at park thanks to our friend here park followed as the captives were dragged out the door down a long corridor and into another chamber this room was smaller with chairs lined up along one wall all of them facing a kingsized bed the man and woman were brought to the bed and dumped upon it where they sat dazed the seats filled with spectators the skullfaced girl sat beside the commander who assumed the centermost chair the commander pointed at the living man and said you take her now the generals watched silent but rapt the man stood made a fist fuck you freak behind him the woman sat pale and stricken the commander shrugged maybe youre not in the mood we have something for that he turned to the door and called the aphrodisiac please for almost a minute nothing happened then from the corridor came a terrible groaning the sound grew louder closer the woman on the bed wrinkled her nose and whispered no a dark form appeared in the doorway it was one of the ones who had been buried in the ground before coming back they always returned as moaners too and had always rotted terribly the man and woman scrambled away onto the floor around its neck the moaner wore a steel collar which was attached to a chain held by a skullfaced guard the moaner shrieked and slavered and swiped at the air with clawlike fingers it lunged at the living and its handler just barely able to keep it under control was halfdragged along behind it with each charge the creature came closer to the man and woman who cowered on the floor in the corner the man kicking feebly in the direction of the monster when the thing was just a few feet away the man shrieked all right all right get it off me the commander lifted a hand and the moaner was hauled back the man and woman trooped grimly to the bed the woman was young maybe twenty meis age park thought had mei gone through this no dont think about it the woman lay down on the bed and the man climbed awkwardly on top of her the commander stared he reached over took the hand of the skullfaced girl and held it for a long time the living man nuzzled the woman pawed her rubbed against her but he was too frightened and couldnt become aroused finally the commander called out enough the figures on the bed froze the commander stood this grows tedious another night perhaps the pair on the bed pulled away from each other and watched anxiously the commander said to them dont worry therell be other chances next time will be better to the generals he instructed take them away put them with the rest the rest park thought park said the commander walk with me park followed him through several doorways then up a few flights of stairs they emerged onto what must have once been simply a rooftop but which had been augmented through the exertions of the dead with a sort of parapet the commander said so how did you enjoy that i it was the commander said sharply dont dissemble i dont like that all of a sudden there was real anger in his voice and park was afraid but just as suddenly the mans eerie calm returned he went on you were uneasy park thought fast i just you always say lust of the flesh is for the masses the commander cut in black and white right and wrong but men like you and i must take a more nuanced view besides its for a greater purpose youll see im sorry i didnt mean and dont apologize the commander said now theres something you want to discuss yes park collected his thoughts then in what way does one become an officer in your army i am the way the commander said tell me why you want to join i hate the living park said always have even when i was one of them especially then but i never saw any alternative until now i understand the commander told him you seem a useful sort park and im always damned short of good men i think im going to be glad i met you the commander turned away and gazed out over the battlements to admire his city his domain there in the darkness with the mans back turned and no one else around park allowed himself one fleeting instant to glare at the commander with pure hatred no park thought you wont be glad not at all so park was designated a lieutenant and given a room in a far corner of the palace and often he was called on to perform routine tasks mostly drilling the other officers in marksmanship the commanders voice was a constant presence as the loudspeakers blared forth an endless mix of propaganda and instructions for the maintenance of the city sometimes pairs of living prisoners were brought out to perform for the commander and his wife but mei was never among them most information was still restricted from park and most areas of the palace were still offlimits a few times he heard men refer to the top floor of the east wing as the petting zoo was that where the living were kept the palace was severely undermanned but even so trying to slip in where he wasnt wanted would be chancy at best patience he told himself wait and watch this is who you are this is what you do and when you strike you strike hard and they never see it coming one day park returned to his room to find someone waiting in the hall it was greavey a heavyset man with a scattering of red hairs whose jowls hung slack below his skeletal face park nodded to him general park said greavey can i ask you a favor a private lesson of course park said he retrieved a pair of rifles from his car then took greavey to a muddy yard nearby where park lined up empty cans upon a wooden table the two of them positioned themselves at the far end of the field greavey took aim and fired his shot went wide he growled and said i was a soldier too in life like you never was a terrific shot though park fired and knocked over the first can its easier now your body is more still greavey raised his rifle again as he sighted he said casually you may have fooled him but you dont fool me he fired a can went flying park didnt answer he took another shot took down another can greaveys voice was gruff you dont buy all his bullshit his little cult and neither do i he fired again missed damn park had been expecting something like this he took aim again and what if i dont he fired another hit listen greavey told him youre new around here you dont know what hes like were losing this war losing bad because of him we dont have enough officers and every time one of us shows a little promise well he doesnt like rivals much so watch yourself its only a matter of time before he turns on you too so whats the alternative park said the moaners are loyal to him theyve been listening to his voice every day and night now for how long whats going to happen if hes gone you think theyll obey you you think you can control them man theyll listen to anyone greavey waved at a loudspeaker who gets on that pa park raised his rifle to his shoulder and sighted downrange its too much of a risk thats not what youll be saying when the living storm in here and blow our brains out park fired another can who then if not him greavey said you know he never did shit before all this he likes to play soldierall of them dobut hes just some college kid now hes smart ill give him that but not as smart as he thinks he is we need someone in charge who knows this army and whos got real military training you then park said greavey shrugged seems sensible ive got training park said another shot another can look greavey said you shoot real good but come on you just got here back me and i promise ill no greavey was silent a while he raised his rifle hesitated lowered it finally what do you want half park said half what half everything the guns trucks troops no way park raised his rifle again maybe i should see what he thinks about all this greavey stared as park took down another can then said fine if thats the way its got to be you and me full partners all right all right park glanced toward the palace except no one but hims allowed to bring weapons in there hes always armed obviously he never sleeps he comes out sometimes greavey said to supervise things personally or lead his army in the field and like i said you shoot real good at this park nodded slowly i see he said as he took down the final can later as park strode through the palace he thought a good try convincing much of it likely true greavey plotting assassination a lie but the commander too reliant on his legion of moaners eliminating clever officers who might become rivals probably yes also true the commander not as smart as he thinks he is park turned a corner toward the commanders private suite two skullfaced men stood guard i have to see the commander park said the men eyed him one of them said wait here and disappeared around a corner a short time later he returned and said all right come on they walked down the hall to an office where the commander sat behind a desk his rifle leaning against a nearby wall he held a combat knife which he fiddled with absently as he said talk park said sir greavey is plotting against you the commander leaned back in his chair give me details everything so park relayed the conversation leaving out nothing afterward the commander stood and began to pace this is good to know park said sir let me handle greavey ill greaveys fine sir the commander pointed his knife at park and said listen to me carefully nothing happens in this city without my knowledge without my order do you understand park feigned bafflement you mean it was a test an exercise the commander said i apologize but its necessary ive been betrayed before i have to make sure a few weeks later just after dawn park heard a rumble from outside as of distant thunder he hurried to the window of his chamber and looked out a giant plume of black smoke was rising from the southern end of the city a short time later the commanders recorded speech cut out abruptly then the commander came on and announced the city is under attack the south wall has been breached muster at the south wall i repeat the south wall the message continued in this vein until the moaners got the idea and began to march to the citys defense park lay low hoping to be missed in the confusion he waited until he saw a column of trucks go speeding away to the south eight trucksenough to carry most of the officers who lurked about the palace park knew he might never get a better chance to scout out the petting zoo he raced through the halls but saw no one the east wing seemed deserted if anyone caught him no they would not catch him hed make sure of that one time he heard footfalls approaching he slipped into a shadowed alcove and a guard passed by heedless another time as park climbed a staircase he imagined he heard wailing but when he stopped to listen there was nothing he reached the top floor and moved quickly down a long hallway lined with windows to his right was a door open just a crack he crept up to it and peeked inside on a nearby couch sat a woman with auburn hair who was bent over something in her lap she was murmuring hey hey its okay mommys here park shifted slightly and scanned the room the walls were painted yellow he saw cribs toys children living children six of them none more than a year old the petting zoo it was a goddamn nursery but why no he told himself ponder later get out now meis not here the woman on the couch raised her head and park caught just a glimpse of her skeletal profile as he eased away from the door he heard voices then back the way hed come he hurried in the other direction he slipped through a door and onto a balcony at its far end was another door the wall to his left was crenellated and as he hurried along he could see down into the yard below where a few dead men wandered moaning the south wall apparently they were attempting to join the battle but were too witless to find their way there a voice at his side said oh hey park leapt back almost stumbling a decapitated human head was impaled on an iron spike between two battlements the head was that of a young man blond who even in this grisly state retained a look of gentle innocence sorry said the head didnt mean to startle you its all right park said turning away wait the head called who are you ive never seen you before im jack damn it park said look i really have to the head narrowed its eyes youre not supposed to be here are you shit park eyed the head it could report him to the others should he destroy it dont the head warned anticipating him hell know somethings up listen you can trust me im not on his side i mean hes the one who put me here park was at a loss i can help you the head added i know things what are you doing here park hesitated did he dare trust it but what choice did he have he said im looking for my sister she was captured i dont how old is she said the head twenty good the head gave him an encouraging look then she was probably kept alive to breed the prisoners are in the south wing down in the basement but youll need keys to the cells dustins got a set and greaveys got the other dustin said park the commander the head explained it added i knew him before all this we were friends park whispered why did he do this to you the head gave a sad wry smile i tried to free the prisoners it said park slipped from the east wing without being noticed hours later one of the trucks returned park lurked in the corridor and watched as the commander and greavey strode back into the palace the two men conferred then the commander headed off in the direction of his suite park tailed greavey down a hallway after a minute greavey turned oh its you park sidled up whats the situation greavey was grim the living are inside the walls theyll be here by nightfall tough bastards militia types called the sons of perdition park knew of them they had a ghastly reputation greavey said the commanders gone to issue new orders where the hell have you been park nodded at some metal piping that ran up the wall from floor to ceiling and said over there greavey turned to look park grabbed the man and ran him into the pipes greaveys skullface rebounded with a crack and he went down park straddled him seized the mans left wrist and cuffed it then slipped the cuffs around the pipes and bound greaveys right wrist too park dug through the mans pockets a keyring park hoped the head on the walljackhad been telling the truth as park made his way to the south wing the commanders voice came over the loudspeakers fall back to the palace defend the palace at all costs i repeat defend the palace park spent maddening minutes navigating the unfamiliar corridors finally he clambered down a set of metal steps and emerged into a dim grimy hallway lined with cells he donned his mask and goggles then moved from door to door mei he called out mei are you here vague figures huddled in the darkness then from a cell hed just passed a weak voice hello she was there her tiny fingers wrapped around the bars he ran to her im getting you out he said as he tried a key in the lock it didnt fit park she said unbelieving i thought she stiffened then as she watched him in a nearwhisper she said take off your mask he tried another key park she said insistent he stopped for a moment he just stood there then he carefully removed his mask and goggles revealing his terrible skullface for all to see mei recoiled but youre one of them one of his it was the only way park said he tried another key beside her in the cell a skinny white man with curly black hair said i know you youre the one who captured me who brought me here mei said is that true yes park said he couldnt meet her gaze he tried another key which turned with a click and he slid the door open the skinny man tried to rush out but park stiffarmed him back and said only her no mei said we cant mei come here he told her she shook her head withdrawing park looked down and saw that she was pregnant she asked whats happened to you youre im what i have to be he shouted to save you now come on for a moment he thought he had her she took a tentative step forward then he heard clanging footsteps on the stairs behind him and knew it was over the commander strode into the hall his rifle raised behind him came the skullfaced girl and greavey the handcuffs dangled from greaveys right wrist and half his left hand was gonehed chewed it off to get free the commander stared at park with baleful eyes there was a long silence then the commander barked get away from there park took a few steps back keep going move the commander advanced when he was even with the cell he glanced at its occupants you brought us so many he said slowly to himself why a change of heart park glared back said nothing no the commander declared then with sudden triumph youre not the compassionate sort you only care about one he swung his rifle around so that it menaced the skinny man in the cell and demanded whos he here for the man shrank back holding up his hands defensively her the girl please park inched forward but instantly the gun was back on him the commander said to greavey get her greavey strode into the cell and with his good hand snatched mei by her long dark hair and dragged her stumbling into the corridor he stood her there in the middle of the hall then stepped aside she trembled behind the commander the skullfaced girl said softly dustin shes pregnant not for long he leveled his rifle at meis belly park stared at mei his sister as she stood there right in front of him after so long and he knew there was nothing he could do to save her then the skullfaced girl shoved the commander as hard as she could his rifle discharged spraying rounds into the cement as he sprawled the gun flew from his grasp and skittered across the floor coming to rest at meis feet she spun and kicked it to park but not hard enough the rifle slid to a stop near greavey who fell to his knees grasping for it park leapt forward and tackled him and they went down together grappling park wrapped both arms around greaveys meaty right bicep pinning it the mans mutilated left hand brushed over the rifles stock but couldnt get a grip on it the commander scrambled to his feet park pushed against the floor with his heels pivoting him and greavey park kept hold of greaveys bicep with one arm while with the other he reached out and snatched the rifle he shoved the muzzle up under greaveys chin and held down the trigger chunks of the mans fleshy jowls spattered across the floor and his body went limp park rolled off him and came up in a crouch with the rifle aimed at the commander who slid to a halt just a few feet away back park said and the commander slowly retreated holding up his hands park said mei come here she staggered toward him park we cant he held out the keys to her and said get these goddamn cells open now the skullfaced girl approached him the prisoners watched her with a mix of unease and wonder she said quietly and the children please park considered this all right he told her and the children an hour later park returned to the cell block with a duffel slung over his shoulder the prisoners were free now around twenty of them and were armed with weapons from the trunk of his car the skullfaced girl had fetched the children each of whom was being carried by an adult the guards had fled and park had taken care of the commander park said to the crowd you know the citys under attack by an army of the living theyre called the sons of perdition you all know who they are the crowd was somber anyone want to join them park said nows your chance no one moved all right he said then lets get the hell out of here they formed a convoy of vehicles and set out north away from the fighting park drove his car and the others followed on the seat beside him rested the duffel and in the back seat sat mei and the skullfaced girl each of them holding a child at first park was forced to barrel through clusters of moaners but once he got away from the palace the streets were mostly deserted the skullfaced girl stared out the window one time she spoke faintly i said i wanted children i was just i didnt think he wanted towhen they got oldermake them like us he its okay park said its over the girl fell silent whats your name mei asked her ashley she said the convoy passed through the north gate without encountering any of the invaders park was faintly hopeful about slipping away unnoticed but as he followed a twolane road toward a cluster of wooded hills a small fleet of pickups came racing out of the west throwing up great clouds of dust shit park said he hoped he could at least make it to the treeline before being overtaken he did barely get out he told mei and ashley then move to another vehicle he passed the duffel to ashley and said take this its jack look after him i will she promised mei lingered how will we meet up after go mei he said she insisted i dont want i said go he screamed she gave him one last worried look then fled park backed up his car so that it blocked the road then he got out fetched his scoped rifle put on his mask and goggles and crouched in the shadow of his car behind him the rest of the convoy sped away the pursuers drew near seven trucks park lay his rifle across the hood of his car then put a round through the windshield of the lead vehicle the truck slid to a halt and the others pulled up alongside it men with rifles poured out taking cover behind the doors of their vehicles thirty guns maybe more the driver of the lead vehicle a giant man with a blond beard who was dressed all in black leather shouted you shot my truck park didnt respond the man yelled you have any idea who youre fucking with again park said nothing listen the man called this is real simple we saw you all coming out we know youve got women we need them your guns and your vehicles and youre all drafted they didnt seem to realize that park was one of the dead good he shouted back we dont want anything to do with your army drafted means you got no choice said the man park crept into the underbrush and took up a position behind a tree hey the man called whats your plan huh just how do you think this is going to end for you park thought like this he fired the mans body toppled against the truck then slumped to the pavement park crawled away as the other men started shooting their bullets shredding the foliage all around him by dusk park was down to his last bullet it didnt matter hed won thirty men had come charging up the hill after him and hed kept ahead of them taking them out one by one hed dropped nine already and there were moaners in these woods too whod surprised and overwhelmed maybe two or three more mei and ashley and the others were well away park had been hit twice in the chest and many more times in the arms and legs but those scarcely troubled him by now his pursuers must know that he was one of the dead and they would be going only for headshots one of the men emerged from behind a boulder and crept closer scanning the bushes make the last shot count park thought as he eased his rifle into place and peered through the scope he was shocked my face he thought my old face no he decided then studying the man but close we could be brothers parks finger twitched tapping the trigger he could easily put a bullet through that face but he hesitated it had been such a long time since hed looked in a mirror since hed recognized himself any moment now hed be spotted take the shot his mind urged do it but what difference did it make mei was safe park continued to stare he didnt want to see that face destroyed no not that face he imagined the eyes of all the people hed delivered into the horrors of the necropolis he imagined the old woman screaming as his teeth tore into her he heard meis voice crying whats happened to you and his own replying im what i have to be to save you slowly he reached up and grasped a handful of fabric there the man had seen him was taking aim for an instant the two of them stared at each other through their scopes park removed his mask dustin watched from the wall of his palace as an army of the living battled through the city toward him but he was powerless to do anything in the yard below one of his followers came into view hey dustin shouted you up here the man stopped and looked at him listen to me very carefully dustin said this is your commander speaking you are to walk around this palace to the main entrance once inside turn right and keep going until you reach the stairs take them to the top floor and continue on the way you were youll come to a door leading out onto this balcony then remove me from this fucking spike do you understand the man stared back with vacant eyes walk around the palace it moaned yes dustin said and the rest of it turn right walk around the palace the creature took a step toward him then away walk around the palace it repeated as it wandered back and forth obedience by brenna yovanoff brenna yovanoffs first novel a contemporary young adult fantasy called the replacement should be out from razorbill around the same time as this anthology her short fiction has appeared in chiaroscuro and strange horizons on her livejournal brennayovanofflivejournalcom she claims to be good at soccer violent video games and making very flaky pie pastry but bad at dancing making decisions and inspiring confidence as an authority figure one of the most wrenching aspects of a zombie plague that makes it completely different from say an invasion of alien arachnids is the knowledge that these hordes of enemies were once our friends and neighbors were once decent loving people as we perforate their faces with a caliber machinegun or hack at their clutching hands with a machete axe or chainsaw its impossible not to wonder whether these moaning ghouls retain any trace of their former personality are the people they once were still trapped in there somewhere aware of whats happening around them might they ever be cured the way a mentally ill patient can be with the right treatment books and films are filled with incidents in which survivors try to show mercy to zombiesas with the barn full of zombies in robert kirkmans the walking deador will even fight to protect them as with the zombified newborn in the remake of dawn of the dead michael crichtons novel jurassic park suggests that its impossible to safely keep dinosaurs in captivity and much the same thing seems to be true of zombies the temptation is always there thoughwhat if it were just one zombie just one little girl surely we could handle that but if zombie stories have taught us anything its that keeping zombies around whether out of mercy or as research subjects seems to have a way of ending up badly for everyone involvedand by badly we mean with teeth blood and screams when the first drinking glass hit the floor and broke private grace pressed her back against the wall and steadied the sidearm with both hands the window above her was singlepaned the weatherstripping rotten to her left a freestanding radiator was rusting gently the house was a summer cabin cramped and redolent with the smell of mice theyd spent the better part of an hour nailing the windows shut then gathering glasswarepitchers vases dinner plates a souvenir ashtray with a cartoon walrus painted in the bottomand arranging the dishes in rows along the sills now they hunkered down waiting there had been food at least canned coated in dust they ate quickly passing the open cans back and forth as evening fell the sound the glass made when it landed was explosive a mortar going off what do we show these giddy bastards whitaker called from the adjoining room sounding clipped and perfunctory the answer came from a dozen positions followed by the metallic sound of carbines magazines and bolt assemblies clattering into place no mercy sir they had begun as an infantry platoon of fortyseven mostly up from new mexico and texas now they were thirteen ten privates one combat medic and denton the marine all serving under whitaker of the privates only grace and a trooper named knotts were from whitakers original squad the other eight and jacobs the medic had come off a company that had gotten pinned down at the air force base and for the most part died there the base had been a shortterm el dorado but when they arrived their grand welcome was absent save for a few survivors holed up in the bunkers some of the medical technicians had made a lastditch effort to seal themselves in the sleep chambers it was difficult to say whether the massacre had happened with the techs scrambling for safety or already in stasis but one thing was certain the flyboys had been dead for weeks where denton originated from remained somewhat of a mystery it was theorized that he was a deserter but in truth grace did not much care denton had the best guns smirkers someone shouted in the front hall immediately followed by a crash as the door splintered fire came in threeround bursts rattling through the tiny house grace crouched lower sinking into her nanovest bracing her shoulder against the radiator she checked the cuffs of her jacket tucked them deep into the tops of her gloves outside pale hands seemed to float palms flat against the windows they were laughing a storm of highpitched giggles they smiled no training in the world prepared you for that they smiled as they slashed and bit tearing flesh off their victims in chunks they smiled as they ran a merciless fullout sprint headlong ravenous they smiled right before you leveled the barrel and squeezed the trigger sometimes if the shot was high enough the caliber small enough even when they fell backsmoke rising from a neat round hole in the foreheadthey were still smiling jacobs said it was neurological an involuntary tic he talked about them a lot his language precise his hands sketching neural pathways it had been his idea to come up here strike for the research complex near rosewood they were close now a couple miles off but the slopes were crawling with smirkers and everything had started to seem wildly impossible a window broke somewhere and the house was suddenly awash with a new influx they poured into the little common room one was wearing a christmas sweater red sprinkled intermittently with green trees white reindeer against the other wall denton was cutting swaths through the mobsystematic businesslike his arms were massive the muscles displayed in sharp relief as he swung the carbine up the smirker in the christmas sweater was closing it moved fast turning on him with hands outstretched semper fi denton said but it sounded flat and ironic he jammed the muzzle in the smirkers face in the front hall private sutter was shouting something he was always shouting hooting whooping sutter with the godawful tattoo on his neck upwards arrow pointing to the base of his skull corsican script said in an incongruously graceful hand eat me smirkers did not in actuality express much preference for the brain over other organs they seemed content to take any piece they could get but the celluloid lore of old movies was hard to shake in the last few weeks some of the privates had taken to painting targets on their helmets aim here in case of infection whitaker didnt like it but allowed the targets in the same indulgent way he allowed sutters tattoo harmless letting off steam grace thought it was morbid the window above her fell in with a glittering crash and she rose and popped the first smirker in the face it slumped forward and she turned to meet the two that came after dropping them on the carpet after that the process became automatic her territory extended outward for two yards and ran the distance of the wall every other inch of the house was someone elses problem something moved behind her and she swung around already reaching for her combat knife it had been a boy sixteen maybe seventeen the face still bore the faint interruptions of acne he grinned and his teeth were coated in a thin veneer of blood the carbines were light easy to maneuver and the sidearm was more versatile still but for such close quarters grace favored the knife she slipped it from the sheath and brought the blade up the throat first and directly after that the right eye preferred it controlled preferred it close some of the others couldnt stand to let the smirkers get near instead they ran themselves out not keeping count a dull shocked look when the handgun clicked empty they thought about themselves before they thought about the job that was the secret if you thought about the job before you thought about anything else if you just did your job you got out she drew her hand back let the boy drop and stepped over him she wiped the blade on her fatigues and then peeled the gloves off they were soaked the shooting had stopped grace stood contemplating the room her heart beat hard and fast in her ears and she could not precisely reckon how much time had passed smirkers lay everywhere sprawled out tangled together on the floor after a cursory check to make sure that none were still moving she started for the doorway in the front hall she found emery standing with his back to her his rifle hung at his side and he was breathing in long whining gasps he was one of the ones with a target a concentric bullseye painted in red on the front of his helmet but when he turned toward her with a mystified expression the bite on his shoulder already weeping yellow she aimed for the eye socket he whimpered and begged a little but in her head she had squeezed the trigger a thousand times and it was no great effort to do it now in the cramped cabin with the daylight dropping away and the smell of bodies heavy in the air the report was very loud in the narrow hall at her feet he lay still after a moment the blood began to pool out from under him her progress through the house was slow the floor was littered with debris spent ammunition bodies lay with their limbs jutting at odd anglessmirkers and soldiers they were mostly accounted for she didnt recognize denton at first except by his size someone had shot him in the face there were bite marks all over his arms his skin oozed with the thick pestilential yellow of infection in the kitchen she found sergeant whitaker he was propped in a corner shoulders wedged in the join between two cabinets he looked up at hera hard dignified look that stopped her in the doorway the side of his neck had been torn away leaving shreds of muscle exposed tendons his voice was hoarse and liquid are they dead she did not know if he was referring to their makeshift squad or to the recent barrage of smirkers yes sir what do you think those washington fucks are doing right now dead of course all dead except the ones still shambling around smiling to themselves giggling their highpitched giggles they dont pay me to think sir whitaker laughed at that a wet clotted sound no ones paid us to do a damn thing in months maybe you could take up thinking as a sideline it wouldnt have to be on the clock he laughed again viscous close to choking the stripes on his sleeve were the brightest thing in the room the gold looked almost white in the failing light the blood was seeping out of him leaving his face gray infection imminent you shouldve made corporal he said and it sounded watery im sorry for that dont worry yourself sir i dont imagine i would have cared for it you never know look at you nowyoure the one whos going to walk out of here tonight blood and foul yellow seepage were running down the side of his throat soaking into his shirt do you want me to take care of it she said jerking her head in the direction of his sidearm he smiled at her a slow complicated smile no i got this she did not disbelieve whitaker even at the last he was a good man dependable already holding the mm to his temple but she stood in the doorway to make sure the report made her flinch when he slumped forward and his hand let go she turned and started back through the house a wooden pulldown ladder stood spindly and erect in the hall it was fixed to the ceiling by a hinge and led up to an open skylight the angle of the ladder was stark surprising in the past weeks the world had taken on an increasingly surreal cast and the ladder did not seem disconcerting now but only natural and right im coming up grace said to no one in particularto whomever might be at the top waiting to put a bullet in the first person to stick their head through the opening on the roof jacobs the medic was sitting with his legs drawn up and his elbows resting on his knees how do they always know he said staring off over the hillside the dark trees the sky was deep purple already speckled with stars we go along covering our tracks moving in the daytime and still they always know grace nodded because his assessment was true not a thing you argued with but how it was they would always find you it was what they did there arent any bugs up here jacobs said no said grace taking a pack of cigarettes from her pocket no i havent seen any its the air its thin she wondered if he was cracking up he didnt seem the type but still with these smart ones it was hard to say sometimes they fell apart just from thinking too much theyre not hunting people he said what do you call it thenwhat theyre doing i mean theyre not hunting people exclusively theyre not strictly cannibals we saw eviscerated deer when we were coming upand rabbitsbut theyre not picked clean they never eat the dead grace pulled a cigarette out of the pack with her teeth lit it her hands were steady but felt light and disconnected when she breathed out jacobs coughed and fanned at the air how does something like this just happen grace observed jacobs his raised head his profile hard against the velvety sky she assumed he must be talking in some broad abstract sense because the howandwhy of it was far from mysterious the methodology was simple escalating reports of a bloodborne pathogen carried by insects high fatality rate drugresistant the government had been frightened of pandemic they had pushed immunization pushed it hard and in the end they got their pandemic all right a vector that began at vaccination and exploded outward extravagant uncontainable it had begun on the west coast vaccination facilities popping up in grocery stores and shopping centers and everyone lined up it had taken approximately six hours to ascertain that something was wrong but in that time the event had affected nearly half a million people and it spread like fire in a way it was good the infection came on fast otherwise they might have all had the shot every last one of them offering their arms to the needle without the slightest indication that anything was amiss what if its a signature jacobs said turning to her i dont follow a carbon dioxide signature bloodseekersthey know to come after you they follow a trail of chemicals a stamp mosquitoes can sense living blood from almost forty meters grace nodded as he spoke not comprehending his train of thought exactly but not needing to the words sounded round fat reassuring we could verify it he said all wed need is a controlled environment some preliminary tests we could keep going get to rosewood theyll have everything we need it would only take a few trials i mean then wed know and rosewoods only four miles out if we run if theres any still in the woods theyll be on us in two seconds sir i dont see much chance jacobs stood up brushing impatiently at his fatigues theres a way though theres always a way he started down the ladder his boots clattering on the wooden rungs there was a smear of blood on the back of his shirt grace squashed the cigarette under her toe and wondered again if they were only prolonging something inevitable it didnt matter with a purpose a mission the blackness of recent days did not seem so close they would go to rosewood and test his theory jacobs was not whitaker but he was capable he knew things and a shortterm itinerary was better than none at all they would go to rosewood and find a brilliant solution after a minute grace rose and followed jacobs down in the bathroom she found him standing over the body of knotts legs splayed to avoid the mess he had opened the medicine cabinet and was rummaging along the shelves what are you after deet he said flinging bottles and tubes from cabinet haphazardly why dont these rednecks have any fucking deet you said it before sir theres no bugs up here the floor at his feet was littered with adhesive bandages aspirin a topical antibiotic knotts was up from florida she said jacobs gave her a distracted look then turned back to the cabinet they got bugs in florida like you wouldnt believe i bet he carries it in with his personal effects a thing like that it just gets to be a habit check him then check his things if you think hes got it another bottle hit the floor the cap flew off and a cascade of white pills rattled across the linoleum washed up against the motionless form of knotts got stuck in the congealing blood and you think we could keep them off us with mosquito repellent sir it doesnt repel it interferes it corrupts receptors the logic was mysterious grace was not much in the way of parsing scientific theories but he seemed to be missing a vital link some key component a person is not a mosquito she thought of saying but in the end she knelt over knottss body and began to pick through his satchel the bottle of bug spray was very small give it to me jacobs said peeling his shirt over his head is this enough itll have to be wont it it doesnt last more than an hour hour and a half anyway we just need to get beyond them he was already smearing the stuff down his arms take off your vest im sorry sir take it off and your shirt we need it thick all over put it in your hair what if it doesnt work does it matter then were dead anyway everyones dead eventually and that was logic she couldnt argue with they reached the rosewood complex shortly after midnight the moon was pale and heavy in the sky fat as a dogtick their progress went undetected although grace had no position as to whether it was due at all to the deet they crossed the perimeter of the complex the west entrance already stood open a dark gaping maw jacobs lit his xenon lamp holding it to the doorway somewhere beyond the halo of light a shape was moving grace loosened her gun in its holster somethings there good jacobs said we just need one i want one alone in the lab for fifteen minutes grace nodded and didnt answer there was never just one from far away a shrill giggle rose it echoed back and forth in the corridor trickling down the walls another came from somewhere in the northern sector at the reception station they paused to examine the attendant signs of disuse the control panel was coated in dust jacobs indicated a bank of monitors see if you can bring the lights up while i find the medical bay i need to get some supplies together grace nodded again her skin was prickling with adrenaline but this was not the time to go jumpy there would be warning there always was when she accessed the backup system the lights came up sluggishly on the generator hazy and dim like being underwater she stood in the reception area and waited the time that passed was deep and faceless and full of sound when an unwieldy figure came toward her down the hall she raised her pistol but it was only jacobs he wore a biohazard suit fitted with a portable respirator and a curved plexiglas facemask with one gloved hand he gestured her to follow he led her through a maze of corridors to the medical wing and ushered her into a glassfronted observation room grace maneuvered between counter tops and stasis chambers to peer through the long window into an adjacent exam room the girl was in bad shape skin discolored covered in welts and scratches she was smiling the smile gleeful manic grace watched her make a circuit of the room eight or nine years old must have belonged to one of the technicians maybe a project manager the girl had been someones daughter jacobs turned from a cooler at the far end of the room cupped in his hands was a white rat is it dead grace asked jacobs shook his head he had to spit out the mouthpiece before speaking theyve got hundreds in there in stasis id say weve got five maybe ten minutes before it revives i need to see what she does grace touched the rats side its fur felt cold and matted jacobs secured the facemask again then motioned her away from the exam room door and entered carrying the rat the girl reacted with no particular venom to jacobs presence when he offered his gloved hand she took it without looking up he lifted her and set her on the edge of a gurney he left the rat resting beside her back in the observation room he took off the headpiece and set it on the counter now watch he said leaning towards the glass the girl sat where hed left her swinging her feet smiling the deranged smile beside her the rat lay peaceful and motionless right now its bodys still retaining carbon dioxide but as it comes up the emissions will be transiently high its going to be a little co bomb in a minute the rat twitched violently when the girl moved it was with unexpected ferocity snatching up the rat and sinking her teeth into its side blood ran copiously soaking into the front of her dress as grace watched through the glass the girls eyes turned up to meet her gaze she was holding the animal to her mouth with both hands and then she let it fall blood was dripping from her chin and the rat lay motionless and red on the cement floor jacobs had pillaged a batterypowered tablet from somewhere and was making rapid marks with the stylus murmuring to himself there was a low industrial whirring as the fans came on grace flinched as the ventilation system roared to life jacobs only stood with his head bent tapping at the little screen on the other side of the glass the girl began to pace frantically scraping at the walls with her fingers whats she doing jacobs glanced up above them ducts ran along the ceiling their shining planes punctuated by vents shes just got a whiff of us he said the airs circulating again in the other room the girl was scrabbling at the floor vents and then at the edges of a broad grate in the wall it occurred to grace that if the deet worked like jacobs said it did then the girl wasnt responding to it that she must be smelling something else or maybe the deet didnt work after all but was only a placebo she did not know whether jacobs had intended the fallacy to comfort her or himself are they really mindless she said with her palms against the glass jacobs looked at her strangely you mean did they experience brain injury if we could mitigate the reaction to incidental levels of co wed be certain but no i dont think theyre stupid the lights failed then and the room lapsed into blackness except for the flicker of the tablet without ceremony jacobs lit the xenon lamp and continued his notations grace reached for her sidearm out in the corridor footsteps echoed multiple peopleeight nine maybeand coming closer but they were unattended by the manic sounds of laughter grace moved so that her back was to the wall jacobs still scribbled on his tablet letters slanting down in a frantic scrawl before the cpu converted them to type he was talking to himself under his breath alive suddenly animated his intensity had become frantic bordering on possession and it frightened her the door swung open and the strangers came in slowly with wary looks and raised guns who are you said a tall craggy man at the head of the group he stepped into the light what are you doing here he wore no uniform someone had sewn stripes onto the sleeves of his jacket but the stitches were sloppy inexpert a scar ran across the bridge of his nose and then jagged abruptly down one cheek behind him a contingent of men held firearms mostly hunting rifles and shotguns grace moved forward standing at attention private maureen grace and sergeant rabe jacobs w the man nodded trask he said he gave no rank and did not need to his manner conveyed the brutal authority of a general although the unit behind him was motley probably local militia he was looking past her to the bare desk and the glassedin examination room and what are you doing here private maureen grace she glanced at jacobs who sat limply watching the newcomers with the air of someone drugged were investigating a possible course of action the sergeants developing a theory and has acquired a research subject this research subject here trask said raising his pistol to the glass this raggedy little bitch right here at the desk jacobs set the tablet down what are you doing shes not a threat you moron shes just a little girl the look trask gave him was long calculating and shed have your throat out in two seconds i had her calm i had her sedate even when i was in the room we have all the preliminary evidence necessary to pursue this are you listening we could alleviate their aggression we could fix them and lead them around like pets keep them until theyve had enough one night and kill us in our beds jacobs scrambled up from the desk it is our duty to cure them there is no cure trask said coming down hard on each word no cure but to rout them and pick them off one at a time until its over theres no way to play nice and then go home around him the other men nodded their gestures tied to his orbit like moons or planets grace watched them trask embodied all the qualities vital in a leader his voice was low and commanding his face was honest it promised suffering to anyone who got in his way above them the ductwork clattered in the eerie glow of jacobss lantern the men started raising their weapons to the ceiling grace crossed to the observation window and pressed her face to the glass shes gone sir when the ventilation duct dropped down into the observation room the sound was very loud the whole apparatus seemed to peel away from the ceilinga long shining arc that hung for an instant at its apex then crashed to the floor with a deafening clang grace watched as a dim figure scrambled out on hands and knees slashing and clawing at everything in reach lank dirty hair tattered dress dark splatters down the front then nothing but the smile the handgun was light not powerful but efficient up out of the holster and in her hand she put the girl down from eight yards beside the desk jacobs lay under the remains of the duct the aluminum had torn jaggedly like a mouthful of teeth her ears still rung with the sound of metal striking cement and on another plane laid over the metallic clatter the shot echoed again and again she did not recall crossing the room but there she was beside him his cheek had been raked open and he gasped for breath looking up at her a dull shocked look like he was offended by the treachery of the world the wound in his side was long not a puncture but a ragged gash first through the material of the biohazard suit and then through his skin and after that the subcutaneous fat the blood was bright arterial red grace knelt over him and pressed her hands to the wound somewhere in the ducts a sharp highpitched giggle broke loose echoing down on them like spilled nails welcome to the zoo trask said behind her you know im right jacobs whispered dont you know im right but grace knew nothing about chemistry or pathology the mysteries of science were jacobss domain and the brilliance of his vision eluded her he was coughing now bloody saliva collecting at the corners of his mouth on the other side of an examination table the dead girl grinned and grinned trask moved closer he was wearing workboots and the soles squeaked on the linoleum look at his face hes infected anyway you know it i know it just end itfor him and for us we need to be strong if were going to restore the nation all through the compound came the sounds of scrabbling shuffling laughing grace had a strange unbidden thought there is no nation only people under her palms jacobs coughed again the skin around his eyes had taken on a bluish hue trask had nothing on his side but grim conviction and force of will a man who was simply not afraid could persuade the masses to follow him anywhere he might not be a war hero but he could marshal the survivors above them the metallic clamor was much louder grace lifted her hands she raised the gun held the muzzle to jacobss cheek his eyes were pained and cloudy she felt for the trigger and did not think because it was easier not to steve and fred by max brooks max brooks is one of the kings of contemporary zombie fiction he is the

graphic novel the zombie survival guide recorded attacks and hes had short stories in the anthologies the new dead and dark delicacies ii prior to becoming the worlds foremost expert on zombies he worked for two years as a writer for saturday night live there comes a point in life when you must look in the mirror and ask yourself certain basic questions who am i what am i doing with my life and most importantly how will i fare when the zombies come as you survey the vast landscape of zombie fiction you must appraise each character and ask would that be me maybe youll be the coward who locks himself in the basement and refuses to help fortify the house and refuses to let any strangers into your domain all the while ignoring obvious signs that your child will soon be among the undead no then maybe youll be the strong leader of your enclave of survivors who goes mad with power and turns into a sadistic monster more horrifying than any zombie dont think so of course you know exactly who youll be the hero the one who perseveres when all others have succumbed youll have the weapons the car the steely determination the girl youll ride into town like a white knight and sort the local zombie problem right out and ride off into the sunset as the weak gather in the dusk and wave and wonder about your name thats the way youve always imagined it right well then our next story should be right up your alley think you know exactly who youll be when the zombies come well so do we youll be exactly like the main character in our next tale theres too many of them naomi shrieked the sound perfectly matching the skidding of the motorcycles tires they came to rest just short of the treeline the buells engine purring between their legs steves eyes narrowed as he scanned the outer wall it wasnt the zombies that bothered him the labs main gate was blocked a humvee had collided with the burnedout hulk of what looked like a semis tractor the trailer must have continued forward turning over as it slammed into the two vehicles bright icelike pools shone where fire had melted parts of the aluminum walks cant get in that way steve glanced over his shoulder at naomi time to use the service entrance the neuroscientist actually cocked her head there is one steve couldnt help but chuckle for someone so smart naomi sure could be dumb steve licked his finger and placed it dramatically in the wind lets find out the lab was completely surrounded hed expected that there had to be what a few hundred shuffling and groping at each side of the hexagonal perimeter i cant see another gate naomi shouted over the bikes roar were not looking for one steve shouted back there a spot where the living dead had crowded against the wall maybe there had been something on the other side a living survivor a wounded animal who knew who cared whatever it was had been tasty enough to entice enough stinkers to crush some of their buddies against the naked cinderblocks the pressure had created a solid mass of compressed necrotic flesh its shallow angle allowing the stillmobile stinkers to literally walk up it and over the wall the ramping must have happened at least a few hours ago the original prey had long since been devoured only a few ghouls now stumbled or crawled over the undead ramp some of its parts still moved a waving arm or a clicking jaw steve could have cared less about them it was the mobile ones still slouching over them he worried about just a few he nodded imperceptibly no problem naomi didnt react when steve aimed the bikes nose at the ramp only when he gunned the engine did she look straight ahead to his target are you she began only way in thats crazy she screamed loosening her grip on his waist as if to leap off the buell steves left hand instinctively shot out holding her wrist and pulling it to him looking back at her terrified gaze he flashed his signature grin trust me wideeyed and chalk pale naomi could only nod and hug him with all her might steve turned back to the ramp continuing to grin okay gunny toombs this ones for you the buell took off like a rifle bullet hansen leaning into the howling wind five hundred yards four hundred three some of the zombies near the ramp began to notice them turning and stumbling towards the oncoming crotch rocket two hundred yards one hundred and now they were massing grouping into a small but tight swarm blocking the ramp without flinching steve swung the m out of its worn leather scabbard and with eyes still fixed firmly ahead he bit down hard on the weapons charging handle it was a move hed only tried once before that night his harrier had crashed outside fallujah the impact had broken one arm and both legs but not his warriors spirit hed tried using his teeth to cock the automatic carbine itd worked then and damn if it worked now the first round clicked reassuringly into the chamber no time to aim hed have to shoot from the hip crack the closest ones left eye disappeared a reddish brown cloud exploding out the back of its head steve might have commented on his marksmanship if only there was time crack crack two more went down falling like puppets with their strings cut this time he smiled still got it the path began to open but at the blinding speed they were traveling would it open fast enough oh my god naomi screamed with barely half a dozen bike lengths to go before they hit the ramp steve squeezed the ms trigger spraying a fully automatic burst of coppercoated tickets to hell kiss satan for me steve thought or my exwife whichever you see first the carbine clicked on empty just as the last zombie fell and with a soft crunch and a bang one hundred and forty six horses thundered onto the ramp with the buells wheels tearing up its putrid surface as they went steve and naomi catapulted clear over the fence ooohrahh steve shouted and for just a split second he was back in the cockpit shrieking over the iraqi desert showering fire and death in a star spangled storm unlike the av jump jet however this machine couldnt be steered once airborne the buells front tire smashed into the parking lot asphalt and skidded on a puddle of human remains the impact catapulted both from the custom leather saddle steve tucked rolled and slammed against the tire of a smashed prius the hybrids driver armless faceless stared down at him from the open drivers door too bad the save the earth car couldnt do the same for its owner he thought steve sprang to his feet he could see naomi lying several yards away she was face down unmoving shit the bike lay in the exact opposite direction no way to tell if either of them was alive the moans and stench hit him like a onetwo punch he whirled just in time to see the first of the zombie horde begin to slouch towards them where the hell was the m hed felt it slip from his grasp as they hit heard it skitter across the hard surface it must have gone under a car but which one there must have been several hundred vehicles still in the parking lot which also meant that there must be several hundred undead former owners still on the grounds no time to worry about that now and no time to start looking for the weapon the ghouls about twenty of them now advanced slowly towards naomis motionless body steves hand first went for the mm in his jacket no he stopped himself if the m was damaged or lost his glock would be their only ballistic weapon plus he thought his fingers closing on familiar sharkskin hilt behind his back it just wouldnt be fair to musashi sschhiing the ninjatōs twentythreeinch blade glinted in the noonday sun as bright and clear as the day sensei yamamoto had presented it to him in okinawa its name is musashi the old man had explained the warrior spirit once drawn its thirst must be slaked with blood well he thought lets hope that syrupy crap those stinkers have in their veins counts a zombie loomed in the blades reflection steve spun catching it cleanly under the neck bone and muscle separated like ice under flame as the still snapping head rolled harmlessly under a torched minivan ground and center another zombie reached out to grab steves collar he ducked under its right arm and came up behind its back another head went rolling breathe and strike a third took musashis blade right through its left eye dodge and swing a fourth lost the top of its head steve now stood only a few paces from naomi ground and center a fifth stinker found its skull cleaved right down the middle steve naomi looked up voice weak eyes unfocused she was alive i got ya babe steve yanked her to her feet simultaneously slamming musashis blade through the ear of a ghoul slouching between them he thought about trying to find the m but there just wasnt enough time plenty more where were going cmon steve pulled her through an encroaching swarm and together they ran to the overturned buell when he felt the engine roar beneath himmade in the usahe wasnt surprised another roar could also be heard dull and faint and growing with each passing second steve tilted his head to the smoke filled sky there it was their ride out of here a small black speck set against the crimson sun you call a cab steve said smiling at naomi for just the briefest of moments the beautiful egghead smiled back they were only a hundred yards from the labs open double doors no problem there four flights of stairs steve patted the motorcycle again no problem we just gotta get to the heliport on the steve trailed off his eyes locked on someoneno something a ghoul was shuffling towards them from behind a smashed suv it was short and slow and even on foot he and naomi could have left it in their dust but steve wasnt planning on leaving not just yet keep the engine running he said and for once naomi didnt question him even with the rotted skin the dried blood the lifeless milkwhite eyes shed also recognized theodor schlozman go was all she said steve dismounted the bike and walked slowly almost casually over to the approaching ghoul hey doc he said softly his voice cold as arctic death still tryin to save mother earth from her spoiled children schlozmans jaw dropped slowly open broken stained teeth poked through chunks of rotting human flesh huuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaa rasped the former nobel prize winner his bloody hands reaching for steves throat the marine let him get almost close enough to touch as you used to say he smirked arms are for hugging and swinging musashi like an honor guard rifle he sliced off schlozmans fingers then hands then forearms before leaping into the air and smashing the paleoclimatologists head sideways with a roundhouse kick the brain that had once been hailed as evolutions crowning achievement exploded from the shattered skull still intact it went spinning towards the buell landing with a wet splat right at the base of the front tire touchdown the marine sheathed his assassins short sword and walked slowly back to naomi we all done she asked steve looked up at the approaching blackhawk five minutes till they hit the roof right on time just had to take out the trash he answered without looking at her he gunned the engine and felt naomis arms grip him tightly around the waist back there she said tilting her head to the spot where hed rescued her did you call me babe steve cocked his head in perfect innocence and spoke the only french he would ever want to learn moi steve gunned the engine and the brain of professor theodor emile schlozman splattered under spinning rubber like an overripe tomato steve smirked as the bike thundered towards fred closed the book he should have stopped several pages back the pain behind his eyes had now spread to his forehead and down his neck most of the time he could ignore the constant headache most of the time it was just a dull pulse the last few days though it was getting almost debilitating he lay flat on his back his skin sticking to the smooth granite floor he rested his head on the oily crusty rag that had once been his tshirt and tried to focus on the center of the ceiling the light fixture above him almost looked like it was on at this point in the afternoon sunlight from the small window struck the bulbs prism glass bowl rainbow sparkles dozens of them marched beautifully across the creamcolored wallpaper this was by far his favorite part of the day and to think he hadnt even noticed it when he first arrived its the only thing ill miss when i get out of here and then they were gone the sun had moved he should have thought of that planned better if hed known what time it was going to happen he could have read up until then he probably wouldnt have even gotten such a bad headache he should have worn a watch why didnt he wear a watch stupid his cell phone always had the time and date and everything now his cell phone was dead how long ago had that happened way to be prepared asshole fred closed his eyes he tried to massage his temples bad idea the first upward motion tore the scabs between skin and fingernail stubs the pain drew a quick hiss fuckin idiot he exhaled slowly trying to calm himself remember his eyes flicked open they swept the walls one hundred seventynine he counted one hundred seventyeight it still worked one hundred seventyseven counting recounting every bloody fist print foot mark panicked frantic forehead indentation one hundred seventysix this is what happens when you lose it do not go there again it always worked although it always seemed to take a little bit longer the last time hed counted down to fortyone this time was thirtynine you deserve a drink getting up was painful his lower back ached his knees ached his thighs and calves and ankles burned a little bit his head swam thats why hed given up morning stretches dizziness was worse than anything that first time hed shot up too quickly the bruise on his face still throbbed from the fall this time he thought hed gotten up slowly enough thought wrong moron fred dropped back to his knees that was safer he kept his head turned to the right from this angle you always looked to the right one hand on the rim to steady himself the other dipped the plastic coke bottle into the reservoir the water was only a few degrees colder but was enough to jolt him back to full consciousness i need to drink more not just for dehydration but when i start to drift four sips he didnt want to overdo it the plumbing was still on for now better to conserve though better to be smart his mouth was dry he tried to swish another bad idea all the pain washed over him at once the cracks in his lips the sores on his soft palate the staff infection at the end of his tongue hed gotten while unconsciously trying to suck out any last particles of food between his teeth lotta fuckin good that did fred shook his head in disgust he wasnt thinking hed left his eyes open and thats when he made the biggest mistake of the day he looked left his eyes locked on the floorlength mirror a sad little weakling stared back at him pale skin matted hair and sunken bloodshot eyes he was naked his janitor uniform didnt fit anymore his body was living off its own fat loser no muscle just fat pussy hairy skin hung in blotched deflated rolls pathetic piece of shit behind him on the opposite wall were the other marks hed made day two when hed stopped trying to widen the twelvebytwelveinch window with fingernails and teeth day four when hed taken his last solid crap day five when hed stopped screaming for help day eight when hed tried to eat his leather belt because hed seen some pilgrims do it in a movie it was a nice thick belt birthday present from no dont go there day thirteen when the vomiting and diarrhea had ended what the hell was in that leather day seventeen when he became too weak to masturbate and every day filled with crying and begging silent deals with god and whimpering calls for dont every day that ended fittingly huddled in the fetal position because there wasnt any room to stretch out dont think about her but of course he did he thought about her every day he thought about her every minute he talked to her in his dreams and in the nomansland between dreams and reality she was okay she had to be she knew how to take care of herself she was still taking care of him wasnt she thats why he was still living at home he needed her not the other way around she would be fine of course she would he tried not to think about her but he always did and of course the other thoughts always followed failure didnt listen to the warnings didnt get out when you could failure let yourself get trapped in this little room not even the whole bathroom just the closetsized toilet box drinking out of the goddamn shitter failure didnt even have the fuckin balls to break the mirror and do the honorable thing you should have done and now if they get in you dont even have the fuckin strength failure failure failure hed said that out loud fuck the loud thumping against the door sent him crumpling against the far corner there were more of them he could hear their moans echoing back down the hall they matched those coming from the street below theyd looked like an ocean down there the last time hed stood on the toilet to look nine floors down they roiled like a solid mass stretching almost out of sight the hotel must be entirely infested now every floor every room the first week hed heard shuffling through the ceiling above him the first night hed heard the screams at least they didnt understand how to open a pocket door hed been lucky there if it had been the kind of door that swung instead of slid shut if the wood had been hollow instead of solid if theyd been smart enough to figure out how to open it if the doorway had been in the back of the outer bathroom instead of off to the side the more the ones in the bedroom pushed the more they pinned others in the bathroom helplessly against the rear wall if it had been a straight line their collective weight their sheer numbers he was safe they couldnt get in no matter how much they clawed and struggled and moaned and moaned the toilet paper in his ears wasnt working as well anymore too much wax too much oil had flattened them against the sides of the canals if only hed saved some more and not tried to eat it maybe its not the worst thing he reassured himself again when a rescue comes you need to hear the chopper it was better this way when the moans got too bad fred reached for the book one more bit of good luck hed found by running in here when he got out of here hed have to track down the original owner somehow and thank him for forgetting it next to the toilet dude it totally kept me sane all that time hed say well maybe not quite like that hed rehearsed at least a hundred more eloquent speeches all delivered over a couple of cool ones or probably more likely a couple of mres thats what theyd been called on page meals ready to eat did they really make them with chemical cookers right in the packaging hed have to go back and reread that part again tomorrow though page was his favorite to it was getting dark hed stop this time before his head hurt too much then maybe a few sips of water and hed make it an early night freds thumb found the dogeared page theres too many of them naomi shrieked the sound perfectly matching the skidding of the motorcycles tires the rapeworm by charles coleman finlay charles coleman finlay is the author of the novels the prodigal troll the patriot witch a spell for the revolution and the demon redcoat finlays short fictionmost of which appears in his collection wild thingshas been published in several magazines such as the magazine of fantasy science fiction strange horizons and black gate and in anthologies such as the best of all flesh and my own by blood we live he has twice been a finalist for the hugo and nebula awards and has also been nominated for the campbell award for best new writer the sidewise award and the theodore sturgeon award radiation a new and exotic phenomena for much of the twentieth century was seized on by writers as a pretext for all manner of unlikely but exciting developments everything from giant monsters to spiderman zombies too of course in night of the living dead its suggested that the recently deceased are brought back as zombies due to strange radiation from a passing comet the idea of extraterrestrial influence being responsible for an exponentially expanding plague that transforms ordinary people into a sinister menace is an old one in science fiction perhaps the best known example is jack finneys novel the body snatchers filmed in as invasion of the body snatchers and remade several times since in which lurking alien seed pods grow perfect simulacra of your friends and neighbors and the impersonators then proceed to murder and replace the originals another wellknown example is robert heinleins novel the puppet masters about sluglike aliens that attach themselves to the backs of human hosts and take control of them the novel which taps into the anticommunist hysteria of the time makes explicit analogies between the alien menace and the soviet union for whatever reason zombie stories of recent decades have tended to eschew cosmic explanations and have typically blamed zombies on manmade superviruses or else just left the question open our next story harkens back to this grand old tradition of zombies from outer space and reminds us that we should never ever forget to watch the skies when the rapeworms began to rain from the ohio skies i tossed my two boys in the truck with cases of canned food and all our camping gear and we headed south for the hocking hills far away from columbus and the other big cities too many other folks had the same idea we found a small colony in and around old mans cave clusters of tents spilling down the gorge from the shelter of the cave all the way to the devils bathtub there were men and women both which was just plain stupid with the rains coming this far north some folks were hostile but a couple of college kids offered to help us pitch camp josh hung back at my elbow fidgeting when the college kids werent looking he bumped into me and whispered dad we have to get farther away than this i looked down at his face and saw the way he was trying to look mean and strong and i hoped he wasnt imitating me he was only thirteen and his face still had a few soft edges to it dont be scared i said im not scared neither am i i lied its safe out here no its not josh was a news junkie had been falling asleep at night with cnn ever since the spaceshipor whatever it waspassed over earth and the rapeworms started at first the scientists thought it was a killer asteroid aimed at the planet maybe it would have been better for us all if it had been hey one of the college kids yelled you can leave the kids here go get your stuff from the car nick my nineyearold tugged frantically at my sleeve his chin trembling he talked through clenched teeth punctuating each word with an angry pause dont leave us here i put my arm around him and pulled him close but he struggled against my grip i wont do that i promise well stay together well be okay so i told the college kids wed just go up to the car together so the boys could help me carry stuff then when we got to the parking lot we ran to the car and headed east on route toward lake hope state park it was getting dark when i first saw the man in the plaid flannel jacket on the side of the road i figured him for another refugee but then he saw us and lurched out into the path of the car waving his arms for us to stop by the way he moved all stiff and jerky i could tell that he was infected get down i yelled at the boys get down i tried to steer around him but he moved fast if awkwardly i had a brief nightmare of him flying through the windshield like a deer because that would be it for us then but i twisted the wheel at the last second clipping him with the bumper and he flew off the side of the road while i held onto the wheel and controlled the car what was that what was that nick yelled joshs voice was calmer did you hit him is he gone dad did you hit him dont worry settle down i yelled fighting every natural instinct in my body to pull off to the side of the road i put my foot down and hit the gas its all right everythings all right less than a mile up the road i saw a car crashed into a ditch which made me wonder what if that man wasnt infected what if he was just an accident victim injured looking for help i pushed those questions out of my mind i had to assume he was infected when i came to the lake hope sign i drove past it soon enough we were on a dark unpopulated road that led through the wayne national forest if we stayed on it wed end up in the university town of athens where there were too many people so when i saw a gate for an old logging trail into the forest i pulled over and broke the chain on it with the tire iron after driving the car through i closed the gate again and poked through my toolbox for a spare lock to close the gate again sure somebody else might come along and break it later but there was no need to advertise we were here if id been thinking ahead i would have driven all night south toward ironton there were places in the woods as far away from people as we were likely to get anywhere in ohio and the rapeworms were unlikely to spread north into the upper peninsula of michigan but it was november already after seven at night and in the dark you cant see the rapeworms falling nick was at the frazzled end of his nerves whining and sucking his thumb something he hadnt done since kindergarten i just wanted to be someplace anyplace so we found a clearing out of sight of the road and we set up camp josh seemed glad to have some work to do he practically put up the whole tent by himself while i talked to nick and tried to get him to calm down well after midnight when i thought they were both asleep in their thermal sleeping bags i tiptoed back out to the truck to listen to the radio there were still stations broadcasting from some of the cities in the north i sat there shivering scanning the am radio channels in hopes of any helpful news wtvn out of columbus was dead but i was able to pick up wjr out of detroit snatches of news came in through the static scientists are still trying to understand the alien biology of the parasite infection that is sweeping the globe officials report that the nuclear device exploded over orlando florida has sterilized the threat there and will prevent the spread of further contamination meanwhile in ohio the governor has extended martial law to the highways all personal travel is forbidden as long as the crisis lasts cars on the highway may be shot without warning when that signal faded i tried a cleveland station with no luck i could pick up a couple christian stations out of west virginia but i couldnt stomach their message if we survived if i saved my kids then it wasnt the end of the world i was lost in these thoughts watching the breath frost from my nose when a tap at the window made me jump and i jerked up my gun and aimed it at my attacker it was nick he was standing there without his coat on bawling i started sobbing even before i opened the door and gathered him into my arms i rocked him and told him how sorry i was snot ran from my nose while static poured out of the tinny speakers after a few moments we both stopped crying he snuggled down into my arms what are you doing he asked im listening to music i reached out and hit the scan button looking for something to distract him but we only caught snatches of news mostly from the christian stations in small towns still unaffected by the plague the fifth angel sounded and i saw a star from heaven fallen unto the earth and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss and the rest of mankind who were not killed with these plagues repented not of the works of their hands hallelujah salva i punched it off then i turned off the car to save the battery and the gas i started to sing to him bye bye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee dad thats an old song its so lame im glad youre here i said tousling his hair why couldnt we bring schrody schrodys a smart cat he can look out for himself but whos going to change his litter box i hugged him close looking through the window as the dashboard light faded the trees formed a black wall around us like the sides of a pit and the darkness of the sky made the stars seem to twitch like maggots we get to camp out and pretend were indians wont that be fun wheres mom is mom safe i checked my cellphone to see if my ex had called but the battery was dead and i had forgotten to pack the dashboard charger their mother and i had gone through a bitter divorce which we tried to keep from the boys even though we split custody tomorrow was the usual day i turned them back to her she would be frantic with worry when she didnt hear from us but i convinced myself it was better to have no contact until the plague passed the government had censored pictures of what happened to women infected by the rapeworm but we heard rumors yeah shes safe i promised she wants me to tell you that she misses you his eyes brightened for a second then he sank back down into my arms you dont really know i held him until he fell back to sleep he started to wake up every time i tried to put him down or move him so i leaned the seat back and fell asleep myself when i woke up in the morning the windows were frosted over with ice and the sun coming through them was bright and harsh josh was in the car too in the passenger seat curled up with his head against my arm they both looked untroubled in their sleep the way they always had until just a few months before i knew i would do whatever i had to do to keep them safe after we woke up i checked our supplies we had our fishing gear and i had my grandfathers old single barrel shotgun in the trunk with a couple boxes of shells there was also his old special revolver the one he bought to protect his store and then never needed i had just the rounds inside that and no extras i didnt like guns and wouldnt have owned these if i hadnt inherited them i checked out our supply of canned foods if we were careful we could get through the next few weeks until things settled down dad you know what we forgot to pack josh said while we ate canned pears for breakfast i picked up the can opener where hed left it on the ground and put it back in my kit no what twinkies theyre the perfect food they never go stale they survive anything i grinned and he flashed a smile back for a moment i thought everything would be okay i think its better if we have healthier food i said i thought you said we were going to have fun he said the way he said it threw the lie back in my face but i grinned anyway over the next few weeks josh and i ate canned food until the green beans tasted like the corn like the peaches like the ham nick ate only peanut butter until all the peanut butter was gone the three of us sat inside the tent playing uno until the day nick tore all the cards in half because we were out of peanut butter we were cold all the time and we started to stink spending day after day in the tent until josh started holding his nose shut every time he sat next to me i didnt pack enough toilet paper and i screamed at the boys when they used the last roll of it to clean up spilled peaches we moved camp twice the first week we heard cars roaring by on the nearby roads so we moved to a clearing farther back in the woods a week later there were days of planes flying overheadfighter jets and helicoptersso we moved farther back under the trees we spent our days watching the skies staring at the roads jumping every time a squirrel crunched through the leaves dashing out our fire any time we heard something like a gunshot at night when the boys were sleeping i listened to the radio for news scientists still hadnt found a way to remove the rapeworms from brain tissue without killing the patients we were no longer in touch with the rest of the world the middle east was the first to go completely silent americans were moving north across the border into canada i thought about following with the boys but the gas gauge in the car read empty after i fell asleep one too many times listening to the radio with the engine running it was the second week of december when i took the shotgun out to try for a deer telling the boys they had to stay in the tent until i came back i was a half mile away when i heard an explosion and then another something far away but powerful enough to make the ground shake i ran all the way back to our camp and the boys were running out to meet me and we all waited together for something else to happen snow fell that night the first snowfall of the year that was more than just flurries three or four inches of it before morning there was a glow on two horizons west toward cincinnati and north toward columbus and the fresh snowfall caught the light and spread it everywhere nick had the leftover peanut butter jars which he had filled full of acorns he collected in the woods he sat there shaking them louder and louder like some kind of shaman trying to ward off evil until i snapped at him and told him to be quiet i just needed some quiet to think before we curled up in our blankets that night i told the boys to hold my hands we sat there silently but i prayed that we would make it all we had to do was lay low and survive long enough and my boys would have a chance it was in the morning when we went outside that we saw the footprints in the snow josh spotted the tracks first when he left the tent to pee i heard him running back feet crunching through the snow he yanked open the tent flap in a panic dad you gotta see this somebodys been watching us we all three went i carried nick if only to keep him from hanging onto my legs and tripping me he growled and bit my shoulder and pounded on me with his fists look theyre the same size as mine josh said its just another kid maybe hes out here all by himself nick squirmed out of my arms at that point eager to take a look himself together we trudged through the snow following the straight line of the trail through the woods when we came to the road i realized how stupid id been dont move i whispered to the boys and then stepping over to a pine tree i reached inside and broke off several branches using them to try to cover up my tracks as i retraced them nick fidgeted shifting from foot to foot kicking up the snow but josh wore a look of horror if we can follow them anyone who comes by here could follow us i nodded well go back to camp stepping in the same footprints as we go okay well use the branches to cover our steps what about the other boy nick asked as i scooped him up in my arms what yeah josh said hes probably really scared out here you cant leave him out here dad i damn well could i thought but then i saw their faces if the boy was infected he would have walked straight into our camp okay i said but you two have to stay here you can hide inside this pine tree and watch me go i thought that would be the breaking point that nick would change his mind but he scrambled through the branches spilling snow as soon as i put him down ill take care of him josh said i crossed the road brushing away both sets of prints as i went i figured to take a quick look around then report back to the boys that i couldnt find anything wed move our camp again and this time i would keep a better eye out for other people but i was only ten or twenty feet off the road when i saw a splash of camouflage bright green against the snow amid a flash of movement hey come back i called i ran after the kidit was definitely a kidwithout bothering to cover my tracks i came into a small clearing and saw him standing on the other side halfhidden by a tree its okay i said im not going to hurt you baby that was a new voice coming from off to my right the kid said dad and ran across the clearing into the mans arms another little family surviving in the wild just like us i put my hands in my pockets feeling more than a little nervous sorry i didnt mean to scare anyone i said taking a step back this other man almost made me feel ashamed of myself he was cleanshaven with his hair buzzed short his clothes were clean and neat not covered with stains he had a pair of sunglasses on his face so that he wasnt squinting at the glare of the snow and a rifle slung over his shoulder he had a big wad of gum in his mouth and he was chewing with loud smacks he came toward me fast hand extended in greeting no problem he said youre that guy whos been camping up on the ridge with his two boys right yeah i said but as soon as his hand closed on mine i felt something snag in my coat looking down i saw the tip of a hunting knife at my stomach he looked me straight in the eye peace okay i said okay he said i just want to be clear were not friends if you or your boys do anything to hurt my daughter or even attempt to hurt my daughter i will kill you without a moments hesitation i looked over at the kid now that he said something i could see she was definitely a girlthe longer hair the small chin the thinner bodyprobably the same age as josh her dad lowered the knife let go of my hand and took a step back are we clear he asked i pulled my hand out of my coat pocket and showed him the that i had aimed at him all along i feel the same way about my boys so i think we have an understanding a small grin twitched at the corner of his mouth like he was a man whod used a gun and knew how to recognize one who hadnt holding up his knife he said you should save those bullets they may be hard to replace i figure i wont use them unless i absolutely need to i hoped that i was implying dont make me need to he blew a big pink bubble and let it pop you boys make an awful lot of noise up there the guys name was mike mike leptke and his daughters name was amanda she was a year younger than josh but about ten years more mature in that way that girls have mike would have been just as happy if we walked away and he never saw us again but amanda was bored with her dads company and used to getting her own way so by the end of the week she was coming over to our camp every day to play with the boys nick came out of his shell and would run off after amanda and josh throwing snowballs at them she got all bigsisterly around him one sunny morning on a day the temperatures shot up to above freezing we were sitting in our camp eating venison that mike had shot and cleaned mike had built a goodsized fire without much smoke and for the first time in weeks i didnt feel cold the kids ran off into the woods pretending to be indians have you ever seen the rapeworms i asked voicing something that had been on my mind for a while what if they arent real oh theyre real i was stationed at fort benning when they fell on atlanta no shit they look like dandelion fluff coming out of the sky theyll hitch a ride on anything but they only do shit to people he shook his head i went awolso did a lot of other guys after thatand came back to ohio as fast as i could stole amanda from my ex when she wouldnt give her up ah its us or them us or them i hope they nuked em all straight back to hell he looked away what if he asked and then stopped what if what i said helping myself to another plate of stew i had done my best to shave and had melted enough water to wash most of the things in our camp including myself and the boys what if were the only people left mike asked in a tone that said it was painful for him thats crazy i said around a mouthful of the best food id had in over a month he had his sunglasses on so i couldnt see his eyes and he always had a smile at the corner of his mouth he lowered his head and spit between his feet what if it isnt i didnt say anything i wasnt ready to think about josh and amanda as some kind of adam and eve you were smart enough to get out of the cities he said and then didnt say any more seemingly on the principle that if you couldnt say something nice dont say anything yeah he shook his head then after a while he said you mind if i take your older boy joshua out in the woods and show him how to use a rifle i was torn i didnt let the boys touch the guns we hadmy old beliefs were too ingrained but i could see his reasoning before i could answer him josh came running back into the camp dad mike nick he found we jumped up from the log we sat on and josh froze his mouth moving but no words coming out mike walked toward him what is it wheres amanda shshshe was trying to help wheres amanda josh turned and ran back the way he came and we ran after him i stumbled tripped ran into trees trying to keep upwhat had happened to nick mike trotted easily at joshs side his head up eyes scanning the woods as soon as he saw nicks bright blue coat against the mottled brown of bark and leaves he bolted for him wheres amanda he said i ran past josh who stood rooted well away from his brother and reached nicks side at the same moment that mike jumped back there was a dog dead at nicks knees a once beautiful golden retriever with a dirty whiteandgreen collar its coat had gone gray and it appeared to be molting right before our very eyes i jumped back ten feet just as mike had the dog was covered with hundreds of maggoty worms silvergray and slick sprouting fluffclouds of microwirethin cilia at one end the cilia moved like the tentacles of tiny squids tugging the creatures across the ground the cilia sparked seemingly at random little blue explosions like static electricity nick i said circling around to see his face his open mouth was full of the worms tiny tufts hung from his nose one worm banged at the corner of his eye pushing at his tear ductwhile we watched it shoved its way in wiggling until it disappeared shit dad im so sorry dad josh was crying scared we were playing hide and seekhe its okay son mike said my tongue was pinned to my throat and i couldnt speak amanda ran to hide when she saw them right she josh sobbed unable to speak its okay mike said taking a step back abrupt and unexpected like a missed heartbeat which direction did she go they got in her face he screamed before we could stop them mike walked away without a word i stood therestaring at josh staring at nick watching the worms crawl off the dog toward my kneeling son i was sick i didnt know what to do didnt know who to ask josh took another step away rubbed the corners of his eyes its not my fault he said i wanted to scream at him to say hell yes it was his fault it was all his fault but i knew the words were really directed at myself its not your fault i whispered i wasnt sure who i was talking to mike returned in moments wearing a gas mask like some kind of steel and plastic bug he emptied a can of gasoline all over the corpse of the dog the smell made me think of gas stations of normal days i ran up and grabbed nick by the collar dragging his limp body back as mike tossed a match and the dog went up in flames look i said pointing at nick look hes okay theyre all off him theyre not off him mike said as the flames danced in the reflections of his goggles theyre in him what hes too young hell sit catatonic like that until he diesunless you feed him then hell sit that way until he hits puberty and the rapeworm kicks in what amanda cant have gone far not yet were going to catch her before she joins the bang at athens athens was the home of ohio university nested in the wooded hills of southern ohio mike was convinced thats where the rapeworm colony had collected because its the biggest city around i asked no he said as he thumped a box of clinking wine bottles into the bed of his x because the dog was wearing an ou collargreen and white go bobcats ah we left nick with josh in one of mikes deer blinds across the road bitter smoke filled the sky where the fire was smoldering out amid the snowwet trees and the wet leaf cover dad dont leave me here he said you have to be brave i said were going to go rescue amanda but i promise well come back after mike and i climbed into his truck and pulled out of the woods onto the main road he said dont kid yourselfwere not going to rescue amanda he had to choke out the words to calm himself down he started to explain that in georgia theyd seen the victims of the worms follow the paths of least resistance moving along roads to the places where they gathered what the soldiers had called bangs why bangs i asked he looked at me like i was stupid huh mike shook his head then he lifted his fist in the air and made a whistling sound like a bomb falling as he lowered it toward the dash when it touched down he popped it open and said bang ah yeah there was that reason too once a bang started we used to let them gather until there were enough to make the strike count he said then he had to knuckle the corner of his eye he shook it off and kept his head up scanning the sides of the road for amanda as we drove toward athens i had the in my pocket and the shotgun on my lap mike had checked both of them for me he was loaded with ordinance like some video game character i didnt like the way this was headed the people who are infected theyre still people i said maybe not the scientists were saying that the worms dont just rewire the brains when they lodge in them they rewrite the dna the military guys thought given enough time theyll find a virus or something that will take it out but the people like amanda like nick we can do something for them keep them safe keep them comfortable until we find a cure he laughed out loud wait until we get to athens youll see he said but we didnt get to athens we came up over a hill and mike slammed on the brakes shit he said he put it in reverse and backed down below the rim of the road just over the hill there was an old white farmhouse with a wraparound porch next to the house were three tall blue silos and a red barn with the name mcaufley spelled out in colored shingles on the roof a long onestory animal shed stood next to an unharvested cornfield i had to wait until we loaded up and crouched back to the top of the road to see what mike had seen instantly the farmhouse door hung open with the ripped ends of curtains fluttering through the broken glass of the windows on the barn a rope hung from the hayloft pulley spiraling around and around in the wind a combine was tipped on its side in a ditch by the road there were people moving around the animal shed the shed was on the far side of the other buildings we approached it carefully creeping along the fence for cover the stench of blood and shit and sugar was overwhelming anguished moans sounded and faded somethings wrong here i whispered the worms didnt start falling until after the harvest there shouldnt be any corn some folks thought it was the end of the world and stopped doing everything mike said shrugging he nodded at the combine maybe there was a rapture and this guy was the only guy who got taken something rustled in the corn the tall stalks swaying mike pushed me to the ground dropped beside me and brought up his gun an old man in a tommy hilfiger sweater walked out of the corn his hair and beard were untrimmed and unkempt his clothes hung from his body tatters trailing like fringes from his arms his smile was beatific and he mumbled nonsense words as he carried an armful of corn back toward the shed mike gestured me to come along and we followed the bearded guy around the other side of the shed where we ducked down behind a fourhundredgallon gas tank one wall of the shed had been pulled open and the building was divided in half on one side a boy rested in the bed of straw a woman crawled away from him pulling ragged clothes back on i was relieved to see it wasnt amanda on the other side of the shed a dozen or more women were lined up in rows their heads were covered with rags and pieces of old shag carpet and odd bits of blanket were wrapped around their shoulders to keep them warm they stood in thawing mud bare feet shifting constantly the sound that i had mistaken for moaning was a constant low murmur of nonsense words when i saw that many of them were pregnant i wanted to puke mike shifted position crouching around the other end of the tank he was looking for amanda i was too disgusted to move every bone and muscle in my body screamed at me to throw down my guns and run away one woman moaned louder than the others her swollen belly popped out of her sparkly teeshirt and soiled sweatpants the boy rose up from his bed of strawhe was not much older than josh with no beard to speak of and pale as a ghost when he leaned in to sniff the womans mouth she tried to bite his nose he jerked his head away then he bent down to sniff her crotch something satisfied him because he tilted his head back and crooned in some inhuman language the old man in the fringetatter tommy hilfiger sweater dropped his new armload of earcorn and came whining out his own reply a third man still wearing his business suit and tie but hairy and ragdemalion like the others came trotting around the corner thing was i could have known any of those men i even recognized the cheerful smiles on their faces from a thousand days at the office from the trips to the mall from the visits to school while i stood there uselessly mike ran over to a chevy parked near the far end of the shed and held a scope in his hand to peer inside tommy hilfiger and threepiece repeated the sniffing at mouth and crotch while the woman moaned and panted clearly in labor the women around her shuffled out of her way keeping up their continuous flow of jabberwocky the old man took out a knife and handed it to the pale boy they exchanged words in their weird groaning language and then without prelude the boy thrust the knife into the underside of the womans belly i jerked up the shotgun banging it into the tank startling myself i shrank back expecting to be seen but the others were too focused on their task the ghostly boy sliced the woman open from hip to hip at first i thought her intestines were spilling out then i saw that it was a pile of worms silvergray and wet hundreds or thousands of them swimming like a school of squids out of the ocean of her belly she moaned with another contraction threepiece reached his hand up into her stomach and pulled a creature flopped out at first i thought it was a human baby stillborn deformedits head was too small to be fully developed i thought it was just food for the worms to feed on and i waited for the mass of tiny creatures to engulf it but as the bloody red thing hit the ground it lifted its head and cried out it pushed itself up on all foursits limbs were as inhuman as its headand began climbing up the womans body she was braced against the wall of the shed the old man tying her to the wall to hold her upright threepiece and the ghost helped the monster climb petting it and stroking it crooning to it as it went the baby bent its squat neck back and cried out again the mother cried back word for word weakly fading the sound sent chills through me as did the sight of the baby ripping open her shirt and biting into her breast amanda mike walked into plain view toward his daughter who i saw now was hidden in the midst of a cluster of women at the farthest end of the shed her head turned at his voice she smiled as though she was happy to see him though her eyes were blank other heads also turned at the sound of his voice the baby lifted its weirdly disfigured crown and screeched the mass of worms on the ground wriggled and pulsed in his direction the three men left the side of the woman and ran toward him mike aimed his gun and with short controlled bursts dropped the old man and the ghost threepiece fell down but rose again blood pouring from his side and from the defensive wounds in his outstretched arms my teeth were chattering but i stepped around the tank with the shotgun raised i was screaming curse words the same words over and over and over still i couldnt bring myself to shoot mike took a step back and shot threepiece again dropping him for good the women in the shed keened and flapped their arms like a flock of frightened birds answering calls came from the fields and the houses i grabbed mike by the arm we have to get out of here amanda he said im so sorry amanda she pressed forward smiling at the sound of his voice but she echoed the keening cry of the other women and began to flail her arms he shot her in the head knocking her back and leaving a hole in the wall of bodies there were more men coming from the fringes of the farm out of the house and the cornfield i had my fist in mikes jacket dragging him backward toward the road he pulled away from me long enough to light one of the molotov cocktails he had brought along the flaming bottle arched through the air and landed in the dry straw of the shed the flames raced across the stalls like a golden retriever running to greet its master the women seemed unable to flee the shed as they jerked and struggled in the flames their screams sounded more and more human the men running out of the cornfields went right past mike and me throwing themselves into the flames to try to rescue the most pregnant of the women i was retreating trying to pull mike along he was emptying his gun into the screaming bodies screaming along with them their voices merged into a single wall of sound that threatened to overwhelm and drown me only the baby escaped the inferno it had dropped from its mothers breast at the first roar of the flame and now it ran bloodymouthed on all fours with its little lizards gait toward us mike pointed his gun at the monster but the trigger clicked on an empty chamber the creature stretched out its clawed hand to mikes leg while he tripped staggering backward fumbling to switch magazines i stepped forward with my shotgun raising it over my head i slammed the butt down on the babys head i hit it over and over until the stock cracked and flew off and then i beat at it with the barrel until the head was pulp pounded into the dirt i couldnt even see what i was doing my eyes were so blurry with tears my vision red with fury mike pulled me away and i threw the barrel on the monster and yelled at it my elbow was bleeding where the gun had gone off and grazed me with the shot i didnt even notice when it happened as we drove away the flames reflected in the window of his truck it felt like the whole world was on fire when we were in the car driving back to our camps i kept thinking about the way mike had shot his daughter rather than see her like that i wanted to be like mike if i had to be i wanted to be strong like he was i didnt want to see my children suffer before we went back to the deer blind mike made me wash up so i wouldnt scare josh with all the blood on me he talked a lot more than usual for himselfrecriminations how he should have extended his perimeter taken out that bang earlier talk about teaching josh how to shoot heading north for colder country we looked into the blind and i saw that josh had taken off his belt and tied himself to one of the corner posts whats up big man i said trying to sound lighthearted he was shaking sitting on his hands to keep them still his voice was very low it was only one dad there was only one that got on my face thats it only one i didnt know what it was nick was saying how they tickledhow it was dandelion seeds but they tickled i looked over at nick sitting catatonic in the corner the jif peanut butter jar had fallen out of his pocket it was filled with a dozen squirming worms setting off tiny blue sparks like little fireflies the j had peeled off the label leaving a glowing brightly colored jar of if josh saw me see it and his face went sick he gritted his teeth put on his meanest face and said nothing trying not to shake mike said good work joshua smart i need to talk to your dad for a second we stepped away from the blind mike put his hand on my shoulder im so sorry he said i was shaking my head rubbing my eyes he said its all right ill take care of it you had my back at the bang i got yours here i swallowed deep knowing he was right wishing that i had known him before everything went so bad wishing that we could have been friends that amanda and josh could have grown up together i took a deep loud breath and willed my chest to stillness looking him in the eye i said thanks thanks but i can do it i need to do this myself you sure yeah yeah im sure he nodded approval and i found myself wanting his approval as he reached into my pocket and pulled out the revolver he flipped it open checked the bullets and pressed it into my hand after this were going to go kill all those fucking alien monster bastards he said all right all right dad josh said uncertainly ill be right there i said mike patted me on the back the revolver felt heavy in my hand like an anchor keeping me in harbor during a storm i raised the gun and shot mike in the face he toppled backward and lay on the ground his head a bloody wound that lay open to the sky dad josh cried im right here i went into the blind joshs teeth were chattering he was pale and shaking and his eyes had already started to take on the glazed look he saw the gun in my hand i dont want it to hurt he whispered dont let it hurt i wont the thing is this even with the alien taking over some part of us remains in them some essential piece of our dna remains unchanged i have to believe that i thought of the way amanda turned her head at the sound of her fathers voice her tongue was inhuman but her face was full of joy so i put down my gun untying joshs bonds i say come here and i take him in my arms he squeezes me tight i look at nick whos already somewhere else and i pull him onto my lap i reach down and pick up the peanut butter jar full of rapeworms i unscrew the lid and pull one out pinched between my thumb and finger it writhes cilia twitching and setting off tiny blue sparks josh buries his face against my shoulder torn between clinging to me and pushing away so he can follow the siren call of the worm in his brain his voice is weak not hardly his own voice any more dad im scared yeah me too holding him to me i lift the rapeworm to my nose it sparks as it enters tickling making me want to choke i taste a spurt of hot blood then i take hold of nicks hand and joshs and we rise when we go well all go together everglades by mira grant mira grant is an open pseudonym for

extremely popular australian tv show the crocodile hunter irwin who had been wrestling crocodiles since early childhood took over his parents zoo and married a woman who had attended one of his shows they didnt wear wedding rings as these might pose a hazard to them or the animals he was criticized for once holding his infant son in his arms while feeding a crocodile though irwin maintained that the child had been in no danger danger was something he lived with daily a television ad he appeared in joked about him dying of snakebite after not choosing the fastest delivery service he eventually did die after being attacked by a stingray while snorkeling at great barrier reef later several stingrays were found dead on local beaches their tails chopped off presumably by vengeful steve irwin fans our next tale is also about danger death and wild creatures the author says this story is about the inevitability of natural selection and its about alligators ive always had a passion for reptiles and virology which gets you looked at sort of funny when youre a perky little blonde girl i have been bitten by multiple kinds of venomous reptile and one of the most chilling things ive ever done was go into the florida everglades to see the gators that really makes you realize that nature has things much more efficiently designed to survive than we are were just blinks of an eye to the alligator the smell hanging over the broken corpse of the campus is rich ripe and greenthe heavy reptile smell of swamplands and of secrets it teases its way past sealed windows and in through cracks permeating everything it touches across the empty expanse of the quad the green flag suspended from the top window of the physics building flutters in the wind it marks the location of survivors waiting for a rescue that may never come i wonder if they smell the swamp as clearly there tucked inside their classrooms full of quiet air where the search for the secrets of the universe has been replaced by the search for simple survival something darts across the pathway leading toward shattuck avenue i twitch the telescope in that direction quickly enough to see a large black cat disappearing under the kissing bridge i havent seen anything larger than a stray dog in the two hours of my watch that doesnt mean its safe to stop looking alligators are invisible until they strike a perfect match for their surroundings in this dead world the zombies are even harder to see from a to z in the predators alphabet this is california a world away from florida but that makes no difference now the everglades are here i lean back against the windowsill scanning the campus and breathe in the timeless tireless smell of the swamp i was eight and wes was twelve the last time we visited our grandparents in florida true to family form grandma and wes promptly vanished to spend their time on the sunny beaches exchanging hours for sandy shoes and broken seashells while i dove straight for grandpas tobaccoscented arms grandpa was my secret conspirator the man who didnt think a passion for snakes and reptiles was unusual for a towheaded little girl from ohio our visits were wonderful things filled with trips to zoos alligator farms and the cluttered somehow sinister homes of private collectors who kept their tanks of snakes and lizards in climatecontrolled rooms where the sunlight never touched them my parents saw my affections as some sort of phase something that would pass grandpa saw them for what they were a calling grandpa died five years ago less than a month after seeing me graduate from high school grandma didnt last much longer thats good i havent seen any reports out of florida in days and i havent seen any reports from anywhere that say people whove been dead that long have started getting back up again only the fresh dead walk my grandparents get to rest in peace that summer though the summer when i was eight and wes was twelve that was the perfect summer the one everything else gets to be measured against forever our second day there grandpa woke me up at fourthirty in the morning shaking me awake with a secret agents sly grin and whispering get dressed now debbie ive got something to show you he rolled me out of bed waited in the hall for me to dress and halfcarried me out of their cluttered retiree condo to drop me into the front seat of his ancient pickup truck the air smelled like flowers i couldnt name and even hours before sunrise the humidity was enough to twist my hair into fat ringlets in the distance a dog barked twice and was still with that bark i came fully awake realizing at last that this wasnt a dream that we were going on an adventure we drove an hour to a narrow unpaved road where the rocks and gravel made the truck bounce uncontrollably grandpa cursed at the suspension while i giggled clinging to the open window as i tried to work out just what sort of an adventure this was he parked next to a crumbling little dock pilings stained green with decades of moss a man in jeans and an orange parka stood on the dock his face a seamed mass of wrinkles he never spoke i remember that even though most of that night seems like a dream to me now he just held out his hand palm upward and when grandpa slapped a wad of bills down into it he pointed us toward the boat anchored at the end of the dock bobbing ceaselessly up and down amongst the waterweeds and scum there were lifejackets in the bottom of the boat grandpa pulled mine over my head before he put his own on picked up the oars and pushed away from the dock i didnt say anything with grandpa it was best to bide your time and let him start the lesson when he was ready it might take a while but he always got there in the end trees loomed up around us as he rowed their branches velvetdraped with hanging moss most seemed to stretch straight out of the water independent of the tiny clots of solid ground around them and grandpa began to speak i couldnt have written exactly what he said to me even then without fifteen years between the hearing and the recollection it was never the exact words that mattered he introduced me to the everglades like he was bringing me to meet a treasured family friend maybe thats what he was doing we moved deeper and deeper into that verdantscented darkness mosquitoes buzzing around us his voice narrating all the while finally he brought us to a slow halt in the middle of the largest patch of open water id seen since we left the dock here debbie he said voice low what do you see its beautiful i said he bent forward picking up a rock from the bottom of the boat watch he said and threw the rock it hit the water with a splash that echoed through the towering trees all around us logs began opening their eyes pieces of earth began to shift toward the water in a matter of seconds six swamp gatorsthe huge kind that id only ever seen before in zooshad appeared and disappeared again sliding under the surface of the swamp like theyd never existed at all always remember that nature can be cruel little girl said grandpa sometimes its what looks most harmless that hurts you the most you want to go back no i said and i meant it we spent the next three hours in our little boat watching the gators as they slowly returned and being eaten alive by mosquitoes i have never been that content with the world before or since im so glad my grandparents died when they did the slice of campus i can see through the window is perfectly still deserted and at peace the few bodies in view have been still for the entire time that ive been watching i dont trust their stillness alligators all corpses aside ive never seen the quad so clean the wind has had time to whisk away the debris and even the birds are gone they dont seem to get sick the way that mammals do but without the student body dropping easytoscavenge meals theres nothing for them here i miss the birds i miss the rest of the student body morealthough we could find them if we tried it wouldnt be that hard all we need to do is go outside and wait for them to follow the scent of blood a loudspeaker crackles to life on the far side of the quad this is professor mason it announces we have lost contact with the library repeat we have lost contact with the library do not attempt to gather supplies from that area until we have reestablished communications we have established contact with durant hall the list continues seemingly without end giving status updates for all the groups were in contact with either on or off the campus i try to make myself listen and when that doesnt work begin trying to make myself feel anything beyond a vague irritation over possibly losing the library they have the best vending machines the broadcast ends and the speaker crackles again marking time before a nervous voice says this is susan wright from the drama department ill be working the campus radio for the next hour please call in if you have anything to report and um go bears this feeble attempt at normalcy concluded her voice clicks out replaced by a death cab for cutie song the sound confuses the dead it isnt enough to save you if theyve already caught your scent but if the radio went offline we wouldnt be able to move around at all i doubt wed last long after that a prey species that cant run is destined to become extinct footsteps behind me i turn andreibig brave andrei who broke the chain on the life science hall door when we needed a place to runstands in the doorway face pale the shaking in his hands almost imperceptible i think evas worse he says and i follow him away from the window out of the welllit classroom and back into the darkness of the halls a school the size of ours never really shuts down although there are times when it edges toward dormant the summer semester is always sparsely attended when compared to fall or spring cutting the population down to less than half id been enjoying the quiet the professor i was working for was nice enough and he didnt ask me to do much leaving my time free for hikes in the local hills and live observation of the native rattlesnakes they have a hot dry reptile smell nothing like the swampy green smell that rises from an alligators skin such polite snakes warning you before they strike rattlesnakes are a lot like people although thats probably not a comparison that most people would appreciate monday some aspiring comedian did a mock news report on the school radio station this just in romero was right the dead walk signs of life even spotted in the math department tuesday half my mailing lists were going offtopic to talk about strange events disappearances attacks some people suggested that it was zombies everybody laughed wednesday the laughter stopped thursday the zombies came some people fought some people ran and some people hid on saturday there were twentysix of us here in the life science building half of us grad students whod been checking on our projects when chaos broke out on the campus by monday that number had been more than cut in half we were down to nine and if eva was worse we might be looking at eight before much longer thats bad thats very bad because out of all of us eva is the one who has a clue andrei leads me down the hall through the atrium where the reconstructed tyrannosaurus rex stands skeletal judgment over us all and into the lecture hall that weve converted temporarily into a sickroom eva is inside reclining on the couch we brought down from the indefensible teachers lounge she has her laptop open on her knees typing with a ferocious intensity that frightens me how long does it take to transcribe a lifetime is it longer than she has in the lecture hall the smell of the everglades hangs over everything hot and ancient and green the smell of sickness burning its way through human flesh eating as it goes eva hears our footsteps and lifts her head eyes chips of burning ice against the sickroom pallor of her complexion acne stands out at her temples and on her chin reminders that shes barely out of her teens the youngest of us left here in the hall her hair is the color of dried corn husks and thats what she looks likea girl somehow woven out of corn husks that have been drenched with that hot swampy smell she barely looks like eva at all its viral thats the first thing she says in her reedy little voice the words delivered with matteroffact calm dannys team over at the med school managed to isolate a sample and get some pictures it looks sort of like ebola and sort of like the end of the fucking world theyre online now she smiles the heartbreaking smile of a corn husk angel theyve been trying all the common antivirals nothings making any difference in the progression of the infection hello to you too eva i say a duct tape circle on the floor around the couch marks the edge of the safe area any closer puts us at risk of infection i walk to the circles edge and stop uncertain what else to say i settle for professor mason just gave an update weve lost contact with the library that isnt a surprise says eva they had jorge over there so asks andrei he updated his facebook status about three hours ago to say that hed been bitten but they washed the wound out with bleach bleach wont save you from ebola so its definitely not going to save you from ebolas bitchy big sister she coughs into her hand before saying almost cheerfully good news for you the structure of the virus means its not dropletbased so you dont need to worry about sharing my air bad news for me if jorge took three hours to turn after being bitten id say i have another hourmaybe twobefore i go dont say that theres no strength in andreis command he lost that when eva got the blood in her eyes when it became clear that she was going to get sick she was the one who told him we needed to run losing her is proof that all of this is really happening eva continues like she doesnt hear him ive been collecting everyones data and reposting it the campus network is still holding thats the advantage to everything happening as fast as it has professor mason has a pretty decent file sharing hub in place if you can keep trading data keep track of where the biters are you can probably maintain control of the campus until help arrives matteroffactly she adds youll have to shoot me soon andrei is still arguing with her when i turn and leave the room the smell of the swamp travels with me hot decay and predators in hiding minutes trickle by susan from the drama department gives way to andy from computer science death cab is replaced by billy ray cyrus there are no gunshots from inside professor mason gives the afternoon update contact with the library has been reestablished six survivors none of them bitten there are no gunshots from inside the hot smell of the swamp is everywhere clinging to every inch of the campus of the city of the world i wonder if the alligators have noticed that the world is ending or if they have continued on as they always haveif they observe our extinction as they observed the extinction of the dinosaurs with silence and with infinite patience the risen dead have more in common with the alligators than they do with us the living thats why the smell of the everglades has followed them here hanging sweet and shroudlike over everything the swamp is coming home draped across the shoulders of things that once were men was that how it began for the dinosaurs with the bodies of their own rising up and coming home did they bring it on themselves or did the dead simply rise and wash them from the world the alligators might remember if there was any way to ask them but the alligators have no place here here there is only the rising of the dead professor mason is on the campus radio again this time with an update from the cdc theyre finally willing to admit that the zombie plague is real details are given but the gunshots from inside drown them out the smell of the swamp the smell of blood and gunpowder the smell of death my grandfathers hand throwing the rock the sound of the rock hitting the water always remember that nature can be cruel i never forgot i whisper and open the door the campus stretches out in front of me majestic in its stillness the smell of swamp water and the dead holding sway over everything the door swings shut behind me the latch engaging with a click no going back there is never any going back for those who walk into the swamp alone this is cleaner this is the end as it was meant to befor dinosaurs for humans for us all the rock fits easily in my hand sized precisely to the span of my fingers i look up at the speaker that broadcasts professor masons update the masking sound that confuses the reality of my presence let the survivors cling to their petty hopes i choose my window with care making certain not to select one that shelters the living i pull back my arm remembering my grandfathers face my brothers voice on the phone when his wife was bitten the golden eyes of alligators in the everglades my aim is true the sound of shattering glass is alien here all i need to do is wait i close my eyes and spread my hands and i am eight years old i am safe beside my grandfather and the smell of the swamp is strong and green and sweet the sound of water running in my memory is enough to block the sound of footsteps the sound of distant moaning on the wind i am eight years old in florida i am twentythree in california and i am temporary nature can be cruel but the alligators the everglades and the dead are eternal we now pause for station identification by gary a braunbeck gary braunbecks most recent novels are far dark fields and coffin county other novels include prodigal blues mr hands keepers and in the midnight museum the sixth novel in his cedar hill cycle a cracked and broken path is forthcoming braunbeck is a prolific author of short fiction as

not one of us the third installment of his collected cedar hill stories will be published in the first half of by earthling publications braunbeck is a fivetime bram stoker awardwinner including once for the story that follows in ancient times bards and storytellers would speak face to face to their audiences they could gauge the mood and reactions of the crowd and adjust their entertainments accordingly and of course they always knew exactly how many people were listening artists who perform livestage actors standup comedians street performersstill have this sometimes dubious luxury but artists directly addressing a live audience is becoming increasingly rare most modern entertainment consists of distributed reproductionsbooks blogs movies tv and of course radio and its new media equivalent podcasting with these sorts of entertainments it can be very difficult for artists to judge exactly how large their audience actually is especially smaller artists and outfits who dont have the benefit of nielsen ratings and the like the publishing industry is notoriously lacking in data about their audience and many smalltime radio hosts speak into the microphone without any real idea of how many people are tuning in this is one reason why it never hurts to blog about or email your favorite lesserknown artists they probably get less positive feedback than you might imagine and would probably appreciate the attention most entertainers today even if they fear that nobody is listening can be confident that anyone who is listening is at the very least alive the determined radio host who stars in our next entertainmentwhich brings new meaning to the phrase dead airdoesnt have that luxury threefourteen am here at wgabwe gab folks thats why its called talk radio so if theres anyone listening at this godawful hour tonights topic is the same one as this morning this afternoon and earlier this eveningin fact its the same topic the whole worlds had for the last thirteen days if anyones been counting our loved ones why have they come back from the dead and what the fuck do they want interesting to say fuck on the air without having to worry that the station manager the fcc and however many hundreds of outraged local citizens are going to come banging on the door torches in hand screaming for my balls on a platter and to tell you the truth after being holedup in this booth for five straight days it feels good so for your listening enjoyment im going to say it again fuck and while were at it heres an earful of golden oldies for youshit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits thank you george carlinassuming youre still alive out thereassuming anyones still alive out there look at that the seven biggies and not one light on the phone is blinking so much for my loyal listeners jesus cmon people theres got to be somebody left out therea goddamn plane flew over here not an hour ago i know the things dont fly themselvesokay okay theres that whole automatic pilot feature but the thing is youve got to have a pilot to get the thing in the air so i know theres at least one airplane pilot still alive out there and if theres an airplane pilot then maybe theres somebody else whos stuck here on the ground like i am this is the cellular age people somebody out there has got to have a fucking cell phone sorry about that folks lost my head a little for a moment look if youre local and if you can get to a phone then please call the station so that i know im reaching somebody i havent left this booth in five days and that plane earlierwell it shook me up you would have laughed if youd been in here to see me i jumped up and ran to the window and stood there pounding on the glass screaming at the top of my lungs like there was a chance theyd hear me thirty thousand feet above now i know how gilligan and the skipper and everyone else felt every time they saw a plane that didntjesus listen to me its tv trivia night here at your radio station at the end of the world the thing that shocked me about all of this was thatit wasnt a thing like weve come to expect from all those horror movies i mean yeah sure the guy who did all the makeup for those george romero filmswhat was his name savini right yeah tom savinianyway you have to give a tip of the old hat to him because he sure as hell nailed the way they look its just all the rest of itthey dont want to eat us they dont want to eat anything allrighty then show of handshow many of you thought the first time you saw them that they were going to stagger over and chew a chunk out of your shoulder mines raised anybody else thats what i thought oh hellyou know in a way it would be easier to take if they did want to eat usor rip us apart orsomething at least then wed have some kind ofi dont knowreason for it i guess something tangible to be afraid of an explanation for their behaviorand did you notice how quickly all the smarmy experts and talking heads on television gave up trying to offer rational explanations for how it is theyre able to reanimate have you everwhen ones been close enoughhave you ever looked at their fingers most of them are shredded down to the bone people forget that its not just the coffin down there in the groundtheres a concrete vault that the coffin goes into as well so once they manage to claw their way through the lid of the coffin they have to get through four inches or so of concrete at least thats what all you good folks whove buried your loved ones have paid for think about it folks i dont give a hammerhorrorfilm shit how strong the walking dead are supposed to be no way could they break through concrete like that not with the levels of decomposition ive seen on some of the bodies so then how do you explain so many disturbed and empty graves in all those cemeteries all around the world easyyouve been getting screwed those vaults that you see setting off to the side during the graveside service have any of you ever stuck around to watch the rest of it be lowered over the concrete base shitit wouldnt cost anything to pour a base underneath the coffin a lot of us have been getting scammed people and i think its high time we got together and did something about it funeral homes and cemeteries have been charging all of us for a single concrete vault that never actually gets put in the ground anybody out there got a better explanation for how a moldy rotting wormfilled bag of bones can dig its way out of a grave so quickly if you do you know the number give me a call and lets talk about it lets raise hell organize a march on all funeral homes and cemetery offices but the ones who came out of the graveyards theyre only a part of it arent they remember the news footage of that greenpeace boat that went after what they thought was a wounded whale only once they got close enough to see that it was dead and had just come back to life it was too late one of them had already touched it by then christ how many kids did we lose when they went outside to see that fluffy or sprat or fido or rover was back from doggy heaven i smashed a silverfish under my shoe a few days ago and what was left of it started crawling again ive got towels rolled up and stuffed under the doors in case therere any ants or cockroaches your friendly neighborhood orkin man might have missed the last time he was here were television stations still broadcasting when sarah grant came home wait a secondsome of them had tove been or else i wouldnt remember seeing it okay right anyway locals will remember sarah she was a fouryearold girl who disappeared about five years ago during the land of legend festival ten thousand people and nobody saw a thing the search for her went on for idontknow how long before they just had to give up well about two weeks ago the night all of this first began what was left of sarah grant dug its way out of the grave in its preschool teachers back yard and walked home she tried to tell them what had happened but her vocal cords were long goneso when the police showed up and saw her they just followed her back to her teachers house where she showed them the grave the police found the teacher hanging from a tree in the back yard hed evidently witnessed sarah waking up from her dirt nap and knew what was coming by then the police had seen more than a few dead bodies get up and start walking around so little sarah didnt come as much of a surprise to them a lot of missing children started showing up at their old homes sometimes their families were still living there sometimes theyd moved away and the kids didnt recognize the person who answered the doorthis is when people still did answer their doors in the beginning when we thought it wasnt something that would happen here noit was just going on in china or what used to be russia or ireland orwherever everywhere but here not here not in the good ole us of a downright unamerican to think that christ there were idiots who stood up in front of congress and declared that all of this was just propaganda from iraq or hong kong or korea can you believe that and of course it was all a plot against america because the whole world revolves around us fuck that noise nations as we knew them dont exist anymore folksand this is assuming that the entire concept of nations was ever real and not just some incredible wellorchestrated illusion dreamed up by the shadows whove really been running the show all along it doesnt matter its all just real estate now up for grabs at rockbottom prices remember how happy a lot of us were at first all that news footage of people in tears running up to embrace their loved ones fresh from their graves mangled bodies pulling themselves from automobile accidents or industrial explosions or recently bombed buildings all those terrified relatives standing around crash accident or other disaster sites hoping to find their husbands or wives or kids or friends still alive reunions were going on left and right it would have moved you to tears if it hadnt been for a lot of them missing limbs or heads or dragging their guts behind them like a brides weddingdress train that didnt matter to the grieving all they saw was their loved ones returned to them they had been spared they had been saved from a long dark night of the soul or whatever they didnt have to give in to that black weight in their hearts they didnt have to cry themselves to sleep that night they didnt have to get up the next morning knowing that someone who was important to them someone they loved and cared about and depended on wasnt going to be there anymore ever again no they were spared that it didnt take long before we figured out that the dead were drawn back to the places or people they loved most that meant everything to them while they were aliveat least romero got that much right in his movies at first i thought it was just a sadass way of reconciling everything of forcing it into a familiar framework so we could deal with the reality of these fucking upright corpses shambling back into our liveshell maybe it was just ai dont knowa kneejerk reaction on the deads part like a sleepwalker maybe their bodies were just repeating something theyd done so many times over the course of their lives that it became automatic something instinctual i mean how many times have you been walking home from someplace and havent even been thinking about how to get from there to here your body knows the way so your brain doesnt even piss away any cells on that one home is important the people there are important the body knows this even if you forget but then the coldness started ihuhi remember the initial reports when people started showing up in emergency rooms at first everyone thought it was some kind of new flesheating virus but that idea bit it in a hurry because all of a sudden you had otherwise perfectly healthy alive human beings walking into emergency rooms with completely dead limbssome of them already starting to decompose and in every single case remember it started in whichever hand theyd first touched their dead loved one the hand went numb then turned cold and the coldness then spread up through the arm and into the shoulder the limbs were completely dead the only thing the doctors could do was amputate the things if the person in question had kissed their loved one when they first saw themgod almightythe coldness spread down their tongues and into their throats but mostly it was hands and arms and for a while it looked like the amputations were doing the trick then the doctors and nurses whod performed the surgeries started losing the feeling in their hands and arms and shoulders whatever it was the coldness was contagious so they closed down the emergency rooms and locked up the hospitals and posted the national guard at the entrances because doctors were refusing to treat anyone whod touched one of the deadthose doctors who still had arms and hands that is the one thing i have to give us credit for as a species is that the looting wasnt nearly as bad as i thought it would be seems it didnt take us very long to realize that material possessions and money didnt mean a whole helluva lot anymore that surprised me i didnt think we had any gracenotes left bravo for our side huh look ive got toive got to try and make it to the bathroom i can at least cut through the production booth but once out in the hall im wide open for about five yards the thing is ive been in this booth for five days now and while the foods almost held outthank god for vending machines and baseball batsive been too scared to leave so ive been using my waste basket for a toilet andwell folks its getting pretty ripe in here especially since the airconditioning conked out two days ago i gotta empty this thing and wash the stink off myself if youre out there please dont go away im gonna cue up the cd and play a couple of beatles songs in my life and let it be im feeling heavyhanded and ironic today so sue me if im not back by the time theyre over odds are i aint gonna be light a penny candle for me folks and stay tuned jesus h christ on a crutch i made it it was kind of touch and go there for a minuteor rather not touch if you get mebut here i am with a gladder bladder and clean hands and face so were not finished yet folks theres still some fight left after all i need to tell you a little bit about our receptionist here at wegab radio her names laura mccoy shes one of the sweetest people ive ever met and if it werent for her most days at this station would be bedlam without the sharp choreography laura has always been a tad on the large sideshe once smiled at me and said she didnt mind the word fat but i do mind itanyway laura has always been on the large side but dammit shes pretty shes tried a couple of times to go on diets and lose weight but theyve never worked and i for one am glad they didnt i dont think shed be half as pretty if she lost the weight lauras husband this prince of all asswipes named gerry left her about ten months ago after fifteen years of marriage seems hed been having an affair with a much younger coworker for going on three years laura never suspected a thing thats how true and trusting a soul she was the divorce devastated her we all knew it but she was never less than professional and pleasant here at the station still whenever there was any downtimeno calls coming in no papers to be filed no tour groups coming through no djs having nervous breakdownsa lot of us began to notice thisthis stillness about her it was like if she wasnt busy then some memory had its chance to sneak up and break her heart all over again so we here at the station were worried i asked her out for coffee one night after my shift i made sure she knew it wasnt a date it was just two friends having coffee and maybe some dessert laura was always incredibly shy when dealing with anyone outside of her job the whole time we were having coffee she spent more time looking at her hands folded in her lap than she did at me when she spoke her voice was alwaysalways so soft and sad even when she and gerry were together her voice had that sad quality to itexcept at work of course at work she spoke clearly and confidently sometimes i thought she was only alive when on the job i said that to her the night we went for coffee this was ohabout eight months after the divorce right for the first time that night she looked right at me and said david youre absolutely right i love working at the station that job and the people there are the only things ive ever been able to depend on thats very important to me now after that things were a lot better for a while laura took her twoweek vacation just before everything started in all the panic and confusion and martial lawwhich didnt exactly take very well as you might recallno one thought to call and check on her shed said she was going up to maine to visit with her sister so i guess most of us just figured or hoped that shed made it to her sisters place before all hell broke loose two days ago laura came back to work i can look over the console and through the window of the broadcast booth and see her sitting there at her desk shes wearing one of her favorite dresses and shes gotten a manicure maybe the manicure came before the great awakening but it looks to me like the nail polish was freshly applied before she came inand i might add she drove her car to work i remember how excited i was to see that car driving up the road it meant there was someone else still alive and theyd thought to come here and check on me i can see her very clearly sitting there at her desk about onethird of her head is missing my guess is she used either a shotgun or a pistol with a hollowpoint bullet my guess is that this sweet pretty woman who was always so shy around other people was a helluva lot more heartbroken than any of us suspected or wanted to imagine my guess is she came back here because this station this job her place at that deskthese things were all she had left to look forward to i wish i had been kinder to her i wish i hadnt been so quick to think that our little chat helped so i didnt have to give her or her pain a second thought i wishohgodi wish that id told her that she wouldnt be as pretty if she lost weight i wishshit sorrygimme a minute okay sorry about that fortyfuckingthree years old and crying like a goddamn baby for its bottle im losing ground here folks losing ground because when i look out at laura there at her desk and i remember sarah grant walking up to her familys home and realize how many of the dead have been able to come back have been able to walk or drive or in some cases take the goddamn bus back homewhen i think of how they recognize us how they remember usyou see the thing is laura used to always bring in homemade chocolate chip cookies once a week no one made cookies like laura i mean nobody shed always wrap them individually in wax paper lay them out on a tray cover the tray with tinfoil and put a little christmastype bow on top theres a tray of homemade cookies setting out there on her desk all wrapped and covered and sporting its bow half her fucking brain is gone splattered over a wall in her houseand she still remembered is this getting through to you folks the dead remember everything it doesnt matter if theyve been in the ground ten years or crawled out of drawer in the morgue before anyone could identify themthey all remember all of them is this sinking in and doesnt it scare the piss out of you look if they can crawl out of a grave after ten years of being wormfood and volleyball courts for maggots and still remember where they lived and who they loved andand all of itthen it means those memories those intangible bits and pieces of consciousness and ether that were told are part and parcel of this mythical mystical thing called a soulit means it never went anywhere after they died it didnt return to humus or dissipate into the air or take possession of brighteyed little girls like in the moviesit just hung around like a vagrant outside a bus station on a friday night which means theres nothing after we die which means there is no god which means this life is itand aint that a pisser karma is just the punchline to a bad standup routine and every spiritual teaching ever drilled into our brain is bullshit ha mark twain was right after allremember the ending of the mysterious strangerthere is no purpose no reason no god no devil no angels or ghosts or ultimate meaning existence is a lie prayer is an obscene joke there is justnothing life and love are only baubles and trinkets and ornaments and costumes we use to hide this fact from ourselves the universe was a mistake and we dear friendswe were a fucking accident thats what it meansand that makes me sosick because ii was kind of hoping yknow but i guess hope is as cruel a joke as prayer now still its funny dont you thinkthat in the midst of all this rot and death theres still a kindof life you see it taking root all around us i suppose thats why so many of us have found ceiling beams that will take our weight or loaded up the pumpaction shotguns and killed our families before turning the gun on ourselvesor jumped from tall buildings or driven our cars headon into walls at ninety miles an hourorororor theres a window behind me that has this great view of the hillside in the middle of the field behind the station theres this huge old oak tree thats probably been there for a couple of thousand years yesterday a dead guy walked into the field and up to that tree and just stood there looking at it admiring i wondered if maybe hed proposed to his wife under this tree or had something else really meaningfulpardon my languagehappen beneath that oak whatever it was this was the place hed come back to he sat down under the oak and leaned back against its trunk hes still there as far as i can make out because we found out didnt we that as soon as the dead come home as soon as they reach their destination as soon as they stop movingthey take root and they sprout like fucking kudzu they sprout the stuff grows out of them like slimy vines whatever it is and starts spreading i cant see the tree any longer for all thethe vines that are covering it oh there are a couple of places near the top where they havent quite reached yet but those branches are bleachwhite now the life sucked out of them the vines when they spread they grow thicker and widerin places they blossom patches of stuff that looks like luminescent pondscum but the vines theyre pink and moist and they have these things that look like thorns only these thorns they wriggle and once all of it has taken rootonce the vines have engulfed everything around them and the patches of pondscum have spread as far as they can without tearingonce all that happens if you watch for a while you can see that all of it isis breathing it expands and contracts like lungs pulling in and then releasing airand in between the breathsif thats what they areeverything pulses steadily as if its all hooked into some giant invisible heartand the dead they just sit there or stand there or lie there and bit by bit they dissolve into the massbecoming something even more organic than they were beforesomething newsomethinghell i dont know i just calls em as i sees em folks lauras sprouted you see the breathing kudzu has curled out of her and crawled up the walls across the ceiling over the floorabout half the broadcast booths window is covered with it and i can see that those wriggling thorns have mouths because they keep sucking at the glass i went up to the glass for a closer look right after i got back from the bathroom and i wish i hadntbecause you know what i saw folks those little mouths on the thornsthey have teethso maybei dont knowmaybe in a way we are going to be eatenor at least ingestedbut whatever it is thats controlling all of this i get the feeling that its some kind of massive organism thats in the process of pulling all of its parts back together and it wont stop until its whole againbecause maybe once its wholethats its way of coming home maybe it knows the secret of what lies beyond deathor maybe it is what lies beyond death whats always been there waiting for us without formand maybe it finally decided that it was lonely for itself and so jumpstarted our loved ones so it could hitch a ride to the best place to get started im so tired theres no unspoiled food left from the vending machinesdid i mention that i took a baseball bat to those things fivealmost six days ago now i guess the delivery guy never got here to restock them candy bars potato chips and shrinkwrapped tuna salad sandwiches will only get you so far im soso tired the kudzu is scrabbling at the base of the doori dont think it can actually break through or it would have by nowbut im thinking whats the point yknow outside the field and hillside are shimmering with the stufffrom here it almost looks as if the vines are dancingand in a little while it will have reached the top of the broadcast towerand then i really will be talking to myself if anyone out there has any requestsnows the time to phone them in ill even play the seventeenminute version of inagaddadavida if you ask me i always dug that drum solo i lost my virginity to that songthe long version not the threeminute single thanks for that vote of confidence in my virility i wish i could tell you that i remembered her nameher first name was debbie but her last namepffft its gone lost to me forever soso many things are lost to me forever nowlost to all of us foreverstill waiting on those requestsplease please please will somebody out there call me because in a few minutes the vines and thorns will have covered the window and those little mouths with their little teeth are all ill be able to see and imim hanging on by a fucking thread here folksso three minutes and forty seconds i am going to play the long and winding road which is three minutes and forty seconds long and if by the end of the song you have not called me i am going to walk over to the door of the broadcast booth say a quick and meaningless prayer to a god that was never there to hear it in the first place and i am going to open that door and step into those waiting breathing pulsing vines so im gonna play the song here in a moment but first lets do our sworn fcc duty like good little drones who are stupid enough to think anyone cares anymore and well just let these six pathetic words serve as my possible epitaph we now pause for station identification reluctance by cherie priest cherie priest is the author of the bestselling novel boneshaker which as of this writing is a finalist for the prestigious hugo and nebula awards she has three other works set in the same milieu as boneshaker a novella from subterranean press called clementine another novel from tor called dreadnought and the story that follows priests other novels include four and twenty blackbirds wings to the kingdom not flesh nor feathers and fathom forthcoming books include urban fantasies bloodshot and hellbent her short fiction has appeared in subterranean magazine and apex digest and is forthcoming in steampunk reloaded priest is one of the leading writers of steampunk a literary subgenre of fantasy typically characterized by a victorian aesthetic and the use of industrial age technology like gears and steam pipes to power wondrous contraptions such as giant robots our next story which is set in the same milieu as boneshaker is an alternate reality in which the american civil war has stretched on for nearly two decades and which has seen the development of all manner of incredible steampunk machinery in the novel an inventors illconceived scheme to tunnel for gold beneath seattle ends up releasing a toxic gas that turns much of the citys population into shambling corpses called rotters if just the thought of steampunk plus zombies has you quivering with joy this next story should be right up your alley the author says id been reading a lot about the civil war and something that nabbed my attention was how boys were occasionally sent off to fight while still horribly young thirteen was fairly common and boys as young as eleven are rumored to have fought i wanted to tell a story about one of these kids all grown up and trying to move onmoving west to make a life for himself away from the front lines i thought such a boy might make an excellent character to dump into the creeping danger of a zombie story because he wouldnt necessarily face the steep learning curve that ordinarily whittles down a survival party his instincts and battle experience would give him an edge walter mcmullin puttered through the afternoon sky east of oneida in his tiny dirigible according to his calculations he was somewhere toward the north end of texas nearing the mexican territory west of the republic and any minute now hed be soaring over the goodnightloving trail he looked forward to seeing that trail longest cattle drive on the continent or thats what hed heardand itd make for a fine change of scenery west west and farther west across the native turf on the far side of the big river hed come and his eyes were bored from it oklahoma texas north mexico next doorit all looked pretty much the same from the air like a pie crust rolled out flat and overbaked same color same texture same unending scorch marks the seasonal scars of driedout gullies and the splits and cracks of a ground fractured by the heat so cowsrows upon rows of lowing shuffling cows hustling their way to slaughter in utahwould be real entertainment he adjusted his goggles moving them from one creased position on his face to another half an inch aside and only marginally more comfortable he looked down at his gauges using the back of one gloved hand to wipe away the everaccumulating grime hydrogens low he mumbled to himself there was nobody else to mumble to his oneman flyer wouldnt have held another warm body bigger than a small dog and dogs made walter sneeze so he flew it alone like most of the other fellows who ran the express line moving the mail from east to west in these hopping skipping jumping increments this leg of the trip he was piloting a singleseater called the majestic one could only presume as a matter of irony the small airship was hardly more complex or majestic than a penny farthing strapped to a balloon but walter didnt mind next stop was reluctance where hed pick up something differentsomething full of gas and ready to fly another leg reluctance was technically a set of mobile gas docks same as walter would find on the rest of his route but truth be told it was almost a town sometimes the stations put down roots for whatever reason and reluctance had roots walter was glad for it hed been riding since dawn and he liked the idea of a nap down in the basement of the express offices where the flyers sometimes stole a few hours of rest hed like a bed but hed settle for a cot and he wouldnt complain about a hammock because walter wasnt the complaining kind not anymore keeping one eye on the unending sprawl of blonde dirt below in case of cows walter reached under the control panel and dug out a pouch of tobacco and tissuethin papers he rolled himself a cigarette fiddled with the controls and sat back to light it and smoke even though he damn well knew he wasnt supposed to his knee gave an old mans pop when he stretched it but it wasnt so loud as the clatter his foot made when he lifted it up to rest on the majestics console the foot was a piece of machinery strapped to the stump starting at his knee more sophisticated than a peg leg and slightly more naturallooking than a vacant space where a foot ought to be the mechanical limb had been paid for by the union army upon his discharge it was heavy and slow and none too pretty but it was better than nothing even when it pulled on its straps until he thought his knee would pop off like a jar lid and even when the heft of it left bruises around the buckles that held it in place besides that was one of the perks of flying for the dirigible express post service not a lot of walking required everybody knew how dangerous it was flying over native turf and through unincorporated stretcheswith no people no water no help coming if a ship went cripple or god forbid caught a spark a graze of lightning would send a hydrogen ship home to jesus in the space of a gasp or a stray bullet might do the same should a pirate get the urge to see what the post was moving thats why they only hired fellows like walter orphans boys with no family to mourn them no wives to leave widows and no children to leave fatherless walter was a prize so far as the union postand absolutely nobody elsewas concerned still a teenager just barely no family to speak of and a veteran to boot the post wanted boys like him who knew precisely how bad their lot could getand who came with a bit of perspective it wanted boys who could think under pressure or at the very least have the good grace to face death without hysterics boys like walter mcmullin had faced death with serious pantsshitting hysterics and more than once but after five years drumming and marching and shooting and slogging through mud with a face full of blood and a handful of stanleys hair or maybe a piece of his uniform still clutched like he could save his big brother or save himself or save anybodyhed gotten the worst of the screaming out of his system with this in mind the express route was practically a lazy retirement it beat the hell out of the army that was for damn sure or so walter mused as he reclined inside the narrow dirigible cab sucking on the end of his sizzling cigarette nobody shot at him very often nobody hardly ever yelled at him and his clothes were usually dry all he had to do was stay awake all day and stay on time keep the ground a fair measure below keep his temporary ship from being struck by lightning or wrestled to the ground by a tornado not a bad job at all something large down below caught his eye he sat up holding the cigarette lightly between his lips he sagged disappointed then perked again and took hold of the levers that moved his steering flaps he wanted to see that one more time even though it wasnt much to see one lone cow and itd been off its feet for a bit he could tell even from his elevated vantage point that the beast was dead and beginning to droop its skin hung across its bones like laundry on a line of course that happened out on the trail every now and again but a quick sweep of the vista showed him three more meaty corpses blistering and popping on the piecrust plain he said huh because he could see a few more dotting the land to the north and to the south a little bit too if he could get a higher view he imagined there might be enough scattered bodies to sketch the goodnightloving pointing a ghastly arrow all the way to salt lake city it looked strange and sad it looked like the aftermath of something he did not think of any battlefields in east virginia he did not think of stanley lying in a ditch behind a broken folded fence he ran through a mental checklist of the usual suspects disease indians mexicans but he was too far away to detect or conclude anything and that was just as well he didnt want to smell it anyway he was plenty familiar with the reek that rotting sweetness tempered with the methane stink of bowels and bloat another check of the gauges told him more of what he already knew one way or another sooner rather than later the majestic was going down for a refill walter wondered what ship hed get next a twoseater maybe something with a little room to stretch out he liked being able to lift his leg off the floor and let it rest where a copilot ought to go but almost never went thatd be nice oh well hed find out when he got there or in the morning out the front windscreen which screened almost no wind and kept almost no bugs out of his mouth the sun was settingthe nebulous orb melting into an orange and pink line against the far flat horizon in half an hour the sky was the color of blueberry jam and only a lilac haze marked the western edge of the world the majestic was riding lower in the air because walter was conserving the thrust and letting the desert breeze move him as much as the engine coasting was a pleasant way to sail and the lights of reluctance should be up ahead any minute some minute one of these minutes where were they walter checked the compass and peeked at his instruments which told him only that he was on course and that reluctance should be a mile or less out but where were the lights he could always see the lights by now he always knew when to start smiling when the gaslamps and lanterns meant people and a drink and a place to sleep wait there maybe yes telltale pinpricks of white laid out patternless on the dark sprawl not so many as usual though only a few here and there haphazard and lostlooking as if they were simply the remainderthe hardy leftovers after a storm the ones which had not gone out quite yet there was a feebleness to them or so walter thought as he gazed out and over and down he used his elbow to wipe away the dirt on the glass screen as if it might be hiding something but no no more lights revealed themselves and the existing flickers of white did not brighten walter reached for his satchel and slung it over his chest where he could feel the weight of his brothers colt bumping up against his ribs he set himself a course for reluctance he was out of hydrogen and sinking anyway and it was either set down in relative civilizationwhere nothing might be wrong after allor drop like a feather into the desert dust alone with the coyotes cactus and cougars if he had to wait for sunrise somewhere better to do it down in an almosttown he knew well enough to navigate there were only a few lights yes but no flashes of firearms and no bonfires of pillage or some hostile victory he could see nothing and no one nobody walking or running nobody dead either he realized when the majestic swayed down close enough to give him a dim view of the dirt streets with their clapboard sidewalks nobody at all he licked at his lower lip and gave it a bite then he pulled out the colt and began to load it sure and steady counting to six and counting out six more bullets for each of the two pockets on his vest could be he was overreacting could be reluctance had gone bust real quick or thered been a dust storm or a twister or any number of other natural and unpleasant events that could drive a throwntogether town into darkness could be people were digging themselves out now even as he wondered about it maybe something had made them sick cholera or typhoid hed seen it wipe out towns and troops before his gut didnt buy it he didnt like it how he couldnt assume the best and he didnt have any idea what the worst might be and still as the majestic came in for a landing no bodies that was the thing nobody down there including the dead he picked up his cane off the dirigibles floor and tested the weight of it it was a good cane solid enough to bring down a big man or a small wildcat push come to shove he set it across his knees the majestic drooped down swiftly but walter was in control hed landed in the dark before and it was tricky but it didnt scare him much it made him cautious sure a man would be a fool to be incautious when piloting a halfton craft into a facility with enough flammable gas to move a fleet all things being ready and bright and all it took was a wrongly placed sparkjust a graze of metal on metal the screech of one thing against another or a single cigarette fallen from a lipand the whole town would be reduced to matchsticks everybody knew it and everybody lived with it just like everybody knew that flying post was a dangerous job and a bunch of the boys who flew never made it home just like going to war walter sniffed one nostril arching up high and dropping down again he set his jaw pulled the back drag chute flipped the switch to give himself some light on the ships underbelly and spun the majestic like a girl at a dance he dropped her down onto the wooden platform with a big red x painted to mark the spot and she shuddered to silence in the middle of the circle cast by her undercarriage light with one hand he popped the anchor chain lever and with the other he reached for the door handle as he listened to that chain unspool outside outside it was as dark as his overhead survey had implied and although the light of the undercarriage was nearly the only light walter reached up underneath the craft and pulled the snuffing cover down over its flaring white wick he took hold of the nearest anchor chain and dragged it over to the pipework docks ordinarily hed check to make sure he was on the right pad clipping his craft to the correct slot before checking in with the station agent but no one greeted him no one rushed up with a ream of paperwork for signing and sealing a block away a light burned and beyond that another gleamed somewhere farther away between those barely seen orbs and the lifting height of a halffull moon walter could see well enough to spy another ship nearby it was affixed to a port on the hydrogen generators but sagging hard enough that it surely wasnt filled or ready to fly except for the warm buzz of the gas machines standing by walter heard absolutely nothing no bustling of suppertime seekers roaming through the narrow streets flowing toward bad alberts place or wandering to mama ricos the pipe dock workers were gone and so were the managers and agents no horses either no shuffling of saddles or stirrups of bits or clomping iron shoes inside the majestic an oil lantern was affixed to the wall behind the pilots seat walter grunted leaning on his cane he pulled out the lamp but hesitated to light it he held a match up ready to strike it on the side of the deflated ship but he didnt the silence held its breath and told him to wait it spoke like a battlefield before an order is given thats what stopped him not the thought of all that hydrogen but the singular sensation that somewhere on some other side enemies were crouchingwaiting for a shot it froze him one hand and one match held aloft his cane leaning against the dirigible and his satchel hanging from his shoulder pressing at the spot where his neck curved to meet his collarbone under the lazily rolling moon and alone in the mobile gas works that had become the lessmobile semisettlement of reluctance walter put the match away and set the lantern on the ground beside his ship he could see a little and given the circumstances he liked that better than being seen his leg ached but then again it always ached too heavy by half and not nearly as mobile as the army had promised itd be the steel and leather contraption tugged against his knee as if it were a drowning man and for a tiny flickering moment the old ghost pains tickled down to his toes even though the toes were long gone blown away on a battlefield in virginia he held still until the sensation passed wondering bleakly if it would ever go away for good and suspecting that it wouldnt all right he whispered and it was cold enough to see the words when had it gotten so cold how did the desert always do that cook and then freeze well move the mail damn straight we will walter reached into the majestics tiny hold and pulled out the three bags hed been carrying as cargo each bag was the size of his good leg and as heavy as his bad one when they were all three removed from the ship he peered dubiously at the other craft across the landing padthe one attached to the gas pipes but empty he considered his options no other ships lurked anywhere close so he could either seize that unknown hunk of metal and canvas or stay there by himself in the dead outpost hoisting one bag over his shoulder and counterbalancing with his cane he did his best to cross the landing quietly but his metal foot dropped each step with a hard loud clankeven though the leather sole at the bottom of the thing was brand new he leaned the bag of mail up against the ship and caught his breath lost more to fear than exertion then he moved the mail bag aside to reveal the first two stenciled letters of the ships name and reading the whole he whispered sweet marie two more mail bags each moved with all the stealth he could muster each one more cumbersome than the last and each one straining his bum leg harder but he moved them he opened the back bin of the sweet marie and stuffed them into her cargo hold every grunt was loud in the desert emptiness and every heaving shove wouldve sent ol stanley into conniptions had he been there too much noise got to keep your head down walter breathed as he leaned on the bin to make it shut it closed with a click this aint the war not out here just like me you carry it with you something what a gusting a hoarse lonely sound that barked and disappeared he leaned against the bin and listened hard waiting for that noise to come again the sweet marie had been primed and she was ready to fill but no one had switched on the generators she sank so low she almost tipped over now that the mail sacks had loaded down her back end walter mcmullin did not know how hydrogen worked exactly but hed seen the filling process performed enough times to copy it the generators took the form of two tanks each one mounted atop a standardissue army wagon these tanks were made of reinforced wood and lined with copper and atop each tank was a hinged metal plate that could be opened and closed in order to dump metal shavings into the sulfuric acid inside at the end opposite the filler plate an escape pipe was attached to a long rubber hose to which the sweet marie was ultimately affixed there were several sets of filters for the hydrogen to pass before it reached the ships tank and the process was frankly none too quick even little ships like these mail runners could take a couple of hours to become airworthy walter did not like the idea of spending a couple of hours alone in reluctance he was even less charmed by the idea of spending all night alone in reluctance so he found himself a crate of big glass bottles filled with acid and with great struggle he poured them down through the copper funnels atop the tanks shortly thereafter he located the metal filings he scooped them up with the big tin cup and dumped them in he turned the valves to open the filters and threw the switch to start the generators stirring and bubbling vibrating the carts to make the acid and the metal stir and separate into hydrogen more quickly it made a godawful amount of noise the rubber hose stamped goodyears rubber belting and packing company of philadelphia did a little twitch sweet maries tank gave a soft plaintive squeal as the first hydrogen spilled through giving her the smallest bit of lift but shed need more lots more there another one a sighing grunt gasped and then gone as quickly as itd burst through the night walter whirled as fast as his leg would let him using it as a pivot he moved like a compass pinned to a map he held his cane out pointing at nothing but the sound again and again another wheeze and gust at this point walter was gutswimmingly certain that it was coming from more than one place partway between a snore and a cough with a consumptive rattle coming from everywhere and nowhere coming from the dark up against the sweet marie he backed he jumped startled by a new sound a familiar one footsteps slow and laborious someone was walking toward him out of the black alleys that surrounded the landing nearing the ladder to the refueling platform and whoever this visitor was he was joined by someone elseapproaching the edge near the parked majestic and a third somebody walter was pretty sure of a third moving up from the shadows not one single thing about this moment this shuddering instant alonebut not alonefelt right or good to walter mcmullin he still couldnt see anyone though he could hear plenty whoever they were lurking in the backgroundthey werent being quiet they werent sneaking and that was something wasnt it why would they sneak if they know they have you reaching into his belt he pulled out the colt and held it with both hands his back remained braced against the slowly filling replacement ship he thought about crying out in greeting just in casebut he thought of the dead cows and his desperate eyes spotted no new lights and the sound of incoming feet and the intermittent groaning told him that no this was no overreaction this was good common sense staying low with your back against something firm and your weapon out thats what you did right before a fight if you could he drew back the guns hammer and waited lumbering up the ladder as if drunk the first head rose into view walter shouldve been relieved he knew that headit belonged to gibbs higley the afternoon station manager but he wasnt relieved not at all because it wasnt gibbs not anymore he could see that at a glance even without the gaslamps that lit up a few blocks far away something was very very wrong with gibbs higley the man drew nearer shuffling in an exploratory fashion sniffing the air like a dog he was missing an ear his skin looked like boiled lye one of his eyes was ruined somehow wet and gelatinous and sliding down his cheek higley walter croaked higley didnt respond he only moaned and shuffled faster homing in on walter and raising the moan to a cry that was more of a horrible keening to walters terror the keening was answered it came bouncing back from corner to corner all around the open landing area and the footsteps that had been slowly incoming shifted gears moving faster maybe he shouldve thought about it maybe he shouldve tried again trying to wake higley up shake some sense into him there mustve been something he couldve done other than lifting the colt and putting a bullet through the mans solitary good eye but thats what he did against a desert backdrop of dustcovered silence the footsteps and coughing grunts and the buzzing patter of the generators had seemed loud enough but the colt was something else entirely fire and smoke and a kick against his elbows and a lingering whiff of gunpowder curling and dissolving gibbs higley fell off the landing flopping like a rag doll walter rushed as fast as he could to the ladder and kicked it awaymarooning himself on the landing island five or six feet above street level then he dragged himself back to sweet marie and resumed his defensive position the only one he had that was easy he muttered almost frantic to reassure himself one down more to go youre a good shot but youre standing next to the gas surrounded by it almost he breathed i need to think you need to run i need the sweet marie wont get far without her hands appeared at the edge of the lifted landing pad gray hands hands without enough fingers left to right he swung his head seeking some out knowing he didnt have enough bullets for whatever this wasknowing it as sure as he knew hed die if any of those hands caught him plague is what it was nothing hed ever seen before but goddamn gibbs higley had been sick hadnt he gotta hold the landing pad he said through gritted teeth no you gotta to let em take itbut that dont mean you gotta to let em keep it he swung his head again side to side and spotted only more handsmoving like a sea of clapping an audience of death pulling toward the lifted landing spot he wished he had a light and then he remembered that he did have onehe just hadnt lit it one wobbly dash back to the majestic and he had the lantern in his hand again thinking to hell with itto hell with us and striking a match what did it matter they already knew where he was that much was obvious from the rising wail that now rang from every quarter faces were leaning up now lurching and lifting on elbows rising and grabbing for purchase on the platform and soon they were going to find it look where he asked the ghost of a memory trying to avoid a fullblown panic panic never got anybody anywhere but dead it got stanley dead on the far side of a broken folded fence along a line that couldnt have been held not with a thousand stanleys ah above the hydrogen tanks and behind them a ladder in the back corner of the overhang that covered them he glanced at the sweet marie and then his eyes swept the platform where a woman was rising up onto the wooden deckdrawing herself up on her elbows shed be there soon right there with him when she looked up at him her mouth opened and she shouted and blood or bilesomething darkspilled over her teeth to splash down on the boards whatever it was he didnt want it he drew up the colt aimed carefully and fired she fell back the ladder behind the hydrogen tanks must lead to the roof of the overhang would the thin metal roof hold him any port in a storm he scurried past the clamoring hands and scooted still hauling that deadweight foot beneath the overhang and to the ladder scaling it required him to set the cane aside and he wouldnt do that so he stuck it in his mouth where it stretched his cheeks and jaw until they ached with the strain but it was that or leave it or leave the lanternwhich he held by the hot uncomfortable means of shoving his wrist through the carrying loop when it swung back and forth with his motion it burned the cuff of his shirt and seared warmly against his chest so he climbed good foot up with a grunt of effort bad foot up with a grunt of pain both grunts issued around the cane in his mouth when he reached the top he jogged his neck to shift the cane so itd fit through the square opening in the corrugated roof he slipped his heavy foot dragging him to a stop with an earsplitting scrape hed have to step softly from this vantage point holding up the quivering black lantern he could see all of it and he understood everything and nothing simultaneously he watched the mostly men and sometimes women of reluctance stagger and wail shambling hideously from corners and corridors from alleys and basements from brokenwindowed stores and stables and saloons and the one whorehouse they did not pour but they dripped and congealed down the uncobbled streets torn rough and rocky by horses hooves and the wheels of coaches and carts it couldnt have been more than a hundred ragged bodies slinking forward gagging on their own fluids and chasing toward the light he held over his head over the town of reluctance walter stuffed a hand in his vest pockets and felt at the bottom of the bag he still wore over his chest bullets yes but not enough bullets for this not even if he was the best shot in texas and he wasnt he was a competent shot from new york city orphaned and irish a few thousand miles from home without even a sibling to mourn him if the drooling simpering snapjawed dead were to catch him and tear him to pieces bullets were not going to save him all the same he liked having them the lantern drew the dead he watched their gazes watching it moths filthy deadly moths he could see it in their eyes in the places where their souls ought to be most of the men hed ever shot at were fellows like himselfboys mostly lads born so late they didnt know for certain what the fighting was about just men with faces full of fear and grit nothing of that not one shred of humanity showed on any of the faces below he could see it and he was prepared to address it but not until he had to beneath him the sweet marie was filling down below the twisted residents of reluctance were dragging themselves up and onto the platform swarming like ants and shrieking for walterwho went to the ladder and kicked it down against the generators where it clattered and rested and likely wouldnt be climbed he sat on the edge of the corrugated roof and turned the lantern light down it wouldnt fool them it wouldnt make them wander away they smelled him and they wanted him and theyd stay until they got him or until he left he was leaving all right soon inside the satchel he rummaged and he pulled out his tobacco and papers he rolled himself a cigarette lit it off the lowburning lamp and he sat and he watched below as the craniumshaped crest of the sweet marie slowly inflated and the corpses of reluctance gathered themselves on the landing pad beside it ignoring it finally the swelling dome was full enough that walter figured i can make it maybe not all the way to santa fe but close enough he rose to his feet the flesh and blood one and the one that pivoted painfully on a pin the lantern swung out from his fingertips still lit but barely below the lantern beside the ship and around it the men and women shambled but fire could consume anything pretty much itd consume the hydrogen like it was starved for it itd gobble and suck and then the whole world would go up like hell wouldnt it all that gas burning like the breath of god well then hed have to move fast retracting his arm as far as itd go and then adjusting for trajectory he held the lantern and released ittossing it in a great bright arc that cut across the starspeckled sky it crashed to the far corner of the landing pad blossoming into brilliance and heat singeing his face he blinked hard against the unexpected warmth having never guessed how closely he would feel it the creatures below screamed and ran clothing aflame the air sizzled with the stench of burning hair and firepuckered flesh but some of them hovered near the sweet marie lingering where the fire had stayed clear still howling only a few of them the colt took them down onetwothree walter crossed his fingers and prayed that the bullets would not bouncewould not clip or ding the hydrogen tubes or tanks or the swollen bulb of the sweet marie his prayers were answered or ignored either way nothing ignited soon the ship was clear as clear as it was going to get and reaching it required a tenfoot drop walter threw his cane down and watched it roll against the ship then he dropped to his knees and swung himself off the edge to hang by his fingertips he curled the good leg up lifting his knee better a busted pin than a busted ankle and before he had time to reconsider he let go the pain of his landing was a sun of white light his leg buckled and scraped inside the sheath that clasped the false limb he heard his bone piercing and rubbing through the bunched and stitched skin and into the leather and metal but he was down down beside the sweet marie down inside the fire inside the ticking clock with a deadly alarm and only momentsmaybe seconds probably only secondsbefore the whole town went up in flames at the last moment he remembered the clasp that anchored the ship he unhitched it he limped bloodily to the back port and ripped the hydrogen hose out of the back and shut it up tight because otherwise hed just leak his fuel all over north mexico he fumbled for the latch and found it pulled it opened the door and hauled himself inside feeling around for the controls and seeing them awash with the yellowgold light of the fire just outside the window the starter was a lever on the dash he pulled that too and the ship began to rise he grasped for the thrusters and his shaking searching fingers found them and pressed themgiving the engines all the gas theyd take anything to get him up and away anything to push him past the hydrogen before the fire took it anything reluctance slipped away below and behind it shimmered and the whole world froze and gasped and shook like a star being born the desert floor melted into glass arlene schabowski

in audiences at the wizard of oz were dazzled to see a blackandwhite movie burst out into full technicolor when dorothy departs gray kansas and arrives in the magical land of oz and blackandwhite has been battling it out with color ever since in the film pleasantville twins are transported into a blackandwhite sera sitcom and as they slowly liberate the town from its oppressive staidness residents who have broken the mold become fully colorized in the recent video game the saboteur the hero moves through blackandwhite cityscapes in world war iiera occupied france attempting to disrupt nazi plansif hes successful color is restored to liberated areas in the world of zombies of course the most epic confrontation of blackandwhite versus color is the showdown between george romeros original blackandwhite classic night of the living dead and the fullcolor remake directed by makeup man tom savini devotees of the original will emphasize its classic status and the haunting quality of its stark blackandwhite look whereas advocates for the remake will point to its sophisticated makeup effects and stronger female characters like zombies themselves the debate just keeps on going relentless our next story also features a clash between blackandwhite and color child stars often seem to grow up to lead troubled lives but seldom as troubled as this really right now okay let me tell you about a nice lady who lives not too far from here she was in the movie and still is in a way her name is lorraine tylerand also arlene schabowski lorraine is in her early forties though you couldnt tell by looking at her she has long wavy blonde hair arlene is nine years old and she has long wavy blonde hair too most people would agree that she looks quite dead lorraine played arlene all those years ago lorraine stopped but arlene kept right on playing after the zombies swarmed the building arlene devoured most of her parentsthey were hers so she certainly deserved the best partsand then simply wandered off into the night and the night was filled with shambling ravenous corpses feasting upon the flesh of the living but the undead knew she was one of them so she was safe from their hunger her body held no warmth no nourishing spark of life to entice the other zombies that was the last the viewers ever saw of her but she needed food for she was and still is always hungry deliriously hungry for there is a deep black coldness within her that constantly needs filling sometimes right after she has eaten she actually feels alive again perhaps even better than alive she felt that way after she ate her parents and she wanted to feel it again so she wandered through the woods through the darkness until she came to another farmhouse now at this point one might ask they never showed what happened to the little girl after she wandered off didnt the police get her when they came and shot all the zombies brains out obviously not one might also wonder fearfarm of the undead was only a movie wasnt it well yes and no lorraine tylers father was one of the producers and stars of the movie which was made on a shoestring budget the money her family put into that movie back then wouldnt even buy a decent new car these days her father mother and some of their friends wanted to make a movie so they pooled their resources found a few more investors and did it and lorraine got to play a little girl who gets bitten turns into a zombie and eats her parents lorraine went on to become a school teacher with a cool website selling fearfarm memorabilia teachers get time off during the summer so she started going to conventions meeting fans doing a lot more to promote her memorabilia sideline she did that for years made good money too last year she made enough to buy a nice little vacation in mexico people still watch that movie all the time still think about it fearfarm of the undead has spawned hundreds of knockoff versions most of them released directtovideo and lorraine has watched every one of them because she is also arlene schabowski and wants to know what other zombies are doing somewhere out there it is always night and a little dead girl who is also a living school teacher is always hungry anyway back to that other farmhouse arlene could hear cows mooing in the distance the sound made her hungry she crept up to the house and looked in the window into a quaint tidy living room with knickknacks on little cherrywood tables and furniture draped with lace doilies an old woman was sitting at her desk reading some papers she had long white hair and wore a dark gray housecoat of course everything in that world is black and white or shades of gray just like in the movie the old woman must not have turned on the radio or the tv that day or night she looked so peaceful it was clear she had no idea what was going on the little dead girl went to the front door and knocked the old woman called out as cheery as can be who is it now none of the other zombies in that movie were able to talk all they ever did was grunt and roar and squeal but arlene was able to think really hard and call upon the abilities of her other self lorraine and she managed to rasp out the threeword phrase from the movie for which she is best known she also says a fourword phrase early in the movie but most folks dont remember that no they only remember what she says just before she turns into a zombie help me mommy mommy im nobodys mommy the old woman cried whos out there is this some kind of a joke so saying she threw open the door my god little girl are you hurt theres blood all over you arlene held out her arms just like she did before she killed her moviemommy who was played by her reallife mother again she said help me mommy of course ill help you you poor thing the old woman knelt before her she must have had something wrong with her knees because she winced with pain so tell me who did this to you who her next few words were lost in a thick gurgle of black blood because by then arlene had her little teeth embedded in the old womans throat and even though the dear old thing was past her prime she was still full of warm delicious intoxicating life arlene ate her fill and by the time she was done that sweet old woman looked like a carwreck victim sans safety belt arlene turned and strayed into the night she didnt wait around to watch the old womans gnawed carcass scramble back to hungry life mind you while all that was going on poor confused lorraine was hiding in some bushes in the school playground screaming and wondering why all these bad things were going on in her head the other kids thought she had gone nuts her parents and the teachers talked about it later and based on what shed told them they decided she had an overactive imagination they told her not to let the bad images scare her they were makebelieve so they couldnt hurt her it was all in her head they said and in a way it was hers was a sort of reality surplus disorder its hard to concentrate when youve got another personality playing in your mind my best guess is all the movies fans created that personality that blackandwhite world of death all those watchers in the dark thinking about that movie those zombies and of course poor little arlene schabowski all that feverish brain energy what is reality anyway a mental collective thats all the result of multiple minds mulling over enthralling stories im sure that somewhere out there moby dick is still swimming and the house of usher is still falling im sure dorothy is still wandering down the yellow brick road having new adventures fighting more witches and flying monkeys and im sure shes still a tiny young thing just as arlene schabowski is still a tiny dead thing but let us return to arlene she walked down a gravel lane until she came to the highway car lights were heading toward her she held out her bloodstained skinny arms and waited the driver would stop of course they would she was just a little girl so she waited and the driver stoppeda fat middleaged man with a bulbous nose and hornrimmed glasses was there an accident he ran up to her crouched and thrust his fat face near hers help me mommy she said you poor thing he said in a low sad voice what the hell happened to you another one who thought she was simply a poor thing she smiled leaned forward and bit off his noseit was too large and juicy a target to resist he screamed so she bit off his lower lip which made him scream that much louder she gnawed and gnawed until he was too cold for her to stomach then she began shambling down the road and because that entire movie took place at night the daylight never came she wandered an eternal night of fields and rural back roads and farmhouses feasting on innocent country folks who only wanted to help her and lorraine she endured arlenes adventures in her head and finally even got used to them a person can get used to anything really folks who live near airports soon learn to ignore the roar of planes coming and going lorraine grew into a tall willowy lady always slender having a zombie in your head is enough to spoil anyones appetite there were plenty of times when she would sit down to dinner and arlene would suddenly go on a rampage in her mind little zombiegirl would rip apart a couple farmers tear out their guts and gobble them down and suddenly that plate of lasagna would seem like a hideous visceral thing but lorraine wouldnt scream over itwouldnt even bat an eyelash shed just push the plate away as i mentioned lorraine eventually became a school teacher because a part of her was still a little girl she liked being around children she lived in a big nice apartment building surrounded by familiesall the kids there thought she was great some of the people in her building had seen her movie and they were always telling their friends that their neighbor was a movie star sometimes folks who had seen the movie would call her arlene shed smile to be polite but she didnt like it hey arlenehelp me mommy was the favorite greeting of the fat guy who lived six doors down shed always try to take a different route to avoid him if she saw him coming eventually she started dating the schools janitor and all of her friends made fun of her for that joking that the lovers were probably always sneaking off to the boiler room or some such place the janitor whose name was kurt was a goodlooking man only in his midthirties and in fine physical shape and truth to tell the two did sneak off together sometimes to kurts office his door had a fancy titleenvironmental control specialistbut it still meant janitor once while she was in his office lorraine saw a key hanging from a little nail on the wall behind his desk the key had a scrap of paper taped to it the word attic was written on that scrap in blue ballpoint ink she waited until kurts back was turned and she took that key even while she was reaching for it she wasnt sure why she was taking it she just knew she had to have it after school she stayed behind waited until everyone was gone and then went up to the attic it was all storage up there and the things that had been packed away up there so long ago were now all but forgotten remember where little arlene ate her parents in the attic thats where the moviefamily went to hide from the zombies the movieattic had a bed in it where arlene used to sleep she says her fourword line while shes in that bed the school attic had a broken cot among its various odds and ends obsolete school books tennis shoes sacks of that pinkish pulpy stuff to sprinkle on barf to soak it up and make the smell go away lorraine strolled among rows of dusty boxes and stayed up there for about an hour looking at spider webs and old papers and outdated globes she realized then that this was the first time shed been in an atticany attic at allsince the filming of that movie her parents had always lived in apartments her dorm room in college had been on the ground floor a life without attics she now felt oddly at homebut was it a good home when she came down from the attic left the building and went to her car the world around her seemed different somehow a little lesscolorful a moment later arlene schabowski saw red in her nightworld for the first time usually the blood of her victims was shiny black but she looked down at the hitchhiker she had just torn to bits and saw red red everywhere then she saw that her dress was stained not merely with various splotches of gray but horrible gouts of rotted filth and gorered yellow brown green a veritable rainbow of decay it made her smile a few days later kurt was completely confused by lorraines birthday gift to him rainy he said for that is what he called her this tiedont get me wrong i think its great and silk it must have cost plenty but purple i dont know if im the purple type oh she said quite softly is it purple i thought it was some kind of dark silver are you sure its purple lorraine sometimes would bring a book to school to read in the attic after hours in the days to come her students became more and more confused by some of the things she saidespecially during art class whenever one of them did a drawing she would ask things like what color is that horse or thats a very pretty mermaidwhich crayon did you use for the hair arlene began to notice green leaves among the gray when car headlights hit them just right and some of the towns she meandered through were bigger than the little country burgs she usually came across one even had a supermarket she would hide in the bushes bordering the parking lot and watch the front of the supermarket watch all the people rushing in and out it made her hungry sometimes one of the shoppers would hear something rustling in the bushes and go see what it was worrying that it might be a lost child they were right to worry lorraine found that the drive back to her house seemed a little shorter every week and there were fewer cars on the road not as many buildings behind the sidewalks fewer kids in the school but more birds in the light blue sky there was still a bit of color in her world but not much the changes were all huge yet gradual kurt usually wore a nice polo shirt and jeans to work it didnt even surprise her when he started wearing coveralls or when his voice started to take on a rural twang he even took to calling her honey arlene just kept on wanderingshe was so good at it wandering and eating eating and wandering always keeping to the shadows which was getting harder since there were so many streetlights around but she was finding more homeless people so at least she had been eating regularly no more fieldsshe was in the suburbs now and the skies were starting to lighten night was slowly giving way to a light blue morning you see what was happening dont you they were starting to meet in the middle why do you suppose that was happening maybe it was because lorraine was spending so much time up in that attic i suspect attics have strange powers they come to points at the top like pyramids theyre rather intriguing arent they and bear in mind zombie movies were becoming more modernperhaps the imaginations that had pulled arlene into existence were pulling her into the present day lorraine was getting pulled too but in a different way into somethingbut what one morning she thought she saw a tractor drive past the school later that day she knew she heard cows mooing in the distance she broke off her relationship with kurt he was becoming more and more rural like some of the extras in fearfarm of the undead he was growing too much hair and losing too many teeth that wasnt the kind of boyfriend she wanted and this certainly wasnt the life she wanted to lead she didnt like it no not one little bit especially when she found herself chewing on what was left of the algebra teacher late at night up in the school attic she couldnt even remember what she had done to get him up there not that it mattered there were shreds of flesh under her nails and her belly was swollen with food she wasnt sure if what she had done would turn the skinny old teacher into a zombie but better safe than sorry she went down to kurts supply closet grabbed a hammer and used it to cave in the old mans gnawed head and then she waited pretty soon she heard the tappitytap tappitytap tappitytap of littlegirl heels coming up the stairs to the attic and then thats when you walked in arlene you walked in and said the fourword phrase that you said in the first half of that movie in the scene when your mother was putting you to bed tell me a story most people dont remember you said that but you did in that sweet soft cheery voice though thats not what your voice sounds like now you sound like a record thats slowly melting as it plays so did you like my story arlene it was all about youand me too but i said lorraine instead of i because well i dont really feel like me anymore but im not you i dont know who i am where i am or even what i am hmmm no im not your mommy and im afraid i cant help you but who knows maybe pounding your head open with this hammer will help me zombie gigolo by s g browne s g brownes first novel breathers a zombies lament a dark comedy about life after undeath told from the perspective of a zombie came out in and was a finalist for this years bram stoker award for best first novel his second novel which comes out in november is fated a dark irreverent comedy about fate destiny and the consequences of getting involved in the lives of humans his short fiction can also be found in the anthology zombies encounters with the hungry dead one of the things thats appealing about zombie fiction is that zombies used to be us and were just one bite or infected wound away from becoming one of them thats a sentiment browne shares but he also believes theyre experiencing their current popularity because theyre no longer just the mindless shambling ghouls weve known and loved for the past forty years theyre faster funnier sentient he says plus theres this constant fascination with the inevitability of a zombie apocalypse i mean no one ever talks about the werewolf apocalypse that would be ridiculous brownes own take on zombies in his novel and two short stories intended to show a different side to zombies giving them sentience viewing the world through their eyes and what they have to deal with when you think about it most zombie films and fiction are really about the people rather than the zombies browne says my fiction is about the zombies just to warn you our next story is a little gross it was originally written for the gross out contest at the world horror convention in salt lake city browne had just sold his novel breathers so for his contest entry he took a couple of ideas from that and ratcheted them up viscerally the rules stated that the story had to be between three to five minutes in length when read aloud so the authors had to be frugal with their words maintain a decent grossout factor and cut out anything that didnt move the story fast enough browne didnt win but he did come in third winning him the coveted gummy haggis prize but if our next story wasnt gross enough to win im not sure i want to know what did is it necrophilia if youre both dead okay technically were not dead were undead but semantics tend to take a back seat when youre banging a threeweekold corpse whos moaning that shes about to come just before one of her main body cavities bursts open at first i cant tell if its the abdominal cavity or the pelvic cavity because honestly when youre an animated corpse everything smells like a fecal smoothie but then i see something that looks like a partially dissolved kidney and the fluid spilling out of her has the consistency of chunky chicken noodle soup so im guessing abdominal cavity im suddenly wishing id worn a condom though i suppose it could have been worse i could have been eating her out but she didnt pay for the surf and turf not that this is the first time something like this has happened to me after all when youre a zombie gigolo you have to expect the smell of hydrogen sulfide and the oozing of intestinal juices and the occasional skin slip but i should know better than to accept clients who are more than a couple of weeks past their use by date if youve never had your tongue down the throat of a zombie whose liquefied brain suddenly bubbled out of her mouth you probably wouldnt understand the cavity burster gets up from the bed apologizing for the mess as she tries to pack her internal organs back into her lucky brand jeans dripping a trail of liquefied internal organs across the concrete floor on her way out thats why i use plastic sheets instead of calvin klein theyre easy to rinse off and with the setup i have in the cellar i just wash everything down the drain otherwise id spend all of my time at the laundromat my two oclock appointment is less than a week old a freshie still she doesnt exactly smell like irish spring more like summer compost her stomach is already starting to blister she has skin the texture of a greasy banana peel and when i slide inside her it feels like im fucking a nest of mummified cats tongues the thing about zombies is that other than our internal organs turning to soup and liquid leaking from enzymeravaged cells theres not a lot of natural lubrication however for those of us who were fortunate enough to have been embalmed formaldehyde is the magic elixir that allows us to maintain some sense of pride the freshie wasnt one of the fortunate ones in addition to her cracked bloating stomach and the aroma of rotting eggs that keeps leaking out of multiple orifices the tips of her nipples are coming off in my mouth liquid from the deteriorating cells of a corpse can get in between the layers of skin and loosen them this is called sloughage it usually starts with the fingers and toes sometimes the skin of the entire hand or foot will come off not a pleasant thought when youre fucking sandpaper if youve never had the skin of your cock peel off like a used condom you probably wouldnt understand as i slide in and out of the freshie i open my eyes and glance down at her face just inches from mine her eyes are closed in ecstasy her mouth is open in a silent gasp and greenish fluid from her lungs is oozing out of her nose morticians call this frothy purge like its some new drink at starbucks just as im about to blow my load the freshie sneezes and ive got frothy purge on my tongue and lower lip some zombies are walking petri dishes serving host to a plethora of bacteria and fungi these are the unlucky ones who werent embalmed and who suffer the indignities of putrefaction as they slowly dissolve in zombie circles we refer to these pathetic creatures as melters my last customer of the day is a melter her skin is peeling away her body is covered with festering wounds most of her hair has fallen out and when she smiles what few remaining teeth she has are coated in an oily black goo that runs down her chin because she has no lips before she gets on the bed i pull out a can of glade neutralizer and circle around her covering her from head to toe i prefer the neutralizer fragrance because it works directly toward the source of the odor though tropical mist has a nice fruity scent the moment i climb on top of her im wondering if ive made a big mistake her breath washes over me like fresh hot vomit her skin is the texture of raw chicken sliding back and forth and tearing away in my hands when she drags her fingers down my back her fingernails detach occasionally the pus oozing from her wounds erupts in an orgasmic geyser keeping your focus when youre banging a melter isnt easy its enough to deflate even a postmortem permanent boner so i think about human flesh and i close my eyes and i keep banging away but with every thrust it feels like im fucking mashed potatoes like im fucking overcooked rice like the rice is swarming around my cock when i pull out my cock is covered with maggots theyre swarming around my shaft trying to eat their way inside at least i remembered to wear a condom this time i slap at my permanent erection knocking the majority of the maggots off but i can feel some of them scurrying across my nuts tickling my perineum headed for the nearest point of entry before i can brush the rest of them away i have maggots squirming up my ass i need a bidet i need a clorox douche i need a turkey baster and some gasoline on the bed the melter is picking larvae out of her pubic hair and asking me if i want to clean her carpet she smiles at me black saliva dripping from her lipless mouth she says if i do shell suck the maggots out of my asshole i tell her to get out and to take her infested pussy with her then i lock the cellar door grab a bottle of jack put on some barry manilow and try to figure out what im going to do now you spend your entire undeath working to cultivate a reputation for affordable highcaliber parasitefree sex and in one moment of misguided judgment you throw it all away if youve never had maggots crawling around inside your rectal cavity and feasting on your subcutaneous fat you probably wouldnt understand rural dead by bret hammond bret hammond is the coauthor of the book the complete idiots guide to geocaching and the publisher of geocacher university wwwgeocacherucom a website devoted to providing education and materials to both new and experienced geocachers this story is his first and only fiction published to date which originally appeared on the zombie website tales of the zombie war in addition to his interest in geocaching and zombies hes also a pastor and has published articles and cartoons in a variety of religious publications the amish are a christian community of swissgerman origin centered in pennsylvania perhaps bestknown in pop culture thanks to the harrison ford movie witness amish culture emphasizes hard work humility and family they dress simply largely forego modern technology notably automobiles and electrical appliances socialize mainly among themselves and work in trades such as farming construction and craftsmaking their main method of ensuring that members keep to amish ways is peer pressure known as shunning whether or not an individual is to be shunned is determined by the leadership and when someone is being shunned even their spouse may refuse to speak to them in severe cases of noncompliance a person may be expelled from the community though they are always welcome to return if they mend their ways many schisms have developed in amish communities over the years over what rules are to be followed and how severe shunning should be the supreme court case wisconsin v yoder established the precedent that amish are exempt from many american laws including those involving compulsory education amish children are not educated past eighth grade child labor and social security the amish are also extreme pacifists and once faced severe penalties and abuse for refusing to fight in americas wars our next story which is a bit more wholesome than the last one takes a look at how this unusual and closeknit community weathers a zombie apocalypse and what happens when extreme pacifism collides with extreme circumstances weve blocked off the reference room in the small community library for these interviews otto miller sits across the table from me his arms folded tightly against his chest he is an elder in this small amish community and looks every bit the part i ask him to state his name and he simply stares at me and then looks down at the digital recorder ive placed on the table he strokes his beard a couple times and then folds his arms again i can see were going to get nowhere with this i click the device off thats not enough i put it back down in my satchel and pull out a yellow legal tablet as i click my pen he begins to speak i have nothing against you english nor your devices but you have to understand us we dont cling to your machines we dont participate in your ways we dont ask anything of you but you and yourthingsyour waysthey are constantly thrust upon us even your plague he points his finger squarely at me ive heard of righteous indignation but i think this is the first time ive ever seen it i read your newspapers listen to your broadcasts you think this plague was the hand of god wouldnt that be convenient if all this were simply the divine pouring out judgment and wrath upon the world no this was your own doing youyou englishyou played with the natural order of things and this was the result like breeding your livestock in one family line sooner or later the results will haunt you they haunt all of us im eager to get the interview on track why dont we back up a bit mr miller when was it the infection first touched your community otto miller looks out the window for a moment and gathers his thoughts you are from the city yes i smile yes new york my home is very far removed from what you have around here you might think that were completely isolated from the rest of the world but its not true thats not our way separate but not isolated we are not yoked to the world the way you are so we were aware of the sickness the african rabies as they called it we read the reports in the newspapers listened to the radio and even watched the news on the television in the store in town as more and more truth came out about what the disease truly was we werecautious but it seemed as far removed from us aswellas new york city it was in march after that first winter it was a hard winter and i suppose if it hadnt been we would have seen them sooner and maybe been able to prepare ourselves better i was up at am preparing for my morning chores i was walking into the milking barn when i heard an odd sound in the pasture i raised my lantern and thats when i saw my firstplague victim in life he had been jonas yoder a mennonite from up the road jonas was a good man i had known him all my life there he stood in my pasture mouth open moaning and what must have been a pitchfork wound through his chest elder miller looks deep into my eyes to the point of discomfort i suppose something you need to understand being from the city is that the first victims we ever saw were our friends and neighbors people we had known our whole lives ive read your survival guides with faceless pictures of the undead these were faces we had known and welcomed into our homes for years you need to understand that to understand us i nod and he continues it was still an hour or so from daylight so i was very aware of the need to get back inside i wasnt sure how jonas got into my pasture but i felt sure he couldnt get back out on the side closest to my home i went back inside locked the door and waited for sunup with my wife sunrise brought a horrifying sight jonas wasnt alone there was rebecca his wife further out in the pasture i noticed members of the king family the beilers and a few people from townsome of them familiar others not i also saw the gaping hole in my fence on the side closest to the road thats how they had gotten in even worse they had gotten into the barn through some loose planks i had intended to fix in the spring they were in the stalls with my work animals the sounds were awful i could hear my horses crying out as their flesh was torn the sound drew the undead into the barn to feed by the time my son arrived there must have been over thirty of them in the barn so what did you and your son do i ask otto miller chuckles we simply did what needed to be done we fixed the fence i laugh with him here was a man who faced the worst disaster in history with the simple truth he had learned all his lifeif theres a hole in the fence you have to fix it the world was going to hell but the amish remained unchanged we knew enough not to get close we knew about the danger of the bites but they were in the barn so my son amos locked them in and we went to work fixing the fence we couldnt afford to have any more on our land so we strengthened the fence added braces and chicken wire so at this time it was just you your wife and your son he had brought his wife and two children with him after we fixed the fence he went out to the neighbors and brought back everyone he could find and convince to come we are blessed with a large home that was often used as a meeting place by the end of the day there were sixteen of us we were able to bring a few more of our fellowship in over the next week or so we grew to thirtythree members in our home that seems like a lot of people to house let alone feed mr miller straightened in his chair if i didnt know of the humility of these people i would have thought there was a touch of pride in his response to be amish is to know how to provide for your family and those you are in covenant witheven in the most difficult times that is simply our way your infection simply allowed us to do for one another what we had always prepared to do canned goods were brought from other homes there were still chickens in the coop so we had eggs and the occasional fowl we had to keep the birds inside the coop most of the time though their movement attracted too much attention from the infected andwe fearedwould attract attention from survivors as well you saw other survivors from outside your community occasionally it is very difficult to know the intentions of those outside of the fellowship we did our best to remain out of sightas we always hadbut occasionally they would come to the house looking for help or refuge did they get any we wouldnt turn them away empty english that wouldnt be christian but we would give them some food some water and send them on their way a cup of cold water in jesus name is what the scripture commands they received that and more however we were very aware that our supplies were limited it was just gardening season and while we could grow plenty for ourselves it would be some time before we could harvest and we had no idea how long the ordeal would last we knew it was best to not attract attention to ourselves it was then that we realized we could use the infected to our advantage just like with our livestock we would release them from the barn every morning and let them into the pasture the sight of them was enough to keep the curious away so you would let them out of the barn by day what about at night otto miller looks at me like his next answer was the most logical and obvious we would herd them back into the barn we had always done it with our livestock it just seemed natural to do it with the undead also we were uncomfortable with the idea of them roaming at night ive interviewed survivors all over the world no one else ever reported herding the zombies how did you herding is something weve done all our lives we were able to modify the cattle chutes that we had used to guide livestock into wagons for market we would walk in front of them guiding them to the barn and then use a rope ladder to get ourselves into the hayloft and back out of the barn it seems time to ask the question that ive been waiting for the question that makes the survival story of this old order amish community so unique so was that when you came upon the idea tomake use of them as spring wore on and summer was coming we became aware that we might be in for a long stay the infected had killed my workhorses and while we wouldnt need as many crops a few acres of corn and wheat would go a long way towards providing for us over the coming winter abraham schrock was with us and he was an exceptionally skilled woodworker one night as the women were putting the children to bed he showed me his plans for a new type of yoke he estimated it would take eight of the infected to pull a plow and we would have to learn how to direct them but it seemed possible he had brought his woodworking tools and within a few days we were ready to test the new yoke out mr miller catches my laughter i shake my head and comment you actually farmed with zombies his glare narrows at me what would you have me do these were infected people who i had known all my life its not in our way to remove the head as your news reporters so eloquently put it the word of god tells us if any would not work neither should he eat well they had already eaten my livestock it was time for them to work we are silent for a moment i use the time to collect my thoughts and clarify my notes finally i break the silence so how well did itwork better than you might think it took two men with ropes to hold them straight from the sides one man to guide the plow from behind and one or two of the little ones in front toencourage them little ones i ask the children we found that they made good lures for the infectedlike dangling a carrot in front of an old mule yes our children work they do their share they are strong and capable and never were in any real dangerno more danger than being trampled by a horse and we have known too many of those losses over the years at any rate the crops were in the ground it would be a late harvest but there was still plenty of time that winter there would be grain for flour bread for the table warmth in the home it sounds almost ideal youre an amazing group to have survived so well we know it was the lords blessing in fact that fall we decided to hold a feasta harvest festival we prepared food from our crops killed a few of the chickens and gave thanks i remember it was the sabbathsunday we do not work on the sabbath so the infected were kept in the barn all day i suppose thats why they came they didnt see the infected and the children were playing in the yard under the trees the adults were inside on the porch talking when my grandson brought the men to us he shakes his head and looks down they were scavengers vile men who were simply moving from town to town taking what they wanted killing raping here they had comeon our sabbath on our day of thanksgiving they had guns they walked into my home and ordered us to the center of the sitting room there were only five of them butits not our way to fight and with the women and children there it would have beenimproper they needed to see that our faith was strong that our ways were steadfast i spoke up and told them what i had told the other visitors over the months we had food and would share and could provide them with water and even directions but they could not stay they merely laughed one of them spoke up i supposed he was their leader from his swagger and his large gun i suspect he was used to others kowtowing to him he said well im sorry oldtimer but thats just not going to work for us you see were going to stay for as long as we want and take what we want those words were emphasized with a glance towards my daughterinlaw i saw amos bristle and step forward i raised my palm to him and he backed downas he should have the outsiders just laughed one of the other men must have realized that amos was her husband he pushed him with the butt of his rifle and amospoor amosalways with the temper he swung a fist at the man the blow connected and he knocked him to the floor that was when the leader stepped forwardput his gun to the side of amos head and pulled the trigger mr miller stops and lowers his head he removes his glasses and wipes his eyes all the while in silence i know enough to realize its their way in prayer i know better than to break the silence he sighs my son was gone all those months among those undead what some consider monsters and yet here these uninfected had brought the worst plague upon my home my wife was in tears holding our son his wife in tears beside her my grandchildren simply looking onfrozen in the moment im sorry i offer knowing my words mean nothing you have my sympathy i think it was then he continued that those men began to speculate on whether or not this would be as easy as they had thought one of them said we dont need this trouble theres too many of them itd be a waste of ammo lets just take what we need and get out of here that must have sounded agreeable to their leader he shook his head and looked back at me were going to need food all we can carry the women will pack it for you i told him glancing over at katie schrock she nodded and went to the kitchen to prepare the bags for them the man tapped me on the chest with the barrel of his gun youre amish so i dont suppose you have a car but you must have horses around here somewhere were going to need transportation i tried to tell him the horses were gone but he didnt believe me in earnest i didnt want to delay his leaving us so i didnt offer much more of an explanation finally he raised his weapon at my daughterinlaw and tapped the barrel against her head with each word wherearetheanimals i looked him in the eyejust as im looking at you now english and i told him quite simply theyre in the barn the words just hang there and we sit in silence as i let the full weight of them press down on me i cannot help but think of the scavengers as they walked out to the barn and wonder what images of riding off into the sunset filled their minds otto miller stands and takes his hat in hand he nods a goodbye my way and walks out of the room i surmise that in his mind the interview is over he has told his story the rest is actually common knowledge in the area told in hushed tones by the outsiders mr miller led his scavengers to the barn held the door for them as they walked in closed it behind them and braced it muffled screams were heard and one or two shots were fired the next spring he added three new members to his plowing team otto miller is a simple amish man his plain homemade clothes identical to those worn by his father and grandfather his life as it always has been revolving around his family his fields and his faith whatever else he has done is between him and his god and certainly not open to the speculation of an outsider the summer place by bob fingerman bob fingerman is the author of several works of zombie mayhem including the recent novel pariah and the graphic novels zombie world winters dregs and recess pieces which has been described as the little rascals meets dawn of the dead other recent works include an illustrated novella called connective tissue and the postapocalyptic speculative memoir from the ashes his first novel was bottomfeeder and other graphic novel workfor which fingerman also provided the artincludes beg the question you deserved it and minimum wage fingerman has also provided art for periodicals such as heavy metal and the village voice and did covers for dark horse and vertigo comics fire island just off the southern coast of long island is a bit of a mysteryno one really knows how it got its name historian richard bayles has proposed that the name resulted from a confused understanding of the dutch term for five islands as there are a number of small islands in the vicinity other stories suggest that the name comes from the fires built by pirates to lure passing ships onto the sandbars or from the islands rich autumn foliage or even from the rashes caused by the poison ivy that grows there our next story as you might have guessed takes place on fire island my wife and i used to rent a summerhouse on fire island and it struck me what a great setting for a horror story it would be during the offseason fingerman says come october its pretty desolate and there are no cars its a weird place like a sandstrewn version of the village from the old series the prisoner fingerman never was a bike messenger like the protagonist but as with much of his work elements of autobiography found their way into the protagonists personality one way theyre alike is that they both have some sympathy for zombies they didnt ask to be what they are and even though they want to eat humans theres no malice he says theyre the average schmuck of the monster world i can relate im looking at the red ring of fresh shiny tooth marks on my right palm some highlighted by small dots of blood not a lot of blood in fact quite little but enough to have me concerned its times like this i get nostalgic for tetanus remember tetanus when you were a kid and youd go tearing around a vacant lot some future construction site or some such and youd catch your tender young dermis on a rusty nail tetanus adults had warned you youd get visions of lockjaw and freak out the grownups had cautioned you that infection with tetanus would cause severe muscle spasms and that those would lead to locking of the jaw so you couldnt open your mouth or swallow it could maybe even lead to death by suffocation tetanus ah the good old days tetanus is not transmitted from person to person i wish i could say the same for this current unnamed affliction that part also sucks i dont even know what to call this the scientists and doctors hadnt come to a consensus by the time the broadcasts had ceased so whats the official classification whats the name i never understood the concept of naming a disease after yourself just because you discovered it why would you want your name associated with pain and suffering evermore what was parkinson thinking if i was a doctor and i chanced upon some terrible malady id name it after someone awfulhitlers syndrome or bushs complex at any rate what would you call this latestand likely finalpathosis zombification sounds kind of stupid and if its brewing if youre infected but zombification hasnt blossomed into fullblown zombiehood what then what do you call its period of gestation im not man enough to go all bruce campbell on myself and lop off the offending extremity not yet but why bother its in there doing its thing circulating i guess i remember hearing about this guy who was bitten on the ankle by some totally poisonous snakein south america i think it was anyway he knew he had about three minutes before the poison killed him the guy was a lumberjack or somethingmaybe he was decimating the rain forest maybe the snake was protecting its turf i cant remember that kind of detail but he acted decisively and took his chainsaw to his leg and cut it off at the knee and he lived the guy lived he cut it off before the poison could reach his heart i couldnt do that i cant so im agoner why should i be any different still i feel so stupid i bandage the bite more for the psychological comfort it provides i just dont want to keep staring at it still there goes my sex life not being one for ambidexterity i step out onto the porch and look down at the asphalt walkway id call it a road but no cars were permitted here sure the occasional emergency vehicle was allowedthey didnt call it fire island for nothingbut no civilian automobiles during the summer just a few short endless months ago this road was teeming with the pasty and the tan the fit and the flabby all making their circuits to and from the beach most of the guys toting coolers and cases full of cheap lowoctane suds i never saw anyone with food all of these beachgoers the rare quiet ones and the common boisterous types seemed to sustain themselves purely on beer and greasy wedges from the local pizzeria id kill for one of those mediocre slices right now the walkway is mostly obscured by slushy sandjust patches of buried blackness showing through here and there i used to sit on this porch readingor at least pretending to readand scoping the hotties right before the current ultimate nameless pandemic came and ruined everything the girls gone wild epidemic had swept the nation formerly normal girls ones with a modicum of propriety would suddenly whip off their tops and bounce up and down all it took to loosen them up was massive quantities of alcohol a bit of flattery and the materialization of a video camera how many parents cried themselves to sleep at night because of those dvds guys with oversized dean martin fishbowl snifters of frozen margarita would chant as these local girls made bad would frown then giggle then comply and let their boobs out to neanderthal choruses of whoowhoowhoo maybe that was a portent of the looming bestial decline of mankind nah but its amazing how fast a sexy girl can become an abject object all desirability drained away in mere moments i dont know i thought coming back to fire island would be a good idea isolated especially in the offseason i liked the whole no cars thing back in the city when it was really beginning to get soupy the maniacs in their cars were more dangerous than the zombies the roads were choked with panicky motorists attempting to flee causing all kinds of mayhem along the way what did they expect light traffic idiots of course all the roads were clogged and every poor pedestrian schmuck one of these amateur dale earnhardts nailed would rise as one of the undead brilliant broken dolls peeling themselves off the pavement to wreak havoc on the ones who struck them down or whoever was convenient i used to be a bike courier right after that movie quicksilver came outbut not because of that movie never let it be said i was influenced to take a job because of a movie remember that thing kevin bacon as a hotshot bike messenger for the like five minutes hollywood was convinced such a lameass job was cool all those dumb movies about urban iconoclasts anyone for turk anyway even after i moved on from that gig i remained an avid cyclist my legs conditioned for endurance i avoided the main arteries and biked all the way from elmhurst to bayshore long island which is a pretty long haul i dont know how many milesmy odometer fell off somewhere along the waybut a lot especially when you consider the meandering back road nature of the trek none of that as the crow flies convenience en route i could see things worsening citywide the zombies increasing their numbers at a dizzying pace be fruitful and multiply i thought ever the heretic even taking this shunpike route i avoided many a close call and witnessed many horrific sights amazing how many variations on the themes of evisceration and dismemberment there are i splashed through more than a few puddles and im not talking water having learned the hard way how to avoid hitting pedestrians getting doored in traffic and other hazards of the bike couriers trade i managed to eschew ensnarement by the hungry undead at least the zombies are slow and cant ride bikes or drive cars yet when i got to the marinaactually that sounds a bit grand the wharf the dock whateverwhere the ferries left for the island i realized there wasnt exactly going to be regular service what was i thinking panic doesnt make for cogent planning but youd think on that interminable bike ride id have flashed on the notion that maybe ferry service to the island was terminated oddly the ferries were still docked empty no one was around which was rather eerie not a creature was stirring not even a zombie forgive me but christmas is coming call me sentimental anyway i boarded one and got as far as the bridge before i realized i had no idea how to pilot such a craft i dont even know how to drive a car and i had the brass to think those anxious drivers idiotic here i was way out in long island not my bailiwick with no plan and nowhere to go i was exhausted too i walked over to the vending machine to score a refreshing beverage id earned that the machine was dead not accepting currency paper or coin i kicked the machine shook it then basically beat the hell out of it i needed to vent as it lay on its side its front came undone and it spilled its innards in a cacophony of tinnyor would that be aluminumyclanks i chugged three cans in a row of ocean spray cranberry cocktail and felt better i then stuffed a bunch in my backpack and as i was about to check the grounds for more comestibles i spotted some interested parties dotting the periphery not human the ruckus id made was the clarion the dinner gong i might as well have shouted come and get it while tinkling a comical outsized triangle if id entertained even fleeting hope that these callers were reglar folks their herkyjerky locomotion quashed it in a trice i gathered up a few more cansdelicious refreshment could double as solid projectile if need beand mounted my bike but i wasnt sure where to go i made a few quick figure eights around the parking lot then made for the private boats many of those were missing but a shoddylooking motorboat was moored to the jetty i stepped down into it and when i didnt go straight through the bottom decided id be a seafaring boatnik after all i grabbed my bike and loaded it into the dingy little dinghy then tested the motor a few yanks on the cord and it sputtered to life just as the lifeless approached mazel tov id never steered a boat of any size before but for a firsttimer i didnt do too badly i managed to follow the basic course id remembered from all our trips on the ferry and within oh maybe two hours or so i made it to ocean bay park the dinky community wed rented in we i remember the concept of we we was pretty sweet i was part of a we i had a wife but guess what she became one of those things right at the onset on her way home from work she got bit well more than bit consumed i got a call from a cop who kept pausing to vomit noisily on his end of the line he vomited i wept then she came back and tore into the officer or at least i think thats what was going on it sounded crunchy and wet he kept screaming until well until he stopped it was a really moist call im being flippant but sue me its all i have left if im not flip about losing her i might just anyway i might just what kill myself thats a laugh all i know is i heard her moaning before i got disconnectedmoaning and chewing i got the picture even without the benefit of a camera phone so after ramming into the side of the dockstarting it up i could work out stopping not so muchi got out of the boat dizzy and nauseous i lay there for a while gasping trying not to hurl i must have looked like a fish out of water it was midoctober still not too bad temperaturewise but drizzling a good alternative name for fire island would be rust island back in the day people would ride their bikes all over but always these ratty rustspeckled wrecks and here i was with my almost topoftheline mountain bike like it mattered but at the moment i felt annoyed that my precious bicycle was going to be ruined by the elements priorities young man priorities fog was rolling in obscuring everything if there were zombies afoot i wouldnt see them comingor hear them i hastened my pedaling and raced to our house i say our but really it was just a rental and now that i was no longer part of a we our seemed moot too i approached the dwelling that was little more than a shack and slowed as i heard footfalls not human deer fire island is rotten with these skanky tickencrusted deer theyre not beautiful cute or charming theyre the animal kingdoms answer to skid row vagrants dirty infested with chiggers and lice and all manner of parasites their ears look like warty gourds festooned with ticks so engorged they look fit to burst these deer root around the trash knock over garbage cans mooch for scraps when youre eating outside wheres ted nugent when you need him i got inside locked the door checked all the windows and then collapsed onto the naked mattress and into a nightmarerich slumber assuming the island to be pretty much deserted i was almost right the next morning i checked the pantry though why i cant say at the end of the season we cleared out all our edibles so i kind of knew it would be empty which it was i guess it was wishful thinking maybe cupboard elves had left something to gnaw on whatever what else is life but hope what would propel us forward but the inborn combination of hope and masochism after hydrating myself with tap water i snatched up a blackened iron frying pan cracked the front door and took a gander still drizzling but the coast was clear i tiptoed down the short flight of creaky wooden steps to the dirt path and stepped onto the sandy asphalt sandy asphalt sounds like the name of a thirdstring stripper of yore i digress to my left was the beach followed by the ocean a mere hundred or so feet away to my right the ferry dock and the bay the islands about thirty miles long and at its most expansive only about threequarters of a mile wide just a long strip of sand i mounted my bike and baybound made for the general store a weathered gray clapboard number that had overcharged for everything ocean bay parkwhat in its heyday id referred to as lunkhead centralwas silent apart from the patter of rain granted even before this apocalyptic turn of events offseason would have been pretty calm but this was different the stores screen door hung open not swaying on its corroded hinges even a rusty creak would have been reassuring the silence was unnerving unnatural i jiggled the doorknob locked a swing of the frying pan through the window later i was inside stuffing my face like a little piggy with beef jerky chips and lukewarm pepsi i filled my pockets with snacks and potables and hit the road in search of i dont know what other survivors more food a gun yeah all of the above inland such as youd call it the roads were much clearer so biking was easy the fog was burning off so visibility wasnt bad i cut through seaview and approached the largerin relative termstown of ocean beach relishing the pleasure of riding my bike where the town ordinance had been no bicycles allowed the jolly scofflaw in a world where law is passé fun i did a couple of laps around the center of town checking out the spoils general store hardware store a couple of shops devoted to souvenirs and beachwear a disco some eateries bars and ice cream parlors and the old movie theater a wooden structure id avoided something churchlike in its mien that had kept me away i broke into the hardware storefunny how natural looting becomesand selected a few lethal objects a small wieldy ax a volt batteryoperated nail gun and plenty of ammo namely nails i also grabbed a heavy jacket and rain slicker that were hung on a peg behind the counter what can i say i packed light and forgot a few things after knocking on doors and shouting is anyone there till my throat was raw i rode back to the crib and charged the nail gun it would have to do until i found a real gun if i found one that is at least the power was still on as i ate a dinner of processed foodstuffs i heard a noise outside the indicator light on the battery charger was still flashing so i grabbed the ax and snuck up to the front door even with the porch light on i couldnt see anything i heard the noise again something was moving out there had my light attracted it likely i pulled on the heavy jacket and opened the door a hair casting a focused beam from my flashlight into the hazy darkness this fog was getting tiresome the crunch of underbrush drew my attention and straight ahead was a ratty stag one antler broken and dangling the other an elaborate sixpointer listen to me trying to sound like the great outdoorsman the deer on fire island were a protected species they were completely unafraid of humans so certain were they that theyd remain unharmed like city squirrels it was a little early in the season for this buck to be shedding its antlers maybe it had gotten caught on something or been in a fight over a doe satisfied it wasnt a zombie i closed the door and resumed my repast savoring each salty morsel of dry beef and chips amazing how salty american snack foods are stomach full of delicious garbage i fell asleep easily legs sore from all the abuse id heaped on them over the course of the next few days my notion of retreating to fire island proved both a prescient blessing and shortsighted curse it was indeed quite empty but too empty i was hoping to find some other refugees from the world a young or even not so young widow a couple with the swinger ethos maybe just a guy to hang with i rode southwest through robbins rest atlantique the aptly named lonelyville dunewood fair harbor saltaire and kismet i stopped there because i didnt want to get too close to the robert moses causeway the bridge linking the island with the mainlandor at least long island proper i was afraid that where there were cars there might be problems zombies and people in quantity i felt like charlton heston in the omega man vincent price in the last man on earth both mediocre adaptations of mathesons i am legend oddly the one that felt the least like the book was the one that used the actual title go figure anyway tooling around like a tool on my tenspeed i was nobodys legend thats for sure as a boy id been pretty selfsufficient at least in terms of my ability to have fun alone often id play games like i was the last person on the planet id deliberately choose routes to and fro bereft of people id walk beside the tracks of the long island railroad or along the traffic islands down the median of queens boulevard sure thered be cars whipping by but for miles i could walk without encountering another person in the flesh my dad accused me of having a morbid fascination i liked horror movies too much now looking back i reckon it was all a rehearsal for what was coming look at me the nostradamus kid the loneliness was eroding me from within i tried heading in the other direction which proved tricky point o woods was fenced off from ocean bay parkno doubt to keep out the riffraff of which in its day obp had been densely populated unable to negotiate my bike over or around the fence i climbed over and made the rest of my slog on foot id never explored any of the other parts of the island back when it was alive sunken forest was just that pretty but creepy like everyplace else sailors haven wasnt the super gay cherry grove was a bust hell not that id have made a lifestyle change but i craved camaraderie and so long as it was platonic i was up for anything anyone but there was nothing no one i was so tired and dispirited i didnt bother schlepping to the pines and points beyond this was a ghost island and i suppose as crushing as that fact was ghosts were less harmful than zombiesat least physically id managed to evade being literally consumed only to end up consumed by crippling melancholy this was living there was no television not even a test pattern radio was fine if you enjoyed static i embarked on a housetohouse search for reading matter i needed something with which to keep my mind occupied crossword puzzles a game boy anything the problem with summer rentals is that people dont leave stuff yearround sure i found some romance paperbackswhich i read i hate to saybut nothing edifying i found a cache of technothrillers you know tom clancy garbage i read those too but stultifying doesnt begin to describe them the bodicerippers were better i was in and out of almost every house between obp and robbins rest before it dawned on me that i didnt have to stay in my trifling little shack what the hell is wrong with me seriously i had the run of the land and i spent my first three weeks in that drafty dive what a goon i took up residence in a sturdy and significantly more comfortable fivebedroom ranchstyle number the little pig had wised up and abandoned his straw hut for the brick palace there was even a stash of porn in the master bedroom id found my roost with the power still on i kept my drinks cold there was booze and though id always been pretty much a teetotaler i began indulging im not saying i became a drunkard but every night after sashaying around my new demesne i took the edge off and if that sometimes meant ending the night flat on my back the room spinning like dorothys house on its way to oz so be it sobriety had lost its charm on a ride back from the market in ocean beach my front tire blew and i wiped out spilling ass over tit into a shallow ditch opposite the ball field maybe i was a little hung over its possible not being a seasoned inebriate i was still defining my limits for the first time in weeks the sky was cloudless and the sun was blinding even before the tumble my head ached now it throbbed my palms were scraped raw and my vision was impaired even behind dark glasses i squinted against the glare sprawled in the dirt angry and even though there were no witnesses to my slapstick embarrassed but there was a witness hiding behind a water fountain near the bleachers was a zombie how could we have missed each other this whole time i scrabbled to my feet groping for whatever weapon i could find but in my pieeyed complacency id left them all back at the ranch all i could manage was my tire pump which was pretty impotent the thing is the zombie just cowered there maintaining its position still wobbly from the fall and residual spirits i stumbled backwards against a stapleriddled lamppost gauzy remnants of weatherbeaten notices for past community events clinging like scabs to the splintery surface we stared at each other for what felt like eternity neither of us doing anything i began to wonder if this was a zombie or just a hallucination maybe the spill had given me a concussion but it wasnt my vision cleared yet the zombie remained staying put not attacking hello i asked feeling stupid for doing so can i help you it recoiled at the sound of my voice the zombie was female and had been fairly young when she was alivemaybe a teenager or slightly older judging by its apparel more than anything else id never gotten to study one up close most of the ones id seen a blur as id whizzed by them in transit her facial epidermis was taut not slack as id pictured it in my mind and the color of raw chicken skin only the yellow wasnt quite so robust her deepset eyes were filmy and lacked focusin my present condition i could relateyet her gaze never drifted from me her mouth hung slack her breath slow and wheezy two things struck me one she was breathing and two her teeth were toothpaste commercial white in the movies zombies are always snaggletoothed their enamel grossly discolored this undead chick had a movie star grill she also seemed impervious to cold considering her bare feet and midriff lowrider relaxedfit jeans and thin tank top i could see a pink bra under her lowcut white top she had cleavage was i appraising this animated corpses sexual attributes yes yes i was i was wondering if sex with a zombie constituted necrophilia who could say the definition of necrophilia is an obsession with and usually erotic interest in or stimulation by corpses but what of ambulatory corpses what then though her body skin was a bit looserelaxedfit skinshe was well preserved was it loneliness or madness that motivated these thoughts not to mention a surge of blood into my groin both uh hello can you uh you know uh understand me she cocked her head like a dog her brow creased in concentration it was almost adorable in a sick macabre kind of way against my better judgment i took a step in her direction and she flinched then began to back away i took this as a sign to curtail this insanity and make tracks i righted my bike and walked it home looking over my shoulder at my hesitant new companion who did likewise i didnt drink that night but i must have jerked off a halfdozen times maybe thats too much information the next day i replaced the inner tube grabbed my nail gun and hit the road the weather had turned much colder over night and the gray misty gloom had rolled back in as i pedaled it began to drizzle soon snow would come i considered gathering wood for the fireplace but was focused on finding the zombie girl again i tried the ball field of course but shed vacated the area still i thought slow moving as they seem to be how far could she have gotten was she a local did she retain knowledge of her surroundings was she capable of anything beyond rudimentary mentation or even that as i approached lonelyville two does broke through the brush and blocked my path they looked unwell to put it mildly even by fire island standards their fur was patchy the bald spots scabby and oozing tumid ticks as per usual enshrouded their ears in the rain they steamed the smell was not good i slowed hoping theyd clear the way but they just stood there looking unsure what to do next i didnt have some fruity little bell to ring at them so i braked and shouted hey clear the road go on beat it scram i made those nasty noises through my teeth that shoo cats away but no dice they tottered looking drunk i felt a flash of envy then yelled at them a few more times but the filthy beasts were unyielding i didnt feel up to a hassle with nature so i made a uturn and wended my way back home zigzagging the streets up and down looking for youknowwho to no avail that afternoon i emptied a bottle of vodka polished it off with a variety of mixers then disgorged the contents of my stomach into the kitchen sink thank goodness for the garbage disposal i managed to clean up before passing out on the linoleum floor flashes of days of wine and roses and lost weekend flickered behind my throbbing eyelids when i awoke it was the middle of the night and i was disoriented as hell at first i thought id shrunkthe incredible shrinking souse or honey i shrunk the drunk to keep up with the movie theme of this bendermy sightline being that of a man whose face is stuck to the floor i literally peeled myself from the sticky surface rubbing my face which had been imprinted with the texture of the linoleum i felt like crap but upon seeing my patternscarred punim in the mirror began to laugh until the choking curtailed my mirth symmetrical red striations etched the right side of my face what a boob i stumbled into the bathroom urinated painfully then gargled away the sour boozevomit aftertaste it hadnt been that long why was i falling apart like this could it be something to do with the death of humankind especially my family and most of all my precious wife could it be because i was pining for the company of a female zombie i thought was passably attractive yeah maybe that justified this rotten uncharacteristic behavior there have been worse rationales for hitting the sauce i managed to get to the bed before surrendering to dormancy again i dreamt of a threesome with my late wife and the undead girl both stripped me naked and led me to a bed in the middle of the baseball diamond the sky was black not nighttime dark but black a void eyes glowed from the bleachers accompanied by a chorus of chirping crickets the two women began to run their tongues up and down my body my wife working my upper portion the living dead girl south of the waistline the thing is both of them were in that zombified state but it was blissfuluntil they started devouring me i didnt wake up i just lay on my back watching them consume my flesh opening my abdomen and pulling out my innards i was paralyzed they looked so contented i woke up andgoddamn if im not king of mount perverse i had an erection in spite of my hangover i managed to eat and keep down a reasonably healthy breakfast determined to find the girl i dont like being haunted but she was doing just that what would i do when i found her would she still shrink away or would the native hunger zombies seem to havehey im no expertpresent itself if so would i flee or just let it happen this whole survivejustforthesakeofsurvival thing isnt that great its only been weeks and already my joie de vivre is pretty well kaput i mounted up and hit the dustywell moist actuallytrail the mist was icy and i had to keep my eyes squinted tight to prevent ocular abrasion but i was resolute i would find this zombie girl and either court her or exterminate her depending on her receptivity to my companionship maybe she just wanted a tuna sandwich maybe this human flesh eating was just a phase again im no expert maybe she needed a hug i know i did id just like to spoon again be in bed and feel the small of a womans back against my stomach my crotch nestled against her tush as i pedaled i felt more and more conflicted about this loopy notion of bedding down a zombie and it wasnt even a sex thing at the moment i just wanted to snuggle what man just wants a cuddle a crazy lonely one thats what calling out would be a nono she being the shy type so i just kept my eyes peeled and pedaled slow i skipped point o woods and beyond i just couldnt envisage the zombie girl lofting herself over the high chainlink fence so blockbyblock i explored seaview pausing only to pick up a few provisions including a visit to the liquor store in each town i dismounted and checked the nearby beach nothing well nothing but skanky deer at each encounter i mused it was a good thing for them i wasnt fond of venison yeah the first frost came in early december maybe my zombie heartthrob had succumbed to the elements or starvation or decomposition i had no idea how long an undead individual lasted with or without sustenance how often did they eat could they subsist on grubs and squirrels i hated not knowing i hated that i couldnt log onto the internet and google zombie feeding habits lifespan i needed to ask jeeves but couldnt like everything else the net was down i never realized how addicted i was to outlets of mass communication i missed tv radio and the web as much as i missed human contact sick books and backdated magazines were not cutting the mustard no sir my nights were a debauched stag party for one the time split between drinking to excess and masturbating when i could manage it it was while walking my bike through that town whose name i loved so well lonelyville that i stumbled uponliterallythe undead object of my desire but now she was just plain old dead dead her stiff supine body glistening with ice crystals i knelt down beside her and stared my grief indescribable her tank top had disappeared and her bra was torn one cup shredded revealing a pale translucent yellow breast her face was angelic at least it was to me at that moment and i felt shame for having fostered lust for this creature not because it was unnaturalyou can debate that all you wantbut because she looked above such secular desires tears began streaming down my cheeks but i didnt wipe them away i felt more loss here for this stranger than i had for my own wife maybe because my wifes demise was in the abstract i hadnt been there for it id also been in a blind panic like everyone else now in this tranquil wintry setting i had the luxury of time to grieve i let it all out for this strangely captivating zombie girl for my wife for all of humanity i bawled and right there in the road lay on my side and spooned her my body shaking not from the cold but from previously unimaginable loss and as we lay there a grizzled stag stepped onto the road staring at us its eyes black and unknowable steam pumped from its craterous nostrils and it grunted with bestial authority like we were trespassing we i so badly needed to be a part of we again does that make me codependent my vision blurred by anguish my mood black as pitch i glared at this fourlegged interloper it grunted again and scraped a hoof against the pavement the effrontery was too much it was this goddamned filthy animal that was trespassing on this scene of human loss i disengaged from the girls cadaverand thats all it was now just a plain old regular gardenvariety corpseand stood up my fists vibrating with barely contained mayhem i wanted to hurt this threadbare excuse for a deer its antlers cracked and collapsing its fur a mat of mud and grime and abrasions i stepped toward it and it shook its head back and forth its right antler threatening to drop off with each motion i hate you miserable bastards i hissed ive always hated the deer on this godforsaken island but now you you really put it in italics cant you see this is a private moment i know its beyond your feeble peanut brain to show any goddamn respect but so help me if you dont get the hell away from here ill bash your skull in it stood there steaming away in the sleet so i took a swing at it not the brightest thing ive ever done but i was a tad overwrought shall we say open handed i made to slap it right across the muzzle and it bit me and then it hit me why these deer looked so spectacularly putrid they were dead undead whatever they were animated corpses humans arent the only ones circling the drain its all life all of it so now im looking at the fresh white gauze wrapped around my right hand a ring of small red dots seeping through not a lot of blood in fact quite little but enough to have me concerned and back on that road lies the undead girl of my dreams i didnt bury her i guess im infected the wrong grave by kelly link kelly link is a short fiction specialist whose stories have been

wristlet her fiction has earned her an nea literature fellowship and won a variety of awards including the hugo nebula world fantasy stoker tiptree and locus awards this story is about a heartbroken young man who buries the only copies of some of his poems in the grave of a young woman he loves the preraphaelite poet and painter dante gabriel rossetti did exactly the same thing in real life after his wife elizabeth siddal who had modeled for many of his paintings died from an overdose of laudanum and as in this story rossetti later regretted his dramatic romantic gesture and had his wifes grave exhumed so that he could retrieve his poems which were then published in the preraphaelites were dedicated to restoring to art the classical values of pose color and composition which they felt had been denuded by the stuffy influence of art academies rossettis sister christina is also famous for her long poem goblin market which has influenced generations of fantasy authors in later years dante rossetti became obsessed with exotic animals especially wombatshe finally managed to acquire one which he would have join him for supper his parties were also enlivened by his pet toucan which he would dress in a cowboy hat and then have ride his llama around the dinner table pretty strange though at least when rossetti dug up his poetry he was confident that he had the right grave the protagonist in our next tale is not so fortunate and if you thought the life of dante gabriel rossetti was full of strangeness you aint seen nothing yet all of this happened because a boy i once knew named miles sperry decided to go into the resurrectionist business and dig up the grave of his girlfriend bethany baldwin who had been dead for not quite a year miles planned to do this in order to recover the sheaf of poems he had in what hed felt was a beautiful and romantic gesture put into her casket or possibly it had just been a really dumb thing to do he hadnt made copies miles had always been impulsive i think you should know that right up front hed tucked the poems handwritten tearstained and with crossouts under bethanys hands her fingers had felt like candles fat and waxy and pleasantly cool until you remembered that they were fingers and he couldnt help noticing that there was something wrong about her breasts they seemed larger if bethany had known that she was going to die would she have gone all the way with him one of his poems was about that about how now they never would how it was too late now carpe diem before you run out of diem bethanys eyes were closed someone had done that too just like theyd arranged her hands and even her smile looked composed in the wrong sense of the word miles wasnt sure how you made someone smile after they were dead bethany didnt look much like she had when shed been alive that had been only a few days ago now she seemed smaller and also oddly larger it was the nearest miles had ever been to a dead person and he stood there looking at bethany wishing two things that he was dead too and also that it had seemed appropriate to bring along his notebook and a pen he felt he should be taking notes after all this was the most significant thing that had ever happened to miles a great change was occurring within him moment by singular moment poets were supposed to be in the moment and also stand outside the moment looking in for example miles had never noticed before but bethanys ears were slightly lopsided one was smaller and slightly higher up not that he would have cared or written a poem about it or even mentioned it to her ever in case it made her selfconscious but it was a fact and now that hed noticed it he thought it might have driven him crazy not mentioning it he bent over and kissed bethanys forehead breathing in she smelled like a new car miless mind was full of poetic thoughts every cloud had a silver lining except there was probably a more interesting and meaningful way to say that and death wasnt really a cloud he thought about what it was more like an earthquake maybe or falling from a great height and smacking into the ground really hard which knocked the wind out of you and made it hard to sleep or wake up or eat or care about things like homework or whether there was anything good on tv and death was foggy too but also prickly so maybe instead of a cloud a fog made of little sharp things needles every death fog has a lot of silver needles did that make sense did it scan then the thought came to miles like the tolling of a large and leaden bell that bethany was dead this may sound strange but in my experience its strange and its also just how it works you wake up and you remember that the person you loved is dead and then you think really then you think how strange it is how you have to remind yourself that the person you loved is dead and even while youre thinking about that the thought comes to you again that the person you loved is dead and its the same stupid fog the same needles or mallet to the intestines or whatever worse thing you want to call it all over again but youll see for yourself someday miles stood there remembering until bethanys mother mrs baldwin came up beside him her eyes were dry but her hair was a mess shed only managed to put eye shadow on one eyelid she was wearing jeans and one of bethanys old tshirts not even one of bethanys favorite tshirts miles felt embarrassed for her and for bethany too whats that mrs baldwin said her voice sounded rusty and outlandish as if she were translating from some other language something indogermanic perhaps my poems poems i wrote for her miles said he felt very solemn this was a historic moment one day miless biographers would write about this three haikus a sestina and two villanelles some longer pieces no one else will ever read them mrs baldwin looked into miless face with her terrible dry eyes i see she said she said you were a lousy poet she put her hand down into the casket smoothed bethanys favorite dress the one with spider webs and several holes through which you could see bethanys itchy black tights she patted bethanys hands and said well goodbye old girl dont forget to send a postcard dont ask me what she meant by this sometimes bethanys mother said strange things she was a lapsed buddhist and a substitute math teacher once shed caught miles cheating on an algebra quiz relations between miles and mrs baldwin had not improved during the time that bethany and miles were dating and miles couldnt decide whether or not to believe her about bethany not liking his poetry substitute teachers had strange senses of humor when they had them at all he almost reached into the casket and took his poetry back but mrs baldwin would have thought that shed proved something that shed won not that this was a situation where anyone was going to win anything this was a funeral not a game show nobody was going to get to take bethany home mrs baldwin looked at miles and miles looked back bethany wasnt looking at anyone the two people that bethany had loved most in the world could see through that dull hateful fog what the other was thinking just for a minute and although you werent there and even if you had been you wouldnt have known what they were thinking anyway ill tell you i wish it had been me miles thought and mrs baldwin thought i wish it had been you too miles put his hands into the pockets of his new suit turned and left mrs baldwin standing there he went and sat next to his own mother who was trying very hard not to cry shed liked bethany everyone had liked bethany a few rows in front a girl named april lamb was picking her nose in some kind of frenzy of grief when they got to the cemetery there was another funeral service going on the burial of the girl who had been in the other car and the two groups of mourners glared at each other as they parked their cars and tried to figure out which grave site to gather around two florists had misspelled bethanys name on the ugly wreaths berthany and also bethony just like tribe members did when they were voting each other out on the television show survivor which had always been bethanys favorite thing about survivor bethany had been an excellent speller although the lutheran minister who was conducting the sermon didnt mention that miles had an uncomfortable feeling he became aware that he couldnt wait to get home and call bethany to tell her all about this about everything that had happened since shed died he sat and waited until the feeling wore off it was a feeling he was getting used to bethany had liked miles because he made her laugh he makes me laugh too miles figured that digging up bethanys grave even that would have made her laugh bethany had had a great laugh which went up and up like a clarinetist on an escalator it wasnt annoying it had been delightful if you liked that kind of laugh it would have made bethany laugh that miles googled grave digging in order to educate himself he read an edgar allan poe story he watched several relevant episodes of buffy the vampire slayer and he bought vicks vaporub which you were supposed to apply under your nose he bought equipment at target a special batteryoperated telescoping shovel a set of wire cutters a flashlight extra batteries for the shovel and flashlight and even a velcro headband with a headlamp that came with a special red lens filter so that you were less likely to be noticed miles printed out a map of the cemetery so that he could find his way to bethanys grave off weeping fish lane evenas an acquaintance of mine once remarkedin the dead of night when naught can be seen so pitch is the dark not that the dark would be very pitch miles had picked a night when the moon would be full the map was also just in case because hed seen movies where the dead rose from their graves you wanted to have all the exits marked in a situation like that he told his mother that he was spending the night at his friend johns house he told his friend john not to tell his mother anything if miles had googled poetry as well as digging up graves he would have discovered that his situation was not without precedent the poet and painter dante gabriel rossetti also buried his poetry with his dead lover rossetti too had regretted this gesture had eventually decided to dig up his lover to get back his poems im telling you this so that you never make the same mistake i cant tell you whether dante gabriel rossetti was a better poet than miles although rossetti had a sister christina rossetti who was really something but youre not interested in my views on poetry i know you better than that even if you dont know me youre waiting for me to get to the part about grave digging miles had a couple of friends and he thought about asking someone to come along on the expedition but no one except for bethany knew that miles wrote poetry and bethany had been dead for a while eleven months in fact which was one month longer than bethany had been miless girlfriend long enough that miles was beginning to make his way out of the fog and the needles long enough that he could listen to certain songs on the radio again long enough that sometimes there was something dreamlike about his memories of bethany as if shed been a movie that hed seen a long time ago late at night on television long enough that when he tried to reconstruct the poems hed written her especially the villanelle which had been in his opinion really quite good he couldnt it was as if when hed put those poems into the casket he hadnt just given bethany the only copies of some poems but had instead given away those shining perfect lines given them away so thoroughly that hed never be able to write them out again miles knew that bethany was dead there was nothing to do about that but the poetry was different you have to salvage what you can even if youre the one who buried it in the first place you might think at certain points in this story that im being hard on miles that im not sympathetic to his situation this isnt true im as fond of miles as i am of anyone else i dont think hes any stupider or any bit less special or remarkable thanfor exampleyou anyone might accidentally dig up the wrong grave its a mistake anyone could make the moon was full and the map was easy to read even without the aid of the flashlight the cemetery was full of cats dont ask me why miles was not afraid he was resolute the batteryoperated telescoping shovel at first refused to untelescope hed tested it in his own backyard but here in the cemetery it seemed unbearably loud it scared off the cats for a while but it didnt draw any unwelcome attention the cats came back miles set aside the moldering wreaths and bouquets and then he used his wire cutters to trace a rectangle he stuck the telescoping shovel under and pried up fat squares of sod above bethanys grave he stacked them up like carpet samples and got to work by two am miles had knotted a length of rope at short regular intervals for footholds and then looped it around a tree so hed be able to climb out of the grave again once hed retrieved his poetry he was waistdeep in the hole hed made the night was warm and he was sweating it was hard work directing the shovel every once in a while it telescoped while he was using it hed borrowed his mothers gardening gloves to keep from getting blisters but still his hands were getting tired the gloves were too big his arms ached by three thirty miles could no longer see out of the grave in any direction except up a large white cat came and peered down at miles grew bored and left again the moon moved over miless head like a spotlight he began to wield the shovel more carefully he didnt want to damage bethanys casket when the shovel struck something that was not dirt miles remembered that hed left the vicks vaporub on his bed at home he improvised with a cherry chapstick he found in his pocket now he used his gardengloved hands to dig and to smooth dirt away the bloody light emanating from his velcro headband picked out the ingenious telescoping ridges of the discarded shovel the little rocks and worms and wormlike roots that poked out of the dirt walls of miless excavation the smoother lid of bethanys casket miles realized he was standing on the lid perhaps he should have made the hole a bit wider it would be difficult to get the lid open while standing on it he needed to pee there was that as well when he came back he shone his flashlight into the grave it seemed to him that the lid of the coffin was slightly ajar was that possible had he damaged the hinges with the telescoping shovel or kicked the lid askew somehow when he was shimmying up the rope he essayed a slow judicious sniff but all he smelled was dirt and cherry chapstick he applied more cherry chapstick then he lowered himself down into the grave the lid wobbled when he tested it with his feet he decided that if he kept hold of the rope and slid his foot down and under the lid like so then perhaps he could cantilever the lid up it was very strange it felt as if something had hold of his foot he tried to tug it free but no his foot was stuck caught in some kind of vise or grip he lowered the toe of his other hiking boot down into the black gap between the coffin and its lid and tentatively poked it forward but this produced no result hed have to let go of the rope and lift the lid with his hands balance like so carefully carefully on the thin rim of the casket figure out how he was caught it was hard work balancing and lifting at the same time although the one foot was still firmly wedged in its accidental toehold miles became aware of his own breathing the furtive scuffling noise of his other boot against the coffin lid even the red beam of his lamp as it pitched and swung back and forth up and down in the narrow space seemed unutterably noisy shit shit shit miles whispered it was either that or else scream he got his fingers under the lid of the coffin on either side of his feet and bent his wobbly knees so he wouldnt hurt his back lifting something touched the fingers of his right hand no his fingers had touched something dont be ridiculous miles he yanked the lid up as fast and hard as he could the way you would rip off a bandage if you suspected there were baby spiders hatching under it shit shit shit shit shit he yanked and someone else pushed the lid shot up and fell back against the opposite embankment of dirt the dead girl who had hold of miless boot let go this was the first of the many unexpected and unpleasant shocks that miles was to endure for the sake of poetry the second was the sickeningno shockingshock that he had dug up the wrong grave the wrong dead girl the wrong dead girl was lying there smiling up at him and her eyes were open she was several years older than bethany she was taller and had a significantly more developed rack she even had a tattoo the smile of the wrong dead girl was white and orthodontically perfected bethany had had braces that turned kissing into a heroic feat you had to kiss around braces slide your tongue up or sideways or under like navigating through barbed wire a delicious tricky trip through no mans land bethany pursed her mouth forward when she kissed if miles forgot and mashed his lips down too hard on hers she whacked him on the back of his head this was one of the things about his relationship with bethany that miles remembered vividly looking down at the wrong dead girl the wrong dead girl spoke first knock knock she said what miles said knock knock the wrong dead girl said again whos there miles said gloria the wrong dead girl said gloria palnick who are you and what are you doing in my grave this isnt your grave miles said aware that he was arguing with a dead girl and the wrong dead girl at that this is bethanys grave what are you doing in bethanys grave oh no gloria palnick said this is my grave and i get to ask the questions a notion crept like little dead cat feet over miles possibly he had made a dangerous and deeply embarrassing mistake poetry he managed to say there was some poetry that i ah that i accidentally left in my girlfriends casket and theres a deadline for a poetry contest coming up and so i really really needed to get it back the dead girl stared at him there was something about her hair that miles didnt like excuse me but are you for real she said this sounds like one of those lame excuses the dog ate my homework i accidentally buried my poetry with my dead girlfriend look miles said i checked the tombstone and everything this is supposed to be bethanys grave bethany baldwin im really sorry i bothered you and everything but this isnt really my fault the dead girl just stared at him thoughtfully he wished that she would blink she wasnt smiling anymore her hair lank and black where bethanys had been brownish and frizzy in summer was writhing a little like snakes miles thought of centipedes inky midnight tentacles maybe i should just go away miles said leave you to ah rest in peace or whatever i dont think sorry cuts the mustard here gloria palnick said she barely moved her mouth when she spoke miles noticed and yet her enunciation was fine besides im sick of this place its boring maybe ill just come along with what miles said he felt behind himself surreptitiously for the knotted rope i said maybe ill come with you gloria palnick said she sat up her hair was really coiling around really seething now miles thought he could hear hissing noises you cant do that he said im sorry but no just no well then you stay here and keep me company gloria palnick said her hair was really something i cant do that either miles said trying to explain quickly before the dead girls hair decided to strangle him im going to be a poet it would be a great loss to the world if i never got a chance to publish my poetry i see gloria palnick said as if she did in fact see a great deal her hair settled back down on her shoulders and began to act a lot more like hair you dont want me to come home with you you dont want to stay here with me then how about this if youre such a great poet then write me a poem write something about me so that everyone will be sad that i died i could do that miles said relief bubbled up through his middle like tiny doughnuts in an industrial deepfat fryer lets do that you lie down and make yourself comfortable and ill rebury you today ive got a quiz in american history and i was going to study for it during my free period after lunch but i could write a poem for you instead today is saturday the dead girl said oh hey miles said then no problem ill go straight home and work on your poem should be done by monday not so fast gloria palnick said you need to know all about my life and about me if youre going to write a poem about me right and how do i know youll write a poem if i let you bury me again how will i know if the poems any good no dice im coming home with you and im sticking around until i get my poem kay she stood up she was several inches taller than miles do you have any chapstick she said my lips are really dry here miles said then you can keep it oh afraid of dead girl cooties gloria palnick said she smacked her lips at him in an upsetting way ill climb up first miles said he had the idea that if he could just get up the rope if he could yank the rope up after himself fast enough he might be able to run away get to the fence where hed chained up his bike before gloria managed to get out it wasnt like she knew where he lived she didnt even know his name fine gloria said she looked like she knew what miles was thinking and didnt really care by the time miles had bolted up the rope yanking it up out of the grave abandoning the telescoping shovel the wire cutters the wronged dead girl and had unlocked his road bike and was racing down the empty am road the little red dot of light from his headlamp falling into potholes hed almost managed to persuade himself that it had all been a grisly hallucination except for the fact that the dead girls cold dead arms were around his waist suddenly and her cold dead face was pressed against his back her damp hair coiling around his head and tapping at his mouth burrowing down his filthy shirt dont leave me like that again she said no miles said i wont sorry he couldnt take the dead girl home he couldnt think of how to explain it to his parents no no no he didnt want to take her over to johns house either it was far too complicated not just the girl but he was covered in dirt john wouldnt be able to keep his big mouth shut where are we going the dead girl said i know a place miles said could you please not put your hands under my shirt theyre really cold and your fingernails are kind of sharp sorry the dead girl said they rode along in silence until they were passing the eleven at the corner of eighth and walnut and the dead girl said could we stop for a minute id like some beef jerky and a diet coke miles braked beef jerky he said is that what dead people eat its the preservatives the dead girl said somewhat obscurely miles gave up he steered the bike into the parking lot let go please he said the dead girl let go he got off the bike and turned around hed been wondering just exactly how shed managed to sit behind him on the bike and he saw that she was sitting above the rear tire on a cushion of her horrible shiny hair her legs were stretched out on either side toes in black combat boots floating just above the asphalt and yet the bike didnt fall over it just hung there under her for the first time in almost a month miles found himself thinking about bethany as if she were still alive bethany is never going to believe this but then bethany had never believed in anything like ghosts shed hardly believed in the school dress code she definitely wouldnt have believed in a dead girl who could float around on her hair like it was an antigravity device i can also speak fluent spanish gloria palnick said miles reached into his back pocket for his wallet and discovered that the pocket was full of dirt i cant go in there he said for one thing im a kid and its five in the morning also i look like i just escaped from a gang of naked mole rats im filthy the dead girl just looked at him he said coaxingly you should go in youre older ill give you all the money ive got you go in and ill stay out here and work on the poem youll ride off and leave me here the dead girl said she didnt sound angry just matter of fact but her hair was beginning to float up it lifted her up off miless bike in a kind of hairy cloud and then plaited itself down her back in a long businesslike rope i wont miles promised here take this buy whatever you want gloria palnick took the money how very generous of you she said no problem miles told her ill wait here and he did wait he waited until gloria palnick went into the eleven then he counted to thirty waited one second more got back on his bike and rode away by the time hed made it to the meditation cabin in the woods back behind bethanys mothers house where he and bethany had liked to sit and play monopoly miles felt as if things were under control again more or less there is nothing so calming as a meditation cabin where long boring games of monopoly have taken place hed clean up in the cabin sink and maybe take a nap bethanys mother never went out there her exhusbands meditation clothes his scratchy prayer mat all his buddhas and scrolls and incense holders and posters of che guevara were still out here miles had snuck into the cabin a few times since bethanys death to sit in the dark and listen to the plinkplink of the meditation fountain and think about things he was sure bethanys mother wouldnt have minded if she knew although he hadnt ever asked just in case which had been wise of him the key to the cabin was on the beam just above the door but he didnt need it after all the door stood open there was a smell of incense and of other things cherry chapstick and dirt and beef jerky there was a pair of black combat boots beside the door miles squared his shoulders i have to admit that he was behaving sensibly here finally finally becauseand miles and i are in agreement for onceif the dead girl could follow him somewhere before he even knew exactly where he was going then there was no point in running away anywhere he went shed already be there miles took off his shoes because you were supposed to take off your shoes when you went into the cabin it was a gesture of respect he put them down beside the combat boots and went inside the waxed pine floor felt silky under his bare feet he looked down and saw that he was walking on gloria palnicks hair sorry miles said he meant several things by that he meant sorry for walking on your hair sorry for riding off and leaving you in the eleven after promising that i wouldnt sorry for the grave wrong ive done you but most of all he meant sorry dead girl that i ever dug you up in the first place dont mention it the dead girl said want some jerky sure he said he felt he had no other choice he was beginning to feel he would have liked this dead girl under other circumstances despite her annoying bullying hair she had poise a sense of humor she seemed to have what his mother called sticktoitiveness what the ap english exam prefers to call tenacity miles recognized the quality he had it in no small degree himself the dead girl was also extremely pretty if you ignored the hair you might think less of miles that he thought so well of the dead girl that this was a betrayal of bethany miles felt it was a betrayal but he thought that bethany might have liked the dead girl too she would certainly have liked her tattoo how is the poem coming the dead girl said theres not a lot that rhymes with gloria miles said or palnick toothpick said the dead girl there was a fragment of jerky caught in her teeth euphoria maybe you should write the stupid poem miles said there was an awkward pause broken only by the almostnoiseless glide of hair retreating across a pine floor miles sat down sweeping the floor with his hand just in case you were going to tell me something about your life he said boring gloria palnick said short over thats not much to work with unless you want a haiku tell me about this girl you were trying to dig up gloria said the one you wrote the poetry for her name was bethany miles said she died in a car crash was she pretty gloria said yeah miles said you liked her a lot gloria said yeah miles said are you sure youre a poet gloria asked miles was silent he gnawed his jerky ferociously it tasted like dirt maybe hed write a poem about it that would show gloria palnick he swallowed and said why were you in bethanys grave how should i know she said she was sitting across from him leaning against a concrete buddha the size of a threeyearold but much fatter and holier her hair hung down over her face just like a japanese horror movie what do you think that bethany and i swapped coffins just for fun is bethany like you miles said does she have weird hair and follow people around and scare them just for fun no the dead girl said through her hair not for fun but whats wrong with having a little fun it gets dull and why should we stop having fun just because were dead its not all demon cocktails and scrabble down in the old bardo you know you know whats weird miles said you sound like her bethany you say the same kind of stuff it was dumb to try to get your poems back said the dead girl you cant just give something to somebody and then take it back again i just miss her miles said he began to cry after a while the dead girl got up and came over to him she took a big handful of her hair and wiped his face with it it was soft and absorbent and it made miless skin crawl he stopped crying which might have been what the dead girl was hoping go home she said miles shook his head no he finally managed to say he was shivering like crazy why not the dead girl said because ill go home and youll be there waiting for me i wont the dead girl said i promise really miles said i really promise said the dead girl im sorry i teased you miles thats okay miles said he got up and then he just stood there looking down at her he seemed to be about to ask her something and then he changed his mind she could see this happen and she could see why too he knew he ought to leave now while she was willing to let him go he didnt want to fuck up by asking something impossible and obvious and stupid that was okay by her she couldnt be sure that he wouldnt say something that would rile up her hair not to mention the tattoo she didnt think hed noticed when her tattoo had started getting annoyed goodbye miles said at last it almost looked as if he wanted her to shake his hand but when she sent out a length of her hair he turned and ran it was a little disappointing and the dead girl couldnt help but notice that hed left his shoes and his bike behind the dead girl walked around the cabin picking things up and putting them down again she kicked the monopoly box which was a game that shed always hated that was one of the okay things about being dead that nobody ever wanted to play monopoly at last she came to the statue of st francis whose head had been knocked right off during an indoor game of croquet a long time ago bethany baldwin had made st francis a lumpy substitute ganesh head out of modeling clay you could lift that clay elephant head off and there was a hollow space where miles and bethany had left secret things for each other the dead girl reached down her shirt and into the cavity where her more interesting and useful organs had once been she had been an organ donor shed put miless poetry in there for safekeeping she folded up the poetry wedged it inside st francis and fixed the ganesh head back on maybe miles would find it someday she would have liked to see the look on his face we dont often get a chance to see our dead still less often do we know them when we see them mrs baldwins eyes opened she looked up and saw the dead girl and smiled she said bethany bethany sat down on her mothers bed she took her mothers hand if mrs baldwin thought bethanys hand was cold she didnt say so she held on tightly i was dreaming about you she told bethany you were in an andrew lloyd webber musical it was just a dream bethany said mrs baldwin reached up and touched a piece of bethanys hair with her other hand youve changed your hair she said i like it they were both silent bethanys hair stayed very still perhaps it felt flattered thank you for coming back mrs baldwin said at last i cant stay bethany said mrs baldwin held her daughters hand tighter ill go with you thats why youve come isnt it because im dead too bethany shook her head no sorry youre not dead its miless fault he dug me up he did what mrs baldwin said she forgot the small lowering unhappiness of discovering that she was not dead after all he wanted his poetry back bethany said the poems he gave me that idiot mrs baldwin said it was exactly the sort of thing she expected of miles but only with the advantage of hindsight because how could you really expect such a thing what did you do to him i played a good joke on him bethany said shed never really tried to explain her relationship with miles to her mother it seemed especially pointless now she wriggled her fingers and her mother instantly let go of bethanys hand being a former buddhist mrs baldwin had always understood that when you hold onto your children too tightly you end up pushing them away instead except that after bethany had died she wished shed held on a little tighter she drank up bethany with her eyes she noted the tattoo on bethanys arm with both disapproval and delight disapproval because one day bethany might regret getting a tattoo of a cobra that wrapped all the way around her bicep delight because something about the tattoo suggested bethany was really here that this wasnt just a dream andrew lloyd webber musicals were one thing but she would never have dreamed that her daughter was alive again and tattooed and wearing long writhing midnight tails of hair i have to go bethany said she had turned her head a little towards the window as if she were listening for something far away oh her mother said trying to sound as if she didnt mind she didnt want to ask will you come back she was a lapsed buddhist but not so very lapsed after all she was still working to relinquish all desire all hope all self when a person like mrs baldwin suddenly finds that her life has been dismantled by a great catastrophe she may then hold on to her belief as if to a life raft even if the belief is this that one should hold on to nothing mrs baldwin had taken her buddhism very seriously once before substitute teaching had knocked it out of her bethany stood up im sorry i wrecked the car she said although this wasnt completely true if shed still been alive she would have been sorry but she was dead she didnt know how to be sorry anymore and the longer she stayed the more likely it seemed that her hair would do something truly terrible her hair was not good buddhist hair it did not love the living world or the things in the living world and it did not love them in an utterly unenlightened way there was nothing of light or enlightenment about bethanys hair it knew nothing of hope but it had desires and ambitions its best not to speak of those ambitions as for the tattoo it wanted to be left alone and to be allowed to eat people just every once in a while when bethany stood up mrs baldwin said suddenly ive been thinking i might give up substitute teaching bethany waited i might go to japan to teach english mrs baldwin said sell the house just pack up and go is that okay with you do you mind bethany didnt mind she bent over and kissed her mother on her forehead she left a smear of cherry chapstick when she had gone mrs baldwin got up and put on her bathrobe the one with white cranes and frogs she went downstairs and made coffee and sat at the kitchen table for a long time staring at nothing her coffee got cold and she never even noticed the dead girl left town as the sun was coming up i wont tell you where she went maybe she joined the circus and took part in daring trapeze acts that put her hair to good use kept it from getting bored and plotting the destruction of all that is good and pure and lovely maybe she shaved her head and went on a pilgrimage to some remote lamasery and came back as a superhero with a dark past and some kickass martialarts moves maybe she sent her mother postcards from time to time maybe she wrote them as part of her circus act using the tips of her hair dipping them into an inkwell these postcards not to mention her calligraphic scrolls are highly sought after by collectors nowadays i have two miles stopped writing poetry for several years he never went back to get his bike he stayed away from graveyards and also from girls with long hair the last i heard he had a job writing topical haikus for the weather channel one of his bestknown haikus is the one about tropical storm suzy it goes something like this a young girl passes in a hurry hair uncombed full of black devils the human race by scott edelman scott edelman is a fivetime bram stoker award finalist whose fiction has appeared in a variety of anthologies and magazines such as the dead that walk the best of all flesh crossroads and postscripts when not writing edelman coedits sci fi wire and in the past edited the fiction magazine science fiction age in the intro to edelmans story in the first the living dead anthology i said that he was something of a zombie genius but it bears repeating in the intervening period the smart folks at ps publishing reached the same conclusion and gathered together all of his zombie fiction into one volume called what will come after though we all live on the same planet in a sense we each inhabit a separate reality after all my reality consists to a substantial degree of the specific building i live in the specific location i work at the specific stores i shop at and the places i hang out yet out of the sixbillionplus people alive right now virtually all of them have never or barely set foot in any of those places let alone all of them and by the same token i will scarcely set foot in any of the places or meet any of the people that make up as far as theyre concerned the world and while other peoples parents are just strangers or possibly acquaintances to us our own parents occupy a massively defining place in our own personal reality so when a parent dies it can seem like the end of the world author scott westerfeld recently took his personal experience with the loss of a parent and used it as inspiration to write his novel leviathan about a fantastical alternate history of world war i in which a parents deathin this case the archduke franz ferdinandactually does cause the world to come apart at the seams our next story is another in which the death of a parent coincides with the end of the world itself a zombie apocalypse seems to promise in some sense the end of death for some people that prospect might be very complicated and challenging indeed paula gaines felt herself quite ready to die or perhaps it was instead that ever since the phone call that brought her to this distant place to look into her fathers dead eyes and have to tell a stranger yes thats him she was no longer ready to live as she sat in the bathtub stroking her forearm with the flat of a knife she had lifted from the hostels communal dining area that fine a distinction no longer mattered to her whether she was racing toward her death or racing away from her life all that mattered now was the speed with which that race could be consummated the reflection of her face in the still water water turned lukewarm so long had she been sitting in it was unfamiliar to her her years on this earth had been full of unfortunate life lessons and thanks to this added insult from the universe there seemed little point in going on before the call that startled her in the middle of another sleepless night before her sudden trip to london she saw herself as a person able to at least keep up a pretense of happiness even though happiness itself was beyond her but this day she no longer had the energy for false smiles and her expression was far grimmer than she had ever known it grimmer and almost lifeless already as she switched the knife from her right hand to her left her slight movement gently rippled the water and as her reflection distorted she could almost see her sisters face and when the ripples were at their greatest even her mothers she slapped the water angrily so that the faces went away she just couldnt bear it her mothers face her sisters face they were both gone the explosion that had taken the two of them had been so great that there had been no faces remaining after death no body parts that the officials at the morgue felt it necessary for her to identify while the terrorist attack had left her fathers body bloodied but intact if she was ever going to see the rest of her family again it would have to be after death after her death she turned the blade so that the edge pressed against her wrist at the instant that she was about to cut deeply lengthwiseas she had learned was necessary for a successful suicide one time when shed investigated it on the webthere was a rap at the bathroom door she startled and as her hand jerked the blade sliced shallowly into her flesh a few drops of blood ran down her arm into the water whos there she asked with a voice that sounded surprised it had the chance to speak again youre not the only one who needs to use the bath you know called out a woman just a moment paula said she looked into the water as her red blood dissipated into pink and then was gone almost as if the thoughts of suicide were a dream but they werent and never would be again she tried to identify exactly whose voice had called out to her to remember which of the women with whom she had shared a bustling breakfast it could have possibly beenlillian who squeezed her hand briefly after passing the marmalade jennifer who found it hard to meet her eyes or perhaps one of the othersand though she could not put a face to the voice she remembered them all as friendly and sympathetic once they realized the purpose of her journey and so she thoughtno not here dont do it here paula didnt want to make friends however new clean up the mess shed leave behind whatever she was going to do it had to be done in front of people whom she had never looked in the eye who would not then be forced to mourn their own failures to save her the women shed just met here even though just passing acquaintances deserved better her mother had raised her that way her mother paula slipped slowly into the water until her head submerged beneath its surface and her knees popped up to cool in the chill air of the room she held her breath embracing the silence and wished that she could just keep holding that breath until all breath was gone taking with it this room this city everything she held the air in her lungs for as long as she could but then the air exploded from between her lips and she sat up quickly shivering in a strange room in a strange country she dressed quickly and rushed back to her cramped room which was all that she could afford and only barely afford at that she grabbed her backpack stuffed it with her possessions told no one she was checking outalmost laughing but not quite at the double meaning of that phraseand fled the hostel if she was going to die that day she was going to do it in front of strangers paula gulped down a mouthful of coffee the moment the waitress brought it over burning her tongue which reminded her yet again that life meant pain at least for her it did she blew on what liquid remained in the cup cursing her impatience she had no idea how others managed to maintain pleasant lives but hers was one filled with impatience and blossoming with pain she had hoped that the despair which had settled over her initially back home and now deepening here would do her a favor for once and demonstrate its own patience so that she could stave off her suicide long enough to return to die in her home country but her latest worries made that unlikely the intricacies of getting her familys remains released negotiating with a local funeral home for proper caskets dealing with the airlines to transport the bodies or what remained of themit was all too much for her and those details buzzed in her head blotting out both sleep and reason she found it hard to contemplate the enormity of suddenly being the responsible one in the family no one could have ever mistaken her for the one in that role before and now identifying her fathers body had been difficult enough she just didnt have the energy to do all of the other things that remained and she didnt have the energy to remain alive either she had walked all morning through the streets of a country she had never before thought to visit stumbled on until her aching feet insisted that she drop into a chair at a corner cafe shed sat in the sunshine for hours unable to summon up the energy to move shamed by the determination of the passersby rushing on with their lives picking at the remains of her plate of squidgy lemon pudding an odd dessert with an odd name she wondered why her father had always wanted to visit this odd country he had always talked about it studying maps poring over guidebooks and had finally done it and look what good chasing his dreams had done him she never understood his dreams anyway that had always been part of their problem she figured she should have been able to understand him better but then he never seemed to spend much energy understanding her either still he had reached out to both paula and her sister jane neither of whom had ever married offering to pay their ways to london to experience it with him perhaps she should have taken her father up on it as her sister had if shed done so she would have been on that bus with the three of them and all of her worrying and despair would now be over instead she had to sit in an unfamiliar place and contemplate how and when she woulddo it if shed been home she would have known exactly what to do she had been thinking about it long enough planning for its inevitability it would have been easy there was that lake and the sunset that came with it and those pills that since mark had left she had been spending far too many long nights studying even before every living relative of hers had been erased she cursed her decision to remain home instead of taking her dad up on his invitation the matter could have been taken out of her hands she could have died with them without thought instead of just sitting there thinking about dying now sitting at the cafe eating her pastry drinking her coffee pondering both her loneliness and the short time she had left in which to be lonelyshe had to find another way maybe she could climb up big ben which her father had always talked of visiting she could climb it and instead of admiring the intricacy of the clockwork and the view justjump off giving herself over to the breeze she wouldnt have minded that feeling of flight to be real for once but somehow it didnt seem right to mingle her fathers goal with her own shortcomings and besides she knew nothing of big ben she had no idea whether that tourist magnet even contained an accessible window or ledge from which she could jump or perhaps she should fill her pockets with rocks and swim out into the thames until she could swim no more a famous writer had done just that she had even seen a movie about it she liked the idea of floating off until consciousness faded but the preparationsfinding a river secluded enough so that no one would try to save her finding a grouping of stones sufficient to her taskit seemed like too much work for her regardless of how romantic it might sound she needed a way that was almost effortless if it could be instantaneous as well so much the better as the traffic blared around her she took another bite of her pastry and looked at the cars and trucks rushing by and to the roadway where she could see painted in large white letters a warning to walkers to look to their right so many tourists visited london each year that there needed to be constant reminders that the world was not the same all over reading the warning she realized that she had finally found her answer she could step blindly into traffic no one would even have to know that she had done it deliberately americans were known for stepping off the curb while looking in the wrong direction if anyone bothered to research her reasons for coming to london in the first place they would simply assume that she had been distracted by grief unlike the case with the women back at the hostel no one would have to feel personal responsibility carrying the weight that it was something she could have been talked out of there would be no guilt they would just think it was the unfortunate accidental passing of another sad american in fact paula could see one of those quaint doubledecker busses approaching right then she pushed back from her table and walked away from the cafe her waitress stepped toward her from amid the outdoor cluster of tables calling after her that she had forgotten to pay which only caused her to walk more quickly as the bright red bus neared paula looked the other way feigning confusion just in case there was a witness and began to put her right foot forward to step into the street before she could set it down in the path of the bus she heard a man scream she hesitated hanging there between life and death when paula turned she saw that man pointing not at her but past her into the street the bus went by her opportunity gone by then additional people were pointing and she followed their outstretched arms to what was revealed after the bus had moved on it was a dead man walking with his shredded clothes bloodied body and gray pallor another might have thought him merely a man in makeup costumed for a party or on his way to a movie set but unfortunately paula knew what death looked like as the creature grew nearer she could see into its eyes they were like those of her father there was no there there unlike her father however this corpse walked it shambled amidst the traffic in her direction the cars honking for him to move and then swerving when he did not a few drivers slowed to a crawl so they could look more closely at the impossibility one man got out of his car and ran over to the thing placing his hand on its shoulder paula could see from the drivers face no more than ten yards away that this was only a gesture of concern perhaps hed thought the bloodied walker an escapee from a hospital as a reward for the mans good samaritanship the shambler slapped out with a bloodied fist and knocked him dead pedestrians screamed and scattered around her but paula simply stood there she wondered if she was frozen in shock but no she was only waiting though she wasnt sure for what she watched as the walking corpse punched a second man to the pavement then lunged to bring down a third biting deeply into a womans neck with crooked teeth then the thing saw her with everyone else fleeing she was the only still target in a sea of flesh its lips parted and she could hear a low dull growl she looked away from its bloody lips into its eyes and thought she now saw an empty hunger there one that was not unfamiliar to her she began to ask what force had animated him what had brought him back to the land of the living but before she could utter her question a shot rang out a police officer had fired on the thing from behind the shelter of a car hitting the creature in its back it staggered slightly under the affront but did not close its dull eyes wait she said holding out one hand toward the officer and the other armed men who joined him you cant do this not yet she took a step forward the step toward death that shed been interrupted from taking mere moments before and further shots rang out the things head exploded splashing brain matter across her it crumpled its knees slamming into the pavement first then it sank forward what remained of its head hitting the roadway at her feet blood splattering her shoes only then did she sag sitting down hard on the curb a policeman dashed over skirting the broken body at their feet miss he asked her are you all right miss she didnt know how to even begin to answer she looked up into the policemans face and for a moment was unable to tell whether he was alive or dead or even remember whether she herself was alive or dead someone thrust a cup of water into her hands and draped a blanket over her shoulders someone else attempted to wipe the blood from her face as she sat there limp hearing the sound of sirens and smelling the scent of death voices reached her through her fog of shock the police were saying that this tableaux hadnt just happened on this one street it was playing itself out all over london all over the world the dead were coming back to life and they didnt seem to like us she let herself be helped back to her feet and then she let herself be tugged along as she had allowed for most of her life but when she realized that the destination she was being shepherded to was the back of an ambulance she broke free from those who thought they were helping her she ran as swiftly as she could ran away into the cafe out a back entrance and down an alleyway this was no time to live meekly to be swept along by the tide if the dead were coming back to life her place wasnt in a hospital with the living and those who hoped to rejoin the living it was in the morgue with the dead her dead paula stared down the barrel of a gun held in the shaking hands of a guard standing in the doorway to the london morgue and was surprised to realize that all she felt was a calm disinterest she felt no alarm she only thoughthow ironic hours before she would have acted as provocatively as possible in the hopes of setting off the trigger finger of the jittery young man in a uniform at least one size too large for him she would have made a lunge in his direction walked with the staggered gait of the living corpses she had seen wandering the streets of london as shed zigzagged her way to the building in which shed identified her fathers bodyanything to provoke that bullet but now everything had changed for suddenly she had hope and so she put her hands out slowly beside her palms up and then chose her words carefully im not dead she said hoping that her calm words would distract from the bits of brain matter that had spotted the front of her blouse when that first corpse had been shot and from the blood stain that remained on her face impervious to washing the guard lowered his gun slightly but it did not appear to paula that he had loosened his grip why did you come here he asked one of his shirt sleeves was missing and the other was dripping with blood this is the last place you should want to be my fathers here do you remember me i remember you you were standing by the elevators when i came in i think he died last week and i had to come here yesterday to identify him what happened to your arm he shook his head unready to talk about it he looked like the sort of person who might never be ready to talk about it holding things in for a lifetime as she had im lucky to be alive he said you should leave i need to be here she said taking a careful step forward i need to see him please no one needs to be here he said standing aside and letting her pass through the door to stand beside him in the entrance hall and ive been here long enough theyve been coming to life all day i hope never to see this place again then he was where she had been outside looking in youre not going to find what youre looking for he said but youre welcome to try the place is all yours he tossed her the keys just remembersome doors youre not going to want to unlock and then he was gone leaving her alone in a lobby that looked even less welcoming than it had been the day before the floor was slick with blood and littered with body parts as she picked her way through the building that no longer fazed her because thats what the city had looked like as shed made her way here only luck had let her get this far she retraced her steps to the room in which she had been asked to identify her fatherbut it was empty she feared that she was too late that her father animated by the plague that had infected the planet had already gotten up and staggered away it could have been his blood on the guards sleeves it could have been his body parts on the floor shredded as the guard had defended himself but as she looked around the bland room she realized that no single body ever stayed there for long this was just a place where people like her came face to face with death the bodies were shuttled here from somewhere else paula returned to the hallway to find that somewhere else the floor had become so slippery that she had to steady herself against a wall to stand upright shed watched enough television to know what she was looking for but it wasnt her eyes that first found her goal that bynow clichéd room with columns and rows of refrigerated cubicles it was her ears she heard her destination before she saw it with her hand on the doorknob and the sounds of violence raging inside she was afraid for the first time that day the thought that her father was inside and that she might be stopped from reaching him stirred up that fear but she was more afraid of what she would learn about her father than of what would happen to her and so forced herself into the room she had to lean against the door to open it and only when she had it fully open did she see that her way had been blocked by body parts a coroner his internal organs chewed was split into four pieces she closed her eyes took a deep breath and stepped into the room which still echoed with noise nothing moved to stop her so she moved slowly to the center of the large room lined with small doors with handles she could hear muffled howling and the dull thuds of bare feet beating against metal doors people were trapped inside many of the refrigerated cubicles struggling to get out no not people she reminded herself what used to be people and behind one of those doors was her father she moved respectfully through the room pausing before each column of doors she noticed that some of the compartments emitted no sound presumably because they contained no body she walked by someones mother someones father someones child and wondered if others like her were coming to try to collect them slots in the doors held cards on which names had been scrawled she had almost circled the room and returned to where shed started before she stopped at last in front of a door which bore a name she shared she placed her hand on the cool metal handle there was silence within a silence that sickened her for it could mean that he was already gone she rested her head against the door and was surprised to find herself praying something she had not done since she was a small child she pulled the handle once the door opened she tugged at the tray inside and slid it out from its compartment it rolled out so effortlessly that she was surprised to see that her fathers body was still there unchanged since the day before oh daddy she moaned he appeared the same as he had been when she had come to identify him though they had washed the blood from him as best as they could the evidence of death was unmistakable whatever had brought the other dead back to this new sort of life had not yet touched him no force had come to animate him again to wake him so that he could say the things as yet unsaid so that she could retract the things said that shouldnt have been said she dragged a chair over beside his pallet so that she could watch him and then she sat down to await his transformation she jerked awake startled to realize that she had been asleep all she remembered was studying her fathers face just as she was doing now there was no change her father still slept he wont be coming back you know she leapt up at the sound of the voice tumbling her chair on its side the guard who had earlier abandoned her knelt to pick it up im sorry that i frightened you he said but i couldnt leave you alone to face this paula backed away keeping the righted chair between them she had not known men to act kindly to her in the past and she doubted that it was about to start under these circumstances what did you mean when you said that he wasnt coming back she asked warily only that its too late for him ive been listening to the news what news is still broadcasting all the others the ones weve seen the ones weve had to fightthey died today and yesterday but your fatherhe died last week no one knows why or what happened but its only the newly dead who return she sank into the chair and began to cry he wouldnt have been the same anyway miss he said trying to comfort her he wouldnt have recognized you the guard didnt understand that wasnt why she was crying this time not because her father couldnt join her in life she was in tears now because it was too late for her to join him in death she was even worse off than shed been before suicide had been rendered useless there could be no end to life now if she were to kill herself she would just come back for another chapter and she wanted no further chapters she wanted her book of life to be closed she wanted to die but the time for death was past she no longer had a goal all purpose had been stolen from her she dried her tears but did not get up she simply sat there continuing to stare at her father you should go home miss if you can but what about my father what about him there is no him anymore i was supposed to bring him home i dont know that theres any home anymore either from what i hear the states are just as bad and at a time like this i doubt they would let you return with a dead body im sorry but its best to just say goodbye the former guard backed away from her giving her space she did not need inviting her with his body language to leave with him but he didnt get it she was dead inside she may have looked alive but inside she was just like her father she belonged here by day she wandered the wounded city sure that her wounds were even greater studying those who still dared to walk the streets in an attempt to get on with their lives in the midst of chaos and being studied in return at night she slept by her fathers side surprised that she even could sleep for the noise in that room the moaning the pounding of creatures that could not escape was unceasing as she moved through the city it was as if she were leading a charmed life though she was not sure that what she still had was life she would come upon scenes of great carnage small battles between the living and the dead and walk through them unscathed it was as if the undead took her for one of their own so dead was she inside the fugue state in which she existed had seemed to make her invulnerable though she didnt entirely think of herself as so because she no longer had the level of consciousness to be selfaware she existed without conscious choice she just continued her walking through the city eating when hungry returning to sleep when tired around her some people seemed to be going about their business but many had abandoned their routines fleeing the city in search of sanctuary in the countryside london had become depopulated it was as if a great city had become a small village in a matter of days there was no longer a problem getting a seat on the tube though people now looked at each other with suspicion for new reasons that were just as deadly as the old one day after walking she aimlessly rode the tube for hours letting it take her where it would it seemed as useful as anything else she could have been doing she no longer had anywhere to go she no longer had anywhere to be and besides this is how she felt closest to her family riding the public transportation of the city she felt closer to her father than when she slept next to him at night propped up in a chair waiting for a metamorphosis she now doubted would ever come this was the sort of place in which hed died after all this was the sort of place in which her entire family had died taking her along with them she watched others come and go most were afraid eying each other passenger and wondering whether this one or that one was a reanimated corpse she knew no fear for she no longer cared no force living or dead had any answers for her but at the next station she felt fear again as the doors opened to reveal another who was also fearless though for different reasons the man who entered the car wore a hooded sweatshirt even though the weather had been warm that day and on his back he carried an olive backpack paula tried to read his expression but there was no expression there to read and that told her everything she needed to know dont do it she shouted no longer desiring what came after then came the explosion brighter than the sun and then the darkness as black as death paula heard no screaming as she came to and she thought at first that the explosion had deafened her by shattering her eardrums but as she lifted her head she could see that the reason there was no screaming was because she was the only one on the train left alive she was on her back and as she moved her hands about her to rise her fingers swept against glass that had been blown from the windows she sat up in the unmoving train and through the smoke could see the bodies of the few other occupants of the car that had been brave enough to ride the tube she had been furthest from the bomber and had only been knocked out but the halfdozen others had been lifted and thrown against the walls of the train she felt an odd sense of cognitive dissonance it was as if she was visiting the past this is what her fathers last home had looked like filled with smoke and dust and blood but somehow she had escaped her familys fate she leaned against the buckled walls as she moved along the car she walked gingerly past the dead the blood streaming from their ears and threw herself against the door which would not budge she looked nervously at the dead knowing what would happen next she had to get out then she saw him the cause of all this or what was left of him a head its hair matted with blood was on the floor facing away from her the body that had supported it was nowhere to be seen she approached the head slowly circling it and then pushing at it with her toes so she could stare into its face yes it was him he had thought that he would be in heaven soon but there was no heaven waiting for him in this new world she removed her jacket and kicked the head into the center of the cloth hands shaking she tied the corners together so that she could carry her burden along without having to touch it she had to hurry for not only would the others soon come back to life filled with hunger but she could hear the sounds of rescuers approaching as well and both living and dead would only be obstacles to her now she tucked the package under one arm crawled through a shattered window and ran down the tracks as quickly as she could in the opposite direction of the voices back at the morgue paula unwrapped her parcel and put the head upright on a plate balanced on its ragged neck she knew that she might need to move it again but she never wanted to have to touch it she placed it on one of the operating tables turning it carefully away from her away from her father so that all she could see was the back of its head but then she turned it back again so that she could watch it as she sat by her father she needed to see the transformation when it came the sounds in the room had lessened since the dead first began to wake but only by degree the dead feet that had been pounding ceaselessly on the metal doors for hours had splintered and the throats that roared their anger were wearing away she imagined that if she could survive here long enough that she would see their bodies break down entirely just like the systems that kept civilization humming seemed about to do she wasnt sure that she could get home again even if she wanted to and she wasnt sure that she wanted to she stared at what remained of a man who was willing to die for an ideology or as it turned out someone who was willing to do something even worse than that not to die but to choose a living mindless death he and others like him had hoped to bring down the workings of the modern world but they did no such thing the zombie plague did what they could not yet they still continued not realizing that their bombs were pointless night fell and morning came again and there was no change but then as night fell for the second day the closed eyes of the terrorists head snapped open in that instant the sounds from within the refrigerated compartments stopped as if the dead who were locked away sensed a brother outside who might help them but no help would be forthcoming for all the manless head could do was rage she looked at her father he had not responded to the resurrection she guessed she didnt really expect him to that wasnt what this was about answers she dragged her chair forward to sit facing her attacker who could do nothing but look at her with mindless anger who are you she asked how can you keep on doing something like this knowing what you had to have known it growled at her grinding its teeth loudly killing yourself so that you can go to heaven is barbaric enough but once you knew that all youd be getting is this how could you go ahead and do it anyway the world changed and you paid it no attention to choose zombiehood to make others into zombies youre dead forever now im not sure that you were ever really alive to begin with the head howled pinning her with unblinking eyes tell me she said tell me why you did this she stood up and took a step closer as she did the things nostrils flared it snapped its teeth trying to reach her but the gap between them was infinite youre not taking a bite out of me you wont ever be taking a bite out of anyone your death is as over as your life theres nothing left for you so you might as well tell me it rocked back and forth on its severed neck but could gain no momentum tell me she shouted and swatted at the head which flew from the table and bounced several times on the floor leaving several red splotches the creatures behind the doors roared she grabbed the head by its hair and lifted it up to eye level ill never know will i she said never its answers remained the same as before it was all senseless she didnt know whether she could live with that there seemed little reason to change her earlier plans she lifted her other hand near to the things mouth it snapped and snarled so ferociously that a tooth flew from between its lips and bounced off her chest she could do it she could do it quickly one bite and it would be over she could no longer have death but she could have something like it and in a senseless universe that would have to do but behind the head was her father lying there quietly speaking to her more eloquently than any member of the living dead ever could she stepped closer to her father holding the head out before her like a beacon this is my father she said not really caring whether the creature even listened he didnt want much out of life he just wanted to ride a doubledecker bus someday to see the tower of london to have a real beer in a real pub he only wanted to see his daughters grow up to be happy she grew silent as she held the head by its hair it rocked below her hand like a pendulum she didnt know what else to say but she said it anyway im sorry dad maybemaybe i can make it up to you she hadnt been able to make her father happy while he was alive but now that he was deadnow that he was dead maybe she had a chance she placed the head in one of the empty cabinets where it once more began its howling welcome to your new home she said i have to try to get back to mine then she shut the door on the past and left the room of death forever who we used to be by david moody david moodys short fiction has appeared in the anthologies the undead and the number of the beast his zombie novel autumn and its sequels were originally selfpublished and released for free online the books have been downloaded more than a halfmillion times and are currently being rereleased in print by thomas dunne books a film based on autumn starring dexter fletcher and david carradine was released in the us earlier this year moodys novel hater is also currently being adapted for film with guillermo del toro producing and the orphanages j a bayona directing moodys other novels include dog blood the sequel to hater straight to you and trust prominent atheist richard dawkins was recently asked if since he did not believe in any sort of afterlife he was afraid of death he replied that he was not afraid of deathafter all the universe had existed just fine without him for billions of years before he was born so why should it trouble him to imagine that it would go on existing without him for billions of years after hes gone rather he was afraid of dying because current laws compel dying patients to endure a torturous gauntlet of pain and suffering rather than letting them decide for themselves when to let go i think many people assume that if they really did find themselves facingoff against the living dead theyd react like the people in the movies and books theyd hunt out weapons and supplies and fight off wave after wave of the dead moody says i think the reality would be very different many people would just implode others would deny the impossible events unfolding around them and try to continue with their daytoday as usual our next story questions the logic of trying to survive for as long as possible when all youre doing is wasting precious time and effort prolonging the inevitable its like keeping a dying patient alive by pumping them continually with drugs which make them feel worse moody says but sometimes you just have to accept that letting go might just be the kindest and most sensible option there was something beautifully ironic about the way mankind completely overlooked its own annihilation our society for too long increasingly focused on the irrelevant wasnt even looking in the right direction when more than six billion lives were abruptly ended had anyone survived theyd no doubt have been able to come up with a thousand and one halfbaked incorrect explanations a mutated virus terrorism scattered debris from a comet tail a crashed satellite leaking radiation truth was even if by some chance they had stumbled on the right reason it wouldnt have made any difference and anyway if anyone had been watching then what happened next would have been even harder to comprehend than the sudden loss of billions of lives just minutes later as if each persons individual death had been nothing more than an inconvenient blip as trivial and unimportant as a momentary powercut in the middle of a reality tv program every last one of the dead got back up again and tried to carry on simon parker had been in his home office when it happened poring fanatically over business projections what hed originally envisaged as an hours work had as usual wiped out his entire saturday morning but it didnt matter the work needed to be done without the business they could kiss goodbye to this house the cars the holidays janice and nathan understood he felt bad that hed left his son on his own for so long but hed make it up to him when he got the chance he knew janice wasnt bothered shed just got back from shopping arms laden with bags of clothes and other things they didnt need retail therapy kept her happy simon mistook his death for a blackout there were no choirs of angels or long tunnels leading towards brilliant white lights no endless flights of heavenly steps to climb instead his death came as a sudden crushing pressure followed by absolutely nothing one minute he was staring at the screen searching for a particular line of figures the next he was flat on his back looking up at the ceiling unable to focus his eyes he immediately began to search for explanations had he suffered a heart attack an electric shock from a faulty power outlet a physical manifestation of the stressrelated problems his doctor had repeatedly warned him about he tried to shout for janice but he couldnt speak his sudden paralysis was suffocating and terrifying but to his immense relief it was only temporary with an unprecedented amount of mute effort and concentration he finally managed to focus his eyes on the light fixture above him then he slowly turned his head a little then with even more concentration and effort he was able to screw his right hand into a fist and bend his arm at the elbow he managed to draw his knees up to his chest and roll over onto his side then having to will every individual muscle and sinew to move independently he hauled himself up no sooner had he stood upright when his center of balance shifted unexpectedly and he staggered across the room stumbling like a new born animal taking its first unsteady steps in the wild he tried to aim for the door but missed and hit the wall facefirst that didnt hurt he thought to himself panicking inside but unable to show it leaning back he slid his hand under his shirt and pressed his palm against his chest fingers must still be numb he decided cant feel anything got to get help got to get to janice leaning to one side until he overbalanced again he rolled along the wall until he reached the open door and fell through he staggered a few steps further then landed on top of janice who had collapsed halfway down the hallway his son nathan watched them both from where he lay on his back at the very top of the stairs with his head lolling back and eyes unfocused both immediately suspected as much but commonsense prevented simon and janice from accepting they were dead for a considerable length of time they had gradually been able to move around with a little more freedom and control and between the pair of them had dragged nathan down into the living room when the tv didnt tell them anything and the phone calls they tried to make went unanswered simon went outside to look for help what he saw out there confirmed their bizarre and improbable suspicions when he left the house simon had braced himself for the expected sudden drop in temperature outside he was only wearing a thin tshirt and jeansputting on anything else in his current ungainly state would have been too much of an ordealand yet he hadnt felt a thing he hadnt felt the rain he could see splashing in the puddles around his bare feet or the wind which whipped through the tops of the trees he could see behind the houses at the end of the culdesac hed originally planned to try and get to jack thompson a retired gp who lived several doors down but he hadnt even reached the gate at the end of his own drive before hed lost his nerve and turned around his hearing was strangely muffled and unclear but a sudden noise over to his far left had been loud enough to hear clearly he turned towards the sound struggling with knees which wouldnt bend hips which wouldnt cooperate and feet which were heavy as lead and saw that dennis pugh the pompous odious property developer who lived directly opposite was trying to drive his car obviously stricken by the same mysterious affliction as simon as his family pughs bloated unresponsive right foot had become wedged down on the accelerator pedal while his left foot had slipped off the clutch with inflexible arms he fought to control the car as it careened forward at speed clipping the low stone wall at the end of his drive then swerving out across the road and missing simons gate by the narrowest of margins simon watched as pugh ploughed down kathleen malins from number seventeen before smashing into the back of a builders van pugh halfclimbed halffell out of the wreck of his car and staggered back towards his house crimson blood dribbling down his gray face from a deep gash across his forehead simon barely even looked at him instead he watched kathleenone of janices circle of friendsas she tried to get back home she was crawling along the road badly broken legs dragging uselessly behind safely back inside his house simon leant against the door and tried to make sense of everything hed just seen he caught sight of his face in the long mirror on the wall and squinted hard to try and force his eyes to focus he looked bad his flesh was lifeless and pallid his expression vacant and dull his skin he thought looked tightly stretched over his bones like it belonged to someone else as if hed borrowed it from someone a size smaller nathan sat in front of the tv while his parents had a long difficult and surreal conversation in the kitchen about their sudden unexpected deaths and their equally sudden and unexpected reanimation they had all stopped breathing but quickly discovered that by swallowing a lungful of air and forcing it back out again they could just about speak the internet was still workingthank godand they stood together over simons laptop prodding the keyboard with cold clumsy fingers while most major news portals and corporate sites remained frozen and had not been updated they were able to access enough personal blogs microblogs and social networks to answer their most pressing questions yes they were dead yes it had happened to everyone everywhere no there was nothing they could do about it the film that nathan had been watching on tv ended and was replaced with nothing simon returned to the living room his legs stiffening to see why the sound had stopped he picked up the remote and began flicking through the channels some continued with their automated preprogrammed broadcasts as if nothing had happened other stations remained ominously blank some showed a screen of unchanging unhelpful emergency information and onea twentyfourhour news channeljust showed an empty desk the tousled hair of a collapsed news anchor visible in the foreground of the shot getting stiff janice said as she lurched into the room and fell down onto the sofa next to nathan rigor mortis simon wheezed as he sat down heavily opposite them barely able to believe what he was saying wont last long read it online scared nathan said quietly the first word hed managed to say since hed died i know simon replied trying to focus on his sons face well all just sit here janice said pausing midsentence to swallow more air and rest ill get us some dinner later rigor mortis kept the family frozen in position for almost a whole day for a time they were barely able to speak let alone move in the allconsuming darkness of the long winter night simon stared into space unblinking and tried unsuccessfully to come to terms with what had happened his family was dead and yet he felt surprisingly calmperhaps because they were still together and they could still communicate maybe the loss would hit him later he tried to imagine how any of this could be possiblehow their brains could even continue to function he wondered is this strange state of postdeath consciousness just temporary would it last as long as their physical bodies held together or might it end at any moment he tried to distract himself with other thoughts but it was impossible everything had changed now that they were dead janices earlier words rattled around his head her instinctive offer of a dinner he knew shed never cook he realized theyd never eat or drink again hed never again get drunk hed never smell anything again never sleep or dream never make love for a while that really bothered him it wasnt that he wanted sexand even if he did his sudden lack of circulation meant that the act was a physical impossibility nowwhat hurt was the fact that that aspect of his life had been abruptly ended with such dispassionate brutality silent unanswered questions about trivial practicalities and inconveniences soon gave way to other more important but equally unanswerable questions about what would happen next what will happen to our bodies how long will we last for how long will we be able to move and talk and see and hear each other as the long indeterminable hours passed still more questions plagued him he thought about janices faith although he believed her regular trips to church each sunday were more about seeing people and being seen than anything else was there a god or had the events of the last day been proof positive that all religions were based on superstition and bullshit was this heavenif there was such a placeor its unthinkable opposite he suddenly remembered a line from a horror film hed seen once and adapted it to fit his own bizarre circumstance when theres no more room in hell the dead will walk their living rooms hallways and kitchens the next day janice had been the first to move with a wheezing groan of effort shed pushed herself up out of her seat next to nathancasting a disappointed glance at the large yellow stain shed left on the creamcolored leatherthen dragged herself upstairs on all fours simon went back to his office leaving nathan in front of the now lifeless tv he needed to find answers to some of the many questions hed asked himself last night simon got lost on the stillfunctioning parts of the internet it took him a frustrating age to type and to move the mousehe could barely hold it and click the buttons todaybut he still managed to waste hours searching pointlessly as hed regularly done before hed died he heard janice crashing about in the kitchen and her noise finally prompted him to move he checked in on nathan as he passed the living room door the boy looked bad his legs and feet were swollen and bruised his skin had an unnatural bluegreen hue and one corner of his mouth hung open a dribble of stringy yellowbrown saliva trickled steadily down his chin staining his favorite football shirt okay son simon asked having to remind himself how to talk again nathan slowly lifted his head and looked over in the general direction of his father bored just sit there for a bit he said between breaths as he carried on down the hall mum and i will work out what were going to do janices appearance caught him by surprise shed changed her clothes and was wearing a dress shed bought yesterday might as well get some wear out of it she said you look nice he said automatically even though she didnt always compliment your wife he thought even in death truth was the way she looked made him feel uneasy by squeezing herself into such a tight onceflattering dress shed highlighted the extent to which her body had already changed her ankles were bruised and bloated like nathans because the blood which was no longer being pumped around her body was pooling therehed learnt that online and her belly was swollen most probably with gas from countless chemical reactionshed learnt that online too her oncepert breasts hung heavy and unsupported like two small sagging sacks of grain she lurched into the light and just for a second simon was thankful for the frozen expressionless mask that death had given him and which hid his true reaction janice looked grotesque shed covered her face in a thick layer of concealer which appeared even more unnatural than the jaundiced tinge of decay her skin had shown previously shed applied mascara managing to coat her eyeballs more than her eyelashes eyeshadow and lipstick with clumsy hands leaving her looking more like a drunken clown than anything else he didnt know what to say so he said nothing just want to feel normal again she said just because im dead doesnt mean i have to forget who i am for a moment the two of them stared at each other in silence standing and swaying at opposite ends of the room been trying to find out whats going to happen simon told her what do you mean whats going to happen to us how bad things will get before janice moved unexpectedly she didnt want to hear this she headed for the dishwasher which she hadnt emptied since theyd died dont want to know need to think about it got to be ready for it i know she wheezed she squinted in frustration at the white china plate she held in her hand it was dirty again now that shed picked it up but she put it away in the cupboard anyway how long will we have before depends he said anticipating the end of her question could be six months need to keep the house cool stay dry she nodded although her head didnt move enough to notice stopped unloading and leant heavily against the nearest cupboard were lucky really simon said pausing to take another deep breath of air six months is a long time to have to say goodbye by midafternoon the street outside the house was an unexpected mass of clumsy chaotic movement more and more dead people had dragged themselves out into the open as the day had progressed simon thought he recognized some of them although they were pale shadows of who they used to be what were they hoping to achieve out there surely they must have realized by now that the situation was beyond hope no ones going to help you he thought you cant cure death or make it any easierthese people needed to get a grip and get back indoors some of them began to squabble and fight unable to react to their impossible situation in any other way most though simply staggered around aimlessly simon watched them all walking in the same clichéd slothful wayshuffling and stumbling legs inflexible arms stiff and straight that was one thing those horror film people got right he decided they were out by a mile with just about every other aspect of how theyd imagined the dead would reanimate but theyd got the painfully slow and clumsy zombie walk spoton zombies he thought to himself smiling inwardly what am i thinking he cursed himself for using such a stupid word he wasnt a zombie and neither were janice or nathan where was nathan janice was in the kitchen still cleaning and fussing pointlessly but he hadnt seen nathan for a while he tried shouting for him but he couldnt make his voice loud enough to be heard the boy wasnt anywhere downstairs and simon couldnt face the long climb up to check his room he lurched into the kitchen where nathan janice stopped brushing her lank greasy hair and looked up thought you with him simon walked past his dead wife and headed for the utility room at the far end of the kitchen using the walls and washing machines for support he hauled himself along the narrow passageway and looked up the back door was wide open the whole house would no doubt be freezing cold but as they were no longer able to feel the temperature humidity air pressure or anything else neither of them had noticed he squinted into the distance and thought he could see nathan near the bottom of their long garden there was definitely something moving around down there he went out to investigate struggling to keep his balance through the long wet grass the shape slowly came into focus it was nathan crawling around on his hands and knees what the hell you doing playing nathan answered still trying to keep going forward unaware hed crawled headfirst into an overgrown bramble patch lost ball inside simon ordered leaning down and trying unsuccessfully to grab hold of his sons collar nathan reluctantly did as he was told he reversed direction and shuffled back out dragging spiteful prickly bramble stems with him which refused to let go he stood up fell back down when one of his legs gave way then got back up again what you doing simon demanded managing to swallow just enough air to make his voice sound almost as angry as he felt fed up want to play simon grabbed nathans hand and dragged him back towards the house he stopped and held the boys discolored wrist up closer to his face his paperthin skin had been slashed to ribbons by branches and thorns his ankles were in an even worse state flaps of flesh hung down over the sides of his feet like loosefitting socks look what you done wont get better nathan snatched his hand away and trudged back towards the house zigzagging awkwardly up the boggy lawn simons eyes werent working as well as they had been earlier it was getting dark but when he looked outside it was still bright the light was moving flickering think its a fire janice gasped inhaling midsentence house on fire he turned around to look at her she was scrubbing at a dirty brown handprint on the wall her barely coordinated efforts seeming only to increase the size of the grubby mark he noticed that shed changed her clothes again probably for the best several large bilecolored stains had appeared on the white dress since shed started wearing it now she wore only a shapeless baggy pullover he noticed that lumpy brown liquid was dribbling down the insides of her bare legs and splashing on the carpet between her feet what we going to do simon had been trying to think of an answer to that question all day and hed come to the conclusion that they only had one choice nowto barricade themselves in the house and try to maximize the time they had left together earlier when it had been lighter and hed been able to see more clearly hed watched the chaos on the road outside with a mixture of fascination and unease their quiet culdesac had become a seething cesspit of activity there seemed to be a constant flood of people filling the street marching incessantly towards nothing just like in the films he thought he remembered how hed seen several of them trip and fall only to be trampled down by countless others who were being forced forward en masse by the pressure of the swollen crowds behind the street had become little more than a putrid fleshfilled channel ankle deep in places but still they came and still they fell stupid pointless he was glad hed had the foresight to have a gate installed across the drive it made it easier to protect his family from the madness outside and what about nathan hed caused irreparable damage to himself whilst on his own outside and that had only been the beginning of his problems today in punishment simon had sent him to his room only for him to stumble back down an hour or so later clutching his stomach hed fallen off his bed and had torn a deep gash in his side struggling to coordinate their clumsy and frustratingly slow movements he and janice had patched up their son as best they could they packed his gaping wound with towels then wrapped virtually an entire roll of gaffer tape around his misshapen gut to keep the wadding in place he now sat on a stiffbacked chair in the corner of the room under orders not to move what we going to do janice asked again simon had lost himself in his thoughts that kept happening stay here he eventually answered open windows upstairsmake it cold block doors go out nathan grumbled from the corner trying to pick a maggot out from a hole in his left leg just above his knee the bones were sticking out of the ends of two of his fingers making them as difficult to use as chopsticks not out simon snapped conscious that their conversation was beginning to sound primitive and almost totally monosyllabic yes out nathan said again bored here cant janice said positioning her tottering halfnaked frame directly in front of what was left of her only child listen to dad no point go out and get hurt simon yelled already dead nathans bizarre but factually correct response completely floored his father his response like many parents who lose an argument with their child was to ignore him not going out end of talk the dark came again then the light then the dark the family had barely moved in hours but as dawn broke on the fourth day after death simon was forced to take action when the bright sun was finally strong enough for him to be able to see out with his increasingly weak and useless eyes he saw that the front of their house was surrounded he staggered towards the window and squinted out the number of dead people crammed into their crowded culdesac had continued to increase during the night just ended the size of the crowd must have reached critical mass the gate had finally given way and their blockpaved driveway was now filled to capacity with rotting flesh there were hundreds of them out there faces pressed against his windows and doors furious and frightened he hobbled over to one side and pulled the curtains shut what matter janice croaked from where she lay slumped in a puddle of herself on the floor outside was all he said as he limped past her and headed for the hall janice picked herself up and followed her rapidly escaping putrefying innards leaving a trail on the carpet behind her nathan watched his parents disappear into the gloom of the rest of the house in the hall simon looked at the front door he could see them moving on the other side barely able to coordinate his movements he purposefully collided with the coat stand by the mirror knocking it sideways it clattered down and more through luck than judgment became wedged across the full width of the door janice bent down and started to pick up the bags coats hats and scarves which had fallen off and lay on the floor windows simon groaned already moving towards the next room janice followed desperately trying to keep him in focus as he stumbled into his office she saw him grab at the venetian blind with bloated hands his stiff twisted fingers became caught in the metal slats and he fell pulling the blind down and revealing another mass of cold emotionless faces outside janice tried to help him up but she couldnt when he crawled away from her she dropped to her knees and tried to pick up the blind out he mumbled pulling himself back up using the door frame for support janice momentarily confused and disorientated managed to work out where he was standing and shuffled towards his voice once shed gone past him simon made a grab for the door handle catching it with his fourth downwards swipe and managing to pull it shut they stood together in the hallway leaning against each other unsteady legs constantly threatening to buckle simon concentrated hard and forced himself to swallow air back door he said then safe all blocked he pushed janice away so that he could move again she toppled back then lurched forward her face slapping against the wall like rotten fruit instinctively she took an unsteady step back and tried to wipe away the stain shed left behind she was still rubbing at it several minutes later when simon limped back towards her in he wheezed his voice barely audible now together they crashed back through the living room door block it careful she mumbled as he moved towards the bookcase adjacent to the door my things she began trying to pick precious items and heirlooms off the shelvesa trophy a crystal decanter a framed photograph of the three of thembut simon wasnt interested summoning all the effort he could muster he pushed and pulled the bookcase until it came crashing down across the living room door trapping them safely inside janice stood and looked at the mess simon collapsed he aimed for the sofa but skidded in another rancid puddle and ended up on the floor he was past caring they were safe the house was secure after a while he looked around the room something was wrong he knew his eyes were failing but he could still see enough to know that someone was missing where nathan janice and simon lasted another eighteen days together they sat slumped on the floor at opposite ends of the living room for more than four hundred hours longer than anyone else for several miles around still recognizable when most others had been reduced to slurry it felt like forever hour after hour after silent empty hour they sat and remembered who they used to be and what they did and how theyd miss all that theyd lost had they been capable of feeling anything the end would have finally come as a relief more than a week after theyd died first simon and then janices brain activity dwindled and then stopped like batteries running flat nathan only lasted a day after going outside his dad had been right about one thing by staying indoors in cool dry conditions their rate of decay had been slowed dramatically but nathan hadnt wanted to sit there doing nothing in his one long day he played football after a fashion made friends with a frog chased a cat tried to climb a tree and explored that part of the garden that mum and dad didnt like him exploring and even when he couldnt move anymore when everything but his brain and his eyes had stopped working he lay on his back on the grass and looked up at the lights and the clouds and the birds and planned what he was going to do tomorrow therapeutic intervention by rory harper rory harpers short fiction has appeared

was published in and was recently reissued by dark star books harper currently blogs at the zombiethemed site eatourbrainscom where this story originally appeared also of interest to zombie lovers might be his two zombie songs fast zombie blues and nothing else better to do both of which are also available at eatourbrainscom some of the major schools of psychotherapy are psychodynamic psychoanalytic eg sigmund freud adlerian cognitivebehavioral existential and rogerian or personcentered therapy pct in pct the therapist repeats key phrases that the client has said which invites the client to elaborate and gradually reveal a wide swath of their thoughts and feelings author blake charlton whose parents are both therapists recently wrote a humorous piece about the first time he had a girl over for dinner and how his parents would ask her things like tell us about your relationship with your mother and so youre disappointed that your mother works so hard in the city which finally led charlton to exclaim no rogerian therapy at the dinner table our next story also deals with a counseling scenario albeit one thats a bit more macabre the author says zombies are on my mind pretty often i was also an addictions counselor for about seventeen years a lot of my sessions bore some similarity to what takes place in this storymore so than you might think there are a fair number of counselor injokes in this story and one reader suggested that it be made into a short film for counselors in training because of the way it illustrates proper responses to common issues and illustrates how good counselors offer empathy and unconditional positive regard to their clients even if your client is a zombie transcript of counseling session with michael rmay good afternoon

bestselling author of dozens of novels including several longrunning series such as the deathstalker series and the darkwood series most of his work over the last several years has been set in either his secret history series or in his popular nightside milieu recent novels include the good the bad and the uncanny and the spy who haunted me a new series the ghost finders is forthcoming greens short fiction has appeared in the anthologies mean streets unusual suspects wolfsbane and mistletoe powers of detection and is forthcoming in my anthology the way of the wizard apocalypse now is a strange wild movie in it director francis ford coppola retells joseph conrads classic colonialera novel heart of darkness by transposing the story to the vietnam war in one scene american soldiers attempt to seize a beachhead while simultaneously blasting wagners ride of the valkyries and surfing robert duvall playing the mad lieutenant colonel bill kilgore stands tall as mortars land all around him and declares i love the smell of napalm in the morning from there things only get stranger and more surreal as martin sheens character captain willard travels farther and farther upriver seeking a rogue colonel named kurtz but the process of filming the movie was as mad and outofcontrol as anything that appears on film drinking and drugs were rampant among the crew a storm destroyed the sets and the borrowed helicopters were called away to fight reallife battles star marlon brando had become grossly obese and refused to be filmed except from the neck up while standing in deep shadow someone on the production had obtained real cadavers to use as props which turned out to have been stolen from local graves and director francis ford coppola who stood to lose everything if the film failed threatened repeatedly to kill himself sounds pretty insane but on the other hand at least they never had to deal with zombies saigon it isnt hell but you can see hell from here viet nam is another world they do things differently here its like going back into the past into the deep pastinto a primitive even primordial place back to when we all lived in the jungle because that was all there was but it isnt just the jungle that turns men into beasts its being so far away from anything you can recognize as human or humane there is no law here no morality none of the old certainties or at least not in any form we know or can embrace why cling to the rules of engagement to honorable behavior to civilized limits when the enemy so clearly doesnt why hide behind the discipline of being a soldier when the enemy is willing to do anything anything at all to win why struggle to stay a man when its so much easier to just let go and be just another beast in the jungle because if you can hang on long enoughyou get to go home being sent to viet nam is like being thrown down into hell while knowing all the time that heaven is just a short flight away but even heaven and hell can get strangely mixed up in a distant place like this there are pleasures and satisfactions to be found in hell that are never even dreamed of in heaven and after a while you have to wonder if the person youve become can ever go home can ever go back to the person he was monsters dont just happen we make them day by day choice by choice i was waiting for my courtmartial and they were taking their own sweet time about it i knew they were planning something special for me the first clue came when they put me up in this ratinfested hotel rather than the cell where i belonged the door wasnt even locked after all where could i go i was famous now everyone knew my face where could i go who would have me who would hide me after the awful thing id done i was told to wait so i waited the army wasnt finished with me yet i wasnt surprised the army could always find work for a monster in viet nam they finally came for me in the early hours of the morning its an old trick catch a man off guard while hes still halfdrugged with sleep and his physical and mental defenses are at their dimmest except i was up and out of bed and on my feet the moment i heard footsteps outside my door hands reaching for weapons i wasnt allowed any more its the first thing you learn in country if you want to stay alive in country so when the two armed guards kicked my door in i was waiting for them i smiled at them showing my teeth because i knew that upset people apparently i dont smile like a person any more the guards didnt react just gestured for me to leave the room and walk ahead of them i made a point of gathering up a few things i didnt need just to show i wasnt going to be hurried but i was more eager to get going than they were finally someone had made a decision the army was either going to give me a mission or put me up against a wall and shoot me and i really wasnt sure which i wanted most i ended up in a cramped little room far away from anything like official channels my armed guard closed the door carefully behind me and locked it from the outside there was a chair facing a desk and a man sitting behind the desk i sat down in the chair without waiting to be asked and the man smiled he was big bulk rather than fat and his chair made quiet sounds of protest whenever he shifted his weight he had a wide happy face under a shaven head and he wasnt wearing a uniform he could have been a civilian contractor or any of a dozen kinds of businessman but he wasnt i knew who he was what he had to be perhaps because one monster can always recognize another youre cia i said and he nodded quickly smiling delightedly and people say youre crazy how little they know captain marlowe i studied him thoughtfully despite myself i was intrigued it had been a long time since i met anyone who wasnt afraid of me the cia man had a slim gray folder set out on the desk before him couldnt have had more than half a dozen pages in it but then id only done one thing that mattered since they dropped me off here and bet me i couldnt survive well i showed them you know my name i said what do i call you you call me sir he laughed silently enjoying the old joke people like me dont have names you should know that most of the time were lucky if we have job descriptions names come and go but the work goes on and you know what kind of work im talking about all the nasty necessary things that the government and the people dont need to know about i operate without restrictions without orders and a lot of the time i make use of people like you captain marlowe because no ones more expendable than a man with a death sentence hanging over him i can do anything i want with you and no one will give a damn situation entirely normal then i said sir he flashed me another of his wide meaningless smiles and leafed quickly through the papers in my file there were photos too and he took his time going through them he didnt flinch once he finally closed the file tapped the blank cover with a heavy finger a few times and then met my gaze squarely you have been a bad boy havent you captain one hundred and seventeen men women and children including babes in arms all wiped out slaughtered on one very busy afternoon deep in country you shot them until you ran out of bullets you bayoneted them until the blade broke and then you finished the rest off with the butt of your rifle your bare hands and a series of improvised blunt instruments you broke in skulls you tore out throats you ripped out organs and you ate them when your company finally caught up with you you were sitting soaking your bare feet in the river surrounded by the dead soaked in their blood calmly smoking a cigarette was it an enemy village captain no did anyone attack you threaten you no so why did you butcher an entire village of civilians captain marlowe i showed him my smile again because it was there because i didnt like the way they looked at me does it matter not particularly no the cia man leaned forward across the desk fixing me with his unblinking happy gaze youre not here to be courtmartialed captain it has already been decided at extremely high levels that none of this ever happened there never was any massacre there never was any crazy captain far too upsetting for the folks at home instead i have been empowered to offer you a very special very important verysensitive mission carry it out successfully and this file will disappear you will be given an honorable discharge and allowed to go home first thing you learn in the army i said is never volunteer especially not for very special important and sensitive missions should you decline this opportunity i am also empowered to take you out the back of this building and put two bullets in your head said the cia man still smiling i surprised him by actually taking a moment to think about it if this mission was too important for the army and too dangerous for the cia and they needed a monster like me to carry it out successfullyit had to involve something even worse than wiping out a whole village of noncombatants and i wasnt sure i wanted to go home after everything id seen and done i still loved the memories i had of family and friends i didnt like to think of their faces when they realized what had come home to them i didnt like to think of them with a monster in their midst walking around hidden behind my old face i didnt want to stay in hell but there was enough of a man left in me that i knew i had no business contaminating the streets of heaven with my bloody presence so i nodded to the cia man and he sank back into his chair which made piteous sounds of protest as his weight settled heavily again he opened a drawer in his desk put away my file and took out another it was much thicker than mine the cover was still blank not even a file number just like mine the cia man opened it took out a glossy by and skimmed it across the desk to me i looked at the photo not touching it the officer looking back at me had all the right stripes and all the right medal ribbons and a bland impassive face with no obvious signs of character or authority that is major kraus said the cia man excellent record distinguished career wrote a good many important papers had a great career ahead of him stateside but he wanted to be here where the action waswhere he could be a real soldier somehow he persuaded his superiors to allow him to go deep in country where he could try out some special new theories of his own the first reports indicated that he was achieving some measure of success later reports were moreambiguous and then the reports stopped we havent heard anything from major kraus in over a year the army sent troops in after him they never reported back we sent some of our people ingood men experienced men we never heard from them again and now reports have begun trickling out of that area mostly from fleeing native villagers they say kraus has assembled his own private army and turned them loose on everything that moves theyre moving inexorably through the jungle killing everything in their path it isnt enemy territory any more but it isnt ours either major kraus seems intent on carving out his own little kingdom in the jungle and we cant have that of course not i said the armys never approved of individual ambition dont push your luck captain your mission is to go up river all the way into the jungle to the majors last reported position evaluate the situation and then put an end to his little experiment i smiled i get to kill a major the cia man smiled back at me thought youd like that if the major cannot be persuaded to rein himself in and follow orders you are empowered to execute him if the situation can be brought back under control do so if not just present us with the exact coordinates and well send the fly boys in to wipe the whole mess right off the map any questions why me because you are completely and utterly expendable captain if you should fail well just find another psycho and send him up the river its not like theres a shortage these days well just keep sending people like you until one of you finally gets the job done were not in any hurry if nothing else major kraus is at least keeping the enemy occupied if i do this and come back i said do i have to go home or could there be more sensitive missions for me why not said the cia man smiling his crocodile smile were always looking for a few good psychos the patrol boat they gave me was a brokendown piece of shit called the suzy q the crew of three that came with her werent much better i gave the pilot what maps i had and then retired to the cabin to be alone i didnt ask their names i didnt want to know they didnt matter to me except to get me where i was going they didnt know it but they were even more expendable than i was they didnt want to talk to me someone had told them who i was and what id done they maintained a safe respectful distance at all times and their hands never moved far from their weapons i smiled at them now and again just to keep them on their toes i watched them die one by one as we headed up the winding river and deep into the dark and savage jungle it doesnt matter how they died the jungle just reached out and took them in its various bloody ways i waited for the darkness to strike me down too but somehow its aim was always that little bit off so when the long and twisting river finally came to its end i was the only one left to guide the suzie q through the narrowing channels to its dark and awful source the jungle pressed in close around me trees and vegetation crowding right up to the rivers edge a harsh green world impenetrable to merely human gaze huge gnarled trees reached out over the water tall branches thrusting forward to meet each other and form a thick canopy that blocked out the sky light had to shoulder its way in heavy golden shafts punching through the canopy like spotlights the air was heavy with the thick green scents of growing things interlaced with the sickly sweet smells of death and corruption great clouds of insects rose up from the river to break against the boats prow and then reform again behind her the darker it got the more at home i felt the other three died because they were still men while i had left that state behind long ago in the jungle in all the places of the world where man is never meant to live you cannot hope to survive if you insist on remaining a man this is a place for beasts for nature red in tooth and claw for animal instincts and brutal drives the jungle knows nothing of human limitations like honor and sentiment compassion and sanity there were still some people in the jungle i saw them passing by grim gray silent ghosts who had made their own bargain with the jungle blackpajama men and women slipping along concealed trails their supplies balanced on carts and bicycles peasant villagers carrying their lifes possessions retreating in the face of something that could not be stopped or bargained with or survived i let them go partly because my mission was too important to risk revealing myself but mostly because i knew that if i started shooting started killing i might not be able to stop id made a cage inside me to hold my beast but the door was only closed not locked i kept the beast quiet traveling up the river by considering all the awful things i was going to do to major kraus before i finally let him die when the maps ran out i just pointed the suzie q forward and kept going the river narrowed steadily closing remorselessly in from both sides the crowded vegetation creeping right up to the edges of both banks to get a good look at me i passed the time studying the majors cia file there were reports of burned out and deserted villages and wide swathes of devastated land radiating out from kraus compound at the end of the river whole populations slaughtered and the bodiesjust gone taken nobody knew kraus private army ranged far and wide butchering every living thing in its path but not one dead body was ever seen afterwards anywhere cannibalism perhaps the file had theories ideas guesses but no one knew anything where kraus was concerned someone had written the words psychological warfare across the bottom of one page but that was all the river finally ran out ending in a wide natural harbor deep in the dark green heart of the jungle the thick crumbling river banks were so close now i could reach out from the suzie q and trail my fingertips along the turgid vegetation and creepers as they drooped down into the dark waters the thick canopy overhead blocked out the sun plunging the river into an endless twilight like the end of the world i had left the world behind to come to a place man should have left behind long ago we have no business here we cannot be man in a place like this the river banks came together closing in like living gates so close now i could barely squeeze the suzie q through and then they opened out abruptly revealing the wide calm waters of the natural harbor where major kraus had established his compound it was very dark now almost night and at first all i could see were the lights up ahead they jumped and flared a sickly yellow like so many willothewisps the river banks rose sharply up around me great clay and earth walls rising twenty thirty feet above my head roots burst out of the wet earth here and there curling around great open mouths dark caves and caverns peering at me from the river banks huge centipedes crawled in and out of the openings slow ripples moving up and down their unnaturally long bodies the waters ahead of me were flat and still disturbed only by the slow sullen waves preceding the boats prow the steady chugging of the boats engine was disturbingly loud in the quiet so i turned it off allowing the boat to glide the rest of the way in there were hundreds of lights now blazing atop the tall river banks like so many watchful eyes there was no dock as such just a natural protrusion of dull gray earth thrusting out into the water i eased the suzie q in beside it and she lurched fitfully to a halt as her prow slammed against the earth dock in a series of slow slowing bumps i left the boat and stepped cautiously out onto dry land it felt like stepping out onto an alien planet and leaving my spaceship behind the tall earth banks were lined from end to end with flaring lights now i craned my head back and dozens of natives looked down at me holding crude flaring torches none of them moved or spoke they just looked a set of rough steps had been cut into the tall earth wall beside me curving slowly upwards they didnt look in any way safe or dependable but i hadnt come this far to be put off by anything less than a gun in my face i started up the steps pressing my left shoulder hard against the yielding clay and earth of the river bank careful not to look anywhere but straight in front of me the steps squelched loudly beneath my boots and my arm and shoulder were soon soaked with slime and seepage from the earth wall i paused beside the first great opening peering into the dark tunnel beyond i seemed to sense as much as hear movement within of something much larger and heavier than a centipede i pressed on stamping my boots heavily into the slippery steps to keep my balance the natives were still looking down at me saying nothing i was out of breath and aching in every limb when i finally reached the top i took a moment to get my breath back and coughed harshly on the rank air the usual jungle stench of living and dying things pressed close together was overwhelmed here by a heavy stench of death and decay close up and personal it was like breathing in rotting flesh like sticking your face into the opened belly of a corpse it was a smell i knew all too well for a moment i wondered whether all of this had been nothing but a dream and i was still back in my village cooling my bare feet in the river and smoking a cigarette as i waited for them to come and find me and all the awful things id done but this stench this place was too vile to be anything but real the natives stood before me holding their torches and every single one of them was dead i only had to look at them to know they stood in endless ranks unnaturally still their eyes not moving and their chests neither rising nor falling flies buzzed and swarmed and crawled all over them some were older than others their flesh desiccated and mummified others were so recent they still bore the dark sticky blood of the wounds that had killed them some had no eyes or great holes in their torsos packed with squirming maggots everywhere i looked there was some new horror of missing limbs or dropped off lower jaws or pale gray and purple strings of intestines spilling out of openedup bellies they carried knives and machetes and vicious clubs all of them thickly crusted with dried blood they wore rags and tatters almost as decayed as their bodies some wore what was left of army uniforms north and south and then it got worse as two of the dead men dropped their torches uncaringly onto the wet ground and moved towards me they did not move as living things move there was nothing of grace or connection in their movements they moved as though movement had been imposed upon them it was horrible to look at an alien utterly unnatural thing as though a tree had ripped up its roots and lurched forward i started to back away and then remembered there was nothing behind me but the earth steps and a long drop i wanted to scream and run and hide but i didnt this was what i had come here for to learn major kraus awful secret the two dead men took me by the arms and hauled me forward i didnt try to fight them their hands were horribly cold on my bare skin they didnt look at me or try to speak to me for which i was grateful i didnt think even i could have stood to learn what a dead mans voice sounded like they led me through the army of the dead across an uneven ground soaked with blood and littered with discarded body parts there were great piles of organs torn away or fallen out revealed suddenly as great clouds of flies sprang into the air at our approach there were hacked off hands and broken heads faces rotted away to reveal wide smiles of perfect teeth my dead guards walked right over them and did not allow me time to be fastidious by the time we got where i was going my boots and trousers were soaked in blood and gore i should never have taken this mission i only thought i knew what hell was id never felt so scared or so alive after the village after what i did there i didnt feel much of anything but now surrounded by death and the fear of something worse than death i felt alive again my heart hammered in my chest and every breath was a glorious thing despite the stench i was here among things that couldnt be shouldnt beand i wanted to know more the men i killed never got up again that would be awful if they should rise up again and look at me with knowing accusing eyes the men who served beside me who were cut down by an often unseen enemythey never rose up again either in viet nam death was the one thing you could depend on exceptnot here what had major kraus done here so far from civilization and sanity who knew what might be possible here so far from science and logic and all the other things man depends on to make sense of his world perhapsif you went back far enough into the past into the jungle you could leave reality behind in favor of a whole new world where anything anything at all was possible my dead guards brought me to a great hole in the ground and stopped they let go of me and just stood there looking at nothing i rubbed my arms hard where their cold flesh had touched mine without menace or care or any feeling at all i looked down into the hole it seemed to fall away deep into the bloodsoaked earth but there was light at the bottom a metal ladder had been roughly attached to one side of the wet earth i started down it i wanted needed answers if answers there were to be had the ladder went down and down a descent long enough to raise fierce cramps in my arms and legs it ended in a tunnel dug deep into the earth of the tall river bank lit by oil lamps set in niches in the earth walls the red clay in the walls gave them a disturbingly organic quality as though i was invited to go stumbling through the guts of some longdead colossus buried ages ago the tunnels were a maze a warren of narrow interconnecting passageways and i soon lost all sense of place or direction i just lurched along following the lit tunnels sweating profusely in the close hot air the lamps had to be for my benefit dead men wouldnt need them it was no wonder the cia mans maps had been so vague about major kraus secret compound hed hidden it underground to conceal just how big it washidden it underground where only the dead men go if the cia had even suspected how big kraus base was how extensive his army they would have sent the fly boys in long ago to burn the whole place back to bare unliving stone clever kraus finally i came to the heart of the labyrinth to the place of the monster to the awful court of major kraus there was no sign no warning no preparation i just rounded a corner and found myself standing in a clean brightlylit earth chamber there were rushes on the floor shelves on the walls holding books and oil lamps and an assortment of presumably precious objects there was a table covered in maps and papers and two surprisingly comfortablelooking chairs but there was no clock anywhere or even a calendar nothing to tell you what time it might be as though time had no meaning here as though it had become irrelevant in this old old place where the dead walked i was in the past now in the deep past in the ancient primordial jungle and that was all that mattered kraus sat in a chair behind his table hands clasped lightly on the tabletop before him and he watched me with calm amused eyes he was alive his chest rose and fell easily as he breathed and his smile was real if thin his simple vitality was like a shock of cold water in the face breaking me out of the nightmare id been wandering through i studied the man id come so far to find he was stick thin without a spare ounce of fat on him as though all such physical weakness has been burned away in some spiritual kiln he had sharp aesthetic features under closecropped hair and even though he was sitting perfectly still and at ease he blazed with barely suppressed nervous energy his spotlessly clean army uniform hung loosely about him as though it had once fitted a much larger man his smile was slight but genuine and his eyes were disturbingly sane i nodded slowly to the man id been sent to kill i never know what to say on occasions like this all my old certainties had been thrown down and trampled into the dirt but still some small spark of stubborn pride wouldnt allow me to blurt out the obvious question major kraus just smiled and nodded back at me as though he quite understood i had no gun or knife dead hands had taken all my weapons from me before i was allowed down the ladder into the underworld i could still kill him with my bare hands id been trained but if i should faili didnt want to die here not in this awful place where the dead didnt stay dead that would be terrible to die and still not know peace kraus gestured easily for me to sit down a calm casual gesture from a man who knew he held all the power in the room just for a moment the major reminded me of the cia man back in saigon i sat down kraus smiled again just a brief movement of the lips revealing stained yellow teeth yes he said theyre dead theyre all dead the ones who brought you here the ones who stand guard and the ones i send out to kill my enemies dead men walking every single one of them torn from their rest raised up out of their graves and set to work by me everyones dead here except me and now you tell me your name soldier captain marlowe i said torn from my cell raised up from my courtmartial and sent here by the cia to kill you major kraus theyre frightened of you of course if they knew what you were really doing here theres nothing they can do to stop me my army is made up of men who are beyond fear or suffering who cannot be stopped by bullets or bombs or napalm zombies captain marlowe old voodoo magic from the deep south of america where the really old ways are not forgotten you neednt worry captain they wont attack you and they certainly wont try and eat you as they did in a cheap horror movie i saw before i came out here into the real horror show that never ends my men have no need to eat any more than they need to drink or piss or sweat they are beyond such human weaknesses now they have no appetites no desires and the only will that moves them is mine i give them purpose for as long as they last they are my warriors of the night my weapons cast against an uncaring world my horror to set against the horror men have made of this place waris too important to be left to the living of course i said numbly the perfect soldiers the dead dont get tired dont get stopped by injuries and will follow any order you give them without question because nothing matters to them any more exactly said kraus favoring me with another brief smile i just point them in the right direction and let them roll right over whatever lies in their path they destroy everything and everyone like army ants on the march most people wont even stand against them any more they just turn and flee as they would in the face of any other natural disaster and if i should lose some men through too much damage i can always make up the numbers again by raising up the fallen enemy dead youre not shocked captain marlowe how very refreshing why this is hell nor am i out of it i murmured i have seen worse things than this major done worse things than this in my time he leaned forward across his desk fixing me with his terribly sane compassionate gaze yesi can see the darkness in you captain tell what you saw and what you did i have been here before i said in country in the dark and terrible place where the old rules mean nothing and so you can do anything anything at all because no matter how bad we are the enemy is always worse ive seen much scarier things than zombies in country im sure you have said kraus they have no idea what its like herethe real people back in their real world where there are laws and conventions right and wrong and everything makes sense they cant know what its like here or why would fathers and mothers allow their sons to be sent into helland then act all surprised when the command structure breaks down army discipline breaks down and their sons have to do awful unforgivable things just to stay alive what did you do captain to earn a mission like this i wiped out a whole village i said killed them all men women and children and then refused to say sorry why captain why would you do such a thing for the first time i was being asked the question by someone who sounded like he actually wanted to hear the truth so i considered my answer seriously why because i wanted to because i could no matter what you do here the jungle always throws back something worsei dont see the enemy as people any more just so many beasts in the jungle the things theyve donethey give the jungles dark savagery a face thats all and after a while after youve done awful terrible things in your turn and it hasnt made a damned bit of differenceyou feel the need to do more and more just to get a response from that bland indifferent jungle face you want to see it flinch make it hurt the way its hurt you that need drives you on to greater and greater acts of savageryuntil finally you look into the face of the jungleand see your own face looking back at you i know said major kraus i understand i sat slumped in my chair exhausted by the force of my words and kraus smiled on me like a father with a prodigal son its the curse of this country this war captain this isnt like any other war we ever fought there are no real battle lines no clear disputed territories no obvious or lasting victories only a faceless enemy an opposing army and a hateful population prepared to do anything anything at all to drive us out any atrocity any crime against nature or civilization is justified to them because we are outsiders and therefore by definition not human there is only one way to win this war captain and that is to be ready and willing to do even worse things to them to embrace the darkness of the jungle in our hearts and in our souls and throw it in their faces we tried to raise a light in the darkness when we should have eaten the darkness up with spoons and made it oursgiven it shape and purpose and meaning i have done an awful and unforgivable thing here captain but for the first time i am making progress i am taking and holding territory and i am forcing the enemy back i will win this war which my own superiors are saying cannot be won i will win it because i am ready and willing to do the one thing the enemy is not willing to do they are ready to fight us to the death but i have made death a weapon i can turn against them and after my dead warriors have subjugated this entire country north and south and i have won because not one living soul remains to stand against me then then i will take the war home i will cross the great waters with a dead army millions strong and i will turn them loose on the streets of america turn them loose on all those uncaring people who sent their children into hell i will make our country a charnel house and then a cemetery and then finally the war will be over and i can rest he looked at me for a long time and his smile and his eyes were kind they sent you here to kill me captain marlowe those cold and uncaring men but you wont because thats not what you really want stay here with me and be my boswell write the record of what i am doing and then i will send it home ahead of the army thats coming as a warning its only right they should understand their crime before they are punished for it tell my story captain marlowe and when i dont need you any morei promise i will kill you and let you stay dead no more bad thoughts no more bad dreams no more darkness in the heart you will rest easy sleep without dreams and feel nothing nothing at all isnt that what you really want captain marlowe yes i said oh yes major kraus smiled happily i shall put an end to all wars and death shall have dominion when johnny comes marching home the horror the horror he said laughing last stand by kelley armstrong kelley

wwii soldiers speculate endlessly about the former profession of their captain before he finally reveals to them that he had been a simple schoolteacher war and upheaval can shuffle the world thrusting us into roles we could have never imagined in our next story we find another former teacher leading military forces under desperate circumstances doing things she never thought shed be capable of and facing off against an enemy more relentless and implacable than she ever could have feared if you had to make a last stand for the survival of your race monica supposed there were worse places to do it as she gazed out over the fort walls she could imagine fields of green and gold corn stalks swaying in the breeze how long had it been since shed tasted corn monica closed her eyes and remembered august backyard barbecues the smell of ribs and burgers on the grill the chill of an icy beer can as jim pressed it to her back the sound of lilys laughter as she darted past chasing the other children with water balloons monica opened her eyes and looked out at the scorched fields shed been the one whod given the order to set the blaze but there hadnt been corn in them not for years only barren fields of grass and weeds that could hide the enemy best put to the torch commander a voice said behind her she turned and a pimply youth snapped his heels together and saluted the newer ones did that sometimes and shed stopped trying to break them of the habit they needed to believe they were in a proper army with proper rules even if theyd never worn a uniform before it was what kept them going let them believe they could actually win this war hendrix just radioed the youth said hes bringing in the latest group of prisoners monica nodded and followed him off the ramparts they passed two teenage girls in scout uniforms they nodded gazes down and murmured polite greetings monica hid a smile thinking that once upon a time shed have killed to get that respect from girls their age back when shed stood at the front of a classroom she thought about all the kids shed taught wondered where they were now how many were others how many were dead too many in the last category she was sure what would they think seeing their chemistry teacher leading the last band of resistance fighters could they ever imagine it she couldnt imagine it herself some days as she followed the youth into the fort gareth swung out from the shadows he fell into step beside her his left foot scraping the floora broken leg that never healed quite right before he could say a word she lifted her hand objection noted lieutenant i didnt say a word commander he said you dont need to you heard were bringing in a fresh lot and youre going to tell meagainthat we cant handle more prisoners the stockade is overcrowded were wasting manpower guarding them were wasting doctors caring for them we should take them out into the field kill them and leave the corpses on spikes for the others to see i dont believe ive suggested that last part brilliant idea though ill send a troop to find the wood for the poles she shot him a look he only grinned we arent animals lieutenant she said we dont stoop to their level of course he knew shed say that just as well as she knew his complaint gareth just liked to voice his opinion loudly and frequently shed answered only for the sake of the new recruit leading them when they reached the main hall she heard the cry prisoners on the grounds for the newer ones it was a warning and they scattered in every direction monica never tried to make them stand their ground she understood too well where that fear came from those years of hiding watching waiting to run again she did however ask her officers to take note of those who fled and later theyd be taken to the stockades so they could see that the others werent the allpowerful demons of their nightmares once they were convinced theyd react to that cry very differently theyd join the other soldiers now lining stockade walk to watch the parade of prisoners they wouldnt jeer wouldnt say a word would just stand firm and watch the hatred so thick you could smell it heavy suffocating as they walked into the main hall already choked with soldiers gareth said you can watch from the second floor commander like hell a wave went through the assembled men and women grunts and nods of approval from those whod overheard whispers going down the line to those who hadnt yet another crowdpleasing routine she thought wryly gareth won approval for the suggestion and she for refusing as they entered the hall gareths shoulders squared pulling himself up to his full sixfootfive his limp disappearing the crowd of soldiers parted to let them through those who didnt move fast enough earned a glower from gareth and scrambled aside so fast they tripped him they feared and respected her they loved and respected yet another of their routines monica took up her usual position at the first corner when the prisoners walked into the hall shed be the first one they saw waiting at the end she could hear them outside the doors now this was the toughest part nearly every man and woman in this hall had been in this same situation waiting in their hideouts hearing the others approaching praying they passed oh god praying they passed gareth moved up behind her out of sight of the soldiers he rubbed the small of her back when the footsteps stopped at the door a few soldiers broke ranks and shamefaced bolted back to their bunks it was still too much for them the memories too fresh the door started to open monicas own memories flashed in that first moment she didnt see soldiers and prisoners she saw the gang of others whod burst into her own hideaway ten years ago she heard jims shout of rage as he rushed forward to protect them yelling for monica to take lily and run she heard his screams as they fell on him she heard lilys screams as she saw her father torn apart she heard her own screams as she grabbed lily and ran for the basement as they caught her ripping lily from her arms her screams for them to show mercylily was only a child only a little girl they hadnt gareth moved closer letting her rest against him he leaned down to murmur reassurances in her ear then as she relaxed the reassurances turned to reminders stand tall babe youre in charge now you own their asses dont let them forget that now she saw prisoners strangers not the monsters whod slaughtered her family raped and tortured her broken and cowed and filthy they shuffled along the gauntlet of soldiers gareth tensed monica looked up sharply gaze tripping over the prisoners trying to see which one had triggered his old cop instincts sure enough there was one at the end long greasy hair hanging in his face but not quite hiding the furtive looks he kept shooting her way she stood firm gaze on the prisoner he looked away as he passed then he wheeled and lunged at her gareth leapt forward so fast all monica saw was a blur and a flash of silver the prisoners head sailed from his shoulders it hit the floor with a dull thud and rolled when it came to rest at a soldiers feet the young woman kicked it a cheer started to surge choked off at a simple no from monica she motioned for someone to clean up the mess the procession of prisoners continued on none even gave any sign theyd seen what happened they just trudged along gazes down until they disappeared from sight word came next that the scouts had been spotted they were moving fast meaning they were bringing bad news she left the hall with gareth and headed for the meeting room to await their arrival as they passed the lecture hall monica could hear the teacher giving a history lesson for the children all born after the great divide three flu epidemics had threatened the world in the decade preceding the great divide as theyd escaped each relatively unscathed experts swore theyd only dodged one bullet to put themselves in the path of a bigger one the hn virus had started in indonesia with sporadic outbreaks downplayed by authorities until they could announce a vaccine their salvation turned into their damnation some said the vaccine had been deliberately tampered with others blamed improper testing they knew only that it didnt work no that wasnt true if the goal was to ensure that people survived the flu then it worked perfectly people were vaccinated they caught the virus they died and they rose again even before they rose though theyd carried a virus of their own unknowingly spreading it through lovers drug use and blood donations by the time officials realized the problem a quarter of the population was infected after the vaccinations stopped another quarter died from the influenza itself both viruses continued to spread that was the great divide the human race sliced in two one side fighting for supremacy the other for survival the world will end not with a bang but with a sniffle or to be precise with the risk of a sniffle after monica escaped her captors her only thought had indeed been survival her own but as she ran from the hordes shed picked up others like a magnet attracts iron filings everyone was alone everyone needed help as a mother she wanted to protect them as a teacher she wanted to guide them within a year she found herself leading twenty survivors then they found gareth hed been in the middle of what had once been a town square fighting a halfdozen of the others a roaring whirlwind of blood and steel fighting valiantly but wounded and outnumbered theyd rescued him his story was one of the simpler onesno family slaughtered before his eyes just one guy living a normal life until the day he wasnt hed tried to stick to what he knewbeing a cop protecting the innocent which these days meant roaming the countryside fighting bands of others so survivors could escape a noble plan if not terribly efficient monica had suggested that if he really wanted people to protect he could look after them and so it began ten years later they were here commanding what might well be the last of their kind awaiting a final battle a battle they knew they couldnt win the scouts news was exactly what shed expected the others were amassing just beyond a forest to the east the only place for miles that couldnt be seen from the ramparts when shed ordered her troops to raze the fields theyd started cutting down the forest then realized the task was beyond them besides shed reasoned that meant the others would pick that spot for their camp so she could concentrate their surveillance there surveillance it sounded so strategic as if they were fully prepared to meet the enemy simply biding their time when the truth was that they were foxes backed into a den waiting for the wolves to arrive she hadnt brought them here to die shed hoped by running so far theyd send a message to the others look youve won weve holed up here in this wasteland and here well stay now just leave us alone please leave us alone one last plea for mercy it was she realized as the scouts gave their report too much to hope for deep down shed always known it was prepare a reconnaissance team monica said as she rose from the table well leave at the first night bell two of the trained scouts exchanged uneasy looks theyd come from the true military teams long since disbanded where commanding officers stayed behind the enemy lines they glanced at gareth as if hoping hed advise her to stay behind you heard commander roth he said get that team ready monica was back on the ramparts looking out over the barren fields waiting for the team to convene below the faint scrape of gareths dragging boot told her he was coming but she didnt turn just stood at the railing looking out until she felt his arms around her waist we knew this was coming he said i know were as prepared as were ever going to be i know theres still one more option he said no just saying and im saying that i know its an option ill remember its an option but she inhaled and shook her head he pulled her back against him chin resting on her head and she relaxed against the solid wall of his chest she felt his head turn as he made sure there was no one around before he leaned down and kissed her neck his lips cool against her skin those whod been with them a long time knew they were lovers had been for years as discreet as they were it was hard to hide something like that living in close quarters they were still careful though for the sake of those like the scouts whod come from the troops where such a thing would be a serious concern there werent many of them lefttrue soldiers trained ones military commander had never been monicas role years ago when theyd started meeting up with other groups of survivors shed made it clear that she wasnt cut out for that shed take charge of the civilians gareth had been invited to lead a military division but hed stayed with her trained the civilians to protect themselves then one by one the troops had fallen the few survivors making their way to monicas group until they were all that remained now they looked to her to protect them and she wasnt sure she could by the time they left night had fallen that wasnt an accident they traveled at night when they could moving silently across the burned fields the same open land that protected them from sneak attacks made them prisoners during the daylight it was an hours walk to the forests edge theyd just drawn within sight of it when they heard a barely muffled gasp of pain ahead theyd split up gareth and monica proceeding the others fanning out the stifled whimpers came from just past the first line of trees it sounded like a child but they continued ahead with caution gareth in the lead machete drawn those were the best weapons they hadknives and spears and makeshift swords they had guns too but without ammunition they were little more than clubs the others were no better off this was a primitive war of tooth and claw and steel as it had been for years the munitions factories among the earliest targets monicas weapon of choice was a throwing knife and she had one in each hand as she followed gareth at the rustle of undergrowth he stopped and she peered around him to see a figure rising between the trees oh thank god a girls voice said oh thank god the figure wobbled then dropped with a cry they found her on the ground clutching her leg as she lit a lantern she was no more than eighteen thinfaced and pale i thought you were the infected she said her voice breathy with relief they got the rest of my troop ii tried to fight shhh monica said moving closer the girl looked up at them seeing gareths scarred face she gave a start but monica nudged him back he slid into the shadows they took the others the girl said they took them all monica crouched beside the girl well get you back to your camp we just arrived ourselves reinforcements she offered her most reassuring smile youll have to show us the best way to go in case more of them are out here the girl nodded and reached up monica tucked the throwing knives into her waistband halter and tried to take the girls arm but the girl clasped hers instead fingers biting in as she rose slowly then she yanked monica toward her silver flashed as the girls free hand pulled a knife from under her jacket monicas foot expertly snagged the girls wounded leg and she went down the knife flying free monica kicked it out of the way as the girl grabbed for it another kick to the girls stomach and she fell doubledover and gasping did you really think i didnt know what you are the girl snarled between gasps did you think i couldnt smell what you are no gareth said stepping forward machete whispering as it brushed his leg and did you really think we wouldnt smell an ambush he swung the machete as the forest around them erupted others lunging out from their hiding places the girl tried to scuttle back but he was too fast her head flew from her shoulders blood jetted up her body convulsing in death the others stopped all frozen in midstep staring what gareth boomed bloody machete raised isnt that what you do to us lop off our heads the only way to be sure were dead well it works for you too he smiled his scarred face a pale death mask against the night any volunteers you may want to consider it monica said her quiet voice cutting through the silence because if you look over your shoulders youll see we arent alone and they wont kill you theyll turn you she looked around her perfect night vision picking out each face her gaze meeting each set of wide eyes theyll infect you gareth roared giving the signal for attack and the forest erupted again as their soldiers leapt from the undergrowth and swung from the trees in that first wave of attack some of the others bolted more ran after a few halfhearted swings of a blade she had invoked the greatest weapon they possessed fear fear of becoming infected fear of becoming like us without that weapon theyd have been massacred even with it the fight was long and bloody finally they were left standing among bodies some their own but most not and that was really all they could hope for they continued on theyd come to see the others camp and they werent turning back it was a slower walk now trudging through the forest some of them wounded nothing was fatalfew things were for thembut injuries healed slowly and imperfectly like gareths broken leg and scarred face it was as with everything about their condition a tradeoff in some ways better than life before in others worse as a teacher monica had been one of the first to be inoculated along with her family one of the first vaccinated one of the first infected one of the first to die the virus had hit with lightning speed leaving her writhing with pain and fever listening to her daughters screams unable to get to her then a miracle or so it seemed at the time death and rebirth before they could even decide what to do the soldiers came the first squads deployed with orders to annihilate the infected theyd gone into hiding staying one step ahead of the death squads squatting in abandoned homes certain if they could just wait it out the authorities would realize their mistake and help them but the order to kill all infected stayed then came the bounty then the gangs of bloodcrazed bounty hunters theyd escaped the death squads but not the gangs jim had blamed zombie movies when the dead rose again people were sure they knew what they facedan undead scourge that would end life as they knew it some of the old stories were true the infected could not be easily killed they carried the pallor of death the faint smell of rot their bite could infect the living they fed on meat preferably raw and while they had no particular hunger for human flesh it was true that if driven mad with hunger they had been known to do what they would otherwise never consider but unlike the zombies of legend and lore they were still alive in every way that counted still cognizant and they could be reasoned with the same could not be said for the livingfor the others the infected had been hunted to near extermination and now when monica finally set eyes on the others camp those seemingly infinite tents she knew their end was at hand we cant fight this she whispered to gareth but we will and that was what it came down to they would fight hopeless or not they started back for the fort she let gareth take the lead her mind whirring with everything she needed to do she didnt notice when she veered slightly off course didnt notice the tripwire didnt notice until her foot snagged it and she heard gareths shout and saw him diving toward her shoving her out of the way heard the explosion saw the flying debris and saw him sail backward hitting the ground hard enough to make the earth shake she raced over and dropped beside him shit he said rising on his elbows to look down at his chest his shirt shredded the flesh below shredded too a mangled cratered mass thats not good she let out a choking sound meant to be a laugh but coming out as a sob itd been a small blast a homemade bomb designed to do nothing more than shoot shrapnel but all that shrapnel had slammed into gareths chest if he hadnt been infected hed have been dead before he hit the ground she waved the medic over but one look at his face told her all she needed to know they could recover from most injuries but if the damage was too great too extensive oh god not gareth please not gareth she stayed beside him as the medic took a closer look the soldiers ringed around them solemnfaced a few shaking arms around each other when the medic looked up to give his report gareth waved the soldiers back out of earshot they hesitated but obeyed at a growl from him i can make him comfortable the medic murmured get him back to the fort waste of time gareth said someones bound to have heard that blast get them moving before no monica said youre coming if i need to carry you myself she expected him to argue but he gave a slow nod youre right they dont need this not now take me back tell them ill pull through that wasnt what she meant at all but he had a point their best warriora man whod singlehandedly annihilated mobs of otherskilled by a simple tripwire bomb that was a blow to morale they could ill afford the medic bound gareths chest while the soldiers fashioned a makeshift stretcher from branches and clothes and they took gareth back to the fort monica stood on the guards balcony overlooking the stockade crammed with others prisoners of war that had been her policy from the start leave as many of the enemy alive as possible bring them here keep them alive and comfortable use them as bargaining chips and as proof to the others that they werent monsters it hadnt mattered her missives to the government had gone unanswered as they always had for years shed tried to reason with the others first to negotiate then as their numbers dwindled to beg for mercy she understood that they posed a threat so theyd go away far from the living the others might as well have been getting letters from a colony of diseased rats eventually shed realized that was exactly how they saw the infecteddiseased rats that somehow had the power of communication but rats nonetheless subhuman dangerous a threat requiring swift and thorough extermination she looked out at the others and thought of what gareth had said the final option back when shed first started arguing for the taking of prisoners the other commanders had seen the possibilities horrified shed fought until the option was off the table only it wasnt really it never had been she left the guardroom and walked through the fort she passed the rooms of soldiers playing card games of civilians mending clothing and preparing meals of children listening to stories at the feet of the old ones everywhere she looked people were carrying on hiding their fear laughing and talking just trying to live just trying to live thats all theyd ever asked for and that was all she ever wanted for them so how far was she willing to go not to save themshe wasnt sure that was even possible anymorebut to give them every possible chance for survival how far would she go as far as she could three days later she was back on the balcony overlooking the stockade gareth was beside her i need to be there hed said they need to see me standing there so the doctors had done what they could binding him up and shed done what she could washing away the worst of the stink of rot that had set in theyd cleared the hall and carried him on a stretcher to the stockade door hed taken it from there finding the strength to walk up to the guard post he stood in front of a pillar and she knew he leaned against it but to those below their champion was back on his feet and now with this new hope shed given them so were they once again she looked out over the men and women packed into the room below only this time they looked back at her more than one hundred and fifty trained soldiers on their feet watching her in those faces she saw fear and uncertainty she saw hate too but less of that surprisingly less guards ringed the room civilians walked up and down the aisles with trays of meat cooked meat because for now that would make them comfortable they gave the hostages as much as they wanted that would help so too would the doctors slipping along silent as wraiths watching for signs of trouble others in the back room dosing the meat with mild sedatives the transition had gone smoother than shed expected the doctors assured her it would but shed seen one too many hellish deaths and rebirths to truly believe them they were right though after all these years the virus had mutated ensuring its own survival by making the process faster less traumatic one shot of the virus then a deathinducing dose of sedative within a day rebirth and now two days later an army to command she started her speech with a history lesson how the others had driven them to this place how theyd fought the sporadic incursions killing only those they could not capture how theyd treated the prisoners of war humanely every man and woman there could attest to that but now with the wolves at their door refusing to negotiate theyd been forced to do the unthinkable we need soldiers to fight she said her voice ringing through the stockade right now im sure you dont feel much like helping us but you wont be fighting for us youll be fighting for yourselves you are us now you are infected every one of you is now free to walk out our front gates but you wont because you know they wont let you your brothersinarms your friends your familiesevery one of them would lop off your head if you walked into that camp because you are no longer human you are infected she paused to let her words sink in behind her gareth shifted struggling to stay on his feet she glanced at him he smiled and whispered that she was doing fine she turned back to the troops to everyone you left behind you are now dead do you feel dead they shuffled the sound crossing the stockade in a wave to everyone you left behind you are now a monster do you feel like a monster more shuffling sporadic grunts to everyone you left behind you have no right to live another glance at gareth he stood straighter chin lifting he was dying they all were and this was how they had to face it stand tall and refuse to let death win so easily theyd cheated it before now they had to cheat it again she turned back to the crowd below do you want to live she paused are you willing to fight to live the answer came softly at first her own troops calling back gradually more voices joined them the new soldiers joining in their shouts boosting the confidence of the others until the cry ran through the fort gareth moved up behind her his fingers sliding around her waist his touch icecold now you gave them hope he said you gave them a chance she nodded it wasnt much but it was the best she could do maybe just maybe it would be

adding bone muscle and finally flesh zombies are typically missing a lot of their skin and we can see right through to their innards but what if as with watchmens dr manhattan they are in the process not of decomposing but coalescing and what if as the process continues it becomes harder and harder to tell whos human and who isnt this sort of paranoia has inspired a lot of great science fiction from invasion of the body snatchers to the philip k dickinspired film blade runner in which humanseeming replicants can only be identified by subtle variations in their emotional responses in john carpenters the thing based on a short story by john w campbell a research team at a remote arctic compound realizes that some of them have been replaced by shapeshifting aliens and the only way to know for sure whos human is to jam a hot wire into samples of their blood and see if the blood tries to crawl away our next story takes some of these notions and runs with them but these zombies arent just out to eat your brains theyve got something bigger in mind much bigger listen dont try to speak dont try to move listen to me listen to my story everyone remembers their first time the first time they saw a zombie and knew it for what it was but my first time was one of the first times ever it was so early in the invasion that i wasnt sure what was happening so early we didnt yet call them zombies it was in the churchyard of st pancras old church in the fabulous long lost city of london oh its still there more or less its one of the few big cities that didnt get hit in the last crazy days of global spasm but its lost to us now because it belongs to them anyway st pancras old church was one of the oldest sites of christian worship in europe thered been a church there in one form or another for one and a half thousand years and although the railway lines to st pancras station ran hard by its north side it was an isolated and slightly spooky place full of history and romance mary wollstonecraft godwin was buried there and it was at her graveside that her daughter who later wrote frankenstein first confessed her love to the poet shelley and he to her in his first career as an architects assistant the novelist thomas hardy supervised the removal of bodies when the railway was run through part of the churchyard and set some of the displaced gravestones around an ash tree that was later named after him i lived nearby i was a freelance science journalist then and when i was working at home and the weather was good i often ate my lunch in the churchyard thats where i was when i saw my first zombie i can see that you dont understand much of this its all right you are young things had already changed when you were born and much that was known then is unknowable now but im trying to set a mood an emotional tone because its how you respond to the mood and emotions of my story thats important thats why you have to listen carefully thats why you are gagged and bound and wired to my machines listen it was a hot day in june in that ancient and hallowed ground i was sitting on a bench in the sundappled shade of hardys ash tree and eating an eggandcress sandwich and thinking about the article i was writing on cosmic rays when i saw him it looked like a man anyway a ragged man in a long black raincoat ropy hair down around his face as he limped towards me with a slow and stiff gait halting and raising his head and looking all around and then shambling on the tail of his black coat dragging behind i didnt pay much attention to him at first i thought he was a vagrant we are all of us vagrants now but in the long ago most of us had homes and families and only the most unfortunate slaves to drink or drugs lost souls brought down by misfortune or madness lived on the streets vagrants were drawn to churchyards by the quietness and sense of ancient sanctuary and there was a hospital at the west end of the churchyard of old st pancras where they went to fill their prescriptions and get treatment for illness or injury so he wasnt an unusual sight shambling beneath the trees in a slow and wavering march past mary godwins grave towards hardys ash and the little church then a dog began to bark a woman with several dogs on leads and several more trotting freely called to the little wirehaired terrier that was dancing around the vagrant in a fury of excitement two more dogs ran up to him and began to bark too their coats bristling and ears laid flat i saw the vagrant stop and shake back the ropes from his face and look all around and for the first time i saw his face it was dead white and broken like a vase shattered and badly mended my first thought was that hed been in a bad accident something involving glass or industrial acids then i saw that what i had thought were ropes of matted hair were writhing with slow and awful independence like the tentacles of a sea creature saw that the tattered raincoat wasnt a garment it was his skin falling stiff and black around him like the wings of a bat the dog woman started screaming shed had a clear look at the vagrant too her dogs pranced and howled and whined and barked i was on my feet so were the handful of other people whod been spending a lazy lunch hour in the warm and shady churchyard one of them must have had the presence of mind to call the police because almost at once or so it seemed there was the wail of a siren and a prickle of blue lights beyond the churchyard fence and two policemen in yellow stab vests came running they stopped as soon as they saw the vagrant one talked into the radio clipped to his vest the other began to round everyone up and lead us to the edge of the churchyard and all the while the vagrant stood at the centre of a seething circle of maddened dogs looking about clubbed hands held out in a gesture of supplication a hole yawned redly in his broken white face and shaped hoarse and wordless sounds of distress more police came the road outside the churchyard was blocked off a helicopter clattered above the tops of the trees the men in hazmat suits entered the park one of them carried a rifle by this time everyone who had been in the park was penned against a police van the police wouldnt answer our questions and we were speculating in a fairly calm and english way about terrorism that was the great fear in the long ago ordinary men moving amongst us armed with explosives and hateful certainty we all started when we heard the first shot the chorus of barks doubled redoubled a dog ran pellmell out of the churchyard gate and a marksman shot it there in the road and the woman who still held the leashes of several dogs cried out men in hazmat suits separated us and made us walk one by one through a shower frame theyd assembled on the pavement and made us climb one by one in our wet and stinking clothes into cages in the backs of police vans i was in quarantine for a hundred days when i was released the world had changed forever i had watched it change on tv and now i was out in it soldiers everywhere on the streets security checks and sirens and a constant lowlevel dread lynch mobs public hangings and burnings ten or twenty onthespot executions in london alone each and every day quarantined areas cleared and barricaded invaders everywhere by now everyone was calling them zombies we knew that they werent our own dead come back to walk the earth of course but thats what they most looked like more and more of them were appearing at random everywhere in the world and they were growing more and more like us the first zombies had been only approximations barely human in appearance with a brain and lungs and a heart but little else by way of internal organs only slabs of muscle that stored enough electrical energy to keep them alive for a day or so but they were changing evolving adapting after only a hundred days they were almost human the first had seemed monstrous and pitiful now they looked like dead men walking animated showroom dummies almost human but not quite after i was released from quarantine i went back to my trade interviewing scientists about the invasion writing articles there were dozens of theories but no real evidence to support any of them the most popular was that we had been targeted for invasion by aliens from some far star that the zombies were like the robot probes we had dispatched to other planets and moons in the solar system growing ever more sophisticated as they sent back information to their controllers it made a kind of sense although it didnt explain why although they had plainly identified us as the dominant species their controllers didnt try to contact us experiments of varying degrees of cruelty showed that the zombies were intelligent and selfaware yet they ignored us unless we tried to harm or kill them otherwise they simply walked amongst us and no matter how many were detected and destroyed there were always more of them the most unsettling news came from an old and distinguished physicist a nobel laureate who told me that certain of the fundamental physical constants seemed to be slowly and continuously changing he had been trying to convey the urgent importance of this to the government but as i discovered when i tried to use my contacts to bring his findings to the attention of ministers and members of parliament and civil servants the government was too busy dealing with the invasion and the consequences of the invasion there was an old and hopeful lie that an alien invasion would cause the nations of earth to set aside their differences and unite against the common enemy it didnt happen instead global paranoia and suspicion ratcheted up daily the zombies were archetypal invaders from within hatreds and prejudices that once had been cloaked in diplomatic evasions were now nakedly expressed several countries used the invasion as an excuse to attack troublesome minorities or to accuse old enemies of complicity with the zombies there were genocidal massacres and brush fire wars across the globe iran attacked iraq and israel with nuclear weapons and what was left of israel wiped out the capital cities of its neighbours india attacked pakistan china and russia fought along their long border the united states invaded cuba and venezuela tried to close its borders with canada and mexico and took sides with china against russia and so on and so on the zombies didnt have to do anything to destroy us we were tearing ourselves apart we grew weaker as we fought each other and the zombies grew stronger by default in britain everyone under thirty was called up for service in the armed forces and then everyone under forty was called up too three years after my first encounter i found myself in a troop ship at the tail end of a convoy wallowing through the bay of biscay towards the mediterranean huge columns of zombies were straggling out of the sahara desert we were supposed to stop them slaughter them but as we approached the straits of gibraltar someone it was never clear who dropped a string of nuclear bombs on zombies massing in algeria tunisia libya and egypt on our ships we saw the flashes of the bombs light the horizon an hour later we were attacked by the remnants of the libyan and egyptian air forces half our fleet were sunk the rest limped home britains government was still intact more or less but everyone was in the armed forces now defending ourselves from the zombies and from waves of increasingly desperate refugees from the continent there was a year without summer snow in july crops failed and despite rationing millions died of starvation and cold there were biblical plagues of insects and all the old sicknesses came back and still the zombies kept appearing they looked entirely human now but it was easy to tell what they were because they werent starving or haunted or mad we kept killing them and they kept coming they took our cities from us and we fled into the countryside and regrouped and they came after us and we broke into smaller groups and still they came after us we tore ourselves apart trying to destroy them yet we still didnt understand them we didnt know where they were coming from what they were what they wanted we grew weaker as they grew stronger do you understand me i think that you do your pulse rate and pupil dilation and skin conductivity all show peaks at the key points of my story thats good that means you might be human listen let me tell you what the distinguished old physicist told me let me tell you about the observer effect and boltzmann brains in the nineteenth century the austrian physicist ludwig boltzmann developed the idea that the universe could have arisen from a random thermal fluctuation like a flame popping into existence an explosion from nowhere much later other physicists suggested that similar random fluctuations could give rise to anything imaginable including conscious entities in any shape or form boltzmann brains it was one of those contraintuitive and mostly theoretical ideas that helped cosmologists shape their models of the universe and how we fit into it it helped to explain why the universe was hospitable to the inhabitants of an undistinguished planet of an average star in a not very special galaxy in a group of a million such and that group of galaxies one of millions more we are typical ordinary and because we are ordinary our universe is ordinary too because there is no objective reality beyond that which we observe because according to quantum entanglement pairs of particles share information about each others quantum states even when distance and timing means that no signal can pass between them because observation is not passive because our measurements influence the fundamental laws of the universe they create reality but suppose other observers outnumbered us what would happen then the probability of even one boltzmann brain appearing in the fourteen billion years of the universes history is vanishingly small but perhaps something changed the local quantum field and made it more hospitable to them perhaps the density of our own consciousness attracted them as the mass of a star changes the gravitational field and attracts passing comets or perhaps the inhabitants of another universe are interfering with our universe perhaps the zombies are their avatars boltzmann brains that pop out of the energy field and change our universe to suit their masters simply because they think differently and see things differently this was what the old physicist told me in the long ago he had evidence too simple experiments that measured slow and continuous changes in the position of the absorption lines of calcium and helium and hydrogen in the suns spectrum in standards of mass and distance and in the speed of light he believed that the fundamental fabric of the universe was being altered by the presence of the zombies and that those changes were reaching back into the past and forward into the future just as a pebble dropped into a pond will send ripples spreading out to either side every time he checked the historical records of the positions of those absorption lines they agreed with his contemporaneous measurements even though those measurements were continuously changing we are no longer what we once were but we are not aware of having changed because our memories have been changed too do you see why this story is important it is not just a matter of my survival or even the survival of the human species it is a matter of the survival of the entire known universe the zombies have already taken so much from us the few spies and scouts who have successfully mingled with them and escaped to tell the tale say that they are demolishing and rebuilding our cities day and night they ebb and flow through the streets in tidal masses like army ants or swarming bees under the flickering auroras of strange energies they are as unknowable to us as we are to them listen this is still our world that it is still comprehensible to us that we can still survive in it suggests that the zombies have not yet won an outright victory it suggests that the tide can be turned we have become vagrants scattered across the face of the earth and now we must come together and go forward together but the zombies have become so like us that we cant trust any stranger we cant trust someone like you who stumbled out of the wilderness into our sanctuary thats why you must endure this test like mantids or spiders we must stage fearful courtship rituals before we can accept strangers as our own i want you to survive this i really do there are not many of us left and you are young you can have many children many little observers listen this world can be ours again it has been many years since the war and its old beauty is returning now that civilisation has been shattered it has become like eden again tell me is a world as wild and clean and beautiful as this not worth saving was the sky never so green or grass never so blue dating in dead world by joe mckinney joe mckinneys latest

and going out on a date can quickly turn into the stuff of nightmares in the movie first dates adam sandler attempts to woo drew barrymore only to discover that shes afflicted by a rare condition that causes her to forget theyve ever met every time she falls asleep in theres something about mary ben stiller goes to pick up cameron diaz for the prom only to suffer a horrifying mishap involving a zipper but at least those guys never had to deal with the situation presented in our next story the author says after i finish a novel im usually struck by a sort of separation anxiety so much mental effort is put into worldbuilding and getting to know the characters so what i usually do is write a few short stories set in the world of the novel ive just finished dating in dead world was a part of that process he adds right before i left for my first date my dad gave me the only bit of parental sex education i ever received he said remember this you will be held personally accountable for everything that happens to that girl from the moment she leaves her front door to the moment she walks back in it conduct yourself accordingly it wasnt until after id written this story that i realized i was channeling that advice i guess it took heather ashcroft told me to come to the main entrance of her fathers compound she said the guards there would know my name theyd be expecting me they were expecting me all right four of them had their machine guns trained on me while a voice on a pa speaker barked orders turn off your motorcycle and dismount the voice was clear sharp professional i did what i was told step forward stand on the red square i did that too stand still for the dogs three big black german shepherds were led out of the guard shack and began circling me sniffing me cadaver dogs trained to sniff out necrotic tissue no surprise there even the smaller compounds use them and the one i was about to enter was no minor league operation dave ashcroft controls the largest baronage in south texas and his security is top notch im andrew hudson i said im here to see heather ashcroft were going out on somebody called off the dogs and two of the guards came forward one of them used the barrel of his weapon to point me towards a table next to the guard shack stand on that green square face the table you fellas sure put a guy through a lot of trouble for a first date i said i gave him a winning grin he wasnt impressed move he said he asked me what weapons i was carrying and i told him put them in there he said and pointed to a red plastic box on the corner of the table im gonna get those back right he ran a metal detector over my body taking extra care to get up inside the flaps of my denim jacket under my hair up into my crotch a guard fieldstripped my weapons i am gonna get those back right when you come out he said nobodys allowed to be armed around mr ashcroft but im not here to see mr ashcroft i said im taking his daughter out for a date he rattled a smaller box ammunition too i unloaded my pockets there was no need to tell him about the extra magazines in my bikes saddle bags they were already searching those he looked me over again and i could tell by his face that he didnt see anything but a street urchin from the zone get in that jeep over there he said well drive you into the compound several machine guns turned my way i shrugged and got in i hadnt been allowed within the inner perimeter fence on my earlier visits so what i saw when i did finally get inside took my breath away outside the compound downtown san antonio was an endless sprawl of vacant crumbling buildings lath visible in the walls no doors in the doorways every window broken everywhere you turned there were ruins and fire damage and rivers of garbage spilling out into the streets its been sixteen years since the fall and the streets are still full of zombies but inside ashcrofts compound life looked like it was starting to make a comeback he controlled most of the medicines weapons and fuel that south texas needed and it had made him rich enough to carve his own private paradise out of fifteen square blocks of hell sitting in the back of the jeep i rode down what had once been alamo street and tried not to look like a barefoot barbarian gawking at the wonders of rome ashcroft had preserved a few of the main roads from the old days and he left a few of the old buildings intact but he had changed a lot more than he left alone off to my left was what had once been hemisphere park it was farmland now beyond that was a huge field where cattle grazed their backs dappled with the golden copper hues of the setting sun men on horseback patrolled the edges of the fields rifles resting on their shoulders most of the housing was on the other side of the river off to my rightsmall cottages comfortable and clean a few children playing in a garden under an old womans watchful eye but the crown jewel in ashcrofts compound was the fairmount hotel hed turned the ancient fourstory building into his private domain it was flanked on one side by the ruins of the spanish village of la villita the crumbling adobe buildings converted into horse stables in front of the hotel was a spanishstyle garden fed by a large circular stone fountain a fork of the san antonio river curled around the rear of the hotel supplying fresh water for the whole compound as we pulled to a stop in front of the hotel i said looks like you guys have got room for what about five six hundred people here do yourself a favor one of the guards told me and dont ask no questions you aint gonna be here long enough to worry about it now get out of the jeep a few minutes later i was standing in what had once been the hotels lobby waiting on heather checking the smell of my breath in my palm id cleaned up as best i could but that wasnt saying much when you live in the zone in the rubble between the compounds it shows a lump of coal is still a lump of coal no matter how much you polish it i didnt bother to make small talk with the guard off in the corner watching me eventually heather came down the stairs i watched her descend my mouth watering she was wearing a short denim skirt that showed about a mile of bare leg and a tight black camisole that got my adams apple pumping in my throat her eyes were gray as smoke her dark hair pulled back into a ponytail that made her jaw and throat seem delicate as spun glass and she was wearing makeup you never see that anymore her lips were so red they actually shined i couldnt look away and im just glad i didnt start drooling she dismissed the guard with a wave hey she said to me i tried to speak but my throat had gone dry hey i said i couldnt stop looking at her lips god how they shined you look great i managed to say she blushed they didnt give you any trouble at the gate did they no i said well maybe a little no big deal you sure really i said no big deal she smiled my dad wants to see you before we go you dont mind do you mano a mano with big dave ashcroft christ i thought i guess i dont get to say no do i um not really i watched golden rays of light scatter from her hair and said sure why not she led me back to her fathers office daddy she said this is the boy i told you about dave ashcroft wasnt the giant i was expecting to meet you hear stories about these guys growing up in the zone and theyre like gods reshaping the world in their own image you expect them to be six and a half feet tall neck like a beer keg arms like a gorillas but dave ashcroft he was just a normal looking guy in a white work shirt and khaki slacks a donut of gray hair around the back of his head he didnt offer to shake my hand he pointed me to a chair opposite his desk and ordered me to sit without saying a word what kind of name is andrew hudson its just a name sir yeah but i know it from somewhere my dad probably who was your dad eddie hudson he was a cop in the old days he perked up you mean the one who wrote that book about the fall thats right i get that bit about my dad from some of the oldtimers dad wrote a book about the first night of the outbreak about how he had to fight his way across the city to get to my mom and me but his book only covered that first night he left off at a point when it looked like we were actually going to contain the zombie outbreak well he was wrong obviously and sometimes the oldtimers who remember my dads book look at me and i think maybe theyre remembering what it was like back then back when it seemed we might win this thing i think at least for some of them the memories make them angry resentful like they blame people like my dad for the naiveté that allowed the second wave to happen but there are others who recognize my dad and they tune out they become distant like theyve gotten over the anger and now theyre dealing with something else big dave ashcrofthe was one of the ones who just get distant what happened to your dad he asked he and mom died in the second wave sir you would have been what about six when that happened yes sir did they turn mom did dad got swarmed trying to stop a bunch of them from breaking into our house mom got bit but she managed to stash me in a hall closet before she turned and youve been on your own ever since living off the streets thats right so what do you do now how do you live but i could tell the question he meant to ask was how the hell did a zoner like you meet my daughter special deliveries i take private packages all across the zone ive even done some work for you sir thats how i met your daughter he frowned at that where do you plan to take my daughter andrew dinner sir and dancing on the starliner out on the lake he looked impressed though i could tell he didnt want to be impressed the starliners not cheap he said special deliveries must pay pretty good business is fine sir i paused then said but thats not really what youre asking is it he raised an eyebrow and waited listen i said heathers a special girl thats not something you have to tell me i mean i already know it i recognize a class act when i see one and i intend to treat her accordingly id guessed right that was exactly what he needed to hear he knew as well as anybody the dangers waiting for his daughter outside his compounds walls and he knew he wouldnt be able to keep her from them forever sooner or later with or without his permission she was going to brave that world maybe sending her out with me somebody who had proven their ability to survive was his way of hedging his bets but whatever his thoughts he gave his consent he called in his senior security officer a slender bowlegged man named naylor and naylor drove us out to the main gate in an air conditioned utility vehicle he told the guards to give me back my gear and my motorcycle and while they were doing that he pulled heather aside and gave her a little talk after that to me naylor said she has a portable radio equipped with a gps tracker my people will be monitoring it all night well be close then he fixed me with a meaningful glare and said all she has to do is call the message came through loud and clear ill try to be on my best behavior i said heather jumped on the back of my bike and pressed her breasts into my back i could feel the hard pebbles of her nipples through our clothes you better not be on your best behavior she whispered into my ear now drive fast andrew get me out of here in the days after the fall when the necrosis virus emerged from the hurricaneravaged texas gulf coast and turned the infected into flesheating human train wrecks the old world collapsed and men like dave ashcroft stepped up to fill the power vacuum they built compounds like the one heather and i had just left to protect their interests and everywhere else became a wasteland known as the zone of exclusion after my parents died i became one of the fringe people a zoner i was too young to be of any use to the bosses who were just then consolidating their power and building their compounds and so there werent any other options open to me these days i know the zone better than most and what i know i learned the hard way fighting it out every day with the infected in the ruins of san antonio i survived that way for ten years then right after i turned sixteen i stole a motorcycle and before long id worked up a reputation as someone who could get packages delivered anywhere in the zone thats how i met heather about two months before our first date i brought her a package from a dying woman out in the zone how that woman got the money to pay me i dont know because i dont come cheap but she did pay me in gold and i made the delivery heather opened the package in front of me and took out a badly worn pink blanket with her name stitched on it there was a note attached and she read it four times before she asked me about the woman who sent it shes not doing so hot i said which was being charitable the truth was the effort it took her to tell me what she wanted nearly killed her heather nodded quietly and then the tears came she told me her parents divorced when she was little before the fall and when the world turned upside down her father took her away because he could protect her better than her mom she didnt have many memories of the woman but from the looks of that blanket i figured her mom had plenty of memories of her heather gave me a long letter to take back to her mother and though she could have paid my fee ten times over with what she carried in her pocket i didnt charge her i took the letter to her mother and because she couldnt see well enough to read i read it for her she died a few days later but i think she was happy during those last few days happier than shed been in years heather and i got close after that though we had to steal the moments we spent together at least we did before tonight now sitting on the back of my bike she squeezed my waist and put her lips to my ear i love the wind on my face she said go faster dinner was the best thing id ever tasted roasted mutton with wasabi mashed potatoes and asparagus to this day i have no idea what the hell wasabi is or where you get it but i sure loved the bite it gave those mashed potatoes and the scenery was fantastic the stars dappled on the surface of canyon lake on the shore the tops of the hills were silvered with moonlight there was music a few older couples dancing on the open air deck glimpses of a world long gone the conversation on the other hand lagged at least at first id never really talked to a girl not like you do on a date anyway i didnt know what i was supposed to say how i was supposed to act she knew little about weapons or the zone and that pretty much exhausted what i knew she was into growing vegetables and had plans for building schools but i told her dad i was going to treat her like a class act and i did the thing is deep down inside i am and always will be a zoner life as i had known it was short and mean and cheap and i spent a lot of time wondering if it was really worth the effort i put into it when you think that way it can be hard to look at a girl and think the two of you have a chance at romance she asked me if there was anything wrong this world seems kind of pointless dont you think i whispered across the table to heather as the waiter poured each of us another glass of wine there may not be a point she said but even still were here you and me thats enough isnt it her answer surprised me the simple practicality of it thats true i said here we are after dinner we danced on the open deck of the starliner a cool late spring breeze was in the air carrying with it the thick marshy smell of lake water i held her body close to mine the first time id ever held a real girl and lost myself in the warmth of her green eyes and the smell of her skin that feeling that comfort of absolute privacy the romance of it was why the starliner cost so much the infected were everywhere and not even the strongest compound was completely safe from them but when the starliner was off her moorings and out on the lake it was its own world untouchable by the harsh realities of the zone but of course there were other dangers in the zone besides zombies as the evening drew to a close and the starliner began her slow cruise back to the wet dock heather and i stood on the bow and talked about the future about the stars about anything and everything except the past it was our night and though our bonds had been forged in the heartaches of the past we wanted our night together to be about the future we wanted our own happy memories together there were no other boats on the lake at least there hadnt been during most of our date but as we rounded a final elbow of land and entered the cove we saw a large cabin cruiser waiting for us the vague shapes of men ringing the rails of the deck heather broke off in the middle of a giggle and watched them what is it i asked not good she said i think thats wayne nessel daddy warned me he might try something daddy didnt think hed do it out here though i knew of wayne nessel he was ashcrofts biggest rival and a man with a lot of resources at his disposal people in the zone called him the bull he couldnt know youre here he knows she said and then she guided me to the far side of the starliner but how hes got spies everywhere andrew she crossed to the opposite side of the deck and climbed the railing wait a minute i said where are we going she looked down at me can you swim yeah good she waited till nessels boat lit up the starliner with its spotlights then she gave me a wink and dropped herself over the edge i went in after her i thought wed cling to the side of the boat and wait it out but that wasnt what heather had in mind she went under and kept swimming under the starliners hull i followed above us through the green murky haze i could see the glow of the spotlights and the shimmering outlines of men running on both decks there were a lot of muffled popping sounds that i took to be gunfire but none of that was directed down at us it was all boat to boat we surfaced on the far side of nessels boat and swam to shore id hidden my motorcycle in the brush next to the starliners docks out of habit and now i was thankful for my instincts as we swam we decided itd be best to come ashore a little ways from the dock just in case nessel had men covering his back on land we crawled up on shore and heather pulled her black hair back with both hands her camisole clinging to the curve of her breasts like wet paint there were voices nearby just on the other side of the bushes nessels men i thought left here in reserve i spotted them a moment later four men all armed with ars they were lined up on the dock looking out at the boats pointing and laughing amateurs i whispered look at that theyre just watching the show can you get them all no i said not all of them maybe one or two but not all of them what do we do the switchback road wed taken to the docks led a short distance up a steep hill behind us before curving out of sight low scraggly oaks and cedars lined the sides of it i told heather to go up around the curve and wait for me what are you going to do try not to get shot i said she frowned at that but she made her way up to the road just the same careful to stay in the shadows when she was safely out of the way i made my move my bike was hidden in a clump of cedar behind an old rusted truck i crossed behind the guards and made for the bike praying they didnt turn around i got most of the way there before i heard one of them holler something the next instant they were firing at me little chunks of concrete exploded around my shoes as i made for the truck but they didnt hit me and if their lack of attention on the shoreline hadnt convinced me they were just hired goons their shooting certainly did at that range professionals would have killed me with ease i got down beneath the truck pulled my glock and waited they were running up the slope of the lot straight for me i steadied my sights on the lead guy and dropped him with my first shot my next three shots werent aimed i just sprayed the crowd to make them duck for cover it worked they dived behind an old boat trailer giving me enough time to pull my motorcycle out of the bushes start it and go racing up the road they fired after me but they never got close i slowed long enough for heather to jump on the back and then we sped off into the night we were still wet from the swim and it was cold on that bike what had been a lovely cool breeze while we were dancing was now a fierce cold snap biting through us to the bone heather wrapped her arms around my waist and squeezed and i could feel her body trembling i slowed the bike down enough for her to hear me are you okay uh huh why is he after you i asked anything to hurt daddy she said her voice coming in quick breathy stabs his people are always ambushing daddys shipments maybe hes upping the ante now to kidnapping or assassination what do you want to do i asked warn my father she said daddy told me nessel always attacks on two fronts at once if hes coming after me here hes probably trying to attack daddy somewhere else too the radio she nodded i tried back at the lake nobody answered well have to get closer into town and try for my fathers safe houses you got it i said and laid into the throttle when we got closer into town i pulled off the highway and parked in a lot on the top of a small hill and heather called naylor on the radio are you sure its nessels people he asked im sure she said he told us not to use the radio any more than we had to besides a good share of the gasoline market nessel controlled the sale of most of the electronic equipment in the area the radio heather was using was probably stolen from one of his shipments and there wasnt much doubt hed be able to overhear her transmission can you get to the pickup point he asked heather gave me a sidelong glance and a smile im pretty sure we can she said we moved out and as we rode i thought about this oldtimer i used to know who told me what life was like before the outbreak he said people were pretty much the same then as they are now and that turning into zombies hadnt changed them much what was different he said was the noise it was noisy back then there were cars and planes and trains everywhere not to mention all the crowds he said you couldnt escape it but these days there are so few cars left you can drive around all day and never see another driver heather and i hadnt seen any all night i couldnt remember the last time id heard a plane fly overhead id never seen a moving train life in the zone was quiet even though it was rarely peaceful thats how i knew something was wrong heather and i got up on the highway again and started driving but we hadnt made it very far before i heard the highpitched whine of a pack of sport racing bikes we glanced around looking for them they were behind us coming down from an overpass and getting onto the freeway at top speed i didnt need to ask if they were nessels men all of them had machine guns slung over their backs and the way they were riding they clearly knew who we were i got my bike up to top speed but they were faster my bike was just a beat up harley sportster but they were riding honda cxrstop of the line racing bikes i didnt have a snowballs chance of outrunning them in a dead sprint so when they got close enough to take their shots i did the only thing i could think of and veered over to the far left lane let them come up on us then downshifted and banked the bike hard to the right taking the connector ramp to the connelly loop at almost a hundred miles an hour heather yelled out in surprise nessels men overshot us i saw them lock up their brakes and slide but none of them reacted fast enough to take the ramp with us their mistake bought us a few valuable seconds the connelly loop led right into the heart of the zone there was nothing in there but crumbling buildings and legions of the infected as a result it was a low priority for the bosses who made it their business to keep the roads clear and so it was still choked with long lines of abandoned cars my oldtimer friend told me that rush hour traffic used to be so bad the freeways would turn into parking lots and when it was really bad you could sit in your car for half an hour or more and never make it more than a couple of miles looking out over the abandoned cars ahead of us i felt like i knew what he meant it was a threelane bumpertobumper junkyard as far as i could see as i slowed down to thread the gap between the cars heather yelled in my ear what are you doing youre going the wrong way i looked behind us and saw nessels men coming for us they looked like a squadron of mad hornets buzzing down the ramp shooting the gaps between wrecks at fantastic speeds hold on i said a zombie was stumbling along between two rows of cars about a hundred and fifty yards ahead of us i dug into the throttle and went straight for him darting through the narrow gap feeling a thump thump thump echoing in my ears as we passed all the cars zombies are predictable when they see you they stumble after you they dont care if youre on foot or driving a truck they stumble after you just the same which is exactly what the zombie ahead of us was doing and about ten yards ahead of the zombie was a gap in traffic it looked like a driver in the middle lane had tried to turn into the lane to his right and had hit another car in the process the car was stuck at a fortyfivedegree angle with just enough room for me to slip alongside it and cross over to the gap between the middle and right lanes but i had to time it just right i had to get there just a fraction of a second before the zombie if i was going to make it work it was close when i got to the gap i hit the brakes rocked the bike hard to the right then hard to the left feeling heather gasping as she squeezed me we threaded into the opening and took off at full speed i looked back just as one of nessels goons hit that zombie he must have been doing at least ninety miles per hour when he realized what was happening and hit his brakes but at that speed not even the hondas oversized racing brakes could help him he hit the zombie and both bodies went tumbling over the wrecked cars the bike went sideways hit the trunk of a car and shot twenty feet up in the air spinning end over end the whole way back to the ground that slowed the other three down but not by much and i knew i couldnt play those games forever i took us up another hundred yards or so until we came to a small box van there i slowed turned the bike around and headed back the way wed come what are you doing heather said but i didnt have time to answer i ducked my head and charged one of the remaining three riders was in our gap and even though he was wearing a full helmet and face shield that kept his face hidden i could tell by the way his body stiffened that his eyes were going wide i pulled my glock and fired im not sure if i hit him or not but the bike shimmied beneath him he lost his balance glanced off a car and crashed out i saw his head smack a bumper as he fell i stopped the bike and told heather to get off she looked panicked but she did like i asked what are you going to do i pulled out my other glock just stay down okay i got this those huge green eyes of hers melted me were going to be okay i said she nodded and i moved out on foot the other two riders were going slow now practically walking their bikes through the cars looking for us i crouched down below the top of the cars and jogged into position when the rider i was targeting got close enough i stood up and fired both glocks into his chest knocking him backwards off the bike the other rider tried to react but he was stuck between two pickups i threw a lot of ammunition at him with both guns and managed to catch a lucky shot he spun around hit in the shoulder and went down i ran over to where he fell and saw him rolling on the pavement wounded he pushed off his helmet and let it tumble away he looked up at me his eyes pleading with me most of the time my moral compass swings closer to the good than the bad but some people just arent worth the effort i shot him in the head when i got back to heather she was holding that portable radio in her hands and crying whats wrong i asked her daddy was right about nessel she said the bastard used me as a decoy what do you mean daddy sent a squad of his best men to the safe house where we were supposed to go she looked up at me and choked back tears nessel was waiting for them theyre all dead now hes attacking the compound oh jesus he said for us to stay away she looked deep into my eyes but my god andrew it sounded so bad i heard explosions and daddy was screaming at people while he was talking with me i had no idea what to say she told me while we were dancing that she had begged her father for a week to let her go out on a date with me and now his empire was in serious risk of crumbling and it was all because of our date i was feeling lousy because i knew the role i played in wrecking her family but then she surprised me andrew she said you were telling me the truth about my mom werent you you really did read her my letter i nodded you worked a miracle bringing her back into my life i shook my head you did she said i believe that and i believe you can do it again i believe you can give me my father back i felt confused what are you asking me to do help me save my father andrew please she turned those big green eyes up at me a tear welling up and running down her face and in that moment i knew i was powerless to refuse id have handed her my soul for the asking lets go get your dad i said i started toward the main gate because that was the only way into ashcrofts compound that i knew of but when heather saw where i was going she pointed me in a different direction she had me go to the west side of the compound and drive into a crumbling building that looked like it had been a bakery before the outbreak it was the corner shop in a blocklong strip mall she told me to stop got off the bike opened a door that had been made to look like it was rusted shut and ushered me into a freshly painted white corridor this leads right into the compound she said i nodded impressed concealed doors and hidden tunnels were the kind of thing youd expect from a powerful boss like ashcroft but it was still weird to actually see it in real life that kind of engineering was way beyond what most bosses were capable of we took the motorcycle all the way to the end of the corridor where we were met by guards who took us to see ashcroft ashcroft and naylor were watching the battle from the third floor of the fairmount nessel had focused his troops around the main gate but they were hitting the wall of flattened cars in a couple of different places forcing ashcrofts troops to divide up their strength heather and i stood back a little listening as naylor relayed updates of the battle he was receiving over the radio to ashcroft the outer perimeter of ashcrofts compound was made up of smashed and stacked cars nessels men had used rocketpropelled grenades against that wall and it had partially collapsed in two places a large group of ashcrofts men were boxed in near the gate fighting a closequarters battle in the rubble left from the explosions and nessels superior numbers were starting to wear them down ashcroft surveyed the scene with nightvision goggles pull them back naylor he said tell them to regroup around the courtyard ashcrofts troops began falling back heather reached over and touched my hand as the soldiers ran back toward the hotel i looked over at her and saw she was holding her breath just then another blast from a rocket grenade lit up the night and when the smoke settled we saw there was a huge hole in the wall naylor was watching the space beyond the wall somethings happening he said theyre bringing up buses buses ashcroft said he focused his binoculars on the hole my god he gasped two yellow school buses broke through the burning debris that had once been the wall of flattened cars and rolled to a stop not far from ashcrofts retreating troops some of the men stopped to fire at the bodies getting off the buses but took off running again when they realized they were the infected that is fucking brilliant ashcroft said impressed despite himself using the infected like that i didnt think nessel had it in him problem sir naylor said ashcroft smirked what now there sir to the right of the main gate see him i followed naylors finger to a high point on the wall there was a man crawling to the top of it but he was too far away for me to see what he was doing sniper ashcroft said and then one at a time ashcrofts retreating troops started to fall the only clue as to why were the bright muzzle flashes of the snipers rifle in the confusion ashcrofts men didnt know which way to run theyre getting slaughtered out there ashcroft said get some of your men back up to the front and take that sniper out naylor said i dont have anybody sir prescott is the only officer i have left and hes coordinating the retreat ashcroft said nothing he gripped the railing and stared down at the battlefield mr ashcroft i said what he growled i can get him sir just stand still and shut up he said for the second time that night i met his gaze and didnt look away it looked like his first instinct was to throw me over the railing but then he stopped himself okay he said you want to do it go ahead i turned to go heather followed me andrew wait she said youre not serious you cant go i nodded in her fathers direction heather do you really think hed ever let us be together if i dont do this hell always have it in the back of his mind that this happened because of me but i can change that if i do this dont be stupid andrew hes got people to deal with this ill be all right i said i promise god i hope youre right she said yeah me too the battle had reached the courtyard right in front of the hotel ashcrofts men had taken up defensive positions behind the fountain and the rows of small garden walls leading up to the front doors nessels men were still moving into position using the infected as a moving barrier that sniper was the key to the battle from his position he was picking off ashcrofts men no matter how wellhidden they were and it was only a matter of time before he got so many of them that there wouldnt be enough of them left to put up a fight i moved out across the right flank of the battle and headed for a ditch that ran through the cow pasture i figured as long as i stayed inside it id be able to make it all the way to the wall of cars i had no idea what i was going to do from there though i got most of the way across the yard before i saw a small group of the infected wandering on the fringes of the battle i was so intent on reaching the wall that i didnt even notice them until i was right on top of them and by then it was too late i jumped out of the ditch and ran for it the infected followed me i veered right and ran along the inside of the wall until i got to a section where rocket grenades had blown it apart i jumped over the debris and landed outside the wallright in front of a militarystyle humvee where nessel and two of his lieutenants were watching the battle unfold i wasnt wearing one of ashcrofts uniforms so they didnt know what to make of me for a second i might have been a civilian or even one of their own hired goons that hesitation saved me with the infected hot on my heels i drew both glocks and ran straight for nessel firing the whole way i wasnt aiming just spraying and praying but i got one lucky shot and hit nessels driver in the head he went down onto the hood of the humvee the other lieutenant tried to break and run but he got caught by the infected and went down screaming that left nessel he fell over the back of the humvee and landed face first in the grass before he had a chance to get up i shot him three times once in the neck and twice in the chest with nessel dead i turned to face the infected there were eight of them and using the humvee for cover i used up the last of my ammunition on them that left me with nothing but my machete to fight the sniper i started to climb up the wall of flattened cars as quietly as i could i heard him up there popping off shots every few seconds with a boltaction rifle maybe if im lucky i thought hed be so into his shooting rhythm that he wouldnt hear me coming but that was just wishful thinking i made it most of the way to the top when i heard something moving below me it was one of the infected and he was coming up after me he made a gurgling moaning sound as he bumped and clanged his way up the side and i knew he was making enough noise that the sniper would be able to hear him even over the sound of his rifle i was stuck i couldnt go up because i would lose the element of surprise and probably get killed and i couldnt go down either but there was a little gap between two of the cars on the top row and i ducked into that facing outwards i waited to see who would get to me first the sniper or the zombie it was the sniper he poked his head over the side his face barely a foot above my waiting hands i reached up grabbed him by the back of the head and yanked down as hard as i could he came down the side of the wall like a snowball going downhill picking up lose car parts as he hit the sides trying to hold on only to keep tumbling downward right into the waiting arms of the zombie below us the two of them hit hard and both ended up on the ground i didnt waste any time i jumped over the top and picked up the snipers rifle the sniper was fighting the zombie barehanded and doing pretty well until i shot them both then i took up the snipers post i looked through the scope and watched the battle taking place around the fountain ashcrofts men who had a reputation as the best private army in the zone were earning their stripes i saw at least fifty of nessels soldiers dead in the courtyard and it looked like their advance was starting to break apart despite their numerical superiority they just werent as welldisciplined or as welltrained as ashcrofts troops ashcroft himself was leading the fight now i saw him waving a machine gun over his head yelling at his men to hold their positions i went to work on nessels men and as i started putting them down one by one i swept the scope across ashcrofts position he stopped yelling long enough to look my way all at once he realized it was me doing the firing now and he gave me an exaggerated overhand salute the tide of the battle turned and soon nessels men broke ranks and ran ashcroft followed up their retreat and his men carved the retreating enemy up into pockets showing no mercy gradually the steady thunderous roll of the battle faded and all that was left was the occasional sporadic popping of small arms fire ashcrofts men were still dealing with the infected but those too were getting mopped up i could see the mood among ashcrofts men changing they had won big and now they knew it with nothing left to shoot at i got down from the wall and went over to where id left nessel to die i tossed his body onto the hood of the humvee and drove straight through the gates to the hotel i parked in front of the fountain ashcrofts men stopped their celebrations to watch me and ashcroft himself came over to see what was going on he took one look at nessels body and whistled then he looked at me and smiled behind him coming out of the hotel at a run was heather she ran right past her father and straight into my arms ashcroft came over to us you did real good he said and offered me his hand thank you sir i owe you big andrew i shrugged in the background i heard naylor giving orders to the men to start damage control after he got the men moving he came back to ashcroft and gave a report ashcroft listened in silence nodding his head and when naylor was finished he gave him some more orders to relay to the troops then he turned to me and said andrew it looks like weve got a lot of rebuilding to do he glanced down at nessel and i seem to have inherited several new businesses im going to need some good men to help me run them you interested in a job heather was smiling uh a job would be great i said i heard a but in there well i said what i really want is a second date with your daughter flotsam jetsam by carrie ryan carrie ryans first novel the forest of hands and teeth debuted to great acclaim when it was released in the sequel the deadtossed waves came out earlier this year and the third volume the dark and hollow places is due out in spring our next story shares the same milieu as her novels but takes place several hundred years earlier another piece of ryans zombie fiction appears in the anthology zombies vs unicorns her love of zombies is all her fiancé jps fault since becoming infected with the zombie bug she has begun converting her friends and family to her cause much like a zombie would in poetics aristotle recommends that storytellers observe a unity of time no large jumps forward in time place one location and action few or no subplots well things dont get much more unified than a couple of characters on a lifeboat hitchcock used this scenario to great effect in his world war iiera film lifeboat in which the survivors begin to suspect that one of them is a german agent gary larson author of the beloved newspaper comic the far side repeatedly used gags involving lifeboats in one such strip three men and a dog draw lots to see which of them will be eatenthe dog comes up a winner and looks suitably smug our next tale also utilizes the grim immediacy and forced intimacy of a lifeboat scenario my original idea for this story was to have infection break out on an airplane which caused airports to constantly divert it ryan says as i thought more about the idea i wanted to simplify it and boil it down i was out to dinner with friends and talking about my idea and my fiancé suggested using a boat instead id been doing a lot of research into the rime of the ancient mariner for another project so the first line was obvious and the entire story unfolded from there i love using zombies in my fiction because it allows me to ask what differentiates the living from the dead how do we determine our own lives and futures beyond mindlessly doing what someone tells us water water everywhere and damn it jeremy if you say that one more time its when i see his face fall that i swallow the rest of what im going to say but the unspoken words circle my head the rage stinging just under my skin honestly id love nothing more than to reach across the tiny little raft and rip his throat out with my bare fingers i close my eyes try to inhale slow and deep i feel him shift feel the ripple and dip of the rubber underneath us that pushes me just a little off balance to avoid the urge to kick him i pull my legs up to my chest resting my forehead on my knees sorry man he says his voice a tiny defeated squeak i press my face harder against my kneecaps digging the prickle of my unshaven chin into my skin trying to focus all my pain into a single point trying to burn out my frustration waves dip and tumble underneath us tilting us toward the sun and then away water whispering around our tiny octagonal rubber island the cruise ship still hulks on the horizon and no matter how hard i try i cant resist staring at it bright orange specks hover around it like chiggersother lifeboats stuffed with other potential survivors i start to unroll the nylon canopy attaching it to the raft walls and pulling it over the inflated cross bar arcing across the center of the raft when jeremy glances at me looking startled we could go back he says hesitant we could try to get closer just to see i stop struggling with the canopy and close my eyes tight again curling back over my knees no i tell him my voice echoing between my legs he sighs and dips his hand over the edge of the raft i can hear the drip of the salt water as it plinks from his fingers i should tell him to stop tell him that the salts not good for him but we both know it wont matter not in a few days if the reports have been right jeremy has nightmares not that i dont but jeremys are badworse than bad horrific the first two days on the life raft neither of us sleep instead we sit here eyes riveted on the gigantic cruise ship as we drift farther and farther away its during the second night when he finally falls asleep im still staring at the ship struck by how bright and dazzling it ishow it looks exactly like all the commercials as it lights up the night i even start to think that perhaps wed been stupid to evacuate so hastily and that maybe we should circle in closer see if theyve somehow been able to contain the infection thats when jeremy starts screaming and thrashing around it makes the little raft buck and dip one of the sides catching a wave and letting water slosh in i jump on him pinning him down and he swings at me before im able to get to his hands he wakes up with me straddling him and panting hard my heart loud like gunshots in my ears he doesnt know hed been having nightmares and he frowns his face draining get off me he says twisting to the side and i let go his hands and scuttle back to the other side of the raft he looks at me like im a monster and it makes me feel awkward and weird you were screaming i tell him but he just grunts and wont look at me he keeps staring at the ship watching the lights glitter like nothings changed i pull my legs up to my chest and tuck into one of the corners making sure no part of me touches any part of him for the rest of the night smoke billows from the ship on the fourth day its been dry the sun burning and keeping us sweltering under the sagging canopy i think about licking the sweat from my arms but its full of saltjust as useless as the water surrounding us you think nancy and them are still on there jeremy asks hes pressed against the only opening blocking the fresh air i nudge him with my foot and he moves over slightly i wonder how the hell eight people are supposed to survive on this tiny thing how they could ever stand each other eight supply pouches ring the inside of the octagonal raft one per potential survivor and i give each a name a friend who was on the ship with me that ive left behind francis omar leroy margaret nancy micah and tamara i know that leaves jeremy out but i dont care i wasnt supposed to end up on this stupid life raft with him in the first place he wasnt even supposed to be going on the damn cruise and wouldnt be here if it werent for nancy and her soft heart and inability to say no to losers jeremy cranes his neck around and looks at me should we look for them maybe pull a little closer to see if theyre on other rafts i shake my head dig my fingers into my arms until im pinching the muscle i should tell jeremy i saw them already the night we jumped ship i saw them running saw the blood and bites saw the expression on franciss face fucking francis i think to myself of course hed have been the first one bitten jeremy wears glasses and the lenses are crusted with salt everythings so layered with it that he cant even find a way to clean them anymore and so he doesnt bother just stares at everything through the white haze i hate looking at him like that it makes him look like hes already gone like hes already one of them he doesnt think i know about his bite his hand keeps slipping to it pressing against it tracing the outline of it under his shirt i pretend not to notice but its not like hes being subtle about it if i hadnt seen the raw red ring of bite marks along his ribs that first night id struggled with him during his nightmares id have figured it out eventually i mean christ its running towards one hundred degrees every day and even though we huddle under the canopy of the life raft its not like its cool in the shade i ditched my shirt the first day but jeremy still keeps his on and i dont care how selfconscious and scrawny he might be when the temperature hits triple digits and youre stranded with a guy in the middle of the damn ocean while the world falls apart you lose things like modesty if i can watch him slip into the water to take a dump i can deal with his pale thin muscles and a chest like a plucked turkey i may not be the smartest but id have figured out he was hiding something under that shirt how long you think it takes them to turn after theyre bitten i ask him i know im an asshole but im bored and i wonder how much i can prod and poke at him before he admits the truth plus hes smarter than i am jeremys the one who first figured out that we needed to get off the ship even though they hadnt called an official evacuation he was the one keeping up with the news when the rest of us were testing out our fake ids in the bar and pretending everything was going to be okay he swallows sharp dagger of an adams apple dragging along his throat depends how bad the bite was he says pinching the web of skin between his thumb and forefinger i stare at him willing him to have the balls to tell me himself but he just shifts and stares back at the boat maybe we should pull in closer he says just in case someone needs our help i shake my head no i tell him too risky the thing jeremy doesnt understand is that the first time he fell asleep i couldnt resist the pull of all those lights that promise of safety and warmththe idea that everything was under control so id paddled us closer there were people everywhere all over the decks running screaming jumping they were panicked and desperate i saw other lifeboats rocking as they fought against them the living and the dead something had flashed in one of the windows and i stared at it trying to see what was going on inside thats when i saw a hand fingers scratching at the glass thats when i saw the teeth and mouth banging against the window again and again desperate to get out even though id smothered our emergency beacon light i felt like the thing was staring straight at me that more than anything else she wanted to rip every bit of flesh from my bones and pull apart every muscle open me up like a frog on the dissection tray id let us drift back away then just before jeremy started screaming just before i saw the bite marks along his ribs you ever had sex i ask him his back stiffens his shirt sticking to his body even though weve been rationing water hes been sweating a lottoo much his skins hot and flushed and he wants me to think its from the sun and heat but i can smell the way his wounds festering the sweet putrid stink of it he pulls his head under the canopy and slumps against the wall why he asks why sex its supposed to be pretty damn good i tell him trying to lighten his mood supposed to be he repeats raising an eyebrow i scowl cross my arms over my chest dont you think about those things being out here he starts to look at me funny and i think about the night i pinned him in his sleep i roll my eyes i just mean its not like we have anything else to do but think its just sex is one of those things id planned on doing before i died im kinda pissed it might not happen he shrugs who says youre going to die i notice he doesnt say we and i swallow my tongue suddenly feeling a little thick scrunching down until i can prop my feet against the raft wall i stare up at the peak of the canopy watching it stretch and ripple over the inflated support bar what do you thinks happening back home i say its a question ive been trying desperately not to ask but its all i can think about recently well that and sex jeremys silent and i let my head flop over until im looking at him hes staring out at the horizon but from here all i can see is gray water gray sky gray life slowly i push myself to my hands and knees and crawl until im sitting next to him the ships farther away now wed lost sight of it the day before and for a while wed been panicked not realizing until then how much we needed to have it out there even if we kept our distance how empty everything seemed without it but then wed seen the smoke rising out of nowhere and wed paddled toward it until we saw it billowing from the decks of the ship for most of the day its been listing to the side slowly and inevitably capsizing i think they might all be gone jeremy finally says softly before dancing his fingers along his side as if i dont know what hes hiding every time he falls asleep jeremy screams he never remembers it or at least never acknowledges it its driving me insane and a part of me hopes the infection goes ahead and takes him soon so i can be done with it the thing is its not like jeremy or i were being stupid its not like we didnt know how the whole thing works someone gets bitten gets infected dies and comes back from the dead hungering for flesh wed seen the movies and played the video games we knew its justwhen it came down to it it wasnt that easy it was never supposed to be real never supposed to actually happen everything got confused and strange we lost our friends trying to run through the cruise ship and we fought over taking a life raft and ditching or staying for official evacuation orders really this isnt what was supposed to happen at allthis isnt how it was supposed to end up wed treated it like a joke because wed have panicked otherwise haha the zombie apocalypses hit lets take a life raft and run haha jokes on us or them i cant remember anymore sometimes i wonder if it wouldnt just make more sense to confront jeremy and force him overboard after all its not like he has a chance of surviving this and in the meantime hes taking up resources that i might need neither one of us says anything but we both know if there was going to be a rescue itd have happened by now thereve been no planes no coast guard or bright orange helicopters our little raft beacon chirps and blinks away merrily sending little distress rescue me signals out into the world that either no ones there to hear or theyre too busy ignoring us we know this just like we know that land cant really be that far awaywed been on a cruise after all the whole point is to visit all the islandsthey have to be out here somewhere but we cant bring ourselves to lose sight of the ship to find out just in case i dont realize what it is at first the huge groaning noise like a whales swallowed us whole theres this massive deep popping sound a highpitched whine and then the sound of the world sucking itself up with a straw the wave hits not too long after tossing us around the boat i grab the canopy trying to hold on and end up tearing part of it away from the sides what the hell i ask running my fingers over the raft to make sure nothings damaged water knocks us around up and down and up and down and jeremys at the flap staring out in the night no he shouts into the darkness and i suddenly realize just how dark it is its nothing pure absolute emptiness the cruise ships gone devoured by the ocean jeremy jumps into the water and starts swimming as if he could somehow bring it back from the depths i cant even see him hes been swallowed up already but i hear his splashing it cant go yet he screams im not ready im not ready i kneel in the boat my arms over the side trying to feel for him as i listen to him beat at the waves and curse everything for taking away the ship once and for all when i finally get him back on board he shivers in my lap his arms crossed tight over his chest im not ready he mutters turning his face to my chest as tears burn hot against my skin i hold on to him letting the raft rock us both the silence of the sea settling around the sunken ship our only lullaby jenny lyons i tell him and he cracks a small smile her he asks really i shrug it was eighth grade and computer class didnt she have braces then oh yeah he shakes his head how about you i ask if possible his cheeks pinken even more oh dont tell me sweet sixteen and never been kissed i mean it like a tease more like eighteen he says staring at his lap i feel my smile tighten as i think about the bite on his ribs and suddenly it doesnt seem so funny anymore its pitchblack dark when he finally comes clean listen i gotta tell you something he says he must have known i was pretending to sleep because he doesnt bother trying to wake me up first i shift a little feeling the boat rock slowly under my movement we havent seen anything else for days no ship land rafts only so much nothing that it feels like we have to be the last people left as he explains i bite my teeth together as hard as possible wondering if i can break thembreak everything and be done with it ill go overboard if you want he says in the darkness his voice has no body no infection it just is but then youll turn into one of those things i tell him his breath shakes im going to turn into one of those things no matter what he says i push my fingers into my eyes trying to poke them hard enough to bring tears because its the only way i can think of to unleash the searing pain inside is that what you want i ask him if i stay on this raft and turn ill go after you he finally says he pauses and in the emptiness our hearts keep beating i dont want that he adds softly so you think you can take me i ask him he doesnt laugh not really it was a lame joke anyway but i do hear him exhale a little harder as if hed thought about laughing you have to promise me youll throw me over when it happens he finally says promise me youll make me sink i press my fingers harder against my eyes promise me his voice is urgent i shake my head i promise i mutter i think nancy had a little crush on you i tell him its a thick soupy day taunting us with rain and im organizing our water bottles to catch what i can my mouth tries to salivate at the thought of it cool and wet sliding down my throat filling every dry space inside me i hope so since shes the one who bit me hes leaning back in the shade of the canopy shirt off now that i know his secret i cant look at him without glancing at the bite festering along his ribs its like hes proud of it forcing us both to deal with it and then i realize what his words mean so you knew i dont ask it as a question i turn to face him if shes the one who bit you you knew about everyone else francis nancy and the others why do you think i told you we shouldnt wait for them he asks red streaks along his skin marking every vein through his body with an infection whose heat sometimes radiates along the rubber of the raft then why did you keep asking to go back if you knew he shrugs stares at his hands i wanted to be wrong doesnt matter now i guess and hes right we lost sight of the last raft two days ago his hands are hot as he grabs for me hes gasping for breath and at first i think hes turned gurgling on moans but then i realize hes trying to say my name get up he says shaking me but his muscles are weak from so many days of disuse and im still much larger and stronger than he is get up he prods again he shoves something into my hand the lanyards that lashed the flap of the canopy shut tie me up he says its time tie me up sink me its been harder and harder for me to surface from sleep and i struggle to understand what jeremys saying hes wheezing now as he takes my hands wraps my fingers around the ropes pulls them tight along his wrists and elbows his skins dry and cracked and i try to blink the salt from my eyes so i can focus on whats going on its dark in the little raft pitchblack swallowing us everywhere with just the tiny hiccups of the alert beacon flashing flash jeremy knotting the ropes using his teeth to tighten them flash me winding them around his torso tucking up his knees flash jeremys eyes glassy and bright his chest barely moving flash i dont know what to say what to do what to tell him flash i slip my fingers into his im sorry jeremy flash hes nothing flash dead eyes still heart flash waves tilt and whirl as his body becomes a shell flash i breathe in hold it flash flash flash i exhale and before the light can flash again he explodes straining and struggling i see the perfectly straight teeth the gleaming white as he tries to lunge for me as he snaps at the air screaming i throw myself across the raft pushing and forcing myself back wishing the walls could absorb me keep me safe his moans are like growls guttural and wet hes insane with what looks like agony and rage and a desire so intense i can smell it beneath me the entire raft bucks and swirls his movements teetering us around his feet ripping at the canopy overhead as he tries to gain his balance tries to push himself closer to me i cant get near him can only watch as he pulls and pops against the ropes can only hear the strain on his joints the snap of his wrist breaking apart under the twisting jolts its too much i cant stand it cant be near him anymore cant see him like this i dive through the opening in the canopy into the night letting the waves close over my head until i cant hear cant see cant forget as the raft twists and shudders above me do you believe in god i ask jeremy water pools around the divot in the raft where im crouching and ive pulled open the canopy hoping the sun will burn it away so that my poor chaffed skin can find relief jeremy bucks against the soggy ropes holding him tight ive lashed him to the other side of the raft and used strips of my shirt to tie his mouth shut he still manages to moan deep nasal sounds that reverberate through the raft so that im always feeling them even when i shove my hands to my ears i tried to push him overboard i swear but i just couldnt do it i couldnt let go of him hes all i have left i couldnt drift away from him on the empty horizon blink once for yes twice for no i tell him staring into his face he doesnt blink just tries to lunge for me his shoulder buckling back at a sickening angle jeremy i whisper its night pitch black and i swore i woke up to screaming i swore i woke up to jeremy and his nightmares the raft shudders jeremy still desperate to escape still desperate for me i shake my head feeling like my ears are full of water every sound distant and dull jeremy i ask again carefully i crawl across the raft my muscles having a hard time keeping me from falling over the bottom sags every place i set my hand and knee feeling as if it too is giving up i pull myself face to face with jeremy too close to be safe is there anything left i ask him and i cant tell if hes shaking his head or if hes just twisting against his ropes to get closer to me im pretty sure jeremys been talking to me when i wake up im positive i hear his voice in my head and when im staring at the horizon trying to find shapes in the wavering distance i swear hes saying something you promised hes starting to sag against his ropes his bodys pretty torn up joints dislocated and his left arm fractured where he pulled too hard his skins tight over his face cheekbones sharp and accusing im not ready i tell him neither was i he says i turn away again nothing inside me is willing to cooperate anymore everything shudders and falls apart muscles failing to fire bones shifting under my skin so that i always hurt you promised he says over and over and over again until i almost do want to throw him over just to shut him up its raining so our water bottles are full again one of the survival pouches has a fishing kit and ive been sitting here for a while staring at the gleaming little hook part of me wants to draw it along the raft wondering if its sharp enough to gash the boat and sink us both we ran out of food three days ago so i dont have anything to use as bait ive tried using just the hook but nothing bites i stare at jeremy at the flesh flayed off his broken thumb his moans are more like whimpers now and my stomach heaves as i pinch at his skin tearing the little flap off i shove it on the hook and toss it in the water and wait thinking of the fish circling underneath us wondering if eating jeremys undead flesh will cause them to turn as well thinking of the feel of their meat on my tongue the thick oily taste of it makes me weak with desperation so intense i tremble hours pass the storm dwindles and nothing wincing i close my eyes cut a sliver of my own skin away as soon as the scent of my blood hits the air jeremy explodes thrashing harder than he has in days startled the hook slips through my fingers and falls away into the depths i sit staring at the bloody flesh in my fingers red and bright and wet inside im empty nothing but water sloshing through my veins nothing but the taste of salt coating my tongue slowly i raise the bit of skin to my lips and close my eyes jeremy moans and writhes as i force myself to swallow its dark again so dark that nothing makes sense theres a storm whipping around outside dragging the raft and tossing it around i brace my hands against the walls and try to hold on tight but still im thrown into jeremy thrust against him again and again everythings soaking wet water seeping through tears in the canopy even though ive done my best to lash it shut its slippery and i cant keep my balance i reach for jeremys hands i dont want to be alone i scream at him my throat raw and cracked im scared its too hard to keep doing this to keep surviving im exhausted and my bodys beyond pain salt leaches into my cuts my skins tight and shrunken with sunburn and my stomach is so empty im frightened it no longer exists im afraid to die i tell jeremy his fingers grab for me clutch on to me as if he understands what im saying he seems so much stronger than i am i kneel in front of him and pull the scrap of shirt from his head unleashing his jaw he snaps and moans louder than the roar of the storm my breath is shaking as i reach my arm up to him push it toward his mouth a wave crashes down on us flooding the tiny raft and in the murk of it i feel the sharp sting of his teeth closing around me i rest my head in jeremys lap and stare up at the calm blue sky theres something comforting about him about the feel of him underneath me like im a kid curled up on my parents bed on a saturday morning already i feel the sear of the infection my body offering up little resistance ive been shutting down muscles twitching throat closing stomach ceasing to rattle and growl and my heart a bare whisper i havent felt my toes for a day and what bothers me is that i no longer care my dad made the best waffles i tell jeremy staring at the clouds hed leave the butter out overnight so it was soft and melty id drown them with syrup i run the tip of my tongue against the roof of my barren mouth trying to remember the feel of it im so wrapped up in the memory that seeing the bird doesnt make sense doesnt penetrate the fantasy i have in my head of a table heaped with food but then the bird screams and i jolt up my head colliding with jeremys chin snapping him back oh my god i shout oh my god theres a tiny spit of land cresting over the horizon exerting every force i can muster from my muscles i hold my hand up trace the curve of a tree with my finger we draw closer and closer the island growing larger and larger the infection inside me roaring hotter and hotter im weeping barely able to move jeremy sags against the wall next to me red gashes covering his body where the ropes rubbed him raw i put my hand on his foot and he twitches leans toward me we made it jeremy i say with cracked lips he leans toward me his mouth finding my knuckles hes so weak now so torn apart from struggling that he can barely bite and what hurts more than his teeth grazing my flesh is the sting of salt from his lips penetrating the raw skin my eyes blur with tears we made it i whisper overwhelmed with a crush of emotions so intense i cant even untangle them i hug him tight press my face into the curve of his neck and pretend his struggles are joy at being saved thin them out by kim paffenroth r j sevin julia sevin kim paffenroth is the

etcfeature at least one character who spends the entire movie being shrill and obnoxious and totally impervious to reason in night its harry cooper who is crassly possessive of the presumed safety of the cellar in day its captain rhodes the unreasoningly aggressive military commander when author carrie ryanwhose story you just read if youre reading the book in ordersaw night of the living dead for the first time she thought it was stupid the characters are in so much danger but rather than working together they spend the whole movie bickering with each other in a pointless way but then someone explained to her that that was the whole point romero was saying that this is what humanity isthat were doomed by our inability to just get along with each other even in the face of lifeordeath challenges after that she completely changed her mind about the movie this made the film absolutely brilliant to me she said in the face of current calamitiesglobal warming economic collapse aids overpopulationto which humanitys response has been mostly just a lot of pointless political sniping romeros warning seems more pressing than ever and our next story is another that plays with the idea that interpersonal drama can be an even bigger problem than zombies he was on his back looking up at the sky he felt a little cold but overall not too bad hearing sounds to his left he turned his head another person stood nearby eyeing him her face hands and arms glistened red and she held something pink in her hands which she raised to her mouth slurping sounds followed then she wiped her hands on her dress he sat up and examined himself he too was covered with red he tried to say something but all that came out was something between a roar and a moan the red lady returned the greeting so he thought she might be friendly after all he pulled aside the tatters of his shirt and found a large hole in the middle of him that must be where the cold was coming from he reached into the hole and felt around mostly it was squishy but nearer the back there were hard parts too he thought the hole looked nice all colorful and mysterious and he thought it might be useful as a place to put things but he couldnt think of anything he had to put there he stood up and took a step toward the red lady the stuff on her neck wasnt shiny and wet like the stuff on her mouth and hands but all caked and dark even so she looked very pretty the sun made her blond hair shine where it wasnt matted with the red stuff he tried to touch her hair but she growled and pulled away after a while they both sat down on the pavement she still wouldnt let him touch her hair but she did let him hold her hand there was a big shiny metal band around her wrist that looked nice too he looked around a large blue sign nearby read welcome to louisiana another sign not far from that one read simply i he didnt know what either sign meant but somehow he did there was a roar and a metal thing on wheels stopped near them the people who got out of the wheeled thing didnt have red stains on them they werent missing any parts they were whole but he didnt like the way they looked they looked ugly and plain they also had ugly dull metal things in their hands the ugly people smiled and laughed and pointed then the dull metal things roared louder than the wheeled thing had he fell on top of the red lady laying there till he heard the wheeled thing roar off sitting up he found she no longer pushed his hand away but she also didnt move this made him sad he took the metal band off her wrist now he had something to keep in the hole in him the other people had seemed much happier and more satisfied by what they did and he wondered if he could ever be whole like they were he doubted it but sitting there in the fading light running his dead fingers through such luminous blond hair he didnt feel completely empty either okay zach brought the jeep to a halt were on foot from here to his right ted grunted something and the two men hopped out in the back seat wayne looked at his gun and wondered if he should have shot them both as soon as zach threw the vehicle into park the opportunity passed wayne stepped from the jeep and into the early morning light not even nine oclock and already the louisiana air was cloying the interstate sliced through a dense pine forest theyd stick to the shade for as long as they could at the rear of the jeep they suited up backpacks stuffed with supplies in case they got separated and were unable to return to the jeep gloves hinged faceshields filtered dust masks and wooden baseball bats there was also a furniture dolly for boxes wayne grabbed it cars are tight here zach said real low keep quiet and watch your asses if you get bit im calling the doctor he patted the magnum on his right hip the bastard had actually painted it white there was a small red cross on the grip a taurus rested beneath each arm what if you get bit wayne asked grabbing a bat then ill see the doctor that one is mine ted said pulling the bat from waynes hand his dark eyes darting leftrightleftright resembled empty zoetropes there was more than a little crazy there ohkay its the marks right here ted pointed at some deep gouges in the business end of the bat thats how i can tell this is the one i always use it has the marks he turned and trotted off wayne looked at zach who nodded once and walked away wayne grabbed another bat slipped it through a loop on his belt and pushing the dolly followed them onto the interstate since their little community of survivors had come together four months ago outside of baton rouge theyd searched over forty miles of i they now moved along the choked northbound lanes of i and were less than fifty miles away from the mississippi border zach and ted walked shouldertoshoulder two paces ahead of him chuckling over stories theyd told each other several times before theyd been buddies before the outbreaks and it didnt seem fair wayne didnt have any real friends among the threedozen men in the warehouse ian was trustworthy enough but pretty unpleasant to be around always talking about needing pussy always picking at his ears and nose and fingernails and scalp youd think with a perpetual hygiene jones like that hed smell a little better than he did then there was sue who he hardly knew really it was hard to talk about things now in any normal way but he guessed he wasnt really interested in her religion or her favorite music anyway but goddamn ted and zach went on chatting about the saints and the niggers and the fucking waffle house like any of it still mattered scanning the area for dead folks wayne wondered again if he should just pull his piece and pop each of them in the back of the head he wondered if he could that one there zach said indicating an wheeler a few hundred feet away what about those ted was talking about the four smaller delivery trucks between them and the semi could be some good shit in there could be probably is zach said but we try the big truck first find what we need and get the hell out of here wayne looked around no movement anywhere only cars and trucks bumper to bumper for alltime some of them unscathed some blackened and twisted others glass and steel tombs whose misshapen and sunbaked occupants watched soundlessly as the three men strode between them it would be so damn easy now a little later and hed lose his chance to get the drop on them the whole thing could fall apart and if his suspicions were trueif the last five guys to die on supply runs with zach and ted had been popped to keep rations fat back at the warehouse couldnt they already have the drop on him could he be walking toward his execution slow day wayne said ted grunted again the fuck you talking about zach asked wayne could hear the disdain in his voice none of them around yet yeah zach said so far so good i guess about twenty feet from the semi zach cursed the loading door was partially open and the ground around the truck was littered with rusted and broken kitchen appliancestoasters blenders indoor grillssitting among the faded and disintegrating remains of cardboard boxes they lifted the door and peered into the trailer the boxes near the door were weathered and rippled toward the back they were intact their contents as useless as the trailer in which they sat okay zach said none of them were surprised well go back and check the smaller trucks and then welldamn what here we go zach nodded in the direction from which theyd come a few hundred feet away a lone form shuffled toward them ah jeeze ted said he scampered onto the cab of the semi shielding his eyes and scanning the area three more half a mile or so north no problem zach said just stumbling aroundthey dont know were here yet good now get down before you fall and break your fucking leg ill leave your ass i swear i got this one wayne said leaving the dolly and walking toward the slowly moving corpse fifteen feet away from the thing he stopped he smelled it through the dust mask in a van to his right what had once been a small boy of no more than three years watched him from its car seat desiccated hands pawed at the restraints there was no one else in the van the other thing was closer but not by much it was a slow one its flesh was purplishblack and swollen and its massive rigid stomach was split down the middle like a tomato rotting on the vine its gaze rarely rose from the ground and it seemed unable to lift its head its eyes lifted in its sockets and found wayne it tried to grunt hands twitching at its sides and trembling upward wayne pushed down his faceshield and lifted the bat three blows and the corpse went down its head a lumpish black sack wayne walked to the van and opened the door a dry yelp escaped the dead kids drawn lips he placed the blunt end of the bat to the side of the childs head and pushed it didnt take long there was a batman action figure on the floor of the vehicle he picked it up and placed it in the childs lap saying nothing felt wrong but nothing he could think of sounded appropriate as he shut the door he noticed two cases of water in the back of the van along with several unmarked boxes he went around back and checked them each contained various canned goods as well as several packs of pasta and ramen whoever had left the kid had been in a hurry he looked around no walking corpses no sign of zach or ted theyd moved on taking the dolly with them wayne removed the faceshield and wiped sweat from his brow he plucked a bottle of water from the van and pulling the dust mask beneath his chin downed it his heart raced and just like that the silence and the heat were almost too much he felt alone and small and he wanted to be with zach and ted even if they were maybe going to try and kill him today wayne tucked three bottles of water under his arm and walked until he saw zach and ted they were standing at the rear of an unmarked truck that had stalled in the wildly overgrown grass beside the freeway ted looked back and smiled youre not going to believe this he said wayne handed them each a bottle of water and let what he was seeing sink in pallet upon pallet of military rations the kind he and his family had lived off of in the weeks following katrina wayne said damn yeah zach said damn there were hundreds of boxes each containing sixteen complete meals from what he could see several pallets toward the back were piled with cases of bottled water the same stuff as in the van see that ted said fema is good for something after all okay zach said all business he hopped into the truck ripped away the thick plastic wrap securing the boxes to the pallets and began tossing boxes down to ted and wayne the dolly held five boxes wayne pushed it back to the jeep walking behind ted and zach who each carried one box the first trip was without incident on their second run ted got a chance to use his bat the thing that clambered like a lizard out of the forest was naked creeping around on the ragged stumps of its arms and legs no ears lidless eyes lipless mouth ted enjoyed putting it down damn ted said on their third trip to the truck he knocked back a water bottle and belched can we start the truck maybe move it or something zach stared at him for a moment blinking his face glistening with sweat dark stains seemed to emanate from the guns beneath his armpits yeah ted he said halfgrinning and nodding sure but first we have to clear out all these pine trees maybe cut a path all the way to i dont know ted said shrugging i was just saying yeah yeah okay moving on we need to load up what we can for now and come back tomorrow with the truck well get seth to somewhere nearby a dead thing howled long and mournful aw crap ted said where the hell is that coming from there wayne said not far from where hed encountered the first corpse of the day another form stood it howled again louder and longer there was urgency in the things voice oh shit zach said here and there the creatures call was answered not good run they ran their bats raised and ready on either side of the interstate the walking dead emerged from within the cool confines of the forest soon there was a chorus they overtook the howler not slowing ted took a swing at it he missed staggered and almost fell dropping the bat and then the jeep was in sight zach leaned against a tree winded ted bent over his hands on his knees panting you not going back for your bat wayne asked his back to the jeep why the fuck would i do that theres like six more in the back of the jeep ted said and wayne shot him in the face blowing away most of his jaw ted dropped mewling and clutching at where his chin used to be blood poured between his fingers he should have shot zach firstzach was always more on the ball and now he was just gone dropped from sight shit wayne said and zach appeared from behind a tree and started firing the tauruses wayne got the jeep between himself and zach from all sides the dead closed in you knew it was a real shit day when killing the class cat was the high point that was the first thing sue did in the morning and her mood had not improved mr stripestuff had been pretty sickly for a while was probably fifteen years old and going blind and there was no way anybody in the warehouse would take adequate care of him after she left she hoped theyd have a little more compassion for the kids shed be leaving behind but deep down she doubted it she let him lick the scraps from a can of tuna mixed with a packet of old governmentissue powdered creamer and a couple of crushed tylenol pms then she laid him in her lap and petted his head for a while then she put a towel over his face and a plastic bag over that she thought not about how she should just set him free but how slim his odds were out there she was doing him a favor but it wasnt easy for either of them she was gentle gentle as she could be while getting the job done and she laid him in his bed for the class to find they were on lockdown and sue couldnt get downstairs to the trash in the night she had no place to stash stripestuff in the couple of upstairs offices where the orphans lived every minute in the daytime the kidsthe nonorphans at leastgot into everything even downstairs where they were supposedly not allowed might as well make the discovery foreseeable and respectful educational too she thought wondering if maybe she was getting a little teacher in her after all then again each and every one of these kids had already seen death firsthand in unimaginable manners and quantities what could they learn from a cat her smile evaporated the classsuch as it was twenty kids spread over ages three to ten being overseen by a clerk and a dental assistant whose only qualifications were that they looked like teachers both being middleaged femalesfound him in his bed having passed peacefully in the night when they assembled at eight after a little deathlessoncumceremony by sue they interred him by wrapping him in plastic sheeting and throwing him out one of the secondstory windows into the piles of red earth of the unfinished construction site next door the plastic came partly unraveled and the cat fell a little short of the dirt landing on the warehouses own blacktop what could you do but pull the shades the kids mostly cried or moped but not jayson which just confirmed everything sue felt about him he was just lucky he wasnt an orphan im hungry the little animal yelled and sue nearly lost it right there everyone in the warehouse had eaten carefully meted crackers and peanuts for lunch for christ and this little fatty was the only one bitching about it one of the oldest kids in the group but stupider than the youngest by half sue took a breath and clutching it inside her strode past the other children to grab jayson by his filthy collar and hiss in his face you are not a good child that made her smile a little bit and she set him down i hate you he shrieked with his horrible little nubby teeth and his filthy face im telling my dad that made her smile even more she reached down and pinched his cheek hard harder keeping in the thing that she wanted to growl that jaysons father was part of the reason jayson was hungry every time that asshole went out on runs the truck came back halfstuffed with liquor and all the guys cheered not considering that a few cases of saltines and applesauce only went so far another child said it im hungry sue turned feeling revived i told you leticia theres no food yet were waiting for the supply run to come back when are they gonna be here sue looked to patty the dental assistant the other woman who passed for an elementarygrade teacher in the upperlevel conference room of this welding and steamfitting warehouse in truth they were babysitters at best patty was at least slightly more experienced having had a daughter until the outbreak she had a dozen new lines on her face this week and seemed a little stoned with her eyelids not quite reaching the tops of her broad pupils well sue said leaving patty staring at the wall they were supposed to have been back a little while ago for lunch it was quarter past one my guess is they found a really nice grocery store or something and they took their time and theyre almost back now with a truck full of cookies and spaghetti and tuna how does that sound some of the younger kids gave out a little yay chorus then they were all back to doodling on their math sheets or punching at their board games sue hated them most of them wayne said there was only room for eight people on the jeep a couple more if the kids were little sue had eight orphans in her class and eleven children of other adults holed up in the warehouse she didnt have to worry about the eleven but with her and patty not minding them during the day or sleeping on pissy mattresses with them in the classroom at night the orphans were as good as dead pushing it pushing it she and patty could maybe bring five kids that meant she had to eliminate three obviously she should have done this before noon but her hangover was still wearing off then she scanned the pitiful crowd it was easy enough to gravitate toward the younger students the kindergarteners whom life hadnt yet broken but that just made them a liability it meant sue would have to be the one to watch or assist the breaking devon a fouryearold black kid gave out a horrible snorking cough the apparent culmination of some symptoms that had been dribbling out of him all day and a validation ticket for some thoughts sue had been having on the subject she sighed thanks goodbye devon sue sidled over to patty and whispered im thinking we take leticia morgan shawn and greg theyre all over sixfor the last one its between sophia sarah and avery what do you think sarahs youngest but shes got it together listens well patty grunted thats all we can take five is a lot even for two of us to wrangle outon the road christ patty say something we have to wha you have to pick do you want sophia sarah or avery devons got that horrible cough it seems serious all we need is for the kids to all get sick i cant do it yes you can wayne and ian have it all planned out we cant stay here forever i cant pick them im not going youre not making sense weve been talking about it for a week christ weve all been thinking about it for a month ever since ian said seth wanted to quit doing rescue runs and stick to supplies you can do this we have to do it the warehouse is a deadend situation picking the kidsthats all hypothetical anyway if wayne can come back with hard proof that zach and ted are murderers then maybe seth will see that we all have to go of course ill go if we all go but if he doesnt if seth wants to stay im not justim not just going to leave its too dangerous ill stay here with the kids theres food no there isnt usually usually there is theres protection patty said seth keeps things running here pretty well sue rubbed her face ohhh my god you really believe that youd really rather stay it doesnt matter i cant leave any kids none of them none of them deserve that shhh so that was it it was a goddamned mother thing sue stole a look out the window no jeep yet sweetie brandys gone you cant help her let me put it to you this way what would brandy want you to do shed want you to do the thing that was best for everyone right well staying isnt good for anyone this is a place for dying think about plaquemines parish did you ever take brandy down to port sulphur did she like it well its great that area you can grow just about anything fish shrimp its breezy think about the kids that are here i am think about them growing up here in this building theyre not even going to last long enough to grow up theyre going to starve here notheyre exploring i therell be something up there bullshit theres fewer men practically every week to do that and you know why you want to do something good for these kids pick which ones we can take and lets get the fuck out of here now patty was weeping jesus what a drama queen you dont have to take any if you want i know you dont really all right all right she squeezed pattys shoulder and peeked out the window again im taking the four i said id take and then sarah with or without your sorry ass she smiled as she said this realizing that some kids eyes were on her that woke patty up you cant you cant possibly manage five kids i can and i will her face was getting warm but she anchored the smile watch me im making this shit happen ill be goddamned if im gonna stay here and rot sarahs too little leave her and then sue stopped hearing she must have been hyperventilating because her head felt hot but her mouth felt cold she ran her fingers through her hair and left the room went for the stairs she looked down into the main warehouse area fully lit now by the afternoon sun through the skylights wayne was downstairs how did he get here so quietly she didnt see a jeep he was already talking with seth who had on his stained pink shirt and striped tie like he was still middle management sue ran down the rattling iron stairs both of them wayne was saying seth nodded gravely and looked up at sue she had her mouth open but something in waynes eyes told her to shut it bad news sue zach and ted are dead call everyone around the managers office bathroom was the only real private room in the warehouse thats where sue waited for wayne after the meeting drinking a longhoarded abita beer playing with the candles on the ruststained toilet that could no longer be used fixing herself up as best she could in the mirror finally he came in what happened out there wheres the jeep shh he said they tried to kill you didnt they why didnt you tell seth inot really maybe they were going to maybe what did seth say will they come i didnt put it to them i dont think thats wise wayne put his hand on the wall behind sue what were just going just us no caravan he dropped his arm seth cant be trusted she stamped her foot how are we going to make it anywhere without that kind of backup wayne do you hear me i dont trust seth anymore i dont think zach and ted were acting alone i think it came from higher up sue leaned back against the wall they did try to kill you well they didnt get a chance the dead got them first i gotyou know i went ahead and shot them oh christ i was scared i kept thinking about the plan i dont even know if we were right anymore i panicked shh its okay she put a hand on his chest you were right you were right just like we planned just a little different and its good you told seth and all that they were killed by the dead thats fine cover you did good i dont knowi worry that they that ted or zach might what might wander back here i dont know i cant stop thinking about it you didnt finish them i dont know christ

away the kids are half the damn point sue what do you care you dont even know their names she said pattys not coming he sighed whatever just get everything together keep it quiet dont spook anyone give me that beer were leaving at daybreak get some sleep she left the bathroom and headed upstairs shaking and wondering if she could sleep tomorrow would start no better than today had in the classroomorphan bedroom she stepped over the mattresses in the dark and just grabbed clothes from unwashed piles as she passed stuffing them into a backpack trying to get things for the ones shed decided on but just not entirely sure in the dark with this pitiful flashlight children slept like the dead patty was asleep on the floor devon breathed and it sounded like a greasy drain gurgling the shoes she had to be sure of the shoes she put the correct pair next to each childs head morgan leticia greg shawn sarah these were the ones she could help these ones sue had just fallen asleep when wayne woke her up to say the dead had found the warehouse the sun vanished and others like him emerged from the forest they shambled by paying him little mind some marred and broken and beautiful beyond expression others as plain and dull and ugly as the laughing ones with the roaring metal things and the wheels the night was cool and damp when he tried to breathe the air felt empty and used up it had nothing to give him fortunately he needed nothing right thennothing physical at least he could just sit there oblivious and unknowing unknowing but not unthinking his mind was a blur of images and feelingspeople and places and things and all the emotions they evoked in him several times in the long night he clutched at his head and rocked back and forth moaning because the thoughts hurt him it wasnt that they were all images of violence or terrorvery few of them were in fact the pain was from the cacophony of his mind for all the images and feelings came at him without order logic or connection he could not choose what he would think or even pick from among a certain set he could not call forth thoughtshe was only assailed and bombarded by them and the assault seemed as painful as any kind of physical torture he lacked words for most everything that passed through his mind and that contributed more to his mental anguish without labels or categories even pleasant feelings seemed disorienting and disappointing for he could not understand or explain his pleasure and this pain was increased by his inability to hold on to anything or to anticipate what thought or feeling might come next instead he was constantly subject to the whim of some unknown force inside or outside himself when he could calm himself enough to observe and not be tormented by his mind he noted that one person appeared repeatedly in his thoughts a young girl with blond hair and fair skin her age and looks varied in his different thoughts of her but he recognized her as the same girl she was surrounded by different people in various clothes often outside among trees and flowers in many thoughts she was making a happy sound with her mouth that he tried to duplicate but could not but the memory of it still gave him joy and contentment but his contentment was disturbed because he could not understand her connection to him or why he should think so much of her he did not know her name his inability to articulate or specify who she was increasingly oppressed and confounded him till he let out his second loudest and longest moan of what seemed an endless night the longest and loudest wail came from him a couple hours later when an even more fundamental deficiency tore at what was left of his mind and soul he realized shortly before dawn that he could not name or understand his feelings for her seeing her with his minds eye was a pleasant experience it was not fear or pain or anger for examplefeelings of which he seemed to have retained a better fuller conception it was not a need or hunger exactly even though he intensely wanted to see and hear the girl again but his wanting her was not the same as the physical thirst and hunger that wrenched his insides from his throat to his abdomen and twisted them into a knot of burning pain and grasping desire if anything thinking of her made him forget about his broken torn body it made him forget himself entirely and think only of her and what she might need or feel or want it seemed all the more imperative to know what such a selfannihilating feeling might be called and what might be expected of one who felt such a thing so intensely as any understanding of this feeling seemed completely beyond the grasp of his damaged mind he loosed a cry to the uncaring stars as long and piercing as any sent forth from a living man as he died forsaken and alone the fact that he was already dead only seemed to increase his loneliness and separation from anyone or anything that might ease his pain as the orange orb of the sun pushed up above the tops of the cool forest around him the light soothed him somewhat and he could let the feelings and thoughts of the girl occupy him rather than hurt him he would simply have to go on with them as his mental landscape looking at the stiffened female body across his lap the smears of his blood and hers on the pavement around him he realized these did not frighten or hurt him and if they did not then he would ignore the pain of his thoughts perhaps even let their beauty distract him from the ugliness and destruction all around he laid the woman gently on the ground and folded her hands across her chest smoothing her beautiful hair one last time he pulled himself up to his full height and shuffled away from the body he had no plan but something in the words on the signwelcome to louisianamade him think of her the girl in his mind his shoes crunched on broken glass he didnt like the sound wayne watched from the darkness at the foot of the stairs his flashlight hung from his belt his right hand rested on his holstered gun the skylights were just useless blue rectangles now all the lowerlevel windows were longsince boarded up you couldnt see the dead amassing outside but you could hear them shuffling and grunting in the primeval twilight occasionally they banged on the aluminum walls and it echoed through the building to sound like a stage storm making it hard to hear the living as they scuttled in between points of artificial light wayne held his watch to his face and pressed the light button the sun would be down in half an hour five minutes and they were out of here ready or not where the hell was ian keep your voices down seth said hissing trying to rally the troops and failing miserably several men clustered around him voices raised in the darkness their wan faces washed in the cold light cast by various batterypowered fluorescent lanterns outside the dead moaned listen listen seth said and someone shouted him down they needed to get out of here and now no someone else said it may have been hank but wayne wasnt really sure how did they find us how did so many gotta get to the trucks and to shut up they can hear already know were in here how many are there gunshots from above brought silence then the hollow thump of the aluminum roof sheets shifting beneath the weight of the gunmen if youd just listen for a minute seth said no longer bothering to keep his voice down i was trying to another shot interrupted him he raised his voice steve and brian are on the roof were safe here thats why we static and then a voice seth its brian over motioning for those around him to stay silent seth plucked the walkietalkie from his hip and held it to his face talk to me over theres gotta be fifty or sixty out here right now over we can handle that a few seconds of silence wayne looked at his watch again he could hear one of the kids upstairs crying somewhere a walking corpse pounded on the side of the warehouse with what sounded like a pipe more gunshots brian over yeah we can but were making a hell of a lot of noise they might just keep coming you know how the shouts from those around seth drowned out the rest the large group splintered into smaller groups the familiar cliques coming together at last its waynes fault finish the job followed his trail thats not how it works theyre not that smart led them right to us where is he crouching in the darkness wayne pulled his gun killed the safety almost almost seths small group pulled together shouted for everyone to listen said that they had to work together that theyd survive if they could just the trucks one of zachs pals said his own group advancing on seths everywhere people scurried vanishing into the offices that served as their living quarters above the gunfire continued outside the dead howled and pressed in give us the keys were getting the fuck out of here im not giving you the keys tevin just take a minute and think about what youre someone shot seth and then the air was buzzing with lead wayne dropped low and let the whole thing play itself out a second of silence followed by the cries of the wounded on the roof the men continued to fire their guns the dead hammered the building someone ran by their flashlight beam bobbing wayne leapt to his feet and took the stairs two at a time here they are someone said wayne heard keys jingling and then he was in the classroom he closed the door behind him sue held the small black boy to her chest he pressed his face to her neck weeping some of the kids were standing tears in their eyes others still sat amid their sheets and pillows stuffed animals held to their chests patty sat at the back of the class just out of the glow cast by sues lantern she held two children close to her whats happening barely holding it together whos shooting some guys are on the roof picking them no someone in the warehouse fired a gun seth someone seth shot somebody no somebody shot seth we have to oh god is he are you ready wayne said now sue asked looking around jittery wait wheres morgan bathroom patty said jesus sue bit her lip and stood kids get up were going not you hearts patty said to the kids in the back and closed her eyes leticia greg and shawn gathered by waynes side sue looked around wheres sarah sarah shes staying with me patty said pulling one of the shadows closer her voice slurred wayne said we can come back you can fit we all can fit we can goddamn it sue made fists at patty and screamed you idiot youre going on foot patty said the jeep is just four blocks away wayne answered we can you told seth that you left it behind patty said youre going to get them killed do you have your gun wayne asked staring at pattys shadowed form i have three okay lets move more gunshots shouting from downstairs the drone of the gathering dead the kids wailed they closed patty in the back room and stopped in the hall to the stairs wayne looked at sue and whispered i didnt know you wanted that one he wont let go of me she sighed i dont know wherehe couldnt tell me where his shoes were i just have to fucking carry him we can make it wayne said fighting back the urge to yell and curse we just need to be fast justwait what is it sue asked i think i heard the motor pool loading door rolling up damn it theyre gonna get in an eruption of gunfire sue switched the small boydevon wayne rememberedto her left arm and pulled her gun she nodded wayne pulled leticia the smallest of the three standing around them onto his right hip she wrapped her arms around his neck now hold on tight okay dont let them get me okay wayne said sucking in a deep breath sue behind me you cover our right i have the left get them between us sue nudged the two crying boys between them wayne winced there were seven or eight in all but damn it they were so small hold onto my belt he told shawn now he looked at sue just like we planned okay okay he opened the door and led them out the vast expanse of the warehouse was lost to darkness their flashlight beams seemed to die on black air a row of offices separated one warehouse from the other the dead may have been packed shoulder to shoulder in the motor pool but there were none to be seen on this side of the facility they took the stairs slowly somewhere voices raised in anger more popping gunshots from outside heavy footsteps on the roof at the bottom of the stairs wayne stopped the kids head bumped into his back feet shuffled somewhere nearby ian stepped from the darkness and sank his teeth into the soft flesh of leticias shoulder she screamed waynes gun thundered ian dropped sue and the kids screamed retreating falling over one another she opened fire shooting at nothing leticias hot blood doused waynes hand her grip on his neck tightened she screamed and screamed and then there were more of them shambling through the darkness toward them wayne screamed go back and trailed sue and the kids to the top of the stairs ill take care of these ill get the jeep wait in here he pried the screaming and wounded child from his neck and passed her to sue take care of her he said and with the click of the door shutting was gone at the bottom of the stairs two more dead things bumped into one another trace and mark killed in the shootout over the keys he took them down and moved toward the loading door his flashlight beam passing over seths body in the direction of the motor pool someone yelled an engine revved there would only be a few of them milling around outsidemost of them would have flocked toward the motor pool loading door some forty feet to his right he could get through with ease probably holstering his gun and still gripping the flashlight he grabbed the chain with both hands hoisted the massive door some five feet from the ground and dashed into the night cold hands groped for him and he stumbled over a fallen corpsethey were everywhere thanks to the snipers now long since gone the walking ones closed in grunting and eager he rolled kicking and thrashing and fumbling for his gun fuck his holster was empty one of them threw itself onto him his chin hit the concrete blood flowed rolling from beneath its thrashing dead weight he scrambled to his feet and ran into zach the dead man gasped its breath rank wayne jerked back pulled the doctor from the holster on zachs right hip and blew the things head into pulp a pickup truck burst from within the motor pool tires screeching and bouncing over the parking lot dividers screaming and flailing several people flew from the truckbed and slammed against the concrete wayne ran the further he got from the warehouse the less activity he found within five minutes he found himself sliding behind the wheel of the jeep panting two minutes later the headlights passed across the nightmare taking place outside of the warehouse sue walked toward him clutching devon to her chest her gun held high there was no sign of shawn or greg save the glistening red tangle over which the things fought just inside the loading door its ragged jaw twitching and useless teds corpse dragged its baseball bat through the blood pooled around the feast on the roof someone waved and yelled for help wayne brought the jeep to a halt are either of you bit sue shook her head good get in she did they drove away he walked for days thinking of the girl and of her hair though not entirely sure which hair or which girl sometimes he wondered where she was what had happened to her or if the signs around him had anything to do with her new orleans one of them said but that wasnt quite right almost right maybe but not quite it was and it wasnt his wandering carried him from the highway and into a town hammond the sign said and that meant something to him or had the town was shattered and wrecked and broken like the stumbling forms who were so like him and not at all like him one storefront was more thoroughly destroyed than the others he had seen the front doors were lying on the ground ripped from their frames he looked past them and saw a small machine about the size of a man lying further from the store as though it had somehow been yanked through the doors tearing them out along with it the small machine had three letters across the topatm he didnt recall what it was used for but it looked sad lying there he looked back to the devastated store to the left of the entrance a dead woman stood raking her head back and forth across the wall little pieces of her face clung to the bricks as he stepped into the store she pulled her forehead away from the smeared rainbow of filth to watch with listless eyes as he passed because so much damage had been done to the front of the store it wasnt as dark inside as the others boxes and trash were everywhere the floor was slick with dirty water the broken doors let the rain in and this reminded him of something else something that came to him only in images the interior of the place he shared with the girl sodden and ruined black stuff growing on the walls he moaned once and a dead boy sitting in the middle of the candy aisle moaned in return he peeled the crinkly and shiny paper away from something colorful dropping the paper he placed the colorful thing into his mouth retched and spat he made his way slowly to the back where there were hundreds of little plastic bottles all over the floor a few were also on metal shelves he picked one up it rattled unlike his random thoughts in the night one now came to him with some logical connection though it was as unbidden and unpredictable as any of the others he remembered the girl needed what was inside these little bottles he remembered opening them for her and very carefully counting out two of the little white disks into her palm he fumbled with one bottle now but there was no chance of him opening it he raised it up to look at the label but the print was too small for him to read when he noticed this problem he instinctively reached for his shirt pocket he remembered there was always something in that pocket that would help him read things that were too small though he couldnt remember what the device was called or what it looked like but his pocket was now empty he began going through all the bottles arranging many of them on a counter there in the back of the store he couldnt read any of the labels but he tried different ways of arranging the bottlesfrom biggest to smallest or in an undulating wave of descending and then ascending sizes or separating the round bottles from those with squared corners then came combinations of the various organizational methods hed tried he was very careful and spent most of the day on this project he didnt know why he did this or what exactly guided his hand but he knew when he had the bottles arranged in the right way the way that formed the perfect pattern on the counter he stepped back to admire it then he stepped forward and counted the seventh bottle and removed it stepping back the pattern still looked right counting another seven he removed a bottle and still the pattern looked to him unmarred by this removal he repeated this process five more times and when he was satisfied the remaining pattern was still the correct one he looked at the seven bottles he had chosen he nodded these too were correct he thought and put them in the hole in his stomach next to the metal band he had taken from the woman he walked from the store and continued down the street feeling somewhat more full and satisfied than before eventually he worked his way back to another highway i the signs said new orleans his mind buzzed and he walked and walked the sun sank and rose and he walked and sometimes he sat down and closed his eyes or pulled the round thing out of his stomach and held it when the sun got too hot on his skin he sought peace in the shade of the forest or beneath one of the large wheeled things or sometimes even inside one of the smaller ones he walked and walked and sometimes those like him walked with him side by side as if he had someplace to go and they wanted to be there with him other times they ignored him busy with their own broken journeys once he came across a dead man being pursued by four others the man crawled and gasped and tried to stand but the four grunted and pushed and would not let him rise battering him with loose fists and rocks bashing away his nose and shattering his teeth he moved toward them wondering in some way if he could help the man but the others pushed him away and lashed at him with sticks one of them tried to take the things in his stomach he slapped them back and as they turned their attention to the pitiful shape writhing on the ground crept away he walked and walked new orleans and and and though he didnt know what that meant he nonetheless knew it when he saw it silent and dark and still the sun was again going down as he ambled across a large bridge all over the roadway were large machines of metal and glass all of them smashed many of them burned there were motionless bodies inside most of them with many more on the pavement many were not whole but were just limbs or torsos in driedup pools of blood there were swarms of loud ugly flies all over he shook his head and kept walking looking up at the beautiful angles of the bridges proud steel frame there was another bridge next to the one on which he walked and this meant something to him too though it made little sense ccc and gno halfway across the bridge he saw a yellow metal box attached to it at eye level the box was open and a plastic thing hung from it by a cord the plastic thing was grasped by a right hand severed sloppily just below the elbow he looked above the metal box and read the sign there call now life is worth living there is hope he stared at the words for some time he tried mouthing them but his lips and tongue felt like cloth flaps attached to his body without really being a part of it the words were simple but he couldnt quite grasp them or why those ones in particular would be written on a bridge more and more he concentrated on the first word of the second sentence he tried to breathe out as he mouthed it but he couldnt control the vowel sound properly or how to press his lower teeth against his upper lip to make the f sound so it kept coming out differently as laf lav laf lof lov the effort taxed him mentally but he nodded he had made the right sound he continued to the middle of the bridge here the wind whipped across him driving off the flies one vehicle in the center of the bridge was undamaged he ran his hand along the smooth warm metal it remained a beautiful thinga most pleasing combination of curved and straight glass and metal all of it governed by symmetry and grace he balanced the little plastic bottles on the roof of the vehicle stacking them in two little pyramids of three each he put the circular metal band between the two pyramids and placed the last bottle inside the circle as he knew they would be the pyramids were precisely the same height and they were spaced perfectly the band and bottle in the middle were also formed and spaced to complete the whole it was good how they combined with each other and with the lines of the vehicle if there were any people left perhaps they would see it and admire or enjoy it he turned from this creation to the guardrail behind him the city was motionless dead and silent in the days dying light beneath the bridge the water seemed to sit bloated and unmoving a thing dead and stagnant but if he concentrated he knew he could hear its whispering rush full of power mystery and promisequalities he heard more and more distinctly as he spun toward the waters black surface and his uncertain rebirth wayne had been counting on the path still being there and it was one of the very last efforts in the city during the outbreaks had been the national guard attempting to organize things forbidding unauthorized vehicle use for their own travel they had to clear two lanes of the crescent city connection it was the only job they finished wayne drove them over the city i always found that amazing sue said that you could pass through the center of new orleans right over the st charles cable car line french quarter to the north garden district to the south and never even touch down never even have to get your tires dirty mm just float thirty feet above it like a bird on a wire she sighed you cant even see it now wayne slowed as they went up the ccc ramp the guard had cleared it yeah but there were still bits of junk everywhere devon coughed he looked like he was trying to sleep or cry sue was holding him in the front seat starting to cry herself and wayne was turned to look at them like an idiot when the jeep went bakunk there was a huffing sound and wayne knew theyd busted a tire devon was awake now and definitely crying he sounded worse than he had even an hour ago wayne pulled over then got out and paced around the jeep hed wedged the right front tire over a rusted bumper it had sliced clean through the rubber the tire was already empty there was a spare on the back but christ was it dark sue said what is it just the tire im fixing it what stay there sue he heard her door open shit get back in the car ill be done in five minutes he had the spare and the jack already this was ridiculous where are you going he heard her blubbering further up the bridge shed grabbed devon and was carrying him on her chest with his arms wrapped around her neck christ christ she panted as devons green snot wet her shoulder there were bodies all over she jogged up the lane as fast as she could thinking there might be a car up there something with the keys in it and some juice she was hyperventilating again she had no plan her face was hot with tears mosquitoes and flies fluttered in the headlights beams she could only hear her sneakers thumping the asphalt and her own sticky breathing she held devon tighter she reached the crest of the bridge to look down into gretna on the other side it was dark over there she turned wayne crouched next to the car there were no dead in sight not walking anyway maybe she should go back she spun around again and saw the pill bottle pyramids cefdinir citalopram prazepam tramadol amoxicillin more they were pastyflaky with dark blood but sue could read the labels and she recognized some of the names peggy had once told her the names of some medicines she gave to brandy after she was attacked the ones that shouldve helped but didnt which were they devon whimpered into her neck i dont like the dark i know baby sue grabbed all of the bottles stuffed them between her body and devons and turned back toward the jeep zombie season by catherine macleod catherine macleod has tried to watch night of the living dead but every time she does she spends so much time with her hands over her face she cant actually claim to have seen it when not cowering behind her hands she writes fiction which has appeared dozens of times in the canadian science fiction magazine on spec and in other magazines such as talebones transversions and the frenchlanguage magazine solaris her work has also appeared in anthologies tesseracts bits of the dead and open space forthcoming work includes her story stone which will appear in horror library death is a horrible and terrifying thing but its a reality that has to be faced when a loved one dies most people dont feel like doing anything but grieve sadly there are a whole host of practical issues that have to be attended tophone calls to make financial affairs to be put in order and funeral arrangements to be made a coffin must be picked out the body must be prepared and a service planned and of course before a person can be buried in the ground someones got to dig the hole and thats when society turns to our gravediggers we all know this is a vital occupation but perhaps because of our discomfort with the idea of death we tend to form some pretty strange ideas about those who dig graves ask your average person to picture a gravedigger and what do they imagine some weirdo right some lurking creep with frenzied hair and haunted eyes a guy with a strange voice who spends too much time by himself its an ugly stereotype and its high time that something was done to set the record straight gravedigging is an honorable profession and our gravediggers deserve better treatment at the hands of authors and moviemakers we hope that our next story which portrays a gravedigger as a brave zombiebattling hero will eliminate those negative preconceptions and give everyone a more positive wholesome image of gravediggers everywhere the secrets all in the salt people just expect the town zombie hunter to carry it along with a shotgun and squirtbottle of gasoline i dont believe itll protect me but if carrying it makes folks feel safer thats fine of course ive always carried salt but not for reasons that would make anyone feel safe and thats fine too the first shriek shreds the air at am and im ready i was a gravedigger back before judgment day put me out of a jobno use digging holes if the deceased arent going to stay in themand these days people say i just have a natural way with the dead privately i dont think much of their appetite for living flesh but i dont judge some people fear the dead no matter what and back then i didnt understand now i do the dead know too many secrets and some folks have reason to worry like adam wade saying his crazy wife ran off to new york only to have her shamble on home with her head stove in or the preachers pureasnewsnow daughter dying of pneumonia then wandering into church yesterday with the remains of a dead baby caged in her ribs but everyone has secrets i suppose how bad they are is just a matter of opinion then again concern for opinion has always kept me closemouthed about my own my seven oclock job is a zombie on main street who probably wouldnt even have noticed miretta jackson if she hadnt started screaming at it then again its henry jackson mirettas late husband she screamed at him nonstop when he was alive and old habits die hard i shoot him down spare the gasoline and drop a match on the chance thatyup you can always tell whos been embalmed they go up like marshmallows i watch the fire from the coffeehouse as i eat pancakes and ketchup the waitress gina says billy martin i swear you have no taste just like always then like always she glances at my shotgun and moves off its coming on fall now and the dead slow down in cool weather theyre no good at all in winter ill have to start curing meat to put by while the huntings still good gina has no idea saying i have no taste after all isnt my salt mixed with parsley and thyme life is easier these days i dont have to dig the dead up anymore or worry about getting caught and no one wants to watch me roast zombies especially when one might be their own dearly departed still im discreet only the dead know my secret and i doubt theyll judge people say i just have a natural way with the dead and i think that might be true that and the secret really is all in the salt tameshigiri by steven gould a hugo and nebula award finalist steven gould is

currently working on another entry in the jumper series his short fiction has appeared in analog asimovs science fiction amazing stories the years best science fiction and torcom when not writing gould spends entirely too much time killing zombies on his xbox ninjas were spies saboteurs and assassins in ancient japan in japan the equivalent term shinobi is more common but westerners prefer the sound of ninja ninja was an officially recognized job and only those of a certain income were allowed to keep ninjas on the payroll ninjas commonly wielded swords katanas throwing stars shuriken and chain and sickle weapons called a kusarigama while popular imagination pictures ninjas clad in black in real life ninjas probably tried to blend into the local population by dressing as priests entertainers and merchants much of japanese architecture was originally developed as a defense against ninjas including the use of gravel courtyards and nightingale floors that made it difficult for intruders to move about silently gould says that this story is all my fault i made the mistake of saying on twitter something like ninjas awesome zombies awesome ninjas and zombies double awesome john joseph adams saw it and asked if i was writing such a thing i wasnt but i said that i could a student of iaidothe japanese sword as a martial artfor over twelve years gould didnt need to do much research for the story but he says he did stand out in the middle of his backyard with a bokken wooden sword for a while working on some of the moves depicted in the story why zombies the scary thing about zombies slow or fast is that there will always be more gould says it doesnt matter how many you kill eventually more will arrive zombies are a palpable biting representation of our own mortality and mortality stinks and it has rotting flesh in medieval japan there was a swordsmith who volunteered to execute a felon so he could perform tameshigiritest cuttingon his latest blade when the convicted man saw the sword maker he said if i had known it would be you i would have swallowed stones to ruin your blade some days youre the sword maker slicing cleanly through flesh and bone and some days youre the poor bastard forcing rocks down your throat right before they put the steel to you sure youre going to die but you dont have to go easy we walked twenty minutes through the kitchen gardens before we got to the southern wall the gate wasnt manned but we only had to wait a few minutes before the guard walking the parapet got there slung his rifle and came down the ladder huffing and puffing he checked senseis pass and then richard pushed forward like he does to be next the guard glanced at richards pass and then up at his face richard torres you look like your brother didnt he go missing a few weeks back you think snapped richard why do you think sensei touched richard on the arm no sign of diego i take it sensei said to the guard not on my watch no he gave richard back his pass took lous looked at her and blinked they all do when they see her i mean shes gorgeous most days but for some reason today she glowed louise patterson i think i knew your sister in high school how is she dead said lou nine out of every ten died in the infestation youd think hed know better he swallowed gave her back the pass and took mine hello i dont think ive met you before new to town i laughed sourly you sat behind me in algebra danny you kept copying my work he took a step back and stared down at my pass his free hand touched the opposite elbow wow rosa youve uh filled out yes i said i was skinny back then but now i had curves he was stocky before and still was surprising that considering the rationing i didnt comment though about his weight or what had happened back in high school we wanted to get through the gate after all he turned back to sensei as if i wasnt there weapons just the pig stickers right we held open our packs so he could see guns and ammo were reserved for the defense of the community you could travel outside but ammo and guns stayed in unless it was the guards going out to watch the fields during planting weeding or harvest there are other reasons too just the swords said sensei danny undid the massive padlock holding down the hinged bar then said dont open it until ive checked from above right sensei nodded his face impassive understood of course sensei understood hed been outside more than anyone else in town danny went back up the ladder and unslung the rifle theres some in the cornfield over there he pointed to the left of the gate maybe six or so standing up but there could be more lying down the corn is getting pretty high he pointed to the right the soybeans are only kneehigh and theres one wandering around in there the road he lifted his rifle and fired one shot there the road is clear until it dips down toward the river sensei glared at danny lou frowned whatd he do that for hes going to draw them to the gate sensei sighed its not as if were trying to avoid them lou he gestured and i went to the bar and lifted it richard drew his sword and held it hasso pointed straight up near his right shoulder i heard sensei sigh slightly but he didnt say anything sensei gestured again and i pushed the lefthand door opened outward on welloiled hinges until it was ninety degrees open richard sprang out looking around wildly lou rolled her eyes and i nodded the asphalt was cracked and weedlined but the field crews had cleared any sizable brush away twenty feet on either side a hundred feet in front of the gate a body sprawled across the faded median stripesdannys target richard took several steps forward and stopped in the middle of the road sword still raised on high i looked behind the door before moving forward but it was clear sensei said richard put away your sword richard looked back at sensei his eyes wide sensei said what do we study battoho sensei the art of drawing and cutting yes so save your strength trust your training we are out in the open you will have lots of time to draw yes sensei richard did noto the sheathing of the sword in the shindo munen ryu style first lowering the tip forward reversing the grip and swinging the blade up so the mune the back of the blade rested on his shoulder then bringing the saya the wooden scabbard forward until it touched the mune he brought the tskua the handle forward until the swords tip crossed the opening of the saya and then reversed sliding it home done smoothly and quickly it is beautiful to see i winced this was not beautiful richard nearly stabbed himself in the hand sensei stepped forward close to richard and said something quietly richard blushed but he stepped back and said yes sensei from the wall danny said loudly be back before dark right lou held her finger to her lips and danny laughed making no effort to keep his voice down once an asshole always an asshole we turned away and a minute later i heard the gate shut and the bar drop sensei led us on sticking to the road first going toward the zombie that danny had shot from the wall ten feet short sensei stamped his foot hard on the ground the body twitched sensei shook his head and stepped back danny had made all that noise for nothing the shot had grazed the side of the zombies head tearing away an ear but the central nervous system disconnect hadnt happened it pushed itself up on all fours and looked at us it was bald and scabby but it had been a woman once a pearl earring still shiny in the sun hung from the remaining ear once i saw that i couldnt help looking for the other earring yep there it was on the asphalt six feet up the road still attached to the other earlobe lou said sensei hai lou slid forward feet brushing across the asphalt richard gave her an angry glance but lous attention was focused on the zombie as she moved closer it shoved up with its arms coming upright on its knees lou drew and cut with one motion horizontal her left arm pulling sharply back on the scabbard as the tip cleared the sword cut cleanly through the neck the body dropped down and the head bounced off the payment and rolled to the side sensei nodded lou cleaned her blade with alcohol put the sword back in its saya and threw up in the ditch richard opened his mouth to say something but i turned sharply so my saya struck his hip when he turned frowning to look at me i said oh sorry sensei glanced back at us then pointed out across the soybeans to a figure shambling in our direction yours rosa richard you go along and observe he lifted two fingers up and pushed them toward his eyes yes sensei i said eyes open richard walked directly toward the zombie but i said walk in the rows come winter well be eating these beans if you leave any alive i didnt look to see how he took that but set off briskly between two rows of plants at right angles to the road my zombie swung its head toward me and changed course it was one of the stupider ones unable to predict an intercept point so it walked in a constantly changing curve always turning toward me when i was halfway there i saw a dark spot two rows over i held up my hand and looked back at richard but he wasnt watching me or the rows his eyes were on the moving zombie richard i hissed he jerked to a stop ten feet in front of him the dark spot sat up it was missing one arm from the elbow down possibly shot off by one of the wall guards but it got to its feet surprisingly quick it had been a man tall and thin and it was closer to richard than i was when it lurched toward him richard his face white as a sheet took a step forward drew and cut richards arm was clenched so tight that the cutting arc was abbreviated slicing the air in front of the zombie i reached it then from the side and hamstrung it cutting the tendons behind the knees it flopped down but kept crawling forward toward richard finish it i said quietly and headed back toward my original target this one had been a soldier combat fatigues still recognizable but too stained to read the insignia i took a stance ten feet before it hasso sword above my right shoulder as it took one last step i went forward and cut kesa upper right to lower left when id finished the stroke its head and right arm lay to my left and the rest of it lay at my feet i turned back to see how richard was doing hed managed to cut off the other arm and into the zombies spine midback which had at least stopped it shoving forward with its legs at that point finally richard had managed the head though it had been high hed cut through even with the ears so the top of the head was on the ground but the lower jaw tongue extending oddly upward still hung on the neck lovely clean your sword i said getting out my own baggie of alcoholsoaked rags wed all had the vaccination but it was only seventyfive percent effective better to take all precautions sensei and lou joined us then sensei examined both kills quietly when wed sheathed our swords he said right this way there were a lot more of them down in the river bottom there were vacation homes on the high banks and a series of fishing camps but mostly it was the water that drew them they drink a lot if they can the scientists arent sure if they need the water but the speculation is that they feel a burning and they try to quench it its the same burning that drives them at the uninfected drives them to consume something that they dont have anymore as if eating it will give it back sensei took the next group three zombies giving a lecture first when there are more than one you cant afford to wound you must disable or kill wounded they just keep coming so sever the spine or split the brain or take a leg once they are down you can finish those that need to be finished then he showed us he took the first one with a shomen cut shomen means head after all but it refers to the vertical cut which in this case came down from the top of the skull right between the eyes all the way into the throat before it stopped sensei stepped aside as the next one rushed through and he cut into the neck from behind cleaving the spine but not the entire neck for the head flopped forward and hung there as it made one more stumbling step before sprawling forward he took the last zombies leg from the side cutting through the femur right above the knee while it was trying to struggle upright again he decapitated it like an executioner the next zombies came as a pair moderately spaced sensei gestured okay richard just relax remember that youre cutting with the last four inches of the blade extend be aware of your environment richard moved forward with sensei following a bit behind lou and i stood back to back our eyes checking all around you okay i asked since shed thrown up i hadnt had a chance to talk to her yeah something i ate i guess well it wouldve bothered me too i just couldnt help thinking that she was a person once someone raised her tucked her into bed gave her those pearl earrings yeah someone did and it probably ate them cynic i said what was that with danny boy back on the wall when he remembered who you were he backed away quick enough he tried to grope me once id been with sensei for a year already i dislocated his elbow richard and sensei were closing on the two zombies richard in the lead i dont think i can look lou said well i said he hasnt stabbed himself yet i held up my left hand there were three triangular scars on the webbing between my thumb and forefinger i got myself enough times at the dojo it would be better if he had hed have the respect he needs for the blade there was truth in that you shouldnt be afraid of the blade but you should certainly be respectful of it richard drew his sword ahead of time and held it behind him low in waki gamae the hidden stance when the first zombie approached he cut up from the side trying to do a reverse kesa but the blade stuck in the ribs short of the spine richard threw himself to the side wrenching hard and the blade came free but he stumbled backwards and fell sensei tensed but didnt move richard got up on his knees and stayed there when the zombie with the slashed ribs approached he cut horizontal right below the zombies knee the zombie went down forward trying to step on a foot that was no longer there richard twisted to the side and decapitated it cleanly i heard lous sigh of relief richard kept it simple for the next one a straight shomen cut to the forehead he mustve tensed for it was more of a chop but the blade got deep enough into the brain to drop it we joined them sensei was saying cant throw everything you learned out the window now that it counts he held up his left hand and extended the pinky and ring fingers squeeze relax the blade is sharp enough to do the work if you let it speed and the correct angle matter far more than muscle richard nodded sensei had lou go next a group of four clustered close together lou ran toward them then moved quickly to the side and away so that when they turned to track her they strung out in a line she didnt draw her blade until the first cut but took a leg with it then danced past the falling zombie to kill one of the rear ones with a kesa cut to the neck she sidestepped again causing the last two to tangle with the fallen zombie now struggling up on one knee she stepped forward and killed one of the standing with a shomen cut stepped back and repeated the cut on the last standing zombie the one missing a leg crawled forward and she pivoted and took the head sensei nodded in satisfaction see how she separated them took them one at a time isolate them dont let them surround you work around the edges turn and keep turning we heard running feet then and sensei said rosa watch out its recent we all looked fearful but when it came out of the trees near the river we saw it was a woman almost normal looking clothes still intact not as pallid but there was blood down its front and the eyes were insane the recent ones infected within a month are much faster not supernaturally fastjust human fast and not as stupid they retain more of their physical skills jesus said richard its mrs steckles the steckles had left three weeks before traveling to the city looking for family i walked out putting myself well ahead of the others and it tracked on me excuse me if i still use itall of these things were human once but no more i knelt seiza sitting back on my heels it came on and its arms came up as it neared i took both feet off slicing through the ankles sliding off to the right to avoid the flailing clawing hands it thrashed as it fell but was up on knees and hands remarkably fast coming back toward me standing i cut down aiming for the neck but it lurched forward and i ended up cutting through its spine lower down below the shoulder blades it lost control of its abdominal muscles and legs but it flopped down and pulled itself forward with its arms its teeth snapped together within inches of my knee i jumped completely over it turned and cut its head off as it dragged itself back around the rictus of the face relaxed and the eyes lost their focus she looked like mrs steckles again now i felt like throwing up the others came up and sensei was saying imagine facing a large group and one of these faster ones charging into the mix he searched my face for a moment im okay sensei i said wiping the blade he gestured back toward the river lets see what we can find closer to the river we dispatched over a hundred by midafternoon and still they marched out of the woods wed engage the larger groups in a line and as we cut them down wed slowly move back to keep them from flanking us the sheer monotony of it finally overcame richards tenseness and he started looking more like he did in the dojo relaxed and focused spending his energy at the right instance to accelerate his blade instead of slowing it with excess tension we ran into two more from the steckles party or more specifically they ran into us one of them carried a baseball bat his hands hadnt lost their cunning it came in and swung at sensei like a slugger going for a fast ball and sensei took one step back and cut the wrists then finished it kesa richard finished the other after lou took off its leg midthigh it was so much worse recognizing them fortunately the older ones are so changedtheir hair falls out and their skin is scabbed flaked and swollenthat even if you knew them before your chances of recognizing them are small that helps well it helps a little sensei led us back up the hill to where an old soccer field gave a good view in all directions rest he said eat i didnt think id be able to eat but i washed carefully with my alcohol rags and waved my hands through the air to dry them i served sensei first of course it was tortillas with onions eggs and beans and my first bite showed me i could eat that i was really hungry lou barely touched hers okay sensei said lets get back to the gate richard protested sensei we havent begun to look diego could be holed up somewhere starving sensei shook his head perhaps but we need the light it gets dark early down in the bottoms we can try again tomorrow lou looked miserable but she didnt say anything i was unhappy too diego had studied with sensei longer than any of us since before when our sword study was just an adjunct to the aikido diego had brought his little brother richard to learn the sword when it had become a practical matter after ammo became scarcer and it became clear that noise would just bring more of them as far as i was concerned diego was like a brother to me and lou as if wed shared parents in a way we did in sensei danny wasnt at the gate sensei shrugged walking the wall perhaps lou asked is he still on duty oh yes said sensei shifts change at eight four and midnight he should be on for another hour easily richard went over and pounded on the gate three times hard stop it said sensei but it was too late there was a heavy rustling in the cornfield i wish id never read that book lou was mad are you insane why dont you just put a cowbell on and run back to the river sensei shook his head spilled milk keep your mind focused the rustling got louder i mean really loud they mustve been lying among the stocks like cordwood before the pounding roused them why didnt they come out when daniel fired that shot this morning i wondered aloud maybe they werent here yet lou said maybe it was the shot that drew them here twelve walked out of the corn at once then five more and then i lost count sensei said lou maybe we could throw rosa up onto the top of the wall so she could open the gate sensei drew his sword itll be padlocked remember and i dont think shed make it over the razor wire another wave walked out of the corn sensei pointed back along the wall in the other direction through the soybeans at a jog lou lead look ahead keep your eyes open well watch behind now sensei five minutes ago i left my sword undrawn and hung back with sensei letting richard keep pace behind lou there was a recently infected vigorous zombie further back in the cornfield and it got up a serious head of steam before it burst out of the stalks it was across the road in seconds and ten more seconds saw it out in front of the others i breathed out it wasnt diego sensei i said i see it ill make the first cut you finish it he kept jogging but slowed slightly drifting further back the zombie sped up and just when i thought it would leap on senseis back he sidestepped and turned so fast the sword coming across waist high cutting deep across the zombies abdomen it folded over but didnt fall staggering i pivoted and took the head the zombie dropped we kept moving its three miles to the towns west gate but theres a deep culvert where the outflow from the citys water treatment plant flows through a grate under the wall on its way to the river if we went far enough away from the wall it became more shallow but that was in the woods sensei lou asked sensei and i caught up to richard and lou and looked down it was steep fifteen feet down then back up the same on the other side also there was a trio of zombies crouched in the shallow stream follow sensei said and dropped over the edge with his sword drawn the zombie sensei landed on didnt stand a chance neither did the one he cut as he dropped but sensei fell backwards into the stream after landing and the other zombie leaped at him richard jumped he missed with his feet but he fell over and knocked the zombie sideways away from sensei he swore sharply sensei got up and cut the zombie down i looked behind the crowd was fifty yards behind and coming steadily some of them almost jogging if you could call a quick stepdrag a jog go i told lou carefully though i think richards broken his foot she slid down the steep side in a shower of rocks and dirt pulled richard to his feet and began climbing up the other side supporting richard i waited until sensei had joined them supporting richard from the other side then slid down myself i wanted to reach the far side before them if anything came out of the woods theyd be handicapped as they came over the edge i ran ten feet down the gully and scrambled up to where i could grab a root sticking out of the bank with it i reached the top in time to see two zombies come out of the woods very old zombies probably early infected they hardly looked human all their clothes had rotted off and with it lots of skin i couldnt even tell what sex theyd been but thank goodness they were slow ones i had time to pull richard over the lip before they were even close the one in front reached out its left arm and i just cut it off above the elbow it staggered in the other direction suddenly heavier on its right side it would probably have recovered its balance in another step but the gully was right there and it went over the edge i split the other one down through the sinuses and turned back before it fell on the other side of the gully the first of our pursuers had jumped down into the gully and was starting to claw its way up our side sensei tilted his neck side to side stretching his voice was calm and low lou check his leg if its a sprain bind it rosa youre with me on the edge it was a good place to make a stand they were clumsy and even unopposed it took them several tries to get up the bank to the rim mostly we just split their heads open letting them dislodge others as they fell the problem was they were still coming i didnt really see an end to them and some of them were being driven down the gully into the woods where i knew theyd be able to climb out easily wed put twenty or so down for good when lou said bad sprain i think i duct taped it then we should go said sensei start off well follow we killed fifteen more richard was moving okay limping heavily but he and lou were working well as a team with lou taking the legs and richard finishing them we went through a field of sugar beets moving down the rows parallel to the wall go for the gate someone said loudly i looked up one of the guardsnot dannywas watching us from the wall but he kept his gun slung thankfully ill be waiting he headed down the parapet at a slow jog lightfooted hed still get there well ahead of us the next field was hay cut short and harvested recently for it felt like a stubbly lawn without richards sprain we couldve sprinted across it but at least we could see everything come at us i was expecting to see more ahead of us for the wall and the gates draw them but instead i started seeing bodies bodies in pieces sensei diegos been here there were sharp cuts heads arms legs not a few were cleaved entirely through the chest from the shoulder down through the ribs he nodded and frowned one of the bodies had not been infected for it had also been eaten the infected dont eat other infected not after the first day or two something about the taste but this body had been sliced first several times including the neck sensei he frowned i dont know maybe the zombies had already killed or mortally wounded him er her and diego put her out of her misery i was looking at the blood spray definitely alive during the first cut we pushed through to the apple orchard beyond the hay the field hands had done a good job of keeping the underbrush down but the trees were unpruned and many of the branches dipped down close to the ground heavy with unripe fruit obscuring the sight lines the crowd of zombies on our tail hadnt entered the hayfield and it was clear that they were beginning to tail off as the ones in the rear got distracted and wandered away we moved carefully into the orchard looking in all directions the orchard predated the wall and the rows ran at an angle making it hard to see too far ahead we rounded one lowbranched tree and saw him two rows over diego was sitting on a pile of bodies his arms resting on his thighs his head hanging the sun was behind him casting his figure in silhouette but he was instantly recognizable by his size posture and especially his hair which he wore in a top knot like the samurai chonmage style lous hand went to her mouth and froze but richard saw him and cried out diego he turned then and the light fell across his front in one hand he held his sword in the other he held an arm someone elses arm his chin was covered with blood as was his shirt front oh no lou fell to her knees one hand went to her stomach and the other covered her mouth rosa take them around sensei gestured at the side of the orchard closest to the wall keep them moving to the gate he didnt look at us as he said this instead he walked forward his hands resting on the scabbard and handle of his sword sensei shouldnt we take him together hes still holding his sword as i said the recently infected retained their physical skills and diego had been studying with sensei for twentyfive years his physical skills were considerable could you cut him rosa im not sure i can but i must get lou and richard to the gate my will is in the kamiza at the dojo i havent changed it but you are listed as my preferred successor after diego he finally looked around at me the corners of his mouth were drawn down hard but they twitched up briefly in an almost smile and then he winked at me he stepped out briskly toward diego damn him i grabbed lou by the arm and said help me with richard weve got to run for it she was sobbing but she staggered to her feet and grabbed richards other arm we began running toward the wall diego ignored sensei and ran toward the wall too blocking our path he raised his arms to hold the sword jodan over his head but realized he still held the arm in his hand he shoved it down into his shirt where it hung the fingers just sticking above his collar then took the sword up high mate screamed sensei and diego jerked back slightly and looked confused sensei had used that command thousands of times during diegos training it meant stop or wait diego turned back toward sensei who still hadnt drawn his sword see said richard reaching out hes still in there diego its okay diego turned and slashed at richards extended arm i pulled richard back the sword cut through richards shirt sleeve sensei drew then and diego turned and slashed kesa at senseis neck sensei blocked absorbing the strike and drawing his elbows into his body then slid his sword down diegos blade going for the thumb diego drew back to cut kesa on the other side sensei drove forward letting diegos strike pass behind him and then turning away from diego while very close and bringing his blade around to cut diegos exposed side the arm diegos snack stuck down his shirtfront took the brunt of the cut and though sensei sliced all the way through it his sword only cut an inch or so into diegos abdomen diego turned like a snake and cut at senseis back but sensei had kept going putting him just out of range sensei pivoted and sliced up vertically the move from the suburi happo designed to cut from groin to chin and diego jerked backwards to avoid it i tried to get richard and lou moving again and diego saw or sensed the movement he leaped back into our path blocking the way no diego richard yelled again diego hesitated looked confused sensei closed in again and diego faced him moving away from us without unblocking our path diego struck lightning fast shomen and sensei slid off the line guiding the sword away to cut back shomen diego moved sideways without blocking and struck again so fast that sensei barely had time to get his head out of the way the sword bit hard into senseis shoulder but senseis rising block kept it from cutting all the way through the bone sensei fell and diego raised his sword again to finish sensei but i drew and thrust quickly into diegos back it didnt kill or disable but it got his attention he turned and cut viciously kesa but id stepped back as his sword went by i tried to cut his wrist but i hesitated and nicked his forearm instead he came back horizontal and lous sword blocked it at the same time tears streaming down his face richard thrust into diegos stomach diego stepped back and put his hand to the wound then held it looking at the blood he sniffed it and his nose wrinkled he gripped the sword again both hands and i dropped to my knees and said loudly dato when we bow out of class the first thing we do is take our sword out of our obi and put it down on the floor before us i set my bare sword down not in its scabbard like wed normally do but in the same position edge toward me handle to the right diego almost did it starting to lower the sword and bend his knees in reflex but then he stopped and raised it again lou lowered her sword and said diego love come to me diego froze his mouth opening and his face softening and i snatched up my sword and left hand flat on the mune thrust it up through diegos jaw and all the way into his brain diego fell to the side his sword still gripped solidly in his hands lou dropped back to her knees and threw up again we made richard limp by himself as we carried sensei to the gate we kept him from bleeding to death but it was a close thing richard brought back his brothers sword and were saving it boy or girl his child deserves something of her fathers all that throwing up wasnt just something lou had eaten sensei would never have allowed you to come along if hed known you were pregnant lou nodded and kept crying danny the southern guard was discharged from his post and set to garbage detail he wasnt at the gate because he was pilfering in the kitchen gardens had a nice business in black market tomatoes senseis shoulder was never the same he still lives at the dojo and he makes comments from the side of the mat but mostly he leaves it to me and he never went out of the gates again but i did the days of flaming motorcycles by catherynne m valente catherynne m valente is the critically acclaimed author of the orphans tales series which has won the tiptree award the mythopoeic award and was a finalist for the world fantasy award her novel palimpsestwhich she describes as a baroque meeting of science fiction and fantasyis a finalist for the hugo awards her young adult novel the

series beginning in november with the habitation of the blessed retells the legend of prester john her short fiction has appeared in the magazines clarkesworld electric velocipede and lightspeed and in the anthology dark faith where this story first appeared the inspiration for this story came when valente visited augusta maine for the first time augusta despite being the state capitol is an extremely economically depressed region and the dilapidation of the downtown area and the general atmosphere of silence and a city long past its prime truly struck me she says it looked like the zombies had taken over in and people just said well we have to go to work tomorrow the idea of that quiet apocalypse took hold of my heart an apocalypse you just have to live through and find a way to coexist with was fascinating i finally felt like i had something new to say about zombies zombies may be caused by any number of factorsa supernatural event a manmade virus or radiation from a passing cometbut one thing is nearly universal you have to kill them to survive and killing them is completely justified because its selfdefense and you have no choice but what if zombies didnt have to be killed what if they shouldnt be what if you could live sidebyside with them and make a new kind of life for yourself among them even as the world around you has fallen to pieces to tell you the truth my father wasnt really that much different after he became a zombie my mother just wandered off i think she always wanted to do that anyway just set off walking down the road and never look back just like my father always wanted to stop washing his hair and hunker down in the basement and snarl at everyone he met he chased me and hollered and hit me before once when i stayed out with some boy whose name i cant even remember he even bit me he slapped me and for once i slapped him back and we did this standingwrestling thing trying to hold each other back finally in frustration he bit me hard on the side of my hand i didnt know what to dowe just stared at each other breathing heavily knowing something really absurd or horrible had just happened and if we laughed it could be absurd and if we didnt wed never get over it i laughed but i knew the look in his eye that meant he was coming for me that glowering black look and now its the only look hes got its been a year now and thats about all i can tell you about the apocalypse there was no flash of gold in the sky no chasms opened up in the earth no pale riders with silver scythes people just started acting the way theyd always wanted to but hadnt because they were more afraid of the police or their boss or losing out on the prime mating opportunities offered by the greater augusta area everyone stopped being afraid of anything and sometimes that means eating each other but sometimes it doesnt they dont always do that you know sometimes they just stand there and watch you shoulders slumped blood dripping off their noses their eyes all unfocused and then they howl but not like a wolf like something broken and small like theyre sad now zombies arent supposed to get sad everyone knows that ive had a lot of time to think since working down at the java shack on front street became seriously pointless i still go to the shop in the morning though if you dont have habits you dont have anything i turn over the sign i boot up the registeri even made the muffins for a while until the flour ran out carrotmacadamia on mondays mascarponemango on tuesdays blueberry with a dusting of marzipan on wednesdays so on so forth used to be id have a line of senators out the door by am i brought the last of the muffins home to my dad he turned one over and over in his bloody swollen hands until it came apart then he made that awful howlingcrying sound and licked the crumbs off his fingers and he starting saying my name over and over only muddled because his tongue had gone all puffy and purple in his mouth caitlin caitlin caitlin so now i drink the pot of coffee by myself and i write down everything i can think of in a kids notebook with a flaming motorcycle on the cover i have a bunch like it i cleaned out all the stores in a few months ill move on to the punky princess covers and then the looney tunes ones i mark time that way i dont even think of seasons these are the days of flaming motorcycles those were the days of football ogres so on so forth they dont bother me mostly and okay the pot of coffee is just hot water now no arabica for months but at least the powers still on but what i was saying is that ive had a lot of time to think about them about me about the virusbecause of course it must have been a virus right which isnt really any better than saying fairies or angels did it didnt monks used to argue about how many angels could fit on the head of a pin i seem to think i remember that in some book somewhere so angels are tiny like viruses invisible too or you wouldnt have to argue about it youd just count the bastards up so they said virus i said it doesnt matter my dad just bit his own finger off and he howls like hes so sad he wants to die but being sad means you have a soul and they dont theyre worse than animals its a kindness to put them down thats what the manuals say back when there were new manuals every week sometimes i think the only way you can tell if something has a soul is if they can still be sad sometimes its the only way i know i have one sometimes i dont think i do im not the last person on earth not by a long way i get radio reports on the regular news from portland bostonjust a month ago new york was broadcasting loud and clear loading zombies into the same hangars they kept protesters in back in they gas them and dump them at sea brooklyn is still a problem but manhattan is coming around channel is still going strong but its all emergency directives i dont watch it i mean how many times can you sit through the warning signs or what we know plus i have reason to believe they dont know shit i might be the last person in augusta though that wouldnt be hard did you ever see augusta before the angelvirus it was a burntout hole it is a burntout hole just about every year the kennebec floods downtown so at any given time theres only about three businesses on the main street and one of them will have a cheerful well be back sign up with the clock hands broken off theres literally nothing going on in this town not now and not then down by the river the buildings are pockmarked and broken the houses are boarded up windows shattered only one or two people wandering dazed down the streets all gas supplied by the dead river company all your dead interred at burnt hill burying ground and that was before even our walmart had to close up because nobody ever shopped there and you know way back in the pilgrim days or maines version of them which starts in the s sometime there was a guy named james purington who freaked out one winter and murdered his whole family with an axe eight children and his wife they hanged him and buried him at the crossroads so he wouldnt come back as a vampire which would seem silly except well look around the point is life in augusta has been both shitty and deeply warped for quite some time so we greeted this particular horrific circumstance much as mainers have greeted economic collapse and the total disregard of the rest of the country for the better part of forever with no surprise whatsoever anyway i havent seen anyone else on the pink and healthy side in a long time a big group took off for portland on foot a few months ago the days of kermit and company but i stayed behind i have to think of my father i know that sounds bizarre but theres nothing like a parent who bites you to make you incapable of leaving them incapable of not wanting their love ill probably turn thirty and still be stuck here trying to be a good daughter while his blood dries on the kitchen tiles channel says a zombie is a reanimated corpse with no observable sellby date and seriously poor idcontrol but i have come to realize that my situation is not like manhattan or boston or even portland see i live with zombies my dad isnt chained up in the basement he lives with me like he always lived with me my neighbors those of them who didnt wander off are all among the pustulous and dripping i watched those movies before it happened and i think we all for a little while just reacted like the movies told us to get a bat and start swinging but ive never killed one and ive never even come close to being bitten its not a fucking movie and if channel slaps their bullet points all over everywhere i guess i should write my own what we know here just in case anyone wonders why zombies can cry what is a zombie by caitlin zielinski gradewell if the college were still going i guess id be grade a zombie is not a reanimated corpse this was never a night of the living dead scenario the word zombie isnt even righta zombie is something a voudoun priest makes to obey his will that has nothing to do with the price of coffee in augusta my dad didnt die his skin ruptured and he got boils and he started snorting instead of talking and bleeding out of his eyes and lunging at mr almeida next door with his fingernails out but he didnt die if he didnt die hes not a corpse qed channel a zombie is not a cannibal this is kind of complicated channel says theyre not human which is why you cant get arrested for killing one so if they eat us it wouldnt be cannibalism anyway just you know lunch like if i ate a dog not what you expect from a nice american girl but not cannibalism but also zombies dont just eat humans if that were true id have been dinner and theyd have been dead long before now because as i said augusta is pretty empty of anything resembling bright eyed and bushy tailed they eat animals they eat old meat in any freezer they can get open they eat energy bars if thats what they find anything once i saw a womani didnt know heron her hands and knees down by the river bank clawing up the mud and eating it smearing it on her bleeding breasts staring up at the sky her jaw wagging uselessly a zombie is not mindless channel would have a fit if they heard me say that its dogmazombies are slow and stupid well i saw plenty of people slower and stupider than a zombie in the old days i worked next to the state capitol after all sometimes i think the only difference is that theyre ugly the world was always full of drooling morons who only wanted me for my body anyway some are fast and some are slow if the girl was a jogger before shes probably pretty spry now if the guy never moved but to change the channel hes not gonna catch you any time soon and my father still knows my name i cant be sure but i think its only that they cant talk their tongues swell up and their throats expandall of them one of the early warning signs is slurred speech they might be as smart as they ever weresee joggingbut they cant communicate except by screaming id scream too if i were bleeding from my ears and my skin were melting off zombies will not kill anything that moves my dad hasnt bitten me he could have plenty of times theyre not harmless ive had to get good at running and i have six locks on every door of the house even my bedroom because my father cant be trusted he hits me still his fist leaves a smear of blood and pus and something darker purpler on my face but he doesnt bite me at first he barked and went for my neck at least once a day but im faster im always faster he doesnt even try anymore sometimes he just stands in the living room drool pooling in the side of his mouth till it falls out and he looks at me like he remembers that strange night when he bit me before and hes still ashamed i laugh and he almost smiles he shambles back down the hall and starts peeling off the wallpaper shoving it into his mouth in long pink strips like skin theres something else i know its hard to talk about because i dont understand it i dont understand it because im not a zombie its like a secret society and im on the outside i can watch what they do but i dont know the code i couldnt tell channel about this even if they came to town with all their cameras and sat me in a plush chair like one of their endless rocketteline of doctors what makes you think they have intelligence miss zielinski and i would tell them about my father saying my name but not about the river no one would believe me after all its never happened anywhere else and i have an idea about that too because people in manhattan are pretty up on their zombiekilling tactics and god help a zombie in texas if he should ever be so unfortunate as to encounter a human but here theres nothing left no one to kill them they own this town and theyre learning how to live in it just like anyone does maybe augusta always belonged to them and james purington and the dead river company all hail the oozing pestilent kings and queens of the apocalypse this is what i know one night my father picked up our toaster and left the house im not overly attached to the toaster but he didnt often leave i feed him good hamburger nice and raw and i dont knock him in his brainpan with a bat zombies know a good thing the next night he took the hallway mirror then the microwave then the coffeepot then a sack full of pots and pans all the zombie movies in the world do not prepare you to see your father his hair matted with blood his bathrobe torn and seeping packing your cooking materiel into a flowered kingsize pillowcase and then one night he took a picture off of the bookshelf my mother himself and me smiling in one of those terrible posed portraits i was eight or nine in the picture wearing a green corduroy jumper and big long brown pigtails i was smiling so wide and so were they you have to in those kinds of portraits the photographer makes you and if you dont he practically starts turning cartwheels to get you to smile like an angel just appeared over his left shoulder clutching a handful of pins my mother her glasses way too big for her face my father in plaid flannel his big hand holding me protectively i followed him it wasnt difficult his hearing went about the same time as his tongue in a way i guess its a lot like getting old your body starts failing in all sorts of weird ways and you cant talk right or hear well or see clearly and you just rage at things because everything is slipping away and youre never going to get any better if one person goes that way its tragic if everyone does its the end of the world it gets really dark in augusta and the streetlights have all been shot out or burned out there is no darker night than a maine night before the first snow all starless and cold no friendly pools of orange chemical light to break the long black street just my father shuffling along with his portrait clutched to his suppurating chest he turned toward downtown crossing front street after looking both ways out of sheer muscle memory i crept behind him down past the riverside shops past the java shack down to the riverbank and the empty parking lots along the waterfront hundreds of zombies gathered down there by the slowly lapping water maybe the whole of dead augusta everyone left my father joined the crowd i tried not to breathe id never seen so many in one place they werent fighting or hunting either they moaned a little most of them had brought somethingmore toasters dresser drawers light bulbs broken kitchen chairs coat racks televisions car doors all junk gouged out of houses out of their old lives they arranged it almost lovingly around a massive tower of garbage teetering swaying in the wet night wind a light bulb fell from the top shattering with a bright pop they didnt notice the tower was sloppy but even i could see that it was meant to be a tower more than a towerbedslats formed flying buttresses between the main column and a smaller one still being built masses of electric devices dead and inert piled up between them showing their screens and gray lifeless displays to the water and below the screens rested dozens of family portraits just like ours leaning against the dark plasma screens and speakers a few zombies added to the pileand some of them lay photos down that clearly belonged to some other family i thought i saw mrs halloway my first grade teacher among them and she treated her portrait of a chinese family as tenderly as a child i dont think they knew who exactly the pictures showed they just understood the general sense they conveyed of happiness and family my father added his picture to the crowd and rocked back and forth howling crying holding his head in his hands i wriggled down between a dark streetlamp and a park bench trying to turn invisible as quickly as possible but they paid no attention to me and then the moon crowned the spikes of junk cresting between the two towers the zombies all fell to their knees their arms outstretched to the white full moon horrible black tears streaming down their ruined faces keening and ululating throwing their faces down into the rivermud bits of them falling off in their rapture their eagerness to abase themselves before their cathedral i think it was a cathedral when i think about it now i think it had to be they sent up their awful crooning moan and i clapped my hands over my ears to escape it finally mrs halloway stood up and turned to the rest of them she dragged her nails across her cheeks and shrieked wordlessly into the night my father went to her and i thought he was going to bite her the way he bit me the way zombies bite anyone when they want to instead he kissed her he kissed her on the cheek heavily smackingly and his face came away with her blood on it one by one the others kissed her too surrounding her with groping hands and hungry mouths and the moon shone down on her face blanching her so she was nothing but black and white blood and skin an old movie monster only she wept she wept from a place so deep i cant imagine it she wept and she smiled even as they finished kissing her and began pulling her apart each keeping a piece of her for themselves just a scrap of flesh which they ate solemnly reverently they didnt squabble over it her leg or her arm or her eyes and mrs halloway didnt try to fight them she had offered herself i think and they took her i know what worship looks like i was crying by that time you would too if you saw that i had to cry or i had to throw up and crying was quieter your body can make calculations like that if it has to but crying isnt that quiet really one of them sniffed the air and turned toward methe rest turned as one theyre a herd if they are anything they know much more together than they know separately i wonder if in a few decades they will have figured out how to run channel and will broadcast how to recognize a human in three easy steps or what we know they fell on me which is pretty much how zombies do anything they groped and pulled but there were too many of them for any one to get a good grip and i may not have killed one before but i wasnt opposed to the idea i swung my fists and oh they were so soft like jam i clamped my mouth shuti knew my infection vectors as well as any kid in my generation but they didnt bite me and finally my father threw back his head and bellowed i know that bellow ive always known it and it hasnt changed they pulled away panting exhausted that was the first time i realized how fragile they are theyre like lions in short bursts theyll eviscerate you and your zebra without a second thought but they have to save up the strength for it day in and day out i stood there back against the streetlamp fingernails out asthma kicking in because of course it would and my father limped over to me dragging his broken left footthey dont die but they dont heal i tried to set it once and that was the closest i ever came to getting bitten before that night on the river he stood over me his eyebrows crusted with old fluid his eyes streaming tears like ink his jaw dislocated and hanging his cheeks puffed out with infection he reached out and hooted gently like an ape to anyone else it would have been just another animal noise from a rotting zombie but i heard it as clear as anything caitlin caitlin caitlin i had nowhere to go and he reached for me brushing my hair out of my face with one bloody thumb he traced a circle onto my forehead like a priest on ash wednesday caitlin caitlin caitlin his blood was cold after that none of them ever came after me again thats why i can have my nice little habit of opening the java shack and writing in my notebooks these are the days of punky princesses and i am safe the mark on my forehead never went away its faint like a birthmark but its there sometimes i meet one of them on the road wandering dazed and unhappy in the daylight squinting as if it doesnt understand where the light is coming from when they see me their eyes go dark with hungerbut then their gaze flicks up to my forehead and they fall down on their knees keening and sobbing its not me i know that its the cathedral still growing on the banks of the kennebec the mark means im of the faith somehow saint caitlin of the java shack patroness of the living sometimes i think about leaving i hear portsmouth is mostly clean i could make that on my bicycle maybe i could even hotwire a car ive seen them do it on television the first time i stayed i stayed for my father but he doesnt come home much anymore theres little enough left for him to scavenge for the church he keeps up his kneeling and praying down there except when the moon is dark and then they mourn like lost children now i think i stay because i want to see the finished cathedral i want to understand what they are doing when they eat one of their own if its like communion the way i understand it or something else entirely i want to see the world theyre building out here in the abandoned capital if maybe theyre not sick but just new like babies incomprehensible and violent and frustrated that nothing is as they expected it to be its afternoon in the java shack the sun is thin and wintry i pour myself hot water and it occurs to me that apocalypse originally meant to uncover something to reveal a hidden thing i get that now it was never about fire and lightning shearing off the palaces of the world and if i wait here on the black shores of the kennebec here in the city that has been ruined for as long as it has lived maybe someday soon the face of their god will come up out of the depths uncovered revealed so on so forth zero

wanted undead or alive vampire universe and the cryptopedia september changed the world and also changed science fiction fantasy and horror civilization collapsing had always been a topic of perennial interest in the field of course but after magazines were positively deluged with this sort of material and of course zombies the ultimate symbol of societal breakdown went from being a niche interest to one of the dominant images in the popular imagination familiar to everyone before characters in a zombie story might speculate about the cause of the epidemic without ever mentioning the word terrorism afterward of course thats tended to be the first word on every characters lips americas war on terror has had many casualties chief among them the nations view of itself images of us soldiers torturing naked helpless and in many cases innocent prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq haunt the american psyche and are all the more disturbing given the lingering sense that those truly responsible have never been punished in her memoir one womans army janis karpinski maintains that she was scapegoated due to sexism and that the soldiers sent to prison for the crimes were acting according to policies issued by the white house nietzsche famously warned he who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster our next story is a military thriller about zombies terrorism war and some very grim and unsavory interrogation techniques its a powerful story and much as we might wish otherwise a tale of our time battalion aide station near helmand river valley afghanistan one hour ago i never thought that anyone that beautiful could scare the shit out of me the marine sergeant sounded like he had a throatful of broken glass tell me about her sergeant i said he looked away so quickly that i knew hed been waiting for that question he tried to keep a poker face but he was a couple tics off his game sleep deprivation pain and the certain knowledge that his ass was in a sling can do that to you even to a tough son of a bitch like sergeant harper as he turned i saw the way guilt and shame twisted his mouth but his eyes had a different expression one i couldnt quite nail down tell you what that i cant bear to close my eyes cause when i do i see her that ive had the shivering shits ever since we found her out there in the sand i dont mind admitting it said the sergeant he started to say more then closed his mouth and shook his head harpers uninjured hand was freckled with powder burns and skin was missing from two knuckles he ran his trembling fingers through his sandy hair as he spoke he did it two or three times each minute his other hand lay in his lap the hand cocooned inside gauze wrappings i waited i had more time than he did after a full minute though i said where did she come from harper sighed she was a refugee we found her staggering in the foothills a refugee from what from the big meltdown out in the desert in the helmand river valley yes he didnt tack on sir he was fucking with me and i was okay with that for now he didnt know me didnt really know how much shit he was in or how deep a hole hed dug for himself all he knew was that his career in the marines had hit a guard rail at seventy miles an hour and now he was sitting across a small table from a guy wearing captains bars and no other military insignia no medals or unit patch no name tag harper had to be measuring that against the deferential way the colonel treated me like i outranked him which i dont im not even in the military anymore but in this particular matter i was able to throw more weight than the base commander more weight than anyone else in or out of uniform on the continent as far as harper was concerned when it came to throwing him a lifeline it was me and then god and god was off the clock harper couldnt really know any of that but he was smart enough and sly enough to know that i had some juice on one hand he rightly figured that i could drop him into a hole deeper than the one hed dug for himself on the other hand he had information that i wanted and he was stalling to see how best to play his only good card how long are they going to keep me here to be determined sergeant do you feel youre being inconvenienced he didnt rise to the bait its been three days not quite fortyseven hours and change seems longer he didnt even know that wed already met not sure when i was going to spring that on him it wouldnt do anything to calm him down i opened my briefcase and took out a file folder id like you to look at some photos i said and took two color eightbytens from my briefcase and laid them on the table if id tossed a scorpion on the table he couldnt have jerked back faster jesus christ i nodded at the print thats her fuck me muttered the sergeant oh fuck me fuck me fuck me take that as a yes i sat back and waited him out sweat popped all along his forehead and leaked out from his hairline he smelled like urine cigarette smoke and testosterone but i could smell fear too a whole lot of it i used to think that was a myth or something only dogs and horses could smell but lately ive learned different the kind of shit i deal with i smell it a lot and on myself too like now but i wasnt going to let this asshole know it couldcould you turn the pictures over i dont mean to be a pussy but i dont want her staring at me the whole time yknow sure i said and did so but i left them on the table try to relax smoke one if you got any he shook his head never took it up jesus h christ wish i did i opened my briefcase and took out two bottles of spring water unscrewed one and handed it to him he drank half of it down then i took some airline bottles of jack daniels and lined them up in front of him one two three if it helps i said he snatched one off the edge of the table twisted off the cap and chugged it then coughed more bravado than brains tell me about the woman i said and what happened in the cave he gave that some thought drank half of the second bottle of jack do you know my outfit second marine expeditionary brigade light armored reconnaissance battalion we were part of operation khanjar working that corner of helmand province doing some recon stuff up in the hills he began counterinsurgency work and some fox hunts to flush the taliban teams running opium through the area that whole part of the province is nothing but dead rock riddled with a million caves you could hide a hundred thousand people in there camels and all and it would take us fifty years to find half of them thats why this war was fucked from the snap the russians couldnt do it twenty years ago and we cant do it now besides nine out of ten people you meet are friendlies who look and dress just like the hostiles so how you going to know skip the politics sergeant talk about the woman he shrugged it was weird out there because last week the whole place was lit up by some kind of underground explosion we got word that some taliban lab blew up but the blast wasnt nuclear something to do with geothermal chambers or shifting plates or some bullshit like that a whole section of desert just fell into itself and there was this spike of fire that shot a couple hundred feet in the air no radiation no most of us still had tld badges and the badges stayed neutral the area was hot thoughnot with radiation but actually hot like a furnace when we reached the outer perimeter of the event zone we could see a weird shimmer and i realized that big sections of the desert had been melted to glass it looked like a lava flow rippled and dark and is that where you found the woman i asked he drank the rest of the second bottle of jack daniels and chased it with a long pull on the water bottle he was pale his eyes sunken and dark his lips dry he looked like shit and probably felt worse just mentioning the woman made his eyes jump yeah he said locals started calling in sightings of burned people and then word came down to scramble a couple of recon teams we went inand after that everything went to shit he turned away to hide wet eyes the warehouse dms tactical field office baltimore ninetytwo hours ago i was on the mats with echo teams newest membersreplacements for the guys we lost in philadelphia there were four of them two rangers a jarhead and a former swat guy from la for the last couple of hours bunny and i had taken turns beating on them chasing them with paintball guns trying to carve our initials in them with live blades swinging at them with baseball bats everything we could think of actually let me rephrase that there were ten of them this morning the four who were left were the ones who hadnt been taken to the infirmary or told to go the fuck back to where they came from we were just about to enter a practical discussion on pain tolerance when my boss mr church came into the gym at a fast walk he only ever hurries when the real shit is coming down the pike i crossed to meet him church nodded toward the recruits are these four in or out is something up yes and its on a high boil theyre in church turned to bunny sergeant rabbit get these men kitted out afghanistan no id no patches youre wheels up in fifteen bunny flicked a glance at me but he didnt question the order instead he turned and hustled them all toward the locker room bunny was a nice kid most of the time but he was still a sergeant and wed been through some shit together so he knew my views on hesitation dont whats the op i asked church handed me the file this came in as an email attachment two photos two separate sources i flipped open the folder and looked at two photos of an incredibly beautiful woman iraqi probably black hair full lips and the most arresting eyes id ever seen eyes so powerful that despite the low res of the photos and graininess of the printout they radiated heat her face was streaked with dirt and there was some blood crusted around her nose and the corner of her mouth i looked at him these were relayed to us by the people we have seeded into a swiss seismology team studying an underground explosion in the helmand river valley we ran facial recognition on them and mindreader kicked out a ninetyseven percent confidence that this is amirah my mouth went dry as dust holy shit when i was brought into the dms a month ago my first gig was to stop a team of terrorists who had a bioweapon that still gives me nightmares im not kidding couple times a week i wake up with the shivers cold sweat running down my skin and clenched teeth that are the only things between a silent room and a gutbuster of a scream there were three people behind that scheme a british pharmaceutical mogul named gault a religious fanatic from yemen called el mujahid and his wife amirah she was the molecular biologist who conceived and created the seif al din pathogen the sword of the faithful they testdrove the pathogen with limited release in remote afghani villages trying out different strains until they had one that couldnt be stopped seif al din an actual doomsday plague el mujahid brought it here and echo team stopped him but only just if you factor in the dead afghani villagers and the people killed here the body count was north of twelve hundred even so mr church and his science geeks figured we caught a break it could have been more could have been millions even billions it came down to that kind of a photo finish most of the victims turned into mindless killers whose metabolism had been so drastically altered by the plague that they could not think had no personalities didnt react to pain and were hard as balls to kill the pathogen reduced most organ functions to such a minimal level that they appeared to be dead ormaybe they were dead the scientists are still sorting it out we called them walkers a bad pun short for dead men walking the dms science chief is a pop culture geek my guys in echo team called the infected by another name yeah the z word and you wonder why i get night terrors six weeks ago i was a baltimore cop doing scut work for homeland sitting wiretaps that sort of thing now i was top dog for a crew of firstteam shooters do not ask me how one thing led to another but here i am i looked at the photos amirah the rumors of her demise have been greatly exaggerated i said church managed not to smile if youre sending us then she hasnt been apprehended no he said spotted only i arranged for two marine recon squads to locate and detain what if amirahs infected i shared a limited amount of information with the appropriate officers in the chain of command if anyone reports certain kinds of activityfrom amirah or anyonethen the whole area gets lit up lit up as in a nuclear option falls within the parameters of acceptable losses can you at least wait until me and my guys reach minimum safe distance he didnt smile neither did i youll be operating with an executive order so youll have complete freedom of movement you got the president to sign an order that fast he just looked at me what are my orders our primary concern is to determine if anyone infected with the seif al din pathogen is loose in afghanistan yeah thatll be about as easy to establish as bin ladens zip code do your best well be monitoring all news coming out of the area military civilian and other if there is even a peep that intel will be routed to you and the clock will start if i dont come back make sure somebody feeds my cat noted what about amirah you want her brought back here amirah would be a prize catch theres a laundry list of people who want her the vice president thinks she would be a great asset to our own bioweapons programs and is that what you want i asked and then he told me the helmand river valley sixtyone hours ago we hit the ground running when church wants to clear a path he steamrolls it flat our cover was that of a marine sktsmall kill teamoperating on special orders need to know everybody figured we were probably delta and you dont ask them for papers unless you want to get a ration of shit from everyone higher up the food chain and when we did have to show papers we had real ones as real as the situation required just as the helo was about to set us down near the blast site church radioed be advised i ordered the two marine squads to pull out of the area one has confirmed and is heading to a pickup point now the other has not responded make no assumptions in those hills he signed off without explanation but i didnt need any the six of us went out into the desert split into two teams and headed into indian country we ran with combat names only i was cowboy twilight draped the desert with purple shadows as soon as the sun dropped behind the mountains the furnace heat shut off and the wind turned cool not pleasantly cool this breeze was clammy and it smelled wrong there was a scent on the windsweet and sour an ugly smell that triggered an atavistic repulsion bunny sniffed it and turned to me yeah i said i smell it too bob faradaya big moose of a guy whose callsign was slimran point it was getting dark fast and the moon wouldnt be up for nearly an hour in ten minutes wed have to switch to nightvision slim vanished into the distance bunny and i followed behind slower watching as darkness seemed to melt out from under rocks and rise up from sand dunes as the sparse islands of daytime shadows spread out to join the ocean of shadows that was night slim broke squelch twice the signal to close on him quick and quiet as we ran up behind him i saw that hed stopped by a series of gray finger rocks that rose from the troubled sands at the edge of the blast area but as i drew closer i saw that the rocks werent rocks at all i followed my gun barrel all the way to slims side the dark objects were people eleven of them sticking out of the sand like statues from some ancient ruins dead charred beyond recognition fourth fifth and sixthdegree burns you couldnt tell race or even sex with most of them they were like mummies and they were still too hot to touch there was supposed to be some kind of underground lab murmured slim looks like the blast charbroiled these poor bastards and the force drove them up through the sand hope it was quick said bunny slim glanced at him if they were in that lab then they were the bad guys even so said bunny we went into the foothills onto some rocks that were cooler than the sands the other team called in the marine was on point jukebox to cowboy be advised we have more bodies up here five doa three men and two women thirddegree burns cuts and blunt force injuries looks like they might have walked out of the hot zone and died up here in the rocks he paused theyre a mess vultures and wild dogs been at them verify that what you are seeing are animal bites i said there was a long pause and it got longer i keyed the radio cowboy to jukebox copy two long damn seconds cowboy to jukebox do you copy thats when we heard the distant rattle of automatic gunfire and the screams we ran nightvision i snapped and we flipped the units into place as the black landscape suddenly transformed into a thousand shades of luminescent green we were all carrying alice packs with about fifty pounds of gearmost of it stuff thatll blow up m combat rifles amt caliber auto mags on our hips and combat si assault boots its all heavy and it can slow you downexcept when your own brothers in arms are under fire then it feels like wings that carry you over the ground at the speed of a racing tiger thats the illusion and thats how it felt as we tore up the slopes toward the path second squad had taken the gunfire was continuous as we hit the ridge i signaled the others to get low and slow bunny came up beside me those are ms boss he was right our guns have their own distinctive sound and it doesnt sound much like the kalashnikovs the taliban favored the gunfire stopped abruptly we froze letting the night tell us its story the last of the gunfire echoes bounced back to us from the distant peaks i could hear loose rocks clattering down the slope probably debris knocked loose by stray bullets in the distance the wind was beginning to howl through some of the mountain passes i keyed the radio cowboy to jukebox respond nothing we moved forward moving as silently as trained men can do when any misstep could draw fire the tone of the wind changed as we edged toward the rock wall that would spill us into the pass where second squad had gone a heavier breeze perhaps moving through one of the deeper canyons a month ago id have believed that too much has happened since i tapped bunny and then used the hand signal to listen he heard the sound then and i could feel him stiffen beside me he pulled slim close and used two fingers to mime walking slim had been fully briefed on the trip he understood the low sigh wasnt the wind it was the unendingly hungry moan of a walker i fingercounted down from three and we rounded the bend jukebox had said that theyd found five bodies second squad made eight as we rounded the wall we saw that the count was wrong there werent eight people in the pass there were fifteen all of them were dead most of them moving second squad lay sprawled in the dust the nightvision made it look like they were covered in black oil jukebox still held his m finger curled through the trigger guard barrel smoking a man dressed in a white lab coat knelt over him head bowed as if weeping for the fallen soldier but as we stepped into the pass the kneeling man raised his head and turned toward us his mouth and cheeks glistened with black wetness and his eyes were lightless windows that looked into a world in which there was no thought no emotion no anything except hunger spider and zorrothe la swat kid and the other rangerwere almost invisible beneath the seething mass of bodies that crouched over them tearing at clothing with waxwhite fingers and at skin with gray teeth holy mother of god whispered slim gods not here i said as i put the pinpoint of the laser sight on the kneeling zombie it was a stupid thing to say glib and macho but i think it was also the truth the creature bared its teeth and hissed like a jungle cat then he lunged pale fingers reaching for me i put the first round in his breastbone and that froze him in place for a fragment of a second and then put the next round through his forehead the impact snapped his neck the round blew out the back of his skull and the force flung him against the rock wall the other walkers surged up off the ground with awful cries that i will never be able to forget bunny slim and i stood our ground in a shooting line and we chopped them back and down and dead dead for good and all painting the walls with the same dripping black the narrow confines of the pass roared with thunder the waves of echoes striking us in the chest the ejected brass tinkling with improbable delicacy then silence i looked down at the three men theyd been part of echo team for a day less theyd been briefed on the nature of the enemy they were highly trained men the best of the best but really what kind of training prepares you for this the first time the dms encountered the walkers theyd lost two whole teams twentyfour seasoned agents even so the deaths of these good brave men was like a spear in my heart it was hard to take a breath i forced myself to be in the moment and i slung my m and drew my and shot each of the corpses in the head to be sure we carried thes because the low mass of the bullet will penetrate the skull but lacks the power to exit and so the bullet bounces around inside the skull and tears the brain apart assassins use it and so does anyone who has to deal with things like walkers bunny drop a beacon and lets haul ass bunny dug a small device from a thigh pocket thumbed the switch and tucked it under the leg of one of the dead walkers making sure not to touch blood or exposed skin the beacons signal would be picked up by satellite once we were clear of the area an mqreaper would be guided into the pass to deliver an airtosurface hellfire missile fuelair bombs are handy for cleanup jobs like this when you dont want a single fucking trace left we didnt take dog tags because the dms doesnt wear them we try to have a leave no one behind policy but that doesnt always play out we moved on the night was vast knowing that helicopters and armed drones and troops were a phone call away didnt make the shadows less threatening it didnt make the nature of what we were doing easier to accept hunting monsters in a region of the afghan mountains dominated by the taliban yeah find a comfortable space in your head for that thought to curl up in this was pretty much the opium highway the friendlies who lived in the nearby villages were little or no help because even though they idealistically supported us and hated the taliban they also feared the terrorists more than us and without the trickledown of drug money theyd starve to death it was a devils bargain at best but it was the reason that no one can win this war the best we could hope for was to slow the opium shipments and keep the taliban splinter cells underfunded and illprepared for a major coordinated terror offensive of the kind theyve always promised and we live in fear of something flared ahead and i held up my fist the others froze the pass we were following curled around the mountain like the grooves on a screw turning and rising toward the peak on the far side sixty yards ahead halfhidden by an outcropping of rock light spilled from the mouth of a small cave the overhang would have made the light invisible from aircraft but not for us on the ground a shadow seemed to detach itself from the wall and as i watched through narrowed eyes it resolved into the shape of a man a marine he walked to a spot outside the spill of light looked up and down the pass and then retreated to his nook he didnt see the three big men crouched behind boulders in the dark the sentry went to the mouth of the cave and peered inside the glow let me see his face he was grinning then we heard the scream a mans voice pleading a string of words in pashto ending in a screech of pain that was cut off by the sharp crack of a palm on flesh and then the sound of a woman laughing it was not a pleasant laugh it held no cheer no good will no warmth it was deep and throaty strangely wet and it rose into a mocking screech that turned my guts to gutter water we did not hail the guard the situation felt wrong in too many ways i signaled bunny to keep his eyes and gun barrel on the sentry as i circled on cat feet behind a tall slab of rock that put me on the mans six ten feet from his back even if this all proved to be a zerothreat situation i was going to fry this guy for his criminal lack of attention to duty a sentry holds everyones life in their hands this guy was handing me everyone in that cave i screwed thes barrel into the soft spot under his left ear grabbed him by the collar and slowwalked him back slim was there and he spun the guard and put him down i didnt see the blow but it sounded like a tree being felled the guard went out without having said a word slim watched our backs as bunny and i crept to the cave entrance and looked into a scene from hell the cave was clearly one that saw regular use there were chairs a card table ammunition cases cots and a stove with sterno burners a taliban soldier was tied to a folding chair ankles and wrists bound with plastic cuffs his clothes had been slashed and torn away to reveal his pale chest and shoulders his turban hung askew one end trailing down behind him where it puddled on the rocky ground between his heels several kalashnikovs stood against the wall magazines removed the other three men of the marine squad stood in a loose semicircle around the man laughing as he screamed and begged and prayed all of them were sweating a couple had red and puffy knuckles that spoke to the way this session had started if this was just a group of frustrated marines knocking the piss out of a taliban grunt partly to blow off steam and partly to try and get a handle on something that might result in some real good being done then i might have just stepped in and calmed it down yelled a bit given them the appropriate ration of shit but basically dialed it all down with no charges being filed but thats not what we were seeing these guys had taken it to a different level and in doing so had crossed the line between an attempt to gather useful intelligence and something else something darker that was not part of soldiering something that wasnt even part of torturing or enhanced interrogation something that went beyond abu ghraib and into the darkest territory imaginable they had amirahscientist designer of the seif al din wife of one of the worlds most hated terrorists there were two ropes looped around her neck each end pulled to an opposite side by a marine so that she could not approach either of them all she could do was lunge forward toward the prisoner her wrists were bound behind her her ankles were hobbled by a length of rope she couldnt flee couldnt run the men had stripped her to the waist revealing a body that was beautifully made but which now inspired only revulsion her once olive skin had faded to a dusty graygreen and there were four black bullet holesone in her stomach three in her backthat were crusted with dried blood and wriggling with maggots amirah lunged forward to bite the man but the marines jerked on the ropes and stopped her when her gray teeth were an inch from the afghanis face amirah snarled and then laughed it was impossible to say whether she was enjoying this game or if she was completely mad as the men struggled to keep her in check they danced and shifted around and i could see that there were two other afghanis in the room they lay sprawled like broken dolls it looked like their faces had been eaten and their throats were tangles of red junk its getting tough to hold this bitch growled one of the men though he was smiling when he said it please in the name of god keep her away begged the bound man he was already bleeding from half a dozen bites thin lines of dark red spiderwebbed out from each bite the infection was slow for some faster for others snot and spit ran from his nose and mouth as he pleaded in three different languages a big man with sergeants stripesthe only one not holding a leashbent down behind the man and spoke with sharp impatience well fucking stop when you fucking tell us what we want to know but i donti dont he was filled with too much panic to complete a sentence the sergeant straightened and nodded and the men slackened their holds on the rope leashes amirah instantly lunged forward and sank her teeth into the flesh of the mans shoulder blood spurted hot and red beside her cheeks and even from where i crouched i could see her eyes roll high and white with an erotic pleasure the mans piercing shrieks filled the whole cave okay pull the bitch off him snapped the sergeant and she fought them her teeth sunk deep into muscle it took all three men to haul her back two pulling and the sergeant pushing he punched amirah in the face and that finally broke the contact but as they dragged her away a piece of sinew was clamped between her jaws and it snapped with a wet pop she licked her lips delicious she said in english drawing the word out tasting the soft wetness of it savoring the way the syllables rolled between teeth and tongue and lips bunny made a soft gagging sound beside me this was what i was afraid of what church had been afraid of during that fight against el mujahid wed encountered several generations of the seif al din pathogen most of the early generations transformed the infected into mindless eating machines the walkers but at the end when id squared off against el mujahid himself hed been among the dead but he still retained his intelligence it was the result of generation of the disease he bragged about how his princessthe name amirah meant princesshad saved him had elevated him to immortality that had to be what we were seeing here amirah had become one of her own monsters was it an accident or part of some twisted plan from the way el mujahid bragged about itright before i gave him a ticket to paradisei had to believe that amirah had chosen this path chosen god almighty fuck this i murmured and stepped into the cave bunny was right beside me i held my in a twohand shooters grip he had his m our nightvision was off but we wore black balaclavas that showed only our eyes united states army i bellowed stand down stand down the sergeant whirled toward me his right hand going for his sidearm i put the laser sight on him stand down or i will kill you he believed me and he froze the other marines froze the man in the chair froze amirah however did not with a snarl of hunger the mad witch twisted so suddenly and violently that she tore the ropes from the hands of the startled marines she tore her hands free from the plastic cuffs she screamed like some desert demon from legend leapt into the air and slammed into the sergeant driving him against the torture victim they crashed to the ground amid shrieks and blood and biting teeth the two marines began to move toward the sergeant but bunny shifted to cover them with his m that left me i stepped in and kicked amirah in the side of the head the blow knocked her off of the sergeant but she had his hand clamped between her jaws and the bound man was screaming and beating his forehead against the side of the sergeants head mashing his ear holy shit bosson your six it was bunny i pivoted in place in time to catch the rush as something came out of the shadows and tackled me it was one of the other afghanis one of the dead afghanis his teeth were bared and spit flew from cracked lips as he lunged for my throat i braced my forearm under his chin as i fell backward and then clenched my abs so that my flat back fall turned into a curled back roll the afghani went into the tumble with me and instead of him pinning me down we ended the roll with me straddling his chest i jammed the barrel of the into his left eyesocket and fired the bullet tore all his wiring loose and he transformed from murderously vicious to sagging dead weight in a microsecond there were shouts all around and i had to shove at the body to get free as i came up i saw that the second afghani had clamped his teeth around the windpipe of one of the marines bunny put six rounds into the afghani the first one knocked him loose from his victim the second punched him in the chest to stall him and the last four grouped like knuckles in a lead fist to strike him above the eyebrows the mans head exploded and his body spun backward in a sloppy pirouette the marine dropped to his knees trying to staunch an arterial spray with fingers that shook with the palsy of sudden understanding his companion crouched over him pressing the wound with his hands but the marine drowned in his own blood in seconds slim was in the cave mouth his weapon sweeping quickly back and forth from target to target not knowing whether to take a shot or not i dove at amirah who had crawled back atop the sergeant for his part the marine was putting up a good fight but it was clear that terror of the woman he had been using as a tool of interrogation was off the scale too much for him to handle he shot me a single despairing glance and i saw the moment when he gave up it must have been one of those instantaneous moments of clarity that can either save you or kill you his interrogation had failed his method of interrogation was indefensible a fact that would never have mattered if we hadnt shown up but we were here and he was caught his world had just crashed and he knew it i locked my arm around amirahs throat and squeezed bulging my bicep on one side to cut off her left carotid and my forearm to cut off her right in jujutsu that puts someone out it didnt do a fucking thing to her she bucked and writhed with more force than i would have thought possible for a woman of her size alive or dead i shoved the hot barrel of the against the back of her head bent close and whispered in her ear speaking in farsi there is no shame to die in the service of allah her muscles locked into sudden rigidity the cave was instantly still even the afghani and the sergeant had stopped screaming i held her tight against my chest and my back was to the cold stone wall she smelled of rotting meat and death but in her dark hair there was the faintest scent of perfume jasmine amirah i said listen to me i whispered six more words your choice princess i said thisor paradise i leaned on the word this from the absolute stillness i knew that she understood what i meant the cave these men all this destruction she knew and even though she had meant to sweep the world with her pathogen the end goalthe transformation via generation of a select portion of islam and the total annihilation of the enemies of her peoplethat was impossible all that was left to her now was to be a monster alone and reviled the moment stretched no one moved then amirah leaned her head toward me an oddly intimate movement she said notthis i whispered yarhamukallâh may god have mercy on you and pulled the trigger battalion aide station now i sat back and studied harper for a long time he said what you going to sit there and tell me that you wouldnt have done the same thing i said nothing look he said i know that was you in the cave what are you delta seals i said nothing you know what were up against out there they want us to stop the taliban stop the flow of opium but our own government supports the brother of the afghan president and he runs half the opium in the frigging country how the hell are we supposed to win that kind of war this is vietnam all over again were losing a war we shouldnt be fighting i said nothing harper leaned forward anger darkening his face he pointed at me with the index finger of his uninjured hand you think abu ghraibs the only place where we had to do whatever it took to get some answers it goes on all over and its always gone on and look where its gotten us i said fuck you and fuck that zero tolerance bullshit we were trying to save lives we would have gotten something out of that man you didnt get shit from the first two now it was his turn to say nothing after a minute he narrowed his eyes when you spoke to thatthatthing that woman at the end you gave her a blessing you a muslim no then why honestly sergeant i dont think i could explain it to you i meani could explain it but i dont think youd understand you think im a monster dont you are you no man he said im just trying to and his voice broke at first it was just a hitch but when he tried to catch it and hide it his resolve broke and he put his face in his unbandaged hand and sobbed i sat back in my chair and watched i looked at him the bandages on his other hand were stained with blood that was almost black red lines ran in a crooked tracery from beneath the bandage and up his arms i could see the same dark lines beginning to creep up from his collar it was fortyeight hours since hed been brought to the aid station fiftynine since amirah had bitten him strong son of a bitch most people would have turned by now whats going to happen to me he asked raising a tearstreaked face nothing its already happened he licked his dry lips wewe didnt know yes you did your squad was briefed maybe it was all a little unreal to you sergeant horror movie stuff but you knew just as you know how this ends i stood and drew my sidearm and racked the slide the sound was enormous in that little room theyre going to want to study you i said they can do that with you on a slab or in a cage they cant he said anger flaring inside his pain im an american god damn it no i said sergeant andy harper died while on a mission in afghanistan the report will reflect that he died while serving his country and maintaining the best traditions of the us marine corps harper looked at me the truth registering in his eyes so i ask you i said raising the pistol thisor paradise iim sorry he said maybe at that moment he really was deathbed epiphanies arent worth the breath that carries them not to me not anymore i know i lied i did it for us man i did it to help yeah i said me too and raised the gun and the next and the next by genevieve valentine genevieve valentines first novel mechanique a tale of the circus tresaulti is forthcoming from prime books in her short fiction has appeared in the anthology running with the pack and in the magazines strange horizons futurismic clarkesworld journal of mythic arts fantasy magazine escape pod and more her work can also be found in my anthology federations and in my online magazine lightspeed in addition to writing fiction valentine is a columnist for torcom and fantasy magazine in dawn of the dead george romeros followup to his classic genredefining night of the living dead we see hordes of zombies converge upon a shopping mall bust through the doors and proceed to shamble aimlessly up and down its halls we are told that they remember what was important to them in life and are moved to reenact their routines in death and so we are moved to reflect that these mindless dead are not so very different from our own consumerist neighbors who also seem to converge on the mall and wander its tacky displays for no better reason than a kind of grim atavistic inertia and lack of conscious thought as terrifying as it is to imagine being bitten by a zombie and transformed into a mindless shell of your former self even more terrifying is the idea of having to pretend to be one of them to enact a meaningless ritualized existence while fully conscious and never giving away that you are actually wide awake many stories have played with this theme from its humorous treatment in shaun of the dead to its more serious treatment in the film invasion to its positively grueling treatment in adamtroy castros dead like me which appeared in the first the living dead anthology maybe you feel like youre surrounded by mindless drones and that you have to pretend to be something youre not just to fit in if so the scenario presented in our next tale may feel eerily familiar you know them by their milky eyes but theyre easy to fool if you survive the first crush of them and can master the art of walking slowly and staring straight ahead none of them in the packed train car will even look at you once you get their interest its over someone in the car behind you tries to run for it near prospect avenue and gets swarmed if you glance over it will look like a glass box stuffed with maggots do not glance over you must look straight ahead you will do better to ignore the smell of rotting apples thats seeping into the train car from all their open mouths hanging limp you need to get to open wateryoure trying to get to coney island to get someplace where they havent devoured everything youre already too late as you hit new utrecht two men run into the train car theyre holding baseball bats looking over their shoulders smug and relieved to have escaped every head turns every milky eye in the train car fixes suddenly on them and the slack mouths pull up into a hundred rictus grins the men turn and bolt one of them gets caught in the closing doors and as the train pulls away from the station his arm drops out of sight and something tears that man is lucky the other man is trapped in the train car with them with you he gets two or three good swings in before they swarm him and after a few seconds his screaming gets eaten up by a single sucking wet sound that you dont want to think about you must look straight ahead all along the openair platforms they gather headed south pressing themselves into the cars whenever the doors ding open they step on in twos and threes pulling children or parts of children patiently grasping the little hands carrying the little arms that lead to empty shoulders they line the tracks all the way south five deep then eight then ten waiting for the train to stop so they can get on theyre not fast it turns out but theyre patient and there are more of them every minute the boardwalk is packed shouldertoshoulder all of them moving slowly and without direction shambling onto the beach and back again some of them the ones with dents in their skulls walk in small circles with their heads cocked like birds you are too late any hope of finding others is gone you walk slowly alongside all the others out of the train and down the concrete path and up the ramp to the wooden walk there is nothing else now that you can do at first its hard to see much through the boardwalk crowd but there is enough movement for you to slip forward by degrees your goal is brighton beach anything where you can duck into a side street get out of the sun but when you reach the fencing you stop alongside the others and stare into astroland the grown ones have all brought their children hundreds of them waiting patiently in lines that snake back and forth beside the little rollercoaster shaped like a dragon the little flying boats shaped like whales the carousel the adults trudge up to the ride in pairs and deposit a child into an empty seat one child at a time until the ride is full then the switch is thrown the park employees must not have been fast enough to get out they pull their levers with the same clockwork motions youve always seen the little children with their milky eyes turn slowly with the enginewheel rising up and down every once in a while one of them utters a sound through its slack mouth bleating and wordless as a calf from time to time the ride stops and they march up and lift a childany childout of the seat and wander to the next event the carousel is crowded the adults forget to leave and they sway unsteadily as the horses lurch into motion over at the rollercoaster a child has come back without a head a pair of parents picks the body up by the shoulders carries it away you must not run when the crowd moves forward it dissolves into the park little wandering circuits now you can break away you think if you can get past the wonder wheel and back onto the street there has to be some apartment left empty where you can take refuge you walk carefully past the whales and the roller coaster down the maw of the wonder wheel the metal corrals are full but the crowd is so quiet that you can hear the creaking carriages as the wheel stops and the doors open and the line moves forward all at once like a worm surging over the grass the girl operating the wheel has green eyes bright and clear and youre so surprised that you stop in your tracks you startle her bad sign the last thing you need is to draw their notice and when she looks at you she sucks in a breath like shes about to call out to you but remembers herself and flips the switch instead as the wheel lurches into motion a chorus of halfhearted groans floats down from the cars you wait in line snaking closer and when youre at the center of the line and the car swings into place you step aside and let the ones behind you haul themselves into the carriage their slack jaws swinging back and forth as the wheel carries them away how many of us are left she asks under her breath her legs are trembling you wonder how long shes been trapped here pulling the lever back and forth its taken you since yesterday to get this far has she been trapped here all that time i dont know how many you say its a mercy not to tell her the truth about what the city looks like now what good would it do her to know that its too late help me she says her eyes are bright and fixed on you and the panic is starting to set in you know what shes feeling you had this same desperate hope just for a moment when the two men ran into the train car you almost stood up once you get their attention its all over you cant help her they would notice if the wheel didnt stop im sorry you say and walk slowly between the cars threading your way into the departing riders and out the wheel on the other side no she says softly and then louder more shrilly help me you have to help me fuck you come back but by then theyve noticed her you sit in the nearest photo booth safe behind the flimsy curtain until all the sounds have stopped you sit there for a long time looking down at the edge of the curtain watching them pass slowly back and forth you dont know where you can go you cant swim very far youll need a boat you think you cant drive a boat you can barely swim you sit in the booth a long time you do not admit you are stranded how can you outside the booth through the little spaces between the bumper cars you can see that the streets are crawling with them theres no escape there you have to keep going the way that you came in the arcade three children are playing basketball the balls fly away from the tips of their fingers in a waltz beat onetwothree and they scoop up the next without looking their blind white eyes never move from the basket amid the sound of the bumper cars you walk out up the ramp under a banner printed in bright block letters denos wonder wheel open this year and the next and the next and the next and the next at the top of the ramp you risk a look behind you the girl is still standing at the wonder wheel now shes milkyeyed one hand on the lever the other hanging slack at her side the top of her head has been opened like a softboiled egg you turn away too fast you have to steady yourself before you keep walking out and up to the boardwalk dont glance over you must look straight ahead on the boardwalk the adults are absently feeding the children their little mouths mechanically chewing it looks like funnel cake but you know better by now what they eat and you dont investigate the sun is blazing the whole place is starting to smell like a fish market out on the beach its easier to walk the way you should the sand sucks at your feet forces you to be slow and careful some of them are walking out into the water they walk straight out until the waters too deep to stand in and when the current takes them they give in float with arms and legs loose you remember suddenly the summer you were ten years old and the kid a few doors down from you drowned in the pool in his backyard for the rest of the summer none of the neighborhood kids were allowed to go out of sight of their parents which ruined everything your friends had planned all year they moaned all summer about how boring it was to have to stay so close to the house you agreed you were tired all that summer because whenever you closed your eyes at night you imagined that kid in the moment before he fell into the water when he had just begun to lean forward when it wasnt too late for someone to pull him back and save him you walk towards the surf picking your way over the ones on the beach where they have laid out flat in the sand white eyes turned to the sun theres the rancid smell of eggs gone bad you wonder how long you can last this way sneaking amongst them will you have to go back on the train make it through the city head south on the highway walking one mile an hour how far will you have to go before you reach someplace where this hasnt happened you will never find that place there are more of them every minute by now theres a web of them across the water floating akimbo in some places theyre locked together tight as puzzle pieces if you were brave enough you could walk across them behind you someone has figured out how to start the cyclone theres the crank of cars on the way up the rails a collective offkey moan as they plummet on the stretch of boardwalk behind you some of them turn to look at the sound lose interest when they recognize what it is they seem sad to see that its nothing exciting its strange to watch them looking disappointed you dont know what will happen to them when there are no real people left you have already given up hope they will win they are patient when you step into the ocean the water is already cool on your ankles by nightfall it will be cold you dont know how far you can swim in cold water not far enough you take another step the water soaks into your shoes your pants the next step is more difficult than the last one behind you they are coming sloshing dutifully into the water the way they remember doing they will not make way for you to turn around you cannot go back now you think about the moment before the child falls into the pool you must look straight ahead the price of a slice by john skipp cody goodfellow if george romero is the father of zombie cinema then surely john skipp is the father of zombie literature he along with craig spector edited the first alloriginal zombie fiction anthologies in the s book of the dead and still dead then more recently and on his own mondo zombie and zombies encounters with the hungry dead he is also the author of several novels such as the splatterpunk ecocidal classic the bridge cowritten by craig spector and the emerald burrito of oz with marc levinthal cody goodfellows novel perfect union was published earlier this year and his short fiction has appeared in bare bone black static shivers v and dark passions skipp and goodfellows collaborative novel fruiting body publishes in december if youve read the first the living dead anthology you may remember a searing science fiction tale called meathouse man one in a series of stories by george r r martin that concern remotecontrolled zombies being used as slave labor our next tale brings the same concept to a decaying nearfuture san francisco and concerns not only zombie laborers but also soldiers in our own present war by remote control is becoming increasingly commonplace as detailed in p w singers recent nonfiction book wired for war which delves into some of the issues surrounding soldiers who pilot predator drones into combat in iraq or afghanistan from the safety of a cubicle in colorado or nevada the book describes the unease felt by many elite pilots whose training has cost upward of a million dollars as they watch missions similar to their own being flown by teenagers sitting at computer monitors one drone pilot describes the physical qualifications needed for his job as not being able to do a hundred pushups but rather having a big butt and a strong bladderliterally being able to sit at the controls for an extended period of time war is changing before our eyes though as this next story reminds us the more things change the more they stay the same workers and soldiers may be replaced by remotecontrolled zombie slaves but somebodys still got to deliver the pizza i excerpted from why we stood the new utopia by jerrod unger iii a city is to a planet what a person is to a city one out of many a star shining in a firmament filled with constellations with some shining a little bit brighter more beautiful or otherwise luckier than the rest by any standard san francisco was one of the luckiest and the most beloved to those who called her home san francisco was the citythe quintessential the only real city she was a survivor of booms and busts earthquakes and plagues in the face of every disaster she always found a new way to thrive and came back smarter grander and richer than ever before few others could claim the same when the dead rose up most of the worlds cities died just like their people winking out then blindly rising to attack their neighbors like very few othersand tokyo came closestsan francisco kept the lights on throughout the crisis and shone a beacon to the world the new san francisco would not just be the last city on earth she would be the greatest we never set out to merely rebuild the old order we used the breakdown to sweep away old mistakes and make the kind of world we always knew we should have and while the rest of the world sank deeper into chaos we toiled and dreamed and dared to grow our city for three hard uncertain years untilas viewed from spaceshe was clearly the brightest light yet emanating from our godforsaken planet and the only real living city left on earth history is full of tough rotten choices and unfair judgments and few will be more unfair than the condemnation of what we made by those who failed even to keep the lights on in their own homes ii am down at candlestick park twenty miles outside the green zone the predawn gloom gave way to icy castles of toxic fog the bargain of kali yuga his master had called it once again proving his divine prescience everywhere upon the earth darkness had won but here there was still hope this house is surrounded by light ajay watley was on guard duty on top of the east pedestrian ramp of the longdead athletic stadium holding down the sacred perimeter below him the parking lot was a tenacre graveyard of gutted cars and scattered bones he scanned with amped thermal imaging goggles he had a sixtycaliber squad automatic weapon a walkietalkie and an old ipod blasting his alertness mantra this house is surrounded by light ajay had been a devotee of bhagwan ganguly for four years before the masters prophecies came true and he had never had reason to doubt all of the masters visions had come to pass even the date and hour of his death but since then his commands had become erratic and tended to change depending on who transcribed them when he said to move the ashram to the city ajay almost risked his karma by raising doubt the dead had indeed been swept out of san francisco but their worst enemies here were not the dead no birds called and no fish swam as the higgins boat sailed out of the fog and into the lagoon behind the stadium in this place where hopeless giants fans in kayaks used to paddle around waiting for barry bonds home runs the vintage military shiptoshore vessel ran aground like a sea lion unnoticed the ramp dropped and slammed the mud and the oakland raiders came stomping out onto land a flurry of movement in the parking lot depths caught ajays sleepdeprived eye nobodyd spotted a deadhead in weeks and the ones still walking around were nothing to waste ammo on cranking up the volume on the masters chanting voice ajay cracked his knuckles and waited for whatever it was to come into range i am surrounded by light he murmured drawing a bead with the big sixty caliber just as the hot wind brushed him back a drone helicopter no bigger than a toy hovered before him its miniature fuselage pointed a camera lens a parabolic mic and a shotgun barrel at his face he blinked tried to hoist the heavy gun off its bipod the shotgun blew off the left half of his scalp ajay yelped and squirted dropping his machinegun over the railing wake up he screamed into his walkietalkie bellycrawling down the ramp to the guardhouse wiping blood out of his eyes a hollow unfamiliar robotic voice hissed back from the handset all your base are belong to us the raiders doubletimed it to the gatehouse under scattered wild fire from above they wore sfpd tactical body armor draped with silver duct tape raiders jerseys and dented football helmets the first one through the turnstile set off a homemade claymore filled with bathtub napalm it set him alight but did not stop him sheathed in flames he stalked through the atrium yard raking the guardhouse with a beltfed automatic shotgun as flares bricks and small arms fire rained down one crazy devotee jumped from cover and charged but his m jammed the burning raider cornered and hugged him as its ammo cooked off aerial recon had the ashrams sixtyfour devotees holed up in the press boxes moving as a hedgehog the raiders crossed the courtyard and tossed grenades into the spiral pedestrian ramp they never spoke or cried out when they got shot they spent their bodies as cheaply as their bullets a gang of wildeyed devotees dressed in dhotis or long underwear charged down the ramp brandishing machine pistols and howling the masters name another drone chopper swooped into the open well around which the spiral ramp wound a toy with twin fléchette cannons in its nose they sounded like tambourines shaking but they reduced the defenders to a blizzard of red confetti before they could get off a single shot the only effective resistance the raiders faced was the sluice of gore they slipped in as they climbed the ramp on the press level ajay ran past a barricaded snack bar with two machine guns get down sister sharon bellowed from inside move your skinny ass ajay and opened fire she cut the first raider in half blew his torso clean off his hips but still couldnt stop him he dragged himself up to the snack counter while his teammates laid down withering cover fire ajay prayed for a weapon he prayed for the courage to do something the mangled upper half of the raider crawled right past him he saw a gray human face behind the facemask but telescoping goggles covered its eyes it had no lower jaw earbuds in its helmet screamed loud enough for ajay to hear the raiders tinny mantra get some get some get some take that nest you little bitch the raider tossed two grenades in through the gun slits they bounced off the menu board and detonated in sharons lap ajay ran without looking back until hed hopped the barricades and found them unmanned he picked up an mp off the sandbags but before he could find the safety the corridor was engulfed in flames the raiders swept into the luxury skyboxes where the masters favorites were kept their guards resisted with pistols that didnt dent the raiders body armor room to room they stalked giving out headshots or grenades ajay shot one of them in the back without even getting its attention he almost threw himself upon them with his fists but he knew it would be suicide and the master forbade martyrdom it would be easier to die than see the end of everything they had built of everyone he loved ajay went to the window in the owners box and looked out on the field together theyd bulldozed the wreckage of a relief center into the cheap seats to make room for a massive tented victory garden and a parking lot to mirror the one outside hundreds of jaguars rolls royces and bentleys filled the infield before the eye of kali yuga opened on the world the media had mocked master gangulys weakness for british luxury cars but the fleet had brought them all here from the ashram in big sur quickly and in fine style he could get the keys to one of the range rovers they kept in the underground vip parking he could get away and live with a cowards karma but he heard his brothers and sisters chanting in the big room if this was truly their karma they would gather at the masters feet to meet it ajay ran into the banquet hall with his hands on his bleeding head there were at least three dozen of them and even the women and kids were armed and shooting at the double doorway entrance the master sat at the wheel of his favorite silver ghost rolls on a dais in the center of the room he gunned the engine and honked the rolls regal horn the inner circle of devotees locked arms around the car a hulking raider linebacker stepped into the room and got its face shot off inside its hollowedout torso was a veritable whitmans sampler of grenades rpgs and a tow missile even as the hail of lead chewed its helmet and head off the linebacker fell to its knees and unleashed a holocaust the windows and walls blew out of the banquet hall the secondary explosions brought the upper tier bleachers down on the banquet hall but when the smoke cleared four raiders were still standing game over bitches said ajays walkietalkie he threw it away and ran for the vip staircase the corridor was choked with burning bodies but nobody stopped him as he barged through the door and ran down the stairwell he got four steps before he crashed into a raiders back and hit the stairs on his tailbone his legs went numb death machine said the name above the number on its shredded jersey it turned and looked down at him cocking its head and popping its goggles ajays skin crawled as he felt someone intelligent looking at him someone who was probably miles away i am surrounded by light ajay prayed this house is surrounded by light i am the zombie in the raiders helmet stopped over him and put a gloved hand on his shoulder gave his arm a gentle little squeeze im sorry dude but my pizzas here it said the gentle hand shoved the nozzle of a flamethrower in his mouth and pumped a jet of highoctane gasoline down his throat vaya con huevos gandhi said death machine the jet of gas ignited and ajay was surrounded by light iii the dungeon master peeled off his vr goggles and shucked his data gloves checked his pulse rate breathe barbarian breathe holy shit that was brutal he shivered with a bowelclenching adrenaline chill despite the suffocating kiln atmosphere of his server bunker his muscles tensed and twitched like the dregs of an amyl nitrate rush still juiced from something that happened to somebody elses body hed sweated right through his silk dethklok pajamas it felt like someone had dumped a cooler of gatorade on him from somewhere up above sherman laliotitis blinked out of his mystic warrior trance and buzzed in the delivery boy put his hands behind his head and stretched in his ergonomic office chair his catheter jabbed his semitumescent wang as he emptied his bladder the tube snaked out of his pj bottoms to join the spaghetti of cables on the floor to the reclamation tub in the closet christ he thought life during wartime the door thudded shut behind him so uh seagull how much for the pie his headset

doomsday cult from big sur moved in after we cleansed the city and started poaching our supply lines snatching our immigrants we warned them but they fed our messenger to their dear leader thats him

already gone iv jeez thought eagle what a douche nice tip though thirtyeight creds that was the thing about rich motherfuckers they thought they could pay off their contempt with pocket change and they were right they also all liked pizza eagles bike was parked outside the penthouse door it was a chrome green moots gristlea mountain bikethe one he chose out of thousands when they gave him a heros parade and his old job back talk about perks he took a moment to savor the view from the uppermost inner balcony of the hyatt regency gorgeous tiered ultramodern architecture sloping down to reveal luxury rooms all occupied thanks to him and his friends his own was and he could see it from here hey ma he thought and waved but she was dead and that wasnt funny eagle rode to the elevator bank hopped the glass diving bell down to the lobby sheets of illuminated crystal dangled overhead an indoor aurora borealis that looked awesome when stoned which he was waving bye to his friends and neighbors as he hit the domed streets of new san francisco everybody knew eagle that was the great thing beneath the sheer poisonandshatterproof plastic that encased the twentyblock bubble of the green zone roughly still moved and breathed and he saw them all each and every night as he made his rounds through the former financial district spreading joy with wholewheat crust fresh tomatoes and veggies prewar sausage and pepperoni half the open spaces in the green zone were vertical farms now hydroponically providing for the needs of the city and thank god they understood that quality weed was every bit as fundamental as rice and beans in this new economy eagle wheeled around the embarcadero past tribal art galleries and acid jazz bars where thirdshifters decompressed downed shots of sketchy bathtub liquor and hoped for the best outside the bubble the world was still dead and you could still see it if you wanted to look the black ash fields that used to be parks the ferry terminal mausoleum the south side of market street where the lights were still off all just a window away but just a stones throw from the edgeone block from the transamerica pyramid on the corner of front and claywas pizza orgasmica the only surviving hour gourmet pizza emporium couple of outcalls if you want em said bud as he entered for refills one code red and one from somewhere out in the black i told him fuck no but the guy said he knows you really eagle said grinning sometimes it was fun to go outside v death machine stood at attention in the outer courtyard of the defeated enemy objective he had orders not to move followed orders sweep and clear hold and defend seek and destroy had survived eighteen engagements because he hardly needed the voices in his ear to do what he had to do he could follow orders almost before they were given his armorers and handlers were sure he was a professional athlete or a vet probably a marine tully forbes the machinist who rigged the steel beartrap replacement for his missing mandible swore that once when he shouted gimme ten assumed the position and did pushups until tully made him stop with a sleep spike but that wasnt true could count to ten and sometimes even higher when his medpak was working overtime over and over he tried to count the bodies laid out in front of him after ten things got foggy but he didnt have to use his fingers if he used his fingers hed only be able to count up to seven the bodies were covered in sheets the cleanup crew dropped colorcoded tags on them green red or black hardly any green ones the sheets over them were only spotted with blood lots of red and black the red ones were a mess but the black ones were yard sales of loose and charred body parts a couple of men and a woman walked down the line they wore white pressurized biohazard suits but smelled the bracing stink of their breath and sweat venting out of their gas masks even as his medpak kicked down a bolus of tryptophan to make him drowsy he ached to have them the woman was different she smelled dead but she walked and talked and the others listened to her angry orders the deadsmelling lady came over to review the surviving raiders offensive line her skin was a dull graygreen behind her mask shot through with black capillaries he could ignore the itching hunger aroused by her assistants but her rank aroma screamed at to shoot burn and behead her sweep and clear but the order never came as she inspected them she snapped over her shoulder who runs these fucking rodeo clowns a flunky checked his pda a civilian contractor sherman laliotitis he was a professional gamer prewar the best in the world at squadbased combat simulations reliable hes a sociopathic little prick maam but hed do the work for free loves his toys get him on the phone if he still cant deliver viable candidates then hes either incompetent or hes a saboteur she stopped and looked into the eyes of her eyes were the color of bile she never blinked check the headset on this one we did maam it sustained no cranial damage during the engagement check it again and double its downers theyre supposed to be in a coma and this ones looking at me a flunky unscrewed the bolts on s helmet with a drill while the other tugged it off several shots had cracked the highimpact plastic helmet but the kevlar liner had stopped them from damaging the electrical wiring and neurotransmitter pumps screwed into the dome of his skull he wanted to stop them and gut her but he had orders not to move followed orders vi on the dead side of market the berkeley social science geniuses were building museum dioramas in the old storefronts recreating the bustling life of the old city celebrating its heroesboth the surviving and the fallenin frozen pantomimes of earnestly rosy history you couldnt see it at night but theyd actually sculpted a plaster statue of eagle and put him on a bikenext to lester the professor in his wheelchair and crazyeyed emperor norton ii his courageous freak comrades in that first desperate year of rescues and food runs before big brother came back to take over the job a plaque at their feet said they kept the embarcadero lights burning and kept the city alive theyd posed for it together three unlikely loners who had just tried to stay alive and protect their neighbors when nobody else could it was hella fucking surreal hilarious and also an incredible honor but under the selfdeprecation and pride was a creeping sense of having already died their purpose fulfilled their glory days noted memorialized and gone like the boy in the hundredyearold statue behind him on the domedin corner of montgomery and market at which eagle paused finishing his joint before rolling out into the toxins it was a monument erected in or at least that was the date of the quote on the base it showed a handsome young fellow in miners togs with a pickaxe in one hand a flag in the other standing tall against all comers the inscription read the unity of our empire hangs on the decision of this day w h seward on the admission of california vs senate and now san francisco was a sovereign nation pffffftthanks america eagle said its been fun and then coughed up a plume of master kush and kilimanjaro the market street south airlock was four lanes wide and a city block long which included the sealedoff bart station just past montgomery he snuffed the roach and swallowed it on his way through the door no waste in this city no littering either eagles locker was near the back and the showers with the rest of the regulars he suited up put on his goggles and gas mask checked the hazmat seals on the pizza cozy one more time then he rode out through the gate and into the red zone the new city reclaimed the corpse of the old a block at a time clearing the wreckage off the streets purging the buildings of any lingering human wreckagedead or alivewas only the first step they were also repairing infrastructure and cleaning up the chemical residue from the bombs that had leveled the playing fieldor at least cleared it eagle had watched from his bolthole in the hyatt when the navy choppers flew over the city that day he watched the chemical bombs descend on what they all unofficially called black flag day he couldnt tell what kind of bug spray they dropped this time but the thousands of loitering dead that filled the streets didnt respond to the powdery gray clouds like all the other times getting all tweaked and fidgety or eating themselves but still standing this time they just melted like the wicked witch of the west an army reduced to runny rancid meat that pooled in their shoes and overflowed the gutters around their fizzing blackened bones then all was still and death was dead nearly a million zombies dispatched in an hour and a half along with every plant animal insect or human being that wasnt safely under glass black stains like hiroshima victims silhouettes etched deep into the pavement wherever they dropped static shadows of what once was ghosts of an explosion still lethal two years later eagle rolled over them coasting the cleared stretch of market where the work crews were now opening up the frontier a few other cyclists passed eagle as he hopped the curb and crossed the plaza with its defunct fountain and dead ginkgo groves they wore elaborate hopi sacred clown gas masks and shouted his name as they passed the big red city truck was parked at the edge of civic center plaza with a string of worker trailers behind it the crews worked in a long line scrubbing the buckled marble flagstones and shoveling concrete debris into a sinkhole that had gobbled up half of grove street the workers wore orange convict jumpsuits and skidlid motorcycle helmets they played sandblasters over the marble to scour away the black scabs where the dead had melted a cancerous seagull from somewhere far away wheeled down and perched on the head of one of the workers pecked at its runny gray eyes eagle saw a few other encouraging signssickly yellow weeds pushed through the cracks in the sidewalk cockroaches ran in the gutterbut the domed palace of the civic center still looked like an ancient ruin he remembered the day hed delivered twelve pizzas to a wedding feast on the steps the last weekend gay marriages were legal in the city all of them now as dead as the romans the airlock on the back of the truck hissed and irised open as eagle parked his bike and hefted the thermal pouch with their order in it eagle stepped in and closed his eyes to the spray and blowoff he kept his mask on until the inner airlock popped the lucky pizza pies were way better protected than eagle a pipinghot message of love in a hermetic polystyrene metaphorical bottle they would stay warm yet crispy for at least twentyfour hours or until someone opened their boxes some navy jerk on treasure island had bitched about the soggy cardboard when eagle shipped a batch of deep dish pies out there but the next day he shipped a batch of these space age containers the submariners designed for keeping food hot without noisy microwaves another breakthrough for the evolving world hey eagle ernie cheered you remember that pizza place escape from new york over on van ness ada says they gave you free pie if you could order in italian is she full of shit or what eagle peeled off his mask but he was in no hurry to jump into the argument or breathe the air in there ernie nardello and ada glaublich worked red zone cleanup so they practically lived in the truck somebody mustve pissed in their air recirculator hazmat suits masks dirty longjohns and more than a few of eagles special pizza boxes lay ankledeep on the floor i dunno ernie i never delivered for them popping the seal on the pouch made the truck warmer by five degrees garlic and oregano overpowered the trucks manifold stinks even ada made a noise and eagle had never heard her say a word at least not to the living born adam glaublich the shy civil engineer was on top of the list for sex change surgery when the dead fucked up everything ada was a stone bummer but ernie loved her and talked more than enough for both of them ernie cracked the top box and nearly fainted aw shit i thought you said there was no more pineapple we got a couple more cans out of the holiday inn so i saved em for you dude i could blow you right now eagle held out his wrist i love you too but hows about you just pay me instead laughing ernie scanned him with a light pen they dont pay you enough to come out here man no thats your job he looked at the screens the flys compound eye view of the civic center the sinkhole his bicycle working hard ada munched a slice while she monitored their crews youre cold she purred warm up and work shovel faster she jogged ernies elbow and pointed at a blinking indicator but ernie ignored her this is bullshit busy work man ernie said the navy says the shit got washed out and neutralized eighteen months ago thats why the fuckin bay is dead right theres never gonna be enough live people in this city for them to open the green zone this far i beg to differ dude eagle said wiping the steam out of his goggles therere still people out there its our town youre cleaning it up so the people will come back were just polishing rocks for a lifesized museum but thanks theyll have meat puppets good enough to do our jobs by then hey if anybody shows up at the gates who can turn my partners hot dog into a taco let me know okay then ill be at peace with the world ada punched his shoulder s acting up seagull ate his eyes so shut him down ernie growled im not suiting up now im eating lunch you going back to the bubble not right away eagle picked the old boxes out of the mess on the floor got another delivery out here where haight and stanyan eagle strapped on his mask in the airlock ernies eyeballs bounced off his hud goggles as he dropped the first seal say what its a long story i gotta go guys take care eagle popped the outer airlock and jumped down the zombie was waiting for him stenciled on its helmet seagull shit and a sparking wire in its empty eyesockets it dropped its shovel and lurched at eagle who threw the empty pizza boxes in its face and instinctively backed into the gate of the truck groping in vain for a weapon worth having he hated guns but he always carried one a copissue glock mm with soft hollowpoint rounds hung in its holster on his bike next to his canteen about ten unreachable feet away ernie call off your fucking dog ernies voice popped his headset what oh holy shit ada make it stop eagle shrieked as pawed his gas mask with one workgloved hand up close the employed deadthe slave deadglistened hitech glad wrap vacuumsealed their skin locked the sickness in and the freshness out it was the only way to slow their inevitable decay and make them humanly tolerable under the industrial worklights glowed like a leftover angel but underneath the shrinkwrap was the same old hunger its humanity was just a mask up close eagle recognized that mask had a kirk douglas chin a bruce campbell chin a chin among chins with a nose to match that redheaded guy who used to barback at the albion shorttempered the regulars called him fireplug i used to deliver pizzas to this guy he thought ernie and ada were both hollering in his headset but eagle couldnt hear it he was lost in the moment pushing at both hands on its chest boxed in tight with no exit room watching it stagger back lurch in moaning ada pop just do it we got you eagle duck and cover brother eagle dropped to his knees the charges in the rogue workers head went off like firecrackers in a watermelon wetware jumping out the top of its skull and spraying all over the fucking place eagle you okay jesus man im so sorry wobbled and dropped eagle checked himself wiped a few black specks off his parka willed his heart to slow down yeah im good fucking freaked but good okay were okay were okay just yeah just yeah dont worry about it you sure not gonna say a fucking thing all right were good thank you man ernie exhaled and chugged antacid stay safe buddy we got your back eagle scooped up and stowed the pizza boxes pocketed his gun and hopped on his bike as two more remotecontrolled workers swept in to scrape up the mess working together making the world a better place vii the dungeon master had just burnt his tongue on the microwaved ricotta in his calzoneat least a threehitpoint woundwhen the love line rang he washed the glutinous lava down with a splash of root beer checked his hair and let the phone ring for allegedly living humans the science division sure seemed to enjoy chewing on human asses when they couldnt bitch about his kill ratio they whined that his tactics were overkill when his meat puppets werent lagging and bugging out like an nt server they were dangerous rabid dogs the love line blinked faster his pager trembled and jittered off the edge of the desk into an empty pizza box he wondered which of the brain trust would be dining on his haunches today of the threeheaded nerd colossus that ran new san francisco he got the least friction from the livermore geeks nasty little cryptofascist elves but they made the best toys and bitched the least about his tactics his tongue throbbed and told him everything tasted like sandpaper perfect he might as well throw the rest of the calzone back in the fridge well he thought killing his root beer and reaching for another somebody in the world probably has even worse problems he hit the accept button fuck my eyes he thought poison lady sherman sat up in his chair and brushed his oily hair back out of his eyes dr childers youre looking lovely today meredith childers graygreen face tightened on the monitor she wasnt just the chief researcher on the citys medical research brain trust she was also their star guinea pig it was easy to see why the other scientists called her the hippie sherman laliotitis is it round these parts they call me the dun this is not a game sherman you were briefed by your superior about todays primary objective to secure the borders of fortress frisco against hostile invaders maam and phase one was a big win dont fuck around with me you know what were doing here what needs doing sherman looked around the control room the raiders pov monitors showed the cleanup crews carting off the last of the bodies i uh i am sorry if youre unhappy with my performance but you know capping enemies in the heat of battle isnt like cutting the heads off guinea pigs in the lab ill bet the cultists wouldve done it he thought you couldve paid them in lentils and bentleys the order had come down last night to target all the squatters on the peninsula in a oneday blitz using all meatpuppet crews every squad operator was on duty today or tonight the machinists pulled doubleshifts refitting assault teams and converting rundown workers into walking bombs all the targets were armed most were subhuman freaks but none of them was an imminent threat to the city most of the green zone was still halfempty but they were expanding it again and the whitecoats always needed more cold bodies to play with im just he finally said trying to do my job maam if youre as good as advertised you should be able to control your team do you verbally monitor all of them at once thatd be impossible im all over them in realtime for the real precise wetwork but theyre all running a bunch of apps most of which i wrote myself youve changed their programming for today though correct well sure no more headshots you will be docked for each nonviable body docked sherman sputtered how much how much is a human life worth on the current market harden the fuck up and do your job sherman yes maam youll have no excuses for me next time no maam youre not the only warm body in san francisco whos good at videogames mr laliotitis but if youre not the best in town from here on outor if i hear of any more leaks in your operationthe machinists will help us discover a whole new world of uses for you am i clear um yes maam voice choked his catheter popped out cold piss streamed down his leg the line went dead motherfucker sherman got an aluminum baseball bat and strode out into the hall away from the mainframe made from chained pss and the banks of refrigerated processors running every zombie in the city his eyes alit on the vending machine in the hall but it was the only one in the whole building that worked a janitor pushed a floor waxer in loopy circles in front of the elevators he didnt flinch or look up as sherman ran up on him and smashed his face in the janitor wore a cheap motorcycle helmet with an enormous smiley face sticker on the visor it took four whacks to crack the helmet but another twenty to kill the fucking thing it never raised a hand to block the blows with its nylon idiot mittens just kept stumbling back and back as he pummeled it again and again driving it into the wall and making doorknobs rattle halfway down the hall by the time the shrinkwrap snapped and the septic contents exploded outward he could barely swing the bat his lungs vaporlocked knees went wobbly but he couldnt stop until the medpak in its skull cracked open sprayed a little drugstore everywhere and it finally spasmed and keeled over sherman fell down hard on his hands and knees next to the bloodless corpse blowing goat cheese in the beyondseptic waft streaming snot and tears the door behind him clicked and hissed open wiping his eyes sherman saw a very old very drunk man in a plush bathrobe hanging on the doorknob as he scowled at the mess was ist passiert ist alles in ordnung why was everything in the real world so fucking hard viii the black zone party was down by golden gate park at the end of haight less than ten minutes out of the red zone as the eagle flies a universe of difference by any other standard but every so often pizza orgasmica would get an urgent call from one of the outlaws who had managed not to melt in the posthuman hinterlands or had snuck back into town after black flag day there were enclaves dug in all over the city more than anyone knew and they loved pizza too these streets were not clear so eagle ducked and dodged between the cars glad the moots was good on rugged terrain and thinking about how sweet it was to be seeing some longlost friends if you were a bunch of college dropouts living in an empty metropolis you would probably think it was the best idea in the world to hole up in the haightashbury amoeba records the front windows were boarded up but a guy waiting on the roof with an m shouted pizza man and buzzed the front door for him eagle rode into the open floor of the record store it was an impressive setup anywhere else it might have even had a chance the front counters were fortified with thick plexiglass from a bank a portcullis made of wroughtiron spikes was hoisted up to let eagle in then dropped behind him the ground floor of the record store was still a mess but someone had been restocking the cds along the far wall a bunch of young guys and a couple girls sat on stationary bikes wired to car batteries pedaling and watching cartoons as they kept the lights on and powered the big club soundsystem on a dais in the center of the store where a pale guy with black dreads and a droopy mustache spun a deepdish dubstep mix he saluted eagle as the pizza guy parked and popped the hotbox on the back of his bike hey tweak you got any real music tweak flipped him off and tapped the sign on the decks no grateful deadplease dont ask the second floor was a loft where the dvds were stored the new occupants had replaced the old staircase with a cantilevered drawbridge a couple semiferal kids came hopping down the stairs to meet him chanting pizza pizza black circles under their eyes bleeding gums the adults looked worse eagle dropped the stack of pies on the table and immediately wished hed brought more fourteen hungry people converged on the boxes making noises like ernies broken worker dude thanks for coming out lester wiley rolled over and pumped his hand youre a lifesaver i dont have one of those pen things eagle sat on a milk crate next to lesters wheelchair and passed him a fat joint no sweat you got the sly stone and hendrix catalogs on vinyl if the kids havent burned em little philistines melted most of the classic rock to make into swords and throwing stars and shit lesters eyes glistened as he watched his people eat really thanks for coming out man its just a couple pizzas les howre you guys living out here lester lit up and took a stupendous hit its not easy but when was it ever at least the traffics gone havent seen you in ages when did you come back lester sketched out the last year and change since he and his gang left the city to try a commune in the san joaquin valley everywhere else was worse so we came home but were not going back in the green zone man dont know why you stay because its safe nowheres safe at least out here youre not safe out here youre not safe from them weve been here a couple months and it was working out pretty good theres a cistern in the park behind kezar stadium and we had gardens on the roof under pressurized tents what do you mean you had gardens last night somebody burned us out gracie took eagle up to the roof rows of burst bubbles and black crops gracie spat in the ashes whole thing went up before we got up here chimi was on guard duty but he was huffing something last night he said he saw eagle said toy helicopters he ran back downstairs lester followed him passed him the joint eagle stubbed it out you guys gotta get out of here today now lester coughed no way weve got everything we need here if theyd just leave us alone they cant leave you alone they need you he stopped did you hear that turn down the music it sounded like thunder it was dark in the back of the garbage truck soothing miasma of rot inside pushing out bad thoughts in the dark in the stench couldnt see the new recruits couldnt smell their freshly welded metal and plastic newcorpse stink the commanders voice recited a litany in his ear over and over the preengagement medpak spikes made him restless when that happened got bored and he started to picture something else happening and remembering it or imagining it wishing hold and contain wait for the gas to clear target centerofmass no headshots dont screw your dungeon master kids on and on over and over like teaching a parrot to talk if something else happened anything it would be better one of the raiders moaned a low hungry sound in the dark the others took it up they did it every time the drugs and the voice in their ears wound them up so they must be getting close a flat deafening boom lifted the truck and stood it up on its back wheels then dropped it on its side the raiders were thrown into a pile was on top but he couldnt move static chewed his ears the rear hatch hissed jerry the handler pried it open with a crowbar motherfuckers he kept saying like a parrot blood streamed from his ears and hundreds of cuts all over his face and chest that shone like rubieshalfmelted glass embedded in his skin used our own fuckin mines on us tooz woozily he punched in the shoulder fuck em up otown what is the fucking situation out there over the dungeon master screamed in their ears gordo jerry where are my dogs goddamit jerry sat down in the street and lit a cigarette started coughing blood squirted out of the holes in his neck the raiders spilled out of the trash truck three of them rushed jerry and tore him apart they looked funny to trying to stuff gobbets of steaming meat into their toothless mouths and into their rubber foodtubes raiders sound off you cocksuckers growled at the pda ducttaped to his forearm and tapped the touchscreen green dots on the map were friends the red spot on the edge of the map was hot move closer get warmer feels good when you were hot you got to fight youre my quarterback baby are you the only one left fuck the transmitter in the truck is toast im rerouting through here i cant see shit on the satellites and my air support is a fuckin noob and im pretty much talking to myself right now huh counted his comrades tapping the touchscreen six times two raiders still lay in the back of the truck one flopped from the waist down the other ones head was twisted around backwards and could only bite his own back ok helmetcams are live fall in bitches its medication time as one the raiders jerked to attention their medpaks whined under their helmets pumping drugs and barrages of electroshock to jumpstart sluggish decaying synapses shreds of jerrys septic gut dangled from the facemasks of the three backsliders but they shambled into the huddle the new guys were stripped slim green metal tanks jutting out of their chests stuffed with c bricks they marched in staggered formation along both sidewalks hugging the scorched brownstone townhouses and concrete lofts that lined haight street on their screens the meaningless map glowed red in the direction of west took point with a sixtycaliber saw in his hands the dungeon master spoke in his ear coaxing them around piles of wrecked cars and booby traps okay youre coming up on the park go left youre getting warmer didnt need directions his brain glowed pulsing in time with the red zone on the map the light from the intense shocks sparked behind his dull gray eyes and through the bulletholes in his black and silver helmet making him look like a wrathful dickswinging god of the underworld the mix downstairs rudely cut out and bob marleys iron lion zion shook rat turds out of the record stores rafters it was their burglar alarm the pizza feast disbanded with fire drill discipline even the kids grabbed guns tweak pulled a metal chain to drop the steel curtains in front of the store but something roared out in the street and burst through the plywood and plastic windows it burst in midair before crashing at their feet a canister flooded the loft with yellow smoke eagle pulled on his mask and pushed lesters chair away from the gas gracie herded the kids and the pedalpushers towards the rooftop stairs but she dropped dead before she could say the words eagle shouted masks get your masks most of them had masks or filters around their necks but the gas rolled over them before they could spit out their pizza half a dozen of them died in a sprawling pile at the foot of the stairs a kid rolled on the floor clawing at her mask drowning in her own vomit lester slid out of his chair and tumbled to the floor eagle took his gun out and looked for something to shoot his goggles were fogged up all he could see was smoke the white stuff that killed everyone thinned out into cotton candy streamers oozing down the stairs black smoke came from the roof shooting from outside but almost all of it was hitting the building eagle charged down the drawbridge stairs just as a car crashed through the portcullis and plowed into the electronica section nobody was driving the burnedout subaru wagon but four oakland raiders were pushing it the second the subaru crashed through the wroughtiron gate a ring of claymore mines on the cashiers counters popped up like sprinklers to shoulder height before exploding thousands of steel ball bearings flew out like a multiball monsoon in a tight utterly devastating radius two raiders stumbled into each other as their perforated heads drained like dribble glasses tweak capped a third with a shotgun but the headless raider selfdestructed and doused the dj with flaming jelly the fourth raider had dozens of steel pinballs embedded in its armor but it gamely came over and climbed the stairs dragging a huge machinegun on one arm like john fucking wayne clomped up the steps as eagle tried in vain to figure out how to raise the drawbridge he looked at the pile of people behind him dead kids with guns and pizza in their hands the roof stairs were on fire he put away his gun and picked up the last pizza box olives artichoke hearts and anchovies less than halfeaten why did nobody appreciate anchovies hey sherman hold up man its me eagle the pizza guy he waved his chipped wrist at the approaching zombie raider like he deserved to live while these chipless nobodies deserved to get gassed in their own home as if the dungeon master looking at him from behind his game console would see a human being at all lifted the gun to eagles head then froze looking down eagle felt shit pushing at his sphincter sweat popped out of his forehead im not fighting you he told nobody here wanted to fight you they just wanted something to eat scanned the loft from the neat pile of bodies by the stairs to the harmless hopeless pizza guy standing in its way looking back at the dead bodies for a long moment it finally turned to eagle and raised its gun hey big guy you want a slice eagle held out and opened the box and he wanted to say please in the head if you have to which was to say please i dont wanna come back looking past the camera goggles stared straight into s runny gray eyes just pouring his soul out being human the only thing hed ever been gurgled and a rope of spittle dripped down from its steelplated jaws huck anchowies it said and eagle was running even before the barrel dropped running and laughing with tears in his eyes thanking god in whatever form it chose for this awful moment of mercy and grace as the dungeon master went click click click stomped his feet went click click click again repeating it over and over staring furiously at the game that utterly failed to obey him betrayed with every click fifteen minutes lateras he click click clickeda text window popped up on his primary screen much improved good news was good news it was good to be useful he got recognition bonuses and perks all the time he deserved them because he was the best and yet with his free hand he grabbed at his straggly goatee and tugged until the pain cleared his mind then reached out and grabbed the joystick again squeezing and squeezing the trigger on the screen suddenly locked on a worker and shot him in the back cutting him in half his crew went on bagging and tagging the bodies all green tags definitely not an equipment failure i shot you he said to the screen i told you to shoot i gave you a fucking order the replay of eagle staring down his favorite death machine ran on a corner screen until sherman kicked it in it made his foot hurt like a bastard war was just so unfair are you trying to tell me this is heaven by sarah

start to stink after three days it can really be a strain sharing your living space with another person and so the decision to have a child is one of the biggest gambles a person can takeyoure essentially inviting a complete stranger to come live with you for a few decades and to be a major part of your life until you die most of the time it works out pretty well at least we like to think so but there are exceptionschildren who are desperately unhappy no matter what you try to do for them who run away or get mixed up in crime parents torment themselves over how they should handle situations like thisdo you draw the line somewhere try to enforce strict discipline or maybe ship your child off to a prisonlike reform school or do you provide unconditional love and support and hope that somehow they find their way in the world sometimes nothing you do seems to work our final story tells of a parent who was in just such a predicament and who is trying to reach his wayward daughter in the wake of a zombie apocalypse he knows that his daughter is not the child he might have wished for but he loves her nevertheless and is willing to do anything to protect her or at leastalmost anything after all the world can be a terrifying place a place full of monsters i he gets bit the midday sun slaps conrad wilcoxs shoulders and softens the blacktop highway so that his shoes sink just slightly its a wide road with a middle island upon which magnolias bloom along the sides of the street are parked or crashed cars most of them rusted hes got three more miles to go and then if his map is correct a left on emancipation place two more miles after that and hell reach whatevers left of the louisiana state correctional facility for women hell reach delia along the

plague zone keep out conrad wipes his brow with the back of an agespotdappled hand and keeps walking hes come nearly two thousand miles and he buried his fear back in toms river along with the bodies in fears place came hysteria followed by paralysis depression the urge to do selfharm and finally the enduring numbness with which he has sustained his survival but so close to the end his numbness cracks like an external skeleton his chest and groin feel exposed as if theyve loosened from their bony cradles and are about to fall out im almost there gladdy he says youd better be watching youd better help me figure out what to do when the time comes you old cow i am he answers himself in a fussy highpitched voice then adds dont call me a cow another quartermile past the city limits brings him to a kudzucovered eleven its the first shop since the hess station in howell that doesnt look bombed out or looted water here we go connie he mumbles in that same wrongsounding voice see its all going to turn out great he shuffles toward the storefront on a bent back and spry skinny limbs so that the overhead view of him appears crablike he is sixtytwo years old but could pass for eighty his reflection a grizzled wretch with a concave chest and hollowed eyes moves slowly in the jagged storefront glass but everything else is still no crickets chirp no children scream its too quiet he grabs his holsteremptyand remembers that he lost his gun to the bottom of the mississippi river two days ago and has been without water and food ever since this looks like capital t trouble right here in river city he says in the highpitched voice it belongs to his wife gladys hes so lonely out here that hes invented her ghost keep walking connie he knows shes right but hes so thirsty that his tongue has swollen inside his mouth and if he doesnt find water soon hell collapse so he sighs angles himself between the shards of broken doorway glass and enters the eleven its smalltwo narrow aisles flanked by an enclosed counter up front dust blankets the stock like pristine brown snow a morbidly obese woman with a balding black widows peak and chipped purple nail polish stands behind the counter holding a bloodied issue of the enquirer zombies rise up from baton rouge ghetto the lead article screams hi connie says the woman drops the magazine and bobbles in his direction something has eaten most of her abdomen and in the weeks or months since her death the wet climate has not dried her out but instead made a moldy home of her he pictures lizards crickets even unborn children flying out from her gaping hole her apron which presumably once read thank heaven for eleven now reads heaveneleven are you trying to tell me this is heaven conrad asks she lunges at him and the force of her weight against the threefoothigh counter opens her stomach spraying the shrunken big bite hot dogs spit glass and enquirer with gangrenous green fluid sorry i didnt mean to tease you he grunts as he wipes his face and pitches toward the darkened glass refrigerators in the back behind him heaven figures it out and climbs the counter then falls to the floor and crawls after him on a leaking stomach conrad tries to pick up his pace but hes so dehydrated that his heart is a trapped bird in his chest fluttering and in pain do zombies eat cold meat do they dream of electric sheep shut up about the poor innocent zombies and find the water con he hisses only hes too tired to use gladys voice so now its just him talking to himself which strikes him as sort of sad behind heaven pushes herself to her feet her lips spread into a grin and then keep spreading until they split open the heat has turned her blood to thick soup that doesnt run he hurries but his hearts not in it literally its pumping spastically as if to muzakhis wedding song forty years ago with all of your faults i love you still it had to be you lovely young heaven lunges and swipes at him he reaches the refrigerator whose shelves are lined with new world gold and lifts a gallonsized container of poland spring water though heavens gaining he chugs for one second two three as he rounds the second aisle and doubles back toward the exit just then something cracks what the he asks glass skids like sand under heavens feet to his shock she isnt shambling anymore shes running bad luck runners are rare hurry up con he pants but hes rooted there for a second water in hand as her voluminous flesh bounces and thuds hes wondering if maybe this is the second coming and he got left behind because heavens lips have split lengthwise like a hags clit and inside all her teeth are gold she dives fast this time he doesnt know shes got hold of his denim jacket until she reels him into a festering embrace shes strong and tallhis toes dont even touch the floor so he uses her body as a hinge and kicks up as hard as he can his knees slop against her chest hooking gristle as something cracks her ribs her hardened kidneys and she drops him back muscles screaming like cop sirens he dives over the counter his hands find the twelvegauge on the shelf beneath the cash register and he reaches over and presses it against heavens ugly face before his physical mind ever recognizes that its a gun im sorry heaven he intends to say as he squeezes the trigger but instead freudian slip im sorry delia the mention of his daughters name trips him up he hesitates as he shoots and by luck or intention she knocks the gun out of the way he hears the sound of shattering glass but doesnt see what the slug hit all he can see is heaven as she sinks her gold teeth into his shoulder down to the bone theres no time to think he reaches inside her open belly with both hands and pulls her spine until it cracks she hugs him tighter and then lets go falling backward and in half i loved you where the ocean met the sky he tells the thing named heaven though he does not hear himself say those strange words she blinks only her eyelids arent long enough to cover her rotbloated eyes so she watches him perhaps seeing nothing perhaps seeing everything as he pulls the trigger and her head explodes when hes finished he stands over her remains while his shoulder bleeds and infection worms its way through his heart and into his frontal lobe im sorry delia he tells her for that bloodlust for adam and not testifying for not believing you that time you called especially for that im sorry for everything he says then he staggers out a damned man down a long lonely road that is almost over toward delia ii how rosie perez foretold the end some blamed cockroach feces others the hand of god whatever it was nobody who got the virus survived it attacked the immune system first then it devoured the entire frontal lobe the sick forgot who they were or how to walk and eventually how to breathe after they died the virus worked its way into the hindbrains instinct center and kept eating then something funny happened they woke up only this time the virus was in charge and it was hungry fox news broke the story on april at first everybody thought it was a joke the dead rising from embalming and autopsy tables sick beds basement bedrooms they spread the bloodborne disease with their bites it started in baton rouge but quickly spread to all of louisiana overnight hospitals throughout the south were full a week later national radio signals and satellites were offline two weeks after that the army disbanded and went rogue by easter america had dissolved conrad had only been walking for three months since the world ended but it felt like years he didnt like to think about the old days they were bittersweet when his wife got pregnant with delia more than twenty years ago gladys had called the child a gift from god after three miscarriages two years of fertility treatments and finally experimental blood transfusions theyd almost given up hope shes the best thing we could have hoped for gladys said the day she arrived at the hospital and for once cynical conrad had agreed delia christen wilcox was perfect smart pretty full of giggles theyd doted indulged hugged and kissed until their hearts had overfilled broken and grown back larger and more accommodating and shed taken and kept taking it had started at her mothers tit which shed suckled too hard and drawn blood then the bigger things backyard swingset horseback riding lessons her own room a lock on her door handsewn boutique clothes ski vacations allnight curfews and finally the silver and crystal and even their flat screen television drugs theyd guessed though theyd never known for sure after their dog barkley went missing conrad had imagined it was something much worse bloodier probably one of them should have asked she moved out at sixteen and began couch surfing at boyfriends houses back surfing hed once called it for which the kid had slapped him hed slapped her right back then shed bit his arm hard enough to draw blood there were more shenanigans the house got broken into the dodge stolen some fool named butter had called them at all hours asking for his sweet momma they instituted a curfew when the high school kids at toms river started turning up dead but shed climbed out the window and come waltzing back at dawn then she went missing entirely and though both of them had imagined this absence in their darkest moments and assumed it would bring relief it only ushered more misery was she cold frightened alone did she need them only she was ashamed to ask two years later they got the call from a special victims unit detective in louisianadelia had been arrested for the human trafficking of her own child hed learned but had promptly forgotten the particulars a son named adam born a year after she left home a kiddieporn ring a trannie boyfriend whod kept her high and happy a payoff for her infant son it amounted to less than the going rate for any of the boys individual organs on the black market as if the living child as a whole was worth less than the sum of his parts though he considered it in the end conrad decided not to testify in his daughters defense she was sentenced to eight years at the louisiana womens correctional facility he never visited she never wrote he and gladys legally adopted adam they gave away delias pretty things and painted her old room blue adam never learned to attach significance to the word mother and for this they considered themselves lucky its like shes dead gladys once said behind her the section of wall where delias picture once hung had appeared especially white its not like shes dead conrad replied its like she was never born after some time they got used to the boy they cherished his coos and the way he cried out with glee when he woke from naps so happy once again to find them waiting this second time around the scale tilted in the opposite direction and they did not spare the rod for this they were rewarded with an obedient if less spirited child trouble came when the boy turned five it started with the fevers when the welts appeared the specialists diagnosed him with viral meningitis hed gotten it the best anyone could figure from an act of sodomy while under his mothers care this was also how hed gotten the syphilis conrad and gladys sold everything delia had not stolen from the diamond ring to the belgian lace linens when insurance wouldnt cover the experimental spinal filtration they mortgaged their house little adam lived in the columbiapresbyterian intensive care unit and as much as they could they lived there too two months later they saw firsthand in the hospital what the virus did to its victims they survived somehow in the way that people meant to live through every kind of misery always do to his own surprise conrad got cold blooded he bashed two infecteds heads with an iv pole while gladys pulled the tubing from adams wrists and together they ran most others from the administrators to the doctors surrendered with open hands and horrified expressions fighting meant believing and they hadnt been ready for that but by then conrads daughter was a jailbird junkie his grandsons skin too tender to touch and his wife a newage jesus freak praying for the health of her lost family so what the fuck did a few zombies matter he and gladys took the boy back home to toms river where he wheezed his final breaths in their arms throughout adam wore this betrayed expression on his face like hed died under the misapprehension that conrad was god and could have cured him but had chosen otherwise to teach him a lesson outside their manicured splitlevel ranch sirens blasted carnage littered the streets inexplicably his walking buddy dale crowther slick with soap ran naked down princeton road but the animated dead stuck to old routines and in the suburbs nobody visits their neighbors so conrad dug the shallow grave in the backyard next to the family dogs bones unperturbed on the television the next night they learned that the research institutes were close to a cure with martial law declared and civil rights rescinded the cdc had turned the southern prisons into laboratories and begun experimenting on convicts in thick brooklynese rosie perez the fillin wpix news anchor announced that the government had discovered a twentythreeyearold convict who was immune isnt that the lady from the lottery movie gladys asked conrad shushed her by putting his hand over her mouth and theyd sat erect and tense as metal tuning forks while a still photo of their daughter had illuminated the television shed looked younger and more pissed off than hed expected they shot her full of the virus and shes not sick gladys whispered thank the great buddha my baby i love you so much momma loves you she told the angry woman on the glowing screen while conrad inspected his hands because the sight of his wifes tears when he was helpless to console her was intolerable then rosie returned and spoke off teleprompter so basically were killing a buncha prisoners even though theres like a million zombies out there we could capture and test instead so if this delia wilcox winds up curing everybody then i guess it was worth it but if she doesnt rosie had looked directly into the camera through the screen at conrad and hed felt like someone whos done wrong and been caught think about it people they cant see and they cant hear but theyll still chase you twenty miles cause its not your skin these fuckin things want this virus eats souls thats not gonna be me is it gonna be you rosie glared connie thought about delia and the dog barkley and that day the ocean met the sky then rosie produced a gun pressed it to the side of her head while the cameraman shouted thought better of her strategy placed the gun in her mouth and fired the program went offline conrad and gladys got close enough to press their faces to the snowy screen just in case delia came back she didnt after a halfhour a rerun of americas funniest home videos played somebodys cheeky monkey stole a bunch of bananas from a grocery store then the signal went out the television was gone and america died just like that that night gladys shook him awake the bed was just a mattress on the floorhed broken apart the cedar frame along with the rest of the wood furniture and nailed it against the windows and doors they were living on saltines and defrosted vegetables some days it felt like camp but mostly it didnt im dying connie gladys said his belly filled with cold and his heart slowed as it pumped youre healthy as a cow gladys he told her though in fact she was sweating now her breath shallow and he understood with increasing alarm that there was something hed forgotten its my heart were out of the digitalis ill get it right now he answered the digitaliswhy hadnt she reminded him its no good connie she said and he realized then that she hadnt been too upset to help dig adams plot shed been too sick i didnt tell you because i didnt want you to risk it stop this talk he answered standing now in the dark orange light played through the cracks in the windows because something out there was on fire i know a little high school chemistry well cook it on the kitchen stove whats digitalis made of no con im on my way and youve got to promise me something he ran his hands along the sheets and found that they were wet with her sweat i wont promise you anything you tricked me you coward gladys shook her head stop that connie now promise i wont rest peacefully knowing shes alone locked up even with no one to remember to feed her remember the time with the blood she drank it all straight out of the freezer bag maybe theres a reason she ran off and it wasnt just the drugs we were wrong to give up on her like that youve got to promise to see whats become of her he looked at his wife whose complexion had turned orange with the fire over these last thirtynine years shed grown wrinkled and fat and timid he hated her whiny voice and her old lady stink and her sagging tits mostly he hated her worthless ticker im empty gladys i dont love anything anymore not even you she shook her head in what he would later remember as amusement youre married to somebody that long you know better than to pretend like love is a fish oh shut up and find her you big baby in the morning he dressed her in her comfy bathrobe and plasticsoled slippers then cut off her head just in case and buried her next to the boy and the dog by noon he was gone walking south toward delia iii he finds the dog its only been two hours since he left the eleven but his water is gone and hes thirsty again dusk has settled like a tall mans shadow and though the prison is still two miles of dark broken road to go he doesnt have time to set up camp for the night so will instead persevere his back went out during that last fight so his crabwalk is exaggerated but at least his shoulder has stopped hurting and become numb veins along his neck shine bright blue and green with infection and he wonders what those little virions are eating his defenses probably then his memories thats when he hears the howl carrying across the broken blacktop it sounds humana soulful lament he thinks it must be the thrumping bass of old world music since he cant imagine there are any survivors left whod be so incautious as to wail then again maybe its his imagination since he got bit hes been hearing voices they dont belong to gladys sorry i bit you mister could you help an old altar boy father i saw the multitudes to every side of me and their howls were loud he thinks it might be a disorder of the brain he hopes so at least maybe you didnt even get bit con he says in the wrong voice gladys voice maybe you just imagined it and youre totally fine no gladdy im losing it he says as a second howl interrupts him he spots the thing in the middle of the magnoliastrewn street a black lab retriever a dog it cowers with its head between its paws he cant help it he smiles and comes to life a little a dog he thought they all were deadeaten up first by the infected and then by the survivors he shambles faster grinning like an idiot remembers games he taught his old mutt barkleyfetch my beer and lift gladys skirt as he crabwalks he passes a crawling zombie without legs that is chewing its own flesh i like it because it is bitter and because it is my heart but is too decomposed to chase him when he gets to the pup he offers it his closed fist out of habit he pulls back when he sees the things chewedup snout and bloated white eyes it doesnt try to bite him and hes confused until he realizes that it smells his infection and knows they are kindred so he does the dog a favor with one hand he takes it by the chin and with the other he draws the butt of his shotgun and smashes it over the mutts skull it whines just like a real dog i loved you where the ocean met the sky he thinks even though your mouth was bloody then he keeps walking toward delia by his map hes almost there iv bestial creatures hes seen a lot of things none of them good in tupelo he met a band of lunatics who sacrificed their healthiest to the infected in the hopes of pleasing god still theyd been company in delaware he met a couple who traveled with him until they got botulism from canned spam how can you taste the difference in asheville he took pity on an old shutin and stole a kitchens worth of food for her before leaving on his way out she said stay take care of me you cant really think your daughters still alive she wept as he shut the door to her small airless basement and it occurred to him that in the old days he might have wasted more time trying to comfort her when delia was small hed carried her on his shoulders from place to place and pitied his bosses at the accounting firm whod considered their childrens rearing the domain of women now that seemed smug who had he been to judge shit happens you can blame yourself and god and everybody around you but sometimes shit just happens like when they went fishing and the trout flopped in the plastic bucket filled with water the stillness of the ocean had mesmerized him and for a moment he mistook nineyearold delias bloody mouth for a fever dream but then he heard the slurping the sun began to rise and its color married the water to the sky maybe it was the blood treatments or bad genes or bad rearing maybe some people are just born wrong and there is nothing you can do i love you he told her as hed dumped the dead bluefish back into the water a few years later barkley turned up drained and hanging from the roof like a christmas suckling pig he buried the dog before gladys ever saw how badly it was mangled once a long time ago he got a phone call gladys slept through even while he spoke in hushed tones next to her the voice on the other line came reluctantly dad yeah it had been months by then shed left on a sunday afternoon while they were at church and had taken her mothers heirloom pearls with her i need help she said money im in trouble he looked at the phone a long while thinking did you hurt somebody its not about that its a debt about five thousand were out d you robbed us blind and im not working fulltime like i used to theyll make me pay for it with my body she said and im pregnant dad shed been crying but that hadnt meant it was true hed been so angry or maybe so shocked that hed hung up next time they heard from her was two years later in baton rouge his heart swelled like a leaking sponge when he found out shed been telling the truth did you ever imagine she had a baby gladys asked as they sat on the plane headed south their iras cashed in for bail its a blessing maybe she said with tearful eyes little feet running around burping and pooping god ive missed that connie looked out the window at the clouds as theyd kissed the ocean he thought about how in purgatory you relive your life over and over without ever finding resolution or redemption the colors outside the plane had been blue ocean on blue sky and in between the red of a sunset i had no idea hed said v delia and the start of it all the prison is an ordinary building the castiron gate surrounding it is open and rusted its dark out but with the infection threading his veins connie can see he can hear too already he knows that the prison is lousy with the dead theyre looking for things theyve lost children love ambitions their souls maybe she wasnt immune and they only told people that to keep hope alive he says in gladys voice as he comes to the end of emancipation place its a lie just like everything else maybe she wasnt the cure she was the cause youre the optimist glady not me you should shoot yourself now while you still can i hate the idea of you turning into one of them what if theres a heaven and youre not allowed because your soul is gone he stops and looks up at the vast brick prison whose windows are all barred ive come this far glady we both know she was never right but i cant chicken out now he says then climbs the steps to the entrance the lobby inside is small and long with reception stations down the entire length of the building he wanders first the east wing then the west where he passes a slender child who sways to the rhythm of the vents that pump hot wet air her eyes are bloody and out of habit he kicks her so that she lands against the tiled hall wall something cracks her femur but she doesnt come after him only lies against the cafeteria wall like a fractured doll sorry he mumbles then keeps walking its okay she answers in his mind have you seen my daddy he abandoned me thats a low blow he mumbles back only maybe he doesnt say the words maybe now he and the dead understand each other she grins the holding cells are in the back of the building about thirty in all they border the periphery of a large twostory room connie walks from cell to cell half are empty the other half singly occupied by emaciated uninfected women lying mostly in their beds none bear delias face it seems a waste to conrad that no one thought to set them free or feed them in cell nine a woman clings to the bars with locked fingers her front teeth are worn down to the gums from where she tried to bite her way out there are zombies too of course they walk in aimless circles and have spread nearly equidistantabout one per every ten square feetlike air molecules in stasis mindless and inanimate for the most part they dont notice him though he can hear their thoughts im hungry im thirsty im lonely its so dark in here and my love is so dry in the basement of the west wing he finds the makeshift laboratory where it looks like surgeries happened in the hallways he sees the iv trees monitors and needles that remind him of adam it occurs to him that he and gladys never asked delia if she wanted the child instead they took him then abandoned her as if she were junk in admitting his own fault its easier to admit the greater truth she murdered the fish and barkley and those high school kids too she was born with a bloodlust in the basement he finds the rest of the prisoners chained to gurneys they must have been injected with the virus because their heads are cleanly sawed away a doctor and nurse both infected wander the aisles forever trapped in their roles of sick and well prisoner and captive they seem to believe they are ministering comfort as they check lifeless wrists for pulses delia he shouts they look at him for a moment then return to their work if she is alive and i find her i will be happy he thinks even if she has not changed i will take comfort from finishing this journey and be fulfilled delia he cries like his joints his throat is beginning to lock just then a tiny faraway voice shouts back here its been years since hes seen her but her voice transcends time it is imprinted upon him and dwells in the reptile part of his brain that even the virus cannot devour his body moves almost of its own volition not even his back hurts anymore he is entirely numb delia in reply is that same hesitation from years ago when she called late at night while gladys slept hes run that moment over in his mind every day since and recognizes now that her hesitation was shame it was always shame dad hes racing on stiff rigor mortis legs while his favorite memories long forgotten surface the night she stayed home from a party to play chess with him the poster of dogs playing poker in her bedroom that he never took down even after adam moved in the color red that he has forever associated with delia his perfect child who was born with a taste for blood these memories surface like exploding stars and then just as quickly disappear he tries to catch them but they are mist by the time he reaches the lower level of the basement he is aware only of their loss and not what they contained delia he cries and now he cant rememberis he chasing her ghost or the actual girl dad im here in the bomb shelter she answers he shambles standing tall now past the walking dead national guard and orderlies and reporters through the second examination room where the rest of the headless prisoners lay and toward the back stairs that lead farther down his muscles tear and creak as he descends he unlocks another door to another wide room where there are no zombies just a single cell in the center of the room several bodies lay half inside the bars their legs and chests chewed down to the bones he looks up and there is delia redcheeked and glowing peering out from her cage dad she says he doesnt remember her name and her young vigorous face doesnt look familiar but he knows her and he loves her like red dawn he walks stifflegged to the bars shes crying the sound is both terrible and beauteous there are voices many voices whispering words of nonsense im hungry im lonely its so dark nine hundred ninetynine times out of a thousand my master will lie and then through all that so softly he can barely hear it connie promise me shes all weve got the woman is small and sharpfeatured with a round belly though he has no evidence or memory he knows she is his daughter youre immune he asks sort of she says she cant look him in the eyes why didnt they make a vaccine she shakes her head he waits for more she doesnt ask about the boy adam he doesnt remember the name or what the word represents he only knows hes disappointed like always and shes ashamed like always and the chasm between their two distinct natures is red i got bit he tells her where are the keys i better get you out so you can run away she nods her head at the key ring about twenty feet away and he retrieves it there is only one key and it occurs to him that to put her here they must have thought she was very dangerous dont worry about me she says i cant get what you have something clicks inside him the part that knew this all along the part that came all this way because it knew and needed to finish what it had started he comes closer in one hand hes got the shotgun in the other the key he feels himself nodding off he thinks about the ocean and the sky and the time they went fishing at dawn and how she told him she loved him too and then there is gladys looking down on them both with the baby in her arms like the virgin mary why are you immune he asks she points to the back of her cell he notices that the structures hed first imagined as furniture are bones she has fashioned a chair a bed the rest are piled and polished like shiny rocks he realizes why this room is free of zombies little is left save their bones i feed on their blood any blood it keeps me young but you knew that he nods but doesnt answer because he has lost the words he is losing himself one brain cell at a time she licks her lips and he sees that shes less happy to see him than hungry but this is the nature of parents and children the former give the latter take the key dad she asks it feels sharp in his hand he remembers those missing high school kids and after that the junkies bodies he read about in the paper that had been drained of blood no wonder she developed a taste for heroin the virus came from me she says i bit someone and they lived it mutated inside them and spread im dying he says her orange jumpsuit is slack in the hips and waist its probably been a while since she fed if he opens the door for her shell make a meal of him but what are fathers for if not sustenance fuck you dad you never understood it was a gift you made me ashamed he shakes his head feels his heart slowing in his chest it doesnt remember how to pump so he hits it hard i love you he says her eyes water he thinks that means shes sad but he cant really tell monsters dont act like normal people i love you too she answers now give me the key are you lonesome just like me connie did you know gladys asks maybe its coming from him maybe its her ghost yes i knew he whispers so did you behind the bars delia licks her lips the key he doesnt remember his name anymore or this woman before him all that is left is the emotion underneath it and instinct now dad he fires the shotgun his aim is true then he turns the shotgun on himself but it is too long and his fingers wont obey him so he drops it the young woman lies motionless while blood pools around her he thinks about the color blue as he reaches through the bars that will now separate them for an eternity and squeezes her fingers she squeezes back as if she is relieved and then lets go in sadness he can no longer comprehend his heart tears itself into wings and flaps blood it is a caged bird in there that has shred itself insideout but still cant get free
