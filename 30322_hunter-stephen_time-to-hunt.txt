kipling writing in the voice of his son john kia the somme at the age of sixteen prologue we are in the presence of a master sniper he lies almost preternaturally still on hard stone the air is thin still cold he doesnt shake or tremble the sun is soon to rise pushing the chill from the mountains as its light spreads it reveals fabulous beauty high peaks shrouded in snow a pristine sky that will be the color of a pure blue diamond far mountain pastures of a green so intense it rarely exists in nature brooks snaking down through pines that carpet the mountainsides the sniper notices none of this if you pointed it out to him he wouldnt respond beauty in nature or women or even rifles isnt a concept he would recognize not after where hes been and what hes done he simply doesnt care his mind doesnt work that way instead he sees nothingness he feels a great cool numbness no idea has any meaning to him at this point his mind is almost empty as though hes in a trance hes a shortnecked man as so many great shooters are his blue eyes though gifted with an almost freakish acuity appear dull signifying a level of mental activity almost startlingly blank his pulse rate hardly exists he has some oddities again freakish in some men but weirdly perfect for a shooter he has extremely well developed fasttwitch forearm muscles still supple and defined at his age which is beyond fifty his hands are large and strong his stamina is off the charts as are his reflexes and his pain tolerance hes strong flexible as charged with energy as any other worldclass athlete he has both a technical and a creative mind and a will as directed as a laser but none of this really explains him any more than such analysis would explain a williams or a dimaggio he simply has an internal genius possibly autistic that gives him extraordinary control over body and mind hand and eye infinite patience a shrewd gift for the tactical and most of all total commitment to his arcane art which in turn forms the core of his identity and has granted him a life that few could imagine but for now nothing not his past not his future not the pain of lying so still in the cold through a long night not the excitement of knowing this could be the day no anticipation no regret just nothing before him is the tool of his trade lying askew on a hard sandbag he knows it intimately having worked with it a great deal in preparation for the thirty seconds that will come today or tomorrow or the day after its a remington with an hs precision fiberglass stock and a leupold x scope its been tricked up by a custom rifle smith to realize the last tenth of a percent of its potential the action trued and honed and bolted into the metal block at the center of the stock at maximum torque a new krieger barrel freefloated after cryogenic treatment the trigger a jewell lets off at four pounds with the crisp snap of a glass rod breaking the sniper has run several weeks worth of load experimentation through the rifle finding the exact harmony that will produce maximum results the perfect balance between the weight of a bullet the depth of its seating the selection and amount to the tenth grain hand measured of the powder nothing has been left to chance the case necks have been turned and annealed the primer hole de burred the primer depth perfected the primer itself selected for consistency the rifle muzzle wears the latest hot lick a browning ballistic optimizing system which is a kind of screwon nozzle that can be microtuned to generate the best vibrational characteristics for accuracy the caliber isnt military but civilian the mm remington magnum once the flavor of the month in international hunting circles capable of dropping a ram or a whitetail at amazing distances though surpassed by some flashier loads its still a flatshooting hardhitting cartridge that holds its velocity as it flies through the thin air delivering close to two thousand footpounds of energy beyond five hundred yards but of all this data the sniper doesnt care or no longer cares he knew it at one time he has forgotten it now the point of the endless ballistic experimentation was simple to bring the rifle and its load to complete perfection so that it could be forgotten that was one principle of great shootingarrange for the best then forget all about it when the sound comes it doesnt shock or surprise him he knew it had to come sooner or later it doesnt fill him with doubt or regret or anything it simply means the obvious time to work its a peal of laughter girlish and bright giddy with excitement it bounces off the stone walls of the canyon from the shadow of a draw onto this high shelf from close to a thousand yards off whizzing through the thin air the sniper wiggles his fingers finds the warmth in them his concentration cranks up a notch or so he pulls the rifle to him in a fluid motion well practiced from hundreds of thousands of shots in practice or on missions its stock rises naturally to his cheek as he pulls it in and as one hand flies to the wrist the other sets up beneath the forearm taking the weight of his slightly lifted body building a bone bridge to the stone below it rests on a densely packed sandbag he finds the spot weld the one placement of cheek to stock where the scope relief will be perfect and the circle of the scope will throw up its image as brightly as a movie screen his adduct or magnus a tube of muscle running through his deep thigh tenses as he splays his right foot ever so slightly above a hawk rides a thermal gliding through the blue morning sky a mountain trout leaps a bear looks about for something to eat a deer scampers through the brush the sniper notices none of it he doesnt care mommy shouts eightyearold nikki swagger come on nikki rides better than either of her parents shes been almost literally raised on horseback as her father a retired marine staff nco with an agricultural background had decided to go into the business of horse care at his own layup barn in arizona where nikki was born nikkis mother a handsome woman named julie fenn swagger trails behind julie doesnt have the natural grace of her daughter but she grew up in arizona where horses were a way of life and has been riding since childhood her husband rode as an arkansas farmboy then didnt for decades then came back to the animals and now loves them so in their integrity and loyalty that he has almost singlemindedly willed himself into becoming an accomplished saddle man that is one of his gifts okay okay she calls be careful sweetie though she knows that careful is the last thing nikki will ever be for hers is a heros personality built from a willingness to risk all to gain all and a seeming absence of fear shes like an indian in that way and like her father too who was once a war hero she turns come on she calls replicating her daughters rhythms you want to see the valley as the sun races across it dont you yep comes the call from the rider still unseen in the shadows of the draw nikki bounds ahead out of the shadows and into the bright light her horse named calypso is a fouryearold thoroughbred gelding quite a beast but nikki handles it with nonchalance she is actually riding english because it is part of her mothers dream for her that she will go east to college and the skills that are the hallmarks of equestrian sophistication will take her a lot farther than the rowdy ability to ride like a cowboy her father does not care for the english saddle which seems hardly enough to protect the girl from the muscles of the animal beneath and at horse shows he thinks those puffy jodhpurs and that little velveteen jacket with its froth of lace at the throat are sublimely ridiculous calypso bounds over the rocky path his cleverness as evident as his fearlessness to watch the slight girl maneuver the massive horse is one of the great joys of her fathers life she never seems so alive as when on horseback or so happy or so in command now nikkis voice trills with pleasure as the horse at last breaks out onto a shelf of rock before them is the most beautiful view within riding distance and she races to the edge seemingly out of control but actually very much in control honey cries julie as her daughter careens merrily toward disasterbe careful the child the woman the man the child comes first the best rider bold and adventurous she emerges from the shadow of the draw letting her horse run and the animal thunders across the grass to the edge of the precipice halts then spins and begins to twitch with anticipation the girl holds him tightly laughing the woman is next not so gifted a rider she still rides easily with loping strides comfortable in the saddle the sniper can see her straw hair her muscularity under the jeans and work shirt the way the sun has browned her face her horse is a big chestnut a stout working cowboys horse not sleek like the daughters and finally the man he is lean and watchful and there is a rifle in the scabbard under his saddle he looks dangerous like a special man who would never panic react fast and shoot straight which is exactly what he is he rides like a gifted athlete almost one with the animal controlling it unconsciously with his thighs relaxed in the saddle he is still obviously alert he would not see the sniper the sniper is too far out the hide too carefully camouflaged the spot chosen to put the sun in the victims eyes at this hour so that hell see only dazzle and blur if he looks the crosshairs ride up to the man and stay with him as he gallops along finding the same rhythm in the cadences finding the same updown plunge of the animal the shooters finger caresses the trigger feels absorbed by its softness but he does not fire moving target transversing laterally left to right but also moving up and down through a vertical plane meters by no means an impossible shot and many a man in his circumstances would have taken it but experience tells the sniper to wait a better shot will lie ahead the best shot with a man like swagger thats the one you take the man joins the woman and the two chat and what he says makes her smile white teeth flash a little tiny human part in the sniper aches for the womans beauty and ease hes had prostitutes the world over some quite expensive but this little moment of intimacy is something that has evaded him completely thats all right he has chosen to work in exile from humanity jesus christ he curses himself thats how shots are blown that little fragment of lost concentration which takes you out of the operation he briefly snaps his eyes shut absorbs the darkness and clears his mind then opens them again to what lies before him the man and the woman have reached the edge meters before them runs a valley unfolding in the sunlight as the sun climbs even higher but tactically what this means to the sniper is that at last his quarry has ceased to move in the scope he sees a family portrait man woman and child all at nearly the same level because the childs horse is so big it makes her as tall as her parents they chat the girl laughs points at a bird or something seethes with motion the woman stares into the distance the man still seeming watchful relaxes just the tiniest bit the crosshairs bisect the square chest the master sniper expels a breath seeks the stillness within himself but wills nothing he never decides or commits it just happens the rifle bucks and as it comes back in a fraction of a second he sees the tall mans chest explode as the mm remington magnum tears through it part i the parade deck washington dc aprilmay chapter one it was unseasonably hot that spring and washington languished under the blazing sun the grass was brown and lusterless the traffic thick the citizens surly and uncivil even the marble monuments and the white government buildings seemed squalid it was as though a torpor hung over the place or a curse nobody in official washington went to parties anymore it was a time of bitterness and recrimination and it was a time of siege the city was in fact under attack the process the president called vietnamization wasnt happening fast enough for the armies of peace demonstrators who regularly assailed the citys parks and byways shutting it down or letting it live pretty much unchecked and pretty much as they saw fit this month already the vietnam veterans for peace had commandeered the steps of the capitol showering them with a bitter rain of medals more action was planned for the beginning of may when the may tribe of the peoples coalition for peace and justice had sworn to close down the city once again this time for a whole week in all the town there was only one section of truly green grass some would look upon it and see in the green a last living symbol of american honor a last best hope others would say the green was artificial like so much of america it was sustained by the immense labor of exploited workers who had no choice in the matter this is what we are changing they would say the green grass was the parade ground or in the patois of a service which holds fast to the conceit that all land structures are merely extensions of and metaphorical representations of the ships of the fleet the parade deck of the marine barracks at eighth and i southeast the young enlisted men labored over it as intensely as any cathedral gardeners for to the jesuitical minds of the united states marine corps at any rate it was holy ground the barracks built in was the oldest continuously occupied military installation in the united states even the british dared not burn it when they put the rest of the city to the torch in to look across the deck to the officers houses on one side the structures that housed three companies alpha bravo and hotel for headquarters on the other and the commandants house at the far end of the quadrangle was to see preserved a pristine version of what service in the corps and service to the country theoretically meant the ancient bricks were red and the architecture had sprung from an age in which design was pride in order conceived as a fort in a ruder and more violent age it had taken on with the maturity of its foliage and the replacement of its muddy lanes with cobblestone the aspect of an old ivy league campus an un ironic flag flew above it at the end of a high mast red white blue rippling in the wind unashamed it had a passionate nineteenth century feel to it it was somehow an encomium of manifest destiny built on a little chunk of land that was almost an independent duchy of the united states marine corps stuck a mile and a half from and on the same hill as the capitol where the unruly processes of democracy were currently being strained to the utmost now on a particularly hot bright april day under that beating sun young men drilled or loafed as the authorities permitted in the shade at the corner of troop walk and the south arcade seven menboys actuallysquatted and smoked they wore the uniform called undressed blues which consisted of blue trousers a tan gabardine shortsleeved shirt open at the neck and white hatcover as the corps called hatspulled low over their eyes the only oddity in their appearance which to the casual eye separated them from other marines was their oxfords which were not merely shined but spitshined and gleamed dazzlingly the spit shine was a fetish in their culture now the young marines were on a break and naturally pfc crowe the team comedian was explaining the nature of things see he explained to his audience as he sucked on a marlboro itll look great on a resume i tell em i was in this elite unit i needed a topsecret security clearance we trained and rehearsed for our missions and then when we went on them in the hot sweltering weather men dropped all around me but i kept going goddammit i was a hero a goddamn hero of course what i dont tell them is im talking about parades he was rewarded with appropriate blasts of laughter from his cohorts who regarded him as an amusing and generally harmless character he had an uncle who was a congressmans chief fundraiser which accounted for his presence in company b the bodybearer company as opposed to more rigorous and dangerous duties in wes pac as the orders always called it or what the young marines had termed the land of bad things he had no overwhelming desire to go to the republic of south vietnam indeed in all of second casket team only one of the seven had seen service in rsvn this was the noncommissioned officer in charge corporal donny fenn twentytwo of ajo arizona donny a large and almost freakishly handsome blond kid with a year of college behind him had spent seven months in another b company bravo attached to the iii marine amphibious force in operations near and around an hoa in i corps he had been shot at many times and hit once in the lungs for which he was hospitalized for six months he also had something called uh he would mumble uh bmzstr and not look you in the eye but now donny was short that is he had just under thirteen months left to serve and by rumor at any rate that meant the corps would not in its infinite wisdom ship him back to the land of bad things this was not because the corps loved his young ass no it was because the tour of duty in nam was thirteen calendar months and if you sent anyone over with less than thirteen calendar months it hopelessly muddied the tidiness of the records so upsetting to the analretentive minds of personnel clerks so for all intents and purposes donny had made it safely through the central conflict of his age all right he said checking his watch as its second hand hurtled toward to signify the end of break put em out and strip em put the filters in your pockets that is if youre a faggot who smokes filtered cigarettes if i see any butts out here ill pt your asses until morning muster the troops grunted but obeyed of course they knew he didnt mean it like them he was no lifer like them hed go back to the world so as would any listless group of young men in so pitiless an institution as the marine corps they got with the program with something less than total enthusiasm it was another day at eighth and i another day of operations on the parade deck when they werent on alert or serving cemetery duty up at odark an hour of pt at morning muster at chow at and by the beginning of long sometimes endless hours of drill either of the funeral variety or of the riotcontrol variety then the duty day was done those who had assignments did them and otherwise the boys could secure the married could live off base with wives many of the unmarried shared unofficial cheap places available on capitol hill or lounge about playing pool drinking in the enlisted mens bar or going to the movies on the washington px circuit or even trying their luck with women in the bars of capitol hill but the luck was always bad a source of much bitterness this was only partially because marines were thought of as baby killers the real reason was hair it was in the outside world the era of hair men wore their locks long and puffed up usually overwhelming their ears in the process the poor jarheadsand all the ceremonial troopers of the military district of washingtonwere expected to be acolytes to the temple of military discipline thus they offered nearly naked skulls to the worldwhite sidewalls it was calledexcept for a permitted patch no more than threequarters of an inch up top their ears stood out like radar bowls some of them looked like howdy doody and no selfrespecting hippie chick would deign spit at them and since all american girls had become hippie chicks they were in crowes memorable term shit out of luck gloves on donny commanded and his men as they rose pulled on their white gloves donny started them through another long fifty minutes of casket drill as body bearers all were on the husky side as body bearers none could make a mistake it seemed meaningless but a fewdonny for oneunderstood that they did in fact have an important job to anesthetize the pain of death with stultifying ritual they had to hide the actual factthere was a boy in the box going into the ground of arlington national cemetery forever years before his time and to what endwith pomp and precision and donny though an easygoing guy in most respects was determined that in this one aspect they would be the best so the team turned to under his guidance and soft but forcefully uttered commands they walked through the precisely choreographed steps by which a flagdraped box of boy was smartly removed from the hearse which in the rehearsal was only a steel rack aligned by its bearers carried with utter calm dignity to the grave site laid upon a bier next came the tricky flag folding the flag was snapped off the box by six pairs of disciplined hands and beginning with the man at the boot of the casket broken into a triangle which grew thicker with each rigid fold as it passed from man to man if the folding went right what was finally deposited in corporal fenns hands was a per feet triangle a tricorn festooned on either side with stars with no red stripe showing anywhere this was not easy and it took weeks for a good team to get it right and even longer to break in a new guy at this point corporal fenn took the triangle of stars marched with stiff precision to the seated mother or father or whoever and in his white gloves presented it to her an odd moment always some recipients were too stunned to respond some were too shattered to notice some were awkward some even a little star struck for a marine as goodlooking as donny with a chestful of medals hanging heavily from his dress tunic his hair gone his hat as white as his gloves his dignity impenetrable his theater craft immaculate is indeed an awesome sightalmost like a movie starand that charisma frequently cut through the grief of the moment one broken mom even took his picture with an instamatic as he approached but on this runthrough the corporal was not pleased with the performance of his squad of course it was pfc crowe not the best man on the team all right crowe he said after the sweatsoaked boys had stood down from the ritual i saw you you were out of step on the walkto and you were half a beat behind on the left faceout of the wagon ah said crowe searching for a quip to memorialize the moment my damn knee its the junk i picked up at khe sahn this did bring a chuckle for as close as crowe had come to khe sahn was reading about it in the new haven register i forgot you were such a hero donny said so only drop and give me twentyfive not fifty out of commemoration for your great sacrifice crowe muttered darkly but harmlessly and the other team members drew back to give him room to perform his absolution he peeled off his gloves dropped to the prone and banged out twentyfive marineregulation pushups the last six were somewhat sloppy excellent said donny maybe youre not a girl after all all right lets but at this moment the company commanders orderly the bespectacled pfc welch suddenly appeared at donnys right shoulder hey corporal he whispered co wants to see you shit thought donny what the hell have i done now ohhh somebody sang somebodys in trouble hey donny maybe theyre going to give you another medal its his hollywood contract its finally come you know what its about asked donny of welch who was a prime source of scuttlebutt no idea some navy guys thats all i know its asap though im on my way bascombe you take over another twenty minutes focus on the faceout of the hearse that seems to have crowe so baffled then take em to chow ill catch up when i can yes corporal donny straightened his starched shirt adjusted the gig line wondered if he had time to change shirts decided he didnt and took off he headed across the parade deck passing among other drilling marines the show boats of company a the silent drill rifle team were going through their elaborate pantomime the color guard people were mastering the intricacies of flag work another platoon had moved on to riot control and was stomping furiously down troop walk bent double under combat gear donny reached center walk turned and headed into the barracks proper only crossing paths with half a dozen officers in the salutecrazed corps and having to toss up a stiff right hand for their response he entered the building turned right and went through the open hatch marine for door and down the hall it was dark and the gleamy swirls of good buffer work on the wax of the linoleum shone up at him along the green government bulkheads were photos of various marine activities supplied by an aggressive public information office for morale purposes at which they utterly failed at last he turned into the door marked commanding officer and under that captain m c dogwood usmc the outer office was empty because pfc welch was still running errands fenn came the call from the inner office in here donny stepped into the office a kind of ghostly crypt to the joint vanities of marine machismo and bureaucratic efficiency to discover the ramrodstiff captain morton dogwood sitting with a slender young man in the summer tans of a lieutenant commander in the navy and an even younger man in an ensigns uniform sir said donny going to attention corporal fenn reporting as ordered sir as he was unarmed he did not salute fenn this is commander bonson and ensign weber said dogwood sirs said donny to the naval officers commander bonson and his associate are from the naval investigative service said dogwood oh shit thought donny the room was dark the shades drawn the captains meager assembly of service medals hung in a frame on the wall behind him as well as an announcement of his degree in international finance from george washington university his desk was shiny and almost clear except for the polished mm howitzer shell that had been cut down to a paper clip cup and was everybodys souvenir from service in rsvn and pictures of a pretty wife and two baby girls sit down fenn said bonson not looking up from documents he was studying which as donny saw were his own jacket or personnel records aye aye sir said donny he found a chair and set himself into it stiffly facing the three men who seemed to hold his destiny in their hands outside the shouts of drill came through the windows outside it was bright and hot and the day was filled with duty donny felt in murky waters here what the hell was this all about good record said bonson excellent job in country good record here in the barracks your hitch is up when fenn sir may seventytwo hate to see you leave fenn the corps needs good men like you yes sir said donny wondering if this was someno no it couldnt be a recruiting pitch nis was the navy and the corpss own tinny version of the fbi they investigated they didnt recruit im engaged to be married ive already been accepted back at the university of arizona what will you study asked the commander sir prelaw i think you know fenn youll probably get out a corporal rank is hard to come by in the corps because its so small and there just arent the positions available no matter the talent and the commitment yes sir said donny only about eight percent of fouryear enlistees come out higher than corporal that is as a sergeant or higher yes sir fenn think how it would help your law career if you made sergeant youd be one of an incredibly small number of men to do so youd truly be in an elite ah donny hardly knew what to say the officers have a tremendous opportunity for you fenn said captain dogwood youd do well to hear them out yes sir said donny corporal fenn we have a leak a bad leak we want you to plug it a leak sir said donny yes you know we have sources into most of the major peace groups and youve heard rumors that on may day theyre going to try to shut the city down and bring the war to a halt by destroying the head of the machine rumors like that flew through the air the weather underground the black panthers snicc they were going to close down washington levitate the pentagon or bury it in rose petals break into the armories and lead armed insurrection it just meant that bravo company was always on alert status and nobody could get any serious liberty time ive heard his girlfriend was headed in for the may day weekend it would be great to see her if he wasnt stuck on alert or worse sleeping under a desk in some building near the white house well its true may day the communist holiday they have the biggest mobilization of the war planned they really mean to close us down and keep us closed down yes sir our job is simple said lieutenant commander bonson its to stop them such determination in the mans voice even a little tremble his eyes seemed to burn with oldfashioned iwo jimastyle zeal at the same time donny couldnt help notice the lack of an rsvn service ribbon on the khaki of his chest remember november asked bonson yes sir said donny and indeed he did it stuck in his mind not the whole thing really but one ludicrous moment it was late near midnight in the american soul and the marines of bravo in full combat gear were filing into the treasury building adjacent to the white house for protective duties against the possibilities of the next morning in a city where angry kids had camped on the mall a bonedry moon shone above the weather was crisp but not yet brutal the marines debarked from their trucks holding their ms at the high port bayonets fixed but still wearing their metal scabbards as donny led his men downward toward the entrance his eye was caught by light and he looked up the abutment at the end of the ramp was brick and being situated between the ohsowhite white house on the left and the ohsodark treasury on the right yielded a perspective on pennsylvania avenue where the architects of the crusade for peace had organized a silent candlelight vigil so one line of young americans carried rifles into a government building under tin pots and thirtyfive pounds of gear while twentyodd feet above them at a perfect right angle another line of young americans filed along the deserted street cupping candles the light of which weirdly illuminated and flickered on their tender faces donnys epiphany came at that moment no matter what the fiery lifers said or the screaminghead peaceniks both groups of americans were pretty much the same yes sir said donny i remember were you aware corporal that radical elements anticipated the movements of only one military unit company b of marine barracks and that just by the hairiest of coincidences did a washington policeman discover a bomb that was set to take out the phone junction into the treasury thereby effectively cutting off b company and leaving the white house and the president defenseless think of it corporal defenseless he seemed to get a weird charge out of saying defenseless his nostrils flaring his eyes lit up donny had no idea what to say he hadnt heard a thing about a bomb in a phone junction how did they know you were there how did they know thats where youd be demanded the lieutenant commander it occurred to donny there are two buildings next to the white house one is the executive office building one is the treasury if you were going to move troops in wouldnt you move them into one of the two buildings where else could they be i dont he stammered and almost ended his career right there by blowing up in a big laugh thats when my team began to investigate thats when nis got on the case proclaimed the lieutenant commander yes sir weve run exhaustive background checks on everyone in the three line companies at the marine barracks and we think weve found our man donny was dumbfounded then he began to get pissed sir i thought we were already investigated for clearances before we came into the unit yes but its a sloppy process one investigator handles a hundred clearances a week things get through now let me ask you something what would you say if i told you one member of your company had an illegal offbase apartment and was known to room with members of a wellknown peace initiative i dont know sir this pfc edgar m crowe crowe of course it would be crowe ensign weber spoke up reading from documents crowe maintains an apartment at c street southwest there he cohabits a room with one jeffrey goldenberg a graduate student at the northwestern university medin newsroom in washington crowe is no ordinary grunt you know fenn hes a yale dropout who only came into the corps because his uncle had connections to a congressman who could make certain hed never go to vietnam think of that fenn said commander bonson youre over there getting your butt shot off and hes back here marching in parades and giving up intelligence to the peace freaks crowe of course perpetual fuckup smart guy goofoff his furious intelligence hidden behind a burning ambition to be just good enough not to get rotated out but not really good in the larger sense still crowe he was a punk an unformed boy he seemed no different than any of them he was a kid just out of his teens mixed up by the temptations and confusions of a tempting confusing age we know you fenn said the lieutenant commander youre the only man in the company who enjoys the universal respect of both the careertrack marines whove done vietnam and the boys who are just here to avoid vietnam they all like you so we have an assignment for you if you bring it off and i know in my military mind that theres no possibility you wont you will finish your hitch in twelve days a full e buck sergeant in the united states marine corps that i guarantee you donny nodded he didnt like this a bit i want you to become crowes new best friend youre his buddy his pal his father confessor flatter him with the totality of your attentions hang out with him go to his peace creep parties get to know his longhaired friends get drunk with him hell tell you things a little at first then more as time goes on hell give up all his secrets hes probably so proud of himself and his little game hes dying to brag about it and show you what a smart boy he is get us enough material to move against him before he gives up the unit on may day well send him to portsmouth for a very long time hell come out an old man bonson sat back there it was before donny what was most palpable was what had not been said suppose he didnt do it what would happen to him where would they send him i dont reallysir im not trained in intelligence work im not sure i could bring this off fenn is a very straightforward marine said captain dogwood hes a hardworking gungho young man hes not a spy donny could see that the captains interjection deeply irritated lieutenant commander bonson but bonson said nothing just stared furiously at donny in the dark office you have two weeks he finally said well be monitoring you and expect a sitrep every other day theres a lot at stake a lot of people counting on you theres the honor of the service and duty to country to consider donny swallowed and hated himself for it you know you have it pretty good here yourself said bonson to donnys silence you have a room in the barracks not in the squad bay a very pleasant duty station a very pleasant duty day youre in washington dc its spring youre going back to college a decorated hero with all those veterans benefits plus a bronze star and a nice chunk of rank id say few young men in america have it quite as made as you yes sir said donny what the commander is saying said ensign weber is that it can all go away in a flash orders can be cut you could be back slogging the paddies in vietnam the shit flying all around you its been known to happen a guy so short suddenly finds himself in extremely hazardous duty well you know the stories he had a day to go and he got zapped letters to his mother stories in the paper the horror of it all the worst luck in the world poor guy but sometimes thats the way it goes more silence in the room donny did not want to go back to vietnam he had done his time there hed gotten hit he remembered the fear he felt the sheer immense lungcrushing density of it the first time incoming began exploding the world around him he hated the squalor the waste the sheer murder of it he hated having his real life so close and then taken from him he hated the prospect of not seeing julie ever ever again he thought of some peace nerd comforting her after he was gone and knew how that one would play out almost imperceptibly he nodded great said bonson youve made the right decision chapter two he stood outside feeling idiotic rock music pumped out from inside inside it was loud bright crowded festive he felt so stupid he turned there was ensign weber in the ford parked across the way on c street weber nodded encouragingly gave a little whisking motion with his head as if to say go on get going goddammit so now donny stood outside the hawk and dove a wellknown capitol hill watering hole where the young men and women who ran opposed or chronicled the war tended to gather after six when official washington closed down except for the few old men in isolated offices waiting for the latest news on the air strikes or casualty figures it was a beautiful night temperate and soothing donny was dressed in cutoffs jack purcells a madras shirt just like half the kids whod entered the place since hed been standing there except that unlike them his ears stood out and his head wore only a little topside platter of hair it said jar head all the way but it was the hawk and dove where pfc crowe was known to hang and so it was at the hawk and dove he had been deposited christ donny thought again looking back to weber and getting another of the whisking motions with the head he turned and plunged inside the place as expected was dark and close and jammed rock music pummeled against the walls it sounded like buffalo springfield theres a man with a gun over there what it is aint exactly clearsomething like that vaguely familiar to donny everybody was smoking and cruising there seemed to be a sense of sex in the air as people eyed one another in the darkness the pretty young girls from the hill the slim young men from the hill nearly all the guys had big puffs of hair but now and then he spied the whitewalls or at least the very short haired look of the military yet there wasnt much tension it was as if everybody just put it aside left it outside for a generous helping of tribal bonding the young not having to show anything at all in here to the murderous controlling old donny squeezed to the bar ordered a bud forked over a buck and remembered keep all your receipts you can expense this our office will pick it up but nothing hard bonson will fucking freak if you start chugging pinch ive never even tasted pinch donny had replied maybe tonights the night thats a big negative said weber donny sipped his beer beside him a guy was in the middle of a bitter fight with a girl it was one of those quiet muttered things but very intense the boy kept saying under his breath you idiot you unbelievable idiot how could you let him him how could you let him you idiot the girl merely stared ahead and smoked the time passed his instructions were clear he was not to approach crowe that would be a mistake sooner or later crowe would see him crowe would approach him and then it would go where it would go if he threw himself at crowe the whole damned thing would fall apart donny had another beer checked his watch he scoped the action there were some attractive chicks but none as cool as julie the girl to whom he was engaged man he smiled i still got the best it was the football herocheerleader thing but not really yes he was a football hero yes she was a cheerleader but he didnt really like football and she didnt really like cheerleading they actually were sort of forced together as boyfriend and girlfriend by peer pressure at pima county high school found they didnt really like each other very much and broke up once they broke up and started hanging out with other people they missed each other one night they went on a double date he with peggy martin julies best friend and she with mike willis his best friend and that was the night they really connected junior year the war was far away then happening on tv firefights in places like bien hoa and i drang that he had never heard of the napalm floating off the phantoms and wobbling downward to blossom in a huge smear of tumbling fire across the jungle canopy it meant nothing donny and julie went everywhere that year they were inseparable it was he thought the best summer of his life but senior year was better when hed led the southwest counties league in yardage averaging close to two hundred a game he was big and fast julie was so beautiful but she was nice somehow she was so nice she was good was the only word he could think of and it was so lame jesus christ donny felt a hand on his shoulder as the words exploded into his ear he turned what the hell are you doing here of course it was crowe in jeans and a work shirt looking very proletariat he hadwhere the hell did he get thata camouflaged boonie cap on to disguise his hairless ness he held a beer in his hand and was with three other young men who looked exactly like him except their hair was real and long they looked like three jesuses crowe said donny i didnt know this was your kind of place said crowe its a place they have beer what the fuck else would i need donny said this is my corporal crowe said to his pals hes a genuine usmc hero hes actually killed guys but hes a good guy he only made me drop for twentyfive today instead of fifty crowe if youd learn your shit you wouldnt have to drop for any but then id be collaborating oh i see fucking up funerals is part of your guerrilla war on the grieving mothers of america no no im only joking but the funny thing is i cant tell my left from my right i really cant its port and starboard in the marine corps said donny i dont know them either well anyway you want to join us tell these guys about nam oh they dont want to hear no really one of the other kids said man it must be fucking hairy over there he won a bronze star said crowe with a surprising measure of pride he was a hero i was lucky as shit not to get wasted donny said no no war stories sorry look were going to a party we know this guy hes having a big party you want to come corporal crowe call me donny off duty and youre ed eddie and donny thats it come on donny chicks everywhere its over on c right near the supreme court this guy is a clerk he knew my big brother at harvard more pussy in one place than you ever saw you should come donny said one of the boys donny could tell that the hero thing had cut through politics and somehow impressed these warhaters who just a few years back had been worshiping john wayne im engaged donny said you can look cant you shell let you look wont she i suppose said donny but i dont want any ho chi minh shit ho chi minh tried to kill my ass hes no hero of mine it wont be like that crowe promised trig will like him one of the boys said trig will turn him into a peacenik said the other so whos trig said donny it was a short walk and as soon as they were outside one of the boys pulled out a joint and lit up the thing was routinely passed around until it came to donny who hesitated for a moment then took a toke holding it fighting the fire hed had quite the habit for a few months in nam but had broken it now the familiar sweetness rushed into his lungs and his head began to buzz the world seem to come aglow with possibility he exhaled his lungful enough he thought i dont need more of that shit capitol hill had the sense of a small town in iowa under leafy trees that rustled in the night breeze then through a break in the trees he suddenly saw the capitol its huge white dome arclit and blazing in the night they sacrifice virgins in there one of the boys said to the gods of war every night you can hear them scream maybe it was the grass but donny had to smile they did sacrifice virgins but not in there they sacrificed them ten thousand miles away in buffalo shitwater rice paddies donny said crowe can you call in artillery we have to destroy the place to save it again maybe it was the grass ah shotgunzuluthree he improvised i have a fire mission for you map grid fourninersix sixfivefour at alpha sevenohtwofive we are hot with beaucoup bad guys request hotel echo fire for effect please cool one of the kids said whats hotel echo high explosive said donny as opposed to frags or white phosphorous cool as shit the boy responded music announced the site of the party far earlier than any visual confirmation as at the hawk and dove it blasted out into the night hard psychedelic rock beating the dark back and the devil away hed heard the same stuff over there though that was the funny thing the young marines loved the rock it went everywhere with them and if their tough noncoms hadnt stayed on their asses theyd have played it on ambush patrols i wonder if trig is here one of the boys said you never can tell with trig crowe replied whos trig donny asked again the party didnt seem at all unlike any other party donny had attended back at the university of arizona except that the hair was longer milling people of all sorts the bar scene though crammed into smaller hotter rooms the smell of grass sickly sweet heavy in the air ho and che on the walls in the bathroom where donny went to piss even an nva flag though one manufactured in schenectady not downtown haiphong he had a rogue impulse to burn it but that would sure blow the gig now and really it was only a flag the kids were his own age some younger with a few middleaged men hanging around with that intense longhaired look that the dc crowd so liked judging from the hair only he and crowe represented the united states marines though crowe was far from an ambassador he was telling some people a familiar story of how he almost got out of the draft by playing psycho at his physical im nude he was saying except for this cowboy hat im very polite and everybodys very polite to me at first i do everything they ask me to do i bend and spread i carry my underwear in a little bag i smile and call everybody sir i just wont take off my cowboy hat uh son would you mind taking off that hat i cant i explain ill die if i take off my cowboy hat see the key is to stay polite if you act nuts they know youre faking pretty soon they got majors and generals and colonels and all screaming at me to take off my cowboy hat im nude in this little room with all these guys but i will not take off my cowboy hat what a fuckin hero i am what a john wayne theyre screaming and im just saying if i take off my cowboy hat ill die so you werent drafted well they kicked me out it took weeks for the paperwork to catch up and by that time my uncle had cut a deal with the man to get me into a slot in the marines that wouldnt rotate to the nam you know when this is over all those charges will be dropped nobody will care well write the whole thing off thats why anybody who lets themselves get wasted is a total moron like for what good question donny wondered for what he tried to remember the boys in his platoon in bravo whod gotten zapped in his seven months with them it was hard and who did you count did you count the guy who got hit by an army truck in saigon maybe his number was up maybe he would have gotten hit back on the street corner in sheboygan would you count him donny didnt know but you definitely had to count the kidwhat was his name what was his namewho stepped on a betty and got his chest shredded that was the first one donny remembered he was such a new dick then the guy just lay back so much blood people gathered around him exactly in the way you werent supposed to and he seemed remarkably calm before he died but nobody read any letter home to mom afterward in which he told everybody how great the platoon was and how they were fighting for democracy they just zipped him up and left him he remembered the face not the name a sort of porky kid pancakey face small eyes didnt have to shave what was his name another one got hit by a rifle bullet he screamed and bucked and yelled and nobody could quiet him he seemed so indignant it was so unfair well it was unfair why me he seemed to be asking his friends why not you he was thin and rangy from spokane didnt talk much always kept his rifle clean was bowlegged what was his name donny didnt remember there were a few more but nothing much donny hadnt fought in any big battles or taken part in any big operations with dramatic code names that made the news mostly it was walking scared every day youd get jumped or youd trip something off or youd just collapse under the weight of it so much of it was boring so much of it was dirty so much of it was debasing he didnt want to go back he knew that man if you let them send you back at this late date when units were being rotated back to the world all the time during vietnamization and you got wasted you were a moron suddenly someone bumped him hard oh sorry he said stepping back yeah you are someone said where had this action come from there were three of them but big like he was hair pouring from their heads bright bands around their skulls dressed in faded jeans and army fatigue shirts youre the marine asshole right the lifer i am a marine he said and im probably an asshole but im not a lifer the three fixed him with unsteady glares their eyes burned with hate one of them rocked a little the team leader with his fist wrapped tightly around the neck of a bottle of gin he held it like a weapon yeah my brother came back in a little sack because of lifer fucks like you he said im very sorry for your brother said donny asshole lifer got him greased so he could make lieutenant colonel shit like that happens some joker wants a stripe so he sends his guys up the hill he gets the stripe and they get the plastic bag yeah but it happens mainly cause assholes like you let it happen cause you dont have the fuckin guts to say no to the man if you had the guts to say no the whole thing stops did you say no to the man i didnt have to the boy said proudly i was y i was out of it donny thought about explaining that it didnt matter what your classification was if you obeyed it you were obeying orders and working for the man some guys just got better orders than others but then the boy took a step toward donny his face drunkenly pugnacious he gripped the bottle even harder hey i didnt come here to fight said donny i just drifted in with some guys he looked around to find himself in the center of a circle of staring kids even the music had stopped and the smoke had ceased seething in the air crowe had of course totally disappeared well you drifted into the wrong fucking party man said the boy and made as if to take another step as donny tried to figure out whether to pop him or to cut and run to avoid the hassle but suddenly another figure dipped between them whoa he said my brothers my brothers lets not lose our holy cools hes a fucking said the aggressor hes another kid you cant blame the whole thing on him any more than you can blame it on anyone its the system dont you get that jesus dont you get anythingf yeah well you have to start somewhere jerry you cool out go smoke a joint or something man im not letting any three guys with booze bottles jump any poor grunt who came by looking to get laid trig i but this trig laid a hand on jerrys chest and fixed him with a glare hot enough to melt most things on earth and jerry stepped back swallowed and looked at his pals fuck it he finally said we were splitting anyhow and the three of them turned and stormed out suddenly the music started againstones satisfactionand the party came back to life hey thanks said donny the last thing i need is a fight thats okay said his new friend im trig carter by the way he put out a hand trig had one of those long grave faces where the bones showed through the tight skin and the eyes seemed to be both moist and hot at the same moment he really looked a lot like jesus in a movie there was something radiant in the way he fixed you with his eyes he had something rare immediate likability howdy donny said surprised the grip was so strong in a man so thin my names fenn donny fenn i know youre crowes secret hero the bravo oh christ i cant be a hero to him im in it till my hitch ends then im gone forever back to the land of the cacti and the navajo ive been there mourning doves right little white birds dart through the arroyos and the brush really hard to spot really fast oh yeah said donny my dad and i used to hunt them youve got to use a real light shot you know an eight or a nine even then its a tough shot sounds like fun said trig but in my case i dont shoot em with a gun but with a camera then i paint them paint them this made no sense to donny you know trig said pictures im actually an avian painter really ive traveled the world painting pictures of birds wow said donny does it pay a little i illustrated my uncles book hes roger prentiss fuller birds of north america the yale zoologist er cant say i heard of him he was a hunter once he went on safari in the early fifties with elmer keith this did impress donny keith was a famous idaho shooter who wrote books like elmer keiths book of the sixgun and elmer keith on big game rifles wow he said elmer keith roger says keith was a tiny bitter little man he had a terrible burn as a kid and he was always compensating for it they had a falling out elmer just wanted to shoot and shoot he couldnt see any sense to a limit roger doesnt shoot anymore well after nam i dont think i will either donny said you sound okay for a marine donny crowe was right about you maybe youll join us when you get out he smiled his eyes lighting like a movie stars well donny said provisionally himself a peacenik smoking dope long hair carrying those cards chanting hell no we wont go he laughed at the notion trig when did you get here it was crowe and his crowd now with girls in tow all leading what seemed to be a kind of electric ripple toward trig and in seconds trig was gone borne away on currents of some sort of celebrity hood that donny didnt understand he turned to a girl standing nearby hey excuse me he said who is this trig she looked at him in astonishment man what planet are you from she demanded then ran after trig her eyes beaming love chapter three hp rig carter commander bonson exclaimed j yeah that was it i couldnt quite remember the last name said donny who could remember the name very well but couldnt quite bring himself to say it out loud seemed like a very nice guy bonsons office was an undistinguished chamber in a world war iiera tempo still standing in the washington navy yard about a half mile from eighth and i where by dim pretext donny had been sent the next day for his debriefing on his first day as spy hunter you saw trig carter and crowe together is that right why did donny feel so sleazy about all this he felt clammy as if someone were listening he looked around president nixon glowered down at him from the wall enjoining him to do his duty for god and country a degree from the university of new hampshire added to the solemnity of the occasion a few ceremonial photos of lieutenant commander bonson with various dignitaries completed the decor the room was otherwise completely bereft of personality or even much sense of human occupation it was preternaturally neat even the paper clips in the little plastic box had been stacked not dumped lieutenant commander bonson bent forward fixing donny in his dark glare he was a thin dark man with a lot of whiskery shadow on his face and a sense of complete focus there was something pilgrim like about him he should have been in a pulpit denouncing miniskirts and the beatles yes sir donny finally said the two of them and about one hundred other people where was this again a party uh on c street on the hill i didnt get the address threefortyfive c southeast said ensign weber did you check it out weber yes sir its the home of one james k phillips a clerk to justice douglas and a homosexual according to the fbi were most of the people there homosexuals fenn was it a homo thing donny didnt know what to say it just seemed like a party in washington like any party in washington with a lot of young people some grass some beer music and fun and hope in the air i wouldnt know sir bonson sat back considering the homosexual thing seemed to hang in his mind clouding it for a time but then he was back on the track so you saw them together well sir not together really in the same crowd they knew each other that was clear but it didnt seem anything out of the ordinary could crowe have given him any deployment intelligence donny almost laughed but bonson was so set in his glare that he knew to release the pressure he felt building in his chest would have been a big mistake i dont think so he said not that i saw i mean does crowe have any deployment intelligence i dont how would he but bonson didnt answer he turned to weber weve got to get closer he said weve got to get him inside the cell trig carter imagine that a wire sir could we wire him asked weber oh christ thought donny im really not going anywhere with a tape recorder taped to my belly no not unless we could get time to set it up quickly hes got to stay fluid flexible quick on his feet the wire wont work not under these circumstances it was just a suggestion sir said weber well fenn said bonson youve made a fine start but too many times we see fast starters are slow finishers youve got to really press now youve got to make crowe your pal your friend do you see hes got to trust you thats how youll crack this thing trig carter weber isnt that the damndest thing you ever heard sir if i may ask who is trig carter show him weber weber looked into a file and slid something over to donny donny recognized it at once hed seen it a thousand times probably without really noticing it it was just part of the livingroom imagery of the war the scenes that were unforgettable it was a cover of time magazine late in the hot summer of chicago the democratic national convention the police riot outside on the last night there was trig in shirtsleeves a gush of blood cascading down from an ugly welt in his short neat hair he was bent under the weight of another kid he was carrying out of the fog of tear gas and the blurs that were chicago policemen pounding anything that could be pounded trig looked impossibly noble and heroic impossibly courageous his eyes were screwed up in the pain of the cs gas he was bloody and sweaty and the veins on his neck stood out from all the effort he had invested in carrying the dazed bloody traumatized boy out of the zone of violence he looked like any of a dozen insanely heroic corpsmen donny had seen pull the same thing off amid not cops but tracer fire and grenades and bettys over in the land of bad things none of whose pictures had ever ended up on the cover of time magazine the spirit of resistance said the cover hes their lancelot said weber was beaten up in selma by the alabama state police got his picture on the cover of time in sixtyeight at the convention hes been everywhere in the movement since then one of the early peace freaks a rich kid from an old maryland family just came back from a year in england studying drawing at oxford harvard grad some kind of painter isnt that it avian painter sir thats what he told me yes birds loves birds very odd said bonson very smart boy continued weber but then that seems to be the profile it was the profile in england too the smart ones they can figure everything out see through everything theyll be the elite after the revolution anyhow hes big in the peoples coalition for peace and justice a kind of glamorous roving ambassador and organizer lives here in dc but works the campus circuit goes where the action is the fbis been monitoring him for years hed be exactly the kind of man whod get to crowe and turn him into a spy hed be perfect hes exactly who were looking for fenn i cant emphasize this enough youve got less than two weeks until the big raft of may day demonstrations is set crowe will be pressed to uncover deployment intelligence carter will be on him for results youve got to monitor them very carefully if you cant get tape or photos you may have to testify in open court against them donny felt a cold stone drop in his stomach he saw an image himself on the stand putting the collar on poor crowe it made him sick i know youll make a fine witness bonson was saying so begin to discipline your mind remember details events chronologies you might write a coded journal so you can recall things remember exact sentences get in the habit of making a time check every few minutes if you dont want to take notes imagine taking notes because that can fix things in your mind this is very important work do you understand ah doubts do i see doubts you cannot doubt bonson leaned forward until he and he alone filled the world just as you could have no doubters in a rifle platoon you can have no doubters on a counter intelligence mission you have to be on the team committed to the team the doubts erode your discipline cloud your judgment destroy your memory fenn no doubts thats the kind of rigor i need from you yes sir said donny hating himself as the worlds entire melancholy weight settled on his strong young shoulders crowe was particularly derelict that afternoon in riot control drill its so hot donny the mask cant we pretend were wearing our masks crowe if you have to do it for real youll want to be wearing a mask because otherwise the cs will make you a crybaby in a second put the mask on with the other guys muttering darkly crowe slid the mask over his head then clapped his twopound camouflaged steel pot over his skull squad on my command form up shouted donny watching as his casket team plus assorted others from bravo company assigned riot duty in third squad formed a line they looked like an insect army their eyes hidden behind the plastic lenses of the masks their faces made insectoid and ominous by the mandible like filter can all in marine green with their gear their pistols their ms held at the high port squad fix bayonets and the rifle butts slammed into the ground the blades were drawn from their scabbards and in a single clanking machinelike click locked onto the weapon muzzles except one crowes bayonet skittered away he had dropped it crowe you idiot give me fifty of the finest crowe was silenced by his clammy mask but his body posture radiated sullen anger he fell from the formation at ease said donny the squad relaxed one corporal two corporal three corporal crowe narrated through the mask as he banged out the pushups donny let him go to fifteen then said all right crowe back in line asap lets try it again crowe shot him a bitter look as he regathered his gear and rejoined the line donny took them through it again it was an extremely hot day and the darkness of his mood was such that he worked the men hard breaking them down into standard line formation flank marching them into an arrowhead riot element counting cadence to govern their approach to the imagined riot wheeling them left and right getting them to fix and unfix bayonets over and over again he worked them straight through a break as great wet patches discolored their utilities until finally the platoon sergeant came over and said all right corporal you can give them a break yes sergeant yelled donny and even the sergeant a shittogether but fairly decent lifer named ray case gave him a look fall out smoke em if you got em if you dont got em borrow em if you cant borrow em then get outta town because your buddies cant stand you then instead of mingling with the silently furious sweating men he himself walked over to the shade of the barracks and declared himself offlimits let em grouse but soon crowe detached himself and came over cheekily enough secretly irritating donny man you really put me through it i put the squad through it crowe not you we may have to do this shit for real next weekend oh shit none of those guys is going to march with bayonets into a bunch of kids with flowers in their hair where the girls are showing their tits well just hang here or go sit in some fucking building like the last time what you figure the treasury again donny let the question simmer in his mind a bit then he said crowe i dont know i just go where they tell me donny i got it straight from trig theyre not even coming into dc the whole things going to the pentagon let the army handle it we wont even leave the barracks if you say so i thought we were crowe i had fun last night but out here in the daylight im still the corporal and squad leader youre still a pfc so you still play by my rules dont ever call me donny in front of the men while were on drill okay okay okay im sorry anyhow some of us were going to trigs tonight i thought you might want to come you got to admit hes an interesting guy hes okay for a peacenik trigs not like that he was beat up in selma he was a fucking hero in chicago man they say he went out twentyfive times and dragged kids in from the pigs he saved lives i dont know said donny itll be fun you need to relax more corporal donny actually wished the invitation hadnt come it was his half plan dimly formed just to let his secret assignment peter out go away in vagueness and missed opportunities but here it was big and hairy a chance to do his job trig as it turned out lived off upper wisconsin just above georgetown in a row house that was one in a tatty block of similar dwellings the house was crowded it could be no other way the furniture was threadbare almost ascetic still the stench of grass almost levitated the house and made donnys nostrils flare when he entered everything was familiar but unfamiliar lots of books a wall full of shelved albums classical and jazz though no jimi h or bob d but also no posters no nva flags no commie posters instead birds jesus the guy was a freak for birds some were his own paintings and he had a considerable talent for capturing the glory of a bird in flight all the details perfect all the feathers precisely laid out the colors all the hues of miracle but others were older and darker muted things that appeared to have been painted in another century somehow he found himself talking to a girl about birds and told her that he uh hunted them it wasnt the right thing to say but she was one of those snooty eastern ones who wore her hair long and straight and had a pinched look to her you kill them she said those little things well where im from theyre considered good eating dont you have stores this wasnt going too well this grouping was smaller and more intimate than last nights and everybody seemed to know everybody he felt a little isolated and looked for crowe because even crowe would have been a welcome ally but crowe was nowhere to be seen and on top of that he felt incorrectly dressed he was in chinos and jack purcells plus a madras sport shirt everyone here wore jeans and work shirts had long exotic hair beards and seemed somehow in some kind of indian conspiracy against the ways that he felt it was proper for a young man to dress it made him uncomfortable some spy he thought dont give donny a hard time said someonetrig of course simply appearing dramatically an event for which he had a little gift trig was more moderate today his hair back in a ponytail which he wore over a blue buttondown shirt and like donny a pair of chinos he also had an expensive pair of decoratively perforated oxfords on in some exotic rich color trig he shoots little animals sweetie men have been hunting and eating birds for a million years both the birds and the men are still here i think its strange donny almost blurted no its really fun but held himself in well anyway said trig drawing donny away im glad you could come i dont know who half these guys are myself people just hang out here they drink my beer smoke grass get stoned or laid and move on im hardly here so i really dont care but its cool that you came thanks i didnt have much to do well actually i wanted to talk to you oh well go ahead its crowe you know hes really borderline in the unit and he keeps fucking up i know hes a smart kid but if he gets booted from the company his tour is no longer stabilized and he could go on levy to the nam and i dont think hed look too good in a body bag ill talk to him as he said anyone who gets wasted this late in a lost war is a moron ill mention it cool trig was also cool donny could see how hed be a good man in a firefight and while everybody wept or cowered hed be the one to go out and start bringing the people in from the beatings can i ask you he suddenly said to donny fixing him in one of those deep trig looks do you doubt it do you ever wonder why or if it was worth it or are you foursquare the whole way the whole nine yards fuck no said donny sure of course i doubt it but my father fought in a war and so did his father and i was raised just to see that as a price for living in a great country so so i went i did it i came back for better or worse they had now wandered into the kitchen where trig opened his refrigerator and got a beer out for donny and then took one for himself it was a foreign beer heineken from a dark cold green bottle come on this way well get away from these idiots trig took donny out on a back porch toward two deck chairs donny was surprised to see they were on a little hill and that before him the elevation fell away across the falling roofs in the distance he was surprised to see the huddled buildings of georgetown university looking medieval in profile i forget what real people are like trig said thats why its cool to talk to you nobodys more hypocritical and swinish than the pretty boys and the fairies of the peace movement but i know how important soldiers can be i was in the congo in sixtyfourid gone with my uncle to paint the upper congo swallowtail darter we were in stanleyville when some guy named gbenye declared it a peoples republic and took about one thousand of us hostage and set out to purify the population of its imperialist vermin murder squads were everywhere man i saw some shit what people do to each other so anyhow were in this compound the congolese army is fighting its way closer and the rumor is the rebels are going to kill us all holy shit were going to die and nobody gives a shit about us its that simple but when the door is kicked down it isnt rebels its tattooed tough ass kickbutt belgian paratroopers they were the meanest pricks i ever saw in my life and i loved them like you wouldnt believe nobody would stand against the belgian airborne and they got us out in a convoy all the white people from the interior we would have been butchered so im not one of these assholes who says theres no role for soldiers soldiers saved my life roger that said donny but said trig holding it in the air even if i admire courage and commitment i have to make a distinction between a moral war and an immoral war world war ii moral kill hitler before he kills all the jews kill tojo before he turns all the filipino women into whores korea maybe moral i dont know stop the chinese from turning korea into a province i guess thats moral i would have fought in that one but vietnam not moral i dont know you tell me trig leaned forward another of his little unsung gifts listening he really wanted to know what donny thought and he refused to pigeonhole donny as a baby killer and zippo commando donny could not resist this earnest attention what i saw was good american kids trying to do a job they didnt quite understand what i saw was kids who thought it was like a john wayne movie and got their guts blown out i was in a place once a forest or a former forest all the leaves were gone but the trees still stood only they shined it was like they were covered in ice it reminded me of vermont ive never been to vermont but it reminded me of it just the same i think i know where youre headed i saw the same thing on the convoy out of stanleyville yeah well in this case we called in hotel echo on a stand of trees because we saw movement and thought a unit of gooks was infiltrating through it we got em but good those were their guts they were just pulverized turned to shiny liquid and it plastered the stumps and limbs man i never saw anything like that of course it was a platoon of army engineers twentytwo guys gone just like that hotel echo it wasnt very pretty donny i think you know underneath i can feel you getting there youre working on it my girl is already there shes coming in in this peace caravan deal they got going good for her do you talk about it with her she says she decided shed do her part to stop the war when she visited me in the san diego naval hospital good for her again butare you there donny couldnt lie he had no talent for it no not yet maybe never it just seems wrong you have to do what your country tells you you have to contribute its duty trig was like a confessor his eyes burned with empathy and drew donny forward to reveal more donny i know youd never leave or quit or anything i wouldnt ask you to but consider joining us after you get out i think youll feel much better and i cant begin to tell you how much it would mean to us i hate this idea were all a bunch of chicken shits a guy whos been there won a medal fought dedicating himself to ending it and bringing his buddies home thats powerful stuff id be proud to be a part of that i dont know just think about it talk to me keep in touch thats all just think about it donny my god a voice called and he looked up and saw a dream coming onto the porch to him she was thin blond athletic part tawny cowgirl part perfect american sweetheart and he felt helpless as he always did when he saw her it was julie chapter four whats wrong she said why didnt you call me i did and i wrote you too oh shit can we leave can we go someplace donny i havent seen you since christmasi dont know im here with this pfc from my squad and i sort of promised id uh look after him i cant leave him donny i cant explain it its very complicated he kept looking off back into the house as if he was trying to keep his eye on something look let me go tell crowe im leaving ill be right back well go somewhere he disappeared back inside the house julie stood there in the washington dark on a street above georgetown as the traffic veered along wisconsin pretty soon peter fanis came out peter was a tall bearded graduate student in sociology at the university of arizona the head of the southwest regional peoples coalition for peace and justice and nominal honcho of the group of kids he and julie had shepherded out by peace caravan from tucson wheres your friend hell be back i knew thats what hed be like big handsome square but then donny returned ignoring peter hi its stupid but crowe wants to go to another party and i think i ought to go with him i cant its just ill get in touch with you as soon as but then he turned troubled and before she could say a thing he said oh shit theyre leaving ill get in touch and ran off leaving the girl he loved behind him the next morning waking early in his room in the barracks almost an hour before the alarm donny almost went on sick call it seemed the only sane course the only escape from his troubles but his troubles came looking for him it was a boneyard day he knew his team was up he had stuff to do he skipped breakfast in the chow hall and instead repressed his dress tunic and trousers spent a good thirty minutes spitshining his oxfords this was ritual almost cleansing and purifying you put a gob of spit into the black can of polish and with a scrap of cotton mixed the black paste and the saliva together forming a dense goo then you applied just a little dab to the leather and rubbed and rubbed you should get a genie for your troubles you rubbed so hard you rubbed and rubbed a dab at a time covering the whole shoe and then the other you let it fry into a dense haze then went at it again with another cotton cloth went at it like war snap pitysnap it was a lost military art they said they were going to bring in patent leather next time because the young marines couldnt be trusted to put in the hours but donny was proud of his spit shine carefully nursed through the long months built up over time until his oxfords gleamed vividly in the sun so stupid he now thought so ridiculous so pointless the weather was heavy with the chance of rain and the dogwoods were in full bloom another brutal washington spring day arlingtons gentle hills and valleys full of pink trees and dead boys rolled away from the burial site and beyond like a movie rome the white buildings of the capital of america gleamed even in the gray light donny could see the needle and the dome and the big white house and the weeping lincoln hidden in his portico of marble only jeffersons cute little gazebo was out of sight hidden behind an inoffensive dogwoodand tombcrazed hill the box job was over it had gone all right though everybody was grumpy for some reason even crowe had tried hard that day and thered been no slipup as they took lcpl michael f anderson from the black hearse to the bier to the slowtime march snapped the flag off the box folded it crisply donny handed the tricorn of stars to the grieving widow a pimply girl it was always better not to know a thing about the boy inside had lcpl anderson been a grunt had he been a supply clerk a helicopter crew member a military journalist a corpsman combat engineer had he been shot exploded crushed virused or vdd to death nobody knew he was dead that was all and donny stood at crisp attention the poster marine in his dress blue tunic white trousers and white cover giving a stiff perfect salute to the wetnosed shuddering girl during taps grief is so ugly it is the ugliest thing there is and he had fucking bathed in it for close to eighteen long months now his head ached now it was over the girl had been led away and the marines had marched smartly back to their bus and climbed aboard for a discreet smoke donny now watched to make certain that if they smoked they took their white gloves off for the nicotine could stain them yellow otherwise all complied even crowe you want a cigarette donny i dont smoke you should relaxes you well ill pass he looked at his watch a big seiko on a chainmail strap hed bought at the naval exchange in da nang for and saw that they had another forty minutes to kill before the next job you ought to hang your coats up he told the team but dont go outside unless youre buttoned and shined some asshole major might see you put you on report and off you go to the nam youd be back for the next box job only youd be the one in the box right crowe yes corporal sir crowe barked ironic and snide pretending to be the shave tail gungho lifer he would never even resemble we love our corps dont we crowe we love our corps corporal good man crowe he said donny it was the driver looking back some navy guys here shit thought donny donny are you joining the navy crowe asked you could make fortune giving jelly rolls in the showers of a nuclear sub you could

you give every man on the team a blow job thats an order pfc yes corporal sir said crowe taking a puff on his cigarette donny buttoned his tunic pulled on his cover low over his eyes and stepped outside it was weber in khakis good morning sir said donny saluting good morning corporal said weber would you come over here please yes sir said donny as they got out of earshot of the men in the bus donny said man what the fuck is this all about i thought i was supposed to be undercover this really blows it all right fenn dont get excited tell them were from personnel at the pentagon verifying your rsvn service preparatory to separation very common occurrence no big deal down the way in the rear of a tan government ford lieutenant commander bonson sat behind sunglasses peering ahead donny got in the engine was running and airconditioned chill blasted over him good morning fenn said the commander he was a tightassed scrawny lifer in the backseat sitting ramrod perfect sir fenn im going to arrest crowe today donny sucked a gulp of dry painful air excuse me sir at hours ill show up at the barracks with a plainclothes detachment of nis well incarcerate him at the navy yard brig on what charge security violation naval penal code dod unauthorized possession of classified information also dod b unauthorized transmission or transference of classified information ahon what basis your basis fenn my basis sir your basis but i havent reported anything he went to a couple of parties where they were flying the nva flag half the apartments in washington are hanging the nva flag i see it everywhere you can place him in the presence of a known radical organizer well i can place myself in that same guys presence and i have no information to suggest he was compromising marine security or intelligence i just saw him talking with a guy thats all you can place him in the presence of trig carter do you know yet who trig carter is ah well sir you said tell him weber this is straight from this mornings mdwsecret servicefbi briefing fenn said weber carter is now suspected of being a member of the weather underground hes not merely a peacenik with a placard and some flowers in his hair but hes an extreme radical who may be linked to the weather undergrounds bombing campaign donny was dumbstruck trig dont you see it yet corporal said bonson these two bright boys are hatching up something good and bloody for may day we have to stop them if i collar crowe maybe thatll be enough to save some lives sir i saw nothing that would then get with the fucking program corporal bonson bellowed he leaned forward fixing donny with his murderous glare he seemed to bear a grudge against the known world and was holding donny responsible for all his disappointments for all the women who wouldnt sleep with him for the fraternities that wouldnt pledge him for the schools that wouldnt accept him you think this is some kind of joke dont you corporal its beneath you somehow so youll go along to stay out of nam and just play it cool and cute and rely on your good looks and your charm to drift through you wont get your hands dirty you wont do the job well that stops today you have a

the interview was over you okay im fine donny said you look notcool im cool well a bunch of us were going over to this party in gtown donny i found out about it from trig oh christ donny thought as the solicitous crowe loomed over him in the upstairs barracks room where the offbase men kept their huge gray lockers and were now stripping down after a hot afternoon in the boneyard crowe you know we may be on alert at any time is your riot gear outstanding what about steaming and pressing your tunic washing out your dark socks and spending an hour or two on that spit shine which has begun to look a little dim thats what you ought to be doing yeah well said crowe believe me on this one i know were not going on alert till tomorrow night donny almost pointed out that if you said you didnt have to say night but crowe wasnt stoppable at that point and well just hang around here we may get on trucks and probably on saturday well deploy to a building near the white house but itll be a short deployment all the actions going on across the river the whole point of this one is to converge on the pentagon and close it down trig told me trig told you he told you about the deployment man thats classified why the hell would he know dont ask me trig knows everything he has entree everywhere he probably is having cocktails with j edgar himself right as we speak by the way did you know hoover was a fruit hes a goddamn fruit he hangs out in ys and shit crowe youre not telling trig shit are you i mean it might seem like a joke to you but you could get into deep serious green crap that way man what do i know little eddie crowes just a grunt he knows nothing crowe im not kidding is someone asking about me so wheres this party shouldnt you be trying to find your girl she didnt look too happy when you bailed out on her last night to hang out with us and if i know my horny hippie peace freaks that bearded guy hanging on her shirttails has a serious case of the pleasefuckmes you may have to call in a fire mission on him hotel echo nobodys asking about you cause if they are heres my advice give me up i aint worth shit seriously donny roll over on me in a second if its you or me buddy choose you it would be a shame any other way eddie youre full of shit now wheres this party i need a fucking keg of beer maybe trig can find your girl maybe he can they showered and dressed and signed out with a warning from the duty nco to call in every couple of hours to make sure the company hadnt gone on alert sure enough crowes obedient buddies waited just outside the barracks main gate on eighth street they climbed in the old corvair hey donny cool donny the hero he could hardly remember the names he had a splitting headache he had told a lie direct and flat out nobody is asking about you but goddammit how had crowe known so much why had he asked donny the other day where theyd deploy why was all this bad shit happening anyway and what about julie she was camping in some muddy field with whats his face and he hadnt even really talked to her she hadnt called and left a number either man it was all coming down but when they got there trig came over and greeted them and when crowe told him donnys situation he said it would be no problem sure he said let me make a call he went off and donny sat among a bunch of turnedout georgetown kids dressed like young republicans while crowe in his hairhiding boonie cap worked a girl who didnt work him back presently trig returned okay lets go he said you found her well i found out where the university of arizona kids are camping thats where shed be right right said donny okay ill run you over donny paused was he supposed to be looking after crowe but now hed set this thing up and if he hung with crowe it would look very strange and he was supposed to watch crowe with trig right and if he was with trig then crowe couldnt be giving up any secrets could he great said donny just let me get my book said trig he disappeared for a second then came back with a large really filthylooking sketchbook it had the sense of a treasured relic never go anyplace without this i might see an eastern swallowtail mud lark he laughed at himself showing white teeth outside trig gestured to the inevitable trigmobile a tr bright red its canvas roof down cool wheels said donny hopping in i picked it up a little while ago in england he said i got burned out on peace shit i took a little sabbatical went to london spent some time in oxford the ruskin school of drawing bought this baby you must be loaded oh i think theres money in the family not my father he doesnt make a penny hes in state planning some tiny part of the war the economic infrastructure of the province of quang tri what does your dad do trig asked my dad was a rancher he worked like hell and never made a penny he died poor but he died clean in our family we dont work the money works we play working for something you believe in thats the best thats the maximum charge and if you can have a good time at it man thats really cool donny said nothing but a darkness settled on him he was here as a judas wasnt he hed sell trig out for thirty pieces of silver or rather three stripes and no trip back to the land of bad things he looked over at trig the wind was blowing the slightly older mans hair back lushly like a cape streaming behind a horseman trig wore rayban sunglasses and had one of those high beautiful foreheads he looked like a young god on a good day this guy was weather underground this guy would bomb things blow up people that sort of stuff it didnt seem possible by no reach of his imagination could he see trig as conspiratorial he was too much at the center of things the world had given itself to him too easily and too eagerly could you kill anyone donny asked trig laughed showing white teeth what a question wow ive never been asked that one i killed seven men donny said well if you hadnt have killed them would they have killed you they were trying to so there you have it you made your decision but no no i couldnt i just cant see it for me too much would die id be better off dead myself than having killed anything thats just what i believe ive believed it ever since i looked in a house in stanleyville and saw twentyfive kids cut to pieces i cant even remember if its because they were rebels or government they probably didnt know right then no more killing stop the killing just like the man says all we are saying is give peace a chance well its hard to give it a chance when a guy is whacking away at you with an ak trig laughed you have me there partner he said merrily but then he said sure anybody gets that kind of slack but you wouldnt have shot into that ditch in my lai like those other guys did you would have walked away hot blood cold blood hell youre a cowboy you were trained to shoot in selfdefense you shot morally donny didnt know what to say he just stared ahead glumly until in the falling light they sped through downtown past the big government buildings still shiny in the fading sun along the parklined river and at last reached west potomac park just beyond jeffersons classy monument welcome to the may tribe on one side of the street eight or nine cop cars were parked and dc cops in riot gear watched in sullen knots across the street equally sullen knots of hippie kids in jeans and oversized fatigue coats and long flowing hair watched back it was a staredown nobody was winning trigs presence registered immediately and the kids parted suddenly grinning and trig drove the triumph through them and down an asphalt road that led toward the river some playing fields some trees but it was more like sherwood forest than any college campus the meadows streamed with kids in tents kids at campfires kids stoned playing frisbee singing smoking eating necking bathing topless in the river portapots had been put up everywhere bright blue and smelly its the gathering of the tribes said donny its the gathering of our generation said trig being with trig was like being with mick jagger he knew everybody and at least three or four times he had to stop the triumph and clamber out as proteges came upon him for hugs or advice for gossip or news or just to be with him astonishing thing he remembered everybodys name everybodys he never fumbled he never forgot he never made a mistake he seemed to inflate in the love that was thrust upon him by boy and girl man and woman even some old bearded besandaled radicals who looked as if theyd probably protested world war i too boy they love you donny said ive just been riding this circuit for seven long years you get to know folks i am tired though after this weekend im going to crash at a friends farm out in germantown paint some birds blow some grass just chill you ought to bring julie if shes still here and come out route thirtyfive north of germantown wilson the mailbox says here here i think this is it donny saw her almost immediately she had camouflaged herself in some kind of indian fulllength dress and wore her hair up pinned with a navajo silver brooch he had given it to her it cost him the asshole kid farris was near her though he wasnt talking to her he was just watching her from a ways away utterly mesmerized hi donny called i brought young lochinvar from out of the west trig said oh donny enjoy said trig let me know when you want to get out of here ill go listen to peter farris whine for a while but donny wasnt listening he looked full into the person that was julie and his heart broke all over again every time he saw her was like a first time his breath came in little spurts he felt himself lighting up inside he gave her a hug im sorry i wasnt making much sense last night i couldnt put it together fast enough you know how slow i am donny i called the barracks sometimes those messages get through sometimes they dont i was just all out of joint yesterday whats going on ah its too complicated to explain its nothing i cant handle how are you god sweetie its so good to see you oh im fine this camping stuff i could do without i need a shower wheres the nearest holiday inn when this is all over dont go back he suddenly blurted as if finally seeing a path that made some sense stay here with me well get married donny what about the big church wedding what about all my mothers friends what about the country club i and then he saw she was joking and she saw he was not i want us to get married he said right now donny i want to marry you so much i think ill die from it well do it after this weekend thing yes ill marry you as soon as its over ill move into an apartment ill find work ill no then i want you to go home and finish your degree ill go for the early out and ill move back home therell be gi bill money i can work parttime well get some kind of marriedstudent housing itll be great fun and you can tell your mother well have all the parties then so well keep her happy too what brought this on nothing i just realized how important you are to me i didnt want this getting away from me i was an asshole last night i wanted to put us back together as the first priority when i get out ill even help you in this peace stuff well stop the war you and me itll be great they walked a bit amid kids their own ages but stoned and wild just celebrating the youthfulness of their lives in a great merry adventure in washington dc stopping the war and getting stoned and laid in the same impulse donny felt isolated from it terribly he wasnt a part of it and he didnt feel as if he were a part of the marine corps anymore okay he finally said i ought to be getting back we may be on alert if not can i come by tomorrow ill try and break off tomorrow if nothings happening here we dont even know ourselves whats going on they say were going to march to the pentagon over the weekend more theater please be careful i will ill figure out what we have to do to get married legally it might be better to hide it from the corps theyre all assholes then after its done the paperwork will catch up to us donny i love you ever since that date when you were with peggy martin and i realized i hated her for being with you ever since then we will have a wonderful life i promise then he saw someone approaching him swiftly it was trig with peter farris and several other acolytes following in his wake hey he called it just came over the radio the military district of washington has just declared a full alert and all personnel are supposed to report to their duty stations oh shit said donny its beginning said julie chapter five a flare floated in the night lights throbbed and swept the gas was not so bad now and the mood was generous even adventurous it had the air of a huge campout a jamboree of some sort who was in charge nobody who made these decisions nobody the thing just happened almost miraculously by the sheer osmosis of the may tribe at the pentagon almost nothing had happened it was all theater by the time julie and peter and their knot of arizona crusaders actually got onto government property the word had come back that the army and the police werent arresting anybody and they could stand on the grass in front of the huge ministry of war forever and nothing would happen it was determined by someone that the pentagon itself wasnt a choke point and it made more sense therefore to occupy the bridges before the morning rush hour and in that way close down the city and the government others would besiege the justice department another favorite target of opportunity so now they marched along past the big marriott hotel on the right toward the fourteenth street bridge just ahead julie had never seen anything like this it was a movie a battle of joy a stage show every pep rally and football game she had ever been to excitement thrummed in the moist air overhead police and army helicopters buzzed god have you ever seen anything like this she said to peter he replied you cant marry him oh peter you cant you just cant im going to marry him next week you probably wont be out of jail next week then ill marry him the week after they wont let him well do it secretly theres too much important work to be done they passed the marriott maybe fifty abreast and a halfmile long a mass of kids who led them a small knot at the front with bullhorns of the peoples coalition for peace and justice but more realistically their own instincts led them the professional organizers merely harnessed and marginally directed the generational energy meanwhile the smell of grass rose in the air and the sound of laughter now and then a news helicopter would float down from the sky hover and plaster them with bright light theyd wave and dance and chant one two three four we dont want your fucking war or ho ho ho chi minh nlfis gonna win or end the war now end the war now thats when the first tear gas hit it was acrid and biting and its overwhelming power to disorient could not be denied julie felt her eyes knit in pain and the world suddenly began to whirl about the air itself became the enemy screams rose and the sound of panic and confusion spread julie dropped to her knees coughing hard nothing existed for a second but the pain searing her lungs and the immense crushing power of the gas but she stayed there with a few others though peter had disappeared somehow the evil stuff curled around them their eyes now gushing tears but she thought i will not move they cannot make me move suddenly someone arrived with a bucket full of white washcloths soaked in water breathe through this he screamed an old vet of this drill and it wont be so hard if we dont break theyll fall back come on be strong keep the faith some kids fell back but most just stood there trying to deal with it someoneno one could ever say who or whytook a step forward then another one and in a second or so those that remained had joined the mass moved forward not on the assault and certainly not to charge but just out of the conviction that as young people nothing could deter them because they were so powerful as julie moved she saw ahead a barricade of dc police cars their lights flashing and behind them army soldiers presumably a contingent of the national guardsmen called up to much hoohah in the newspapers they had an insect look their eyes giant their snouts long and descending like powerful mandibles their flesh black the masks she realized they were wearing gas masks all of them this infuriated her you are warned to disperse came an amplified voice you are hereby warned to disperse we will arrest those who do not disperse you do not have a parade permit oh like thats really crucial said someone with a laugh shit if id realized that i never would have come a helicopter floated overhead to the right over the potomac the sun began to rise it was about six julie saw looking at her watch keep moving came a cry one two three four we dont want your fucking war julie hated to curse she hated it when donny cursed but standing there in the astringent aftermath of the gas her eyes bawling her heart knotted in anger she picked it up and was not alone one two three four we dont want your fucking war it was like an anthem a battle cry the kids that were left took their strength from it and began to move more quickly they came together in the strobing lights of the police cars and the running lights of the circling copters those whod fled regained their heroism stopped and moved by the strength of the few who remained turned and themselves began to march pop pop pop more cs gas canisters came at them from the barricade evil little grenades spurting viscous clouds of the stuff as they bounced but the kids now knew it wouldnt kill them and that the wind would come to thin it out and take its sting away one two three four we dont want your fucking war julie screamed with all her strength she cried for pale poor donny in his hospital bed a sack of plasma over him his face drawn his eyes vacant because of the death that had passed through him she screamed for the other boys in that awful place without legs or hopes faces gone feet gone penises gone she cried for the girls she knew would be bitter forever because their fiances or brothers or husbands had come home in plastic bags dumped in wooden boxes she cried for her father who preached of duty but himself had sold insurance through world war ii she cried for all the beaten kids in all the demonstrations in the past seven years she cried for the little girl running from the napalm cloud naked and afraid she cried for the little man with his hands tied behind him who was shot in the head and fell to the ground squirting blood one two three four we dont want your fucking war they were all moving forward now hundreds thousands they were at the police cars they were beyond the police cars the police were fleeing the national guard was fleeing hold it hold it goddammit someone was shouting as the melee halted before them was clear bridge all the way to the jefferson memorial in the rising light the capitol stood before them and over some trees the spire of the washington monument and off to the right the alphaville blocks of the new hew complex but there were no cars anywhere and no cops we did it somebody said we did it yes they had they had taken the bridge won a great victory they had driven the state away they had claimed the fourteenth street bridge for the coalition for peace and justice they had won we did it someone was saying next to her it was peter ncos and squad leaders up front asap ncos and squad leaders up front asap the men milled loosely on the broad esplanade of closeddown route about a half mile on the dc side of the fourteenth street bridge behind a barricade of jeeps police cars deuceandahalfs jefferson watched in marble splendor from the portside amid a canopy of dogwoods and from behind a cage of marble columns a pale lemon sky oversaw the scene and helicopters fluttered through it making far more noise than their importance seemed to warrant it looked like a fifties movie the one where the monster has attacked the city and the police and military set up barricades to impede its progress while in some lab whitecoated men labor to invent a secret weapon to bring it down napalm said crowe helpfully id use napalm kill about two thousand kids roast em nice and tastychewie make kent state look like a picnic boy the ward be over tomorrow dont think the lifers havent thought of it said donny as he left to head for the command conference he slipped away from third squad slid through other squads and platoons of young men festooned comically for war exactly as he was who seemed to feel equally foolish with the huge pots banging on their heads that was the odd thing about a helmet when its not necessary it feels completely ludicrous when it is necessary it feels like a gift from god this was one of the former occasions donny reached the informal conclave where the barracks commander stood with three men in jumpsuits that said justice deft on the back some other officials cops firemen and some confused dc guard officers of whom it was said their panic had led to the rout on the bridge all right all right people the colonel said sergeant major all of em here the sergeant major made a quick head count of his ncos and from each man received a nod to signify that the men under him had arrived it was done professionally in about thirty seconds all present sir good said the colonel climbing into a jeep to give him elevation over his subordinates and speaking in the loud clear voice of command all right men as you know at hours a large mass of demonstrators commandeered the righthand span of the fourteenth street bridge effectively closing it down the traffic is tied up back beyond alexandria the other bridges have been cleared by this time but weve got a choke point the department of justice has requested the marine corps to assist in clearing the bridge and weve been authorized by our command structure for that mission so let me tell you what that means we will clear the bridge we will do it quickly and professionally and with a minimum of force and damage understood aye aye sir came the cry i want a company and b company formed up line abreast with headquarters company in reserve to go by squads to the line as needed we do not have arrest powers and i do not want any arrests made we will advance under cover of moderate cs gas with bayonets fixed but sheathed under no circumstances will those bayonets be used to draw blood we will prevail not by force but by good order and solid professionalism a dc police massarrest unit will follow behind detaining and shipping those demonstrators who do not disperse our limit of advance will be the far end of the bridge live ammo sir negative negative i say again negative no live ammo nobody will be shot today these are american kids not vc we will move out at company commanders and senior ncos i want you to hold a quick meeting and get your best squads into the line at the point of contact this is a standard dod antiriot drill all right people lets be professional dismissed donny made it back to his squad as around him other squad leaders were reaching their people with the weird sensation of a large herbivore awakening the unit was picking itself up beginning to form up as each smaller element got instructions there was some cheering moderated by ambiguity but nevertheless a simple expression of the soldier or marines preference for doing anything rather than nothing well be in that arrowformation platoonsabreast thing donny explained the sergeant major will be counting cadence bayonets on but sheathed minimum force were moving these people out of here by our presence no ammo no clubbing just solid marine professionalism got it masks i said masks crowe werent you listening some cs will be fired he looked about the sergeant major had set up a hundred yards beyond the trucks and now the marines were streaming to him to form up at the line of departure donny looked at his watch it was all right lets assemble and march to position form up on me now his men rose to him and found their places he marched them at the double time to a formation that was putting itself together on the broad white band of empty highway teter held her hand he was pale but determined his face still teary from the gas itll be okay he kept saying almost more to himself than to her there was something so sad about him she had a tender impulse to draw him toward her and comfort him all right came the amplified voice wtop has a camera in the sky and weve just heard that the marines are forming up to come and move us oh this is going to be merry said peter the marines i want to counsel everybody you dont want to resist or you may get clubbed or beaten dont yell at them dont taunt them just go limp remember this is your bridge its not theirs weve liberated it we own it hell no we wont go hell no we wont go repeated peter thats the evil part julie said bitterly they dont come themselves the guys in the offices who make it happen they send in donny whos just trying to do his job he gets the shitty end of the stick but peter wasnt listening here they come he said for ahead out of the blur they could now see them drawing ever closer in a phalanx of rectitude and camouflage the united states marine corps advancing at the halftrot rifles at the high port helmets even gas masks turning them to insects or robots hell no we wont go came the chant guttural from the heart marines go home then again hell no we wont go the unit advanced at the halftrot to the sergeant majors urgent cadence huptwothreefour huptwo threefour and donnys squad stayed tight in the crowdcontrol formation a little to the left of the point of the arrow jogging actually helped donny feel a little better he settled into a steady rhythm and the constellation of equipment bounded sloppily on his body his helmet banged riding the spongy straps of the helmet liner with a kind of liquid mushiness he felt the sweat run down inside his mask catch irritatingly at his eyelashes then flood into his eyes but it didnt matter through the lens of his mask the world seemed slightly tarnished slightly dirty ahead he could see the mass of demonstrators sitting on the bridge as if it were theirs looking fiercely at them hell no we wont go alternating with marines go home marines go home rose to fill the air but it sounded tinny and idiotic they closed on the crowd until but fifty yards away then the sergeant majors yell reached out to stop them ready halt the two young americas faced each other on the bridge on the one side about two thousand young people ages fourteen through possibly thirty most around twenty college america the nonconformism of complete conformism all wore jeans and tshirts all had long flowing beautiful hair all were pale intense high on grass or sanctimony standing and drawing strength from one another under a bristle of placards that proclaimed peoples coalition for peace and justice and other ruder signs like gis join us or stop the war or fuck the war or rmn must go the other america strong wore the green twill of duty three companies of marines average age twenty also armed with unloaded rifles and sheathed bayonets they were earnest and behind the rubber and plastic of their masks cleanshaven and shorthaired yet in their way just as conflicted and just as frightened as the kids they faced they were essentially the same kids but nobody noticed behind them were cop cars ambulances fire engines deuceandahalfs their own corpsmen news reporters justice department officials but they were the ones out front a man in the blue jumpsuit of the justice department stepped beyond the marine formation he had a bullhorn this is an illegal parade you do not have a parade permit you are hereby ordered to disperse if you do not disperse we will clear the bridge you are hereby ordered to disperse hell no we wont go came the response when it had died down after a sweaty bit the justice official reiterated his position adding we will commence with cs gas operations in two minutes and the marine corps will move you out you are hereby ordered to disperse a moment of quiet followed and then a young man stepped forward screamed heres your fucking parade permit then pivoted smartly bent and peeled down his jeans to reveal two white half moons of ass god hes beautiful said crowe through his mask but loudly enough for the squad to hear i want him crowe shut up said donny the man from the justice department departed the sun was high the weather sticky and heavy overhead helicopters hovered their rotors kicking up the only turbulence another amplified voice this from the demonstrators as the older people warned the kids do not attempt to pick up tear gas canisters as they will be very hot do not panic the gas is not contained and it will disappear very quickly gas came a command six soft plops marked the firing of six dc police gas guns and the missiles skittered across the pavement leaking white fumes spun rolled and slid raggedly along the point of firing them into the ground was to bounce them into the crowd at low velocity rather than firing them into people at high possibly killing velocity gas the command came again and six more cs shells were fired the sergeant majors scream carried through the air assault arms and with that the rifles left the crosschest position of carry and were brought around the right side of the body stocks wedged under right arms and locked in muzzles with sheathed bayonets angled outward at fortyfive degrees to the ground prepare to advance came the command only crowes rifle wavered probably out of excitement but otherwise the muzzles lanced outward from the formation donny could sense the crowd of demonstrators drawing back gathering somehow then re inflating with purpose tear gas drifted loosely amid their ranks it was just a crowd identities lost in the blur and the gas was julie over there advance came the final command and the marines began to stomp ahead here we go thought donny they looked like cossacks the rank was green slanted in two angles away from the point an arrowhead of boys remorseless and helmeted their facial features vanished behind their masks julie looked through her tears for donny but it was useless the marines all looked the same staunch defenders of whatever in their sharp uniforms with their helmets and now their guns which jutted out like threats a cloud of tear gas washed over her crunching her eyes in pain she coughed felt the tears run hot and fluid down her face and rubbed at them then dipped for her wet washcloth and wiped the chemical from them assholes said peter bitterly enraged at the troops advancing on him he was trembling so hard he was locked in place his knees wobbling desperately but he wasnt going to move assholes he repeated as the marines closed in at a steady pace jjonny was in the lead solid as a rock next to him on the left crowe seemed strong they clomped forward to a steady beat of cadence from the sergeant major and through the jiggling stain of his dirty lenses donny watched as the crowd grew closer the sergeant majors cadence drove them on tear gas wafted through the chaos overhead a helicopter swept low and its turbulence drove the gas more quickly into whirlwinds and spirals until it rushed like water across the bridge steady on the advance screamed the sergeant major details suddenly swam at donny the faces of the scared kids before him their scrawniness their physical weakness and paleness how many of them were girls the cool way the leader exhorted them with his bullhorn and that shocking moment when at last the two groups clashed steady on the advance screamed the sergeant major maybe it was like some ancient battle legionnaires against visigoths sumerians against assyrians but donny sensed a great issue of physical strength of pure force of will as expressed through bodies when the two came together there was no striking no marine lifted his rifle and drove through for a butt stroke no blade came unsheathed and leapt forward into flesh rather there was just a crush as the two masses crunched together it felt more like football than war that moment when the lines collide and there are a dozen contests of strength all around you and you lay what youve got against someone else and hope you get fullbody weight against him and can lift him from his feet donny found himself hard against not an enemy lineman or a visigoth but a girl of about fourteen with freckles and red frizzy hair and braces headband tiedyed tshirt breastless and innocent but she had more hate on her face than any visigoth ever and she whacked him hard on the helmet with her placard which he read as it descended stated make war no more the placard smacked him its thin wood broke and it slipped away he felt his body ramming the girls and then she was gone either knocked back or pushed down and stepped over he hoped she wasnt hurt why hadnt she just fled more tear gas drifted in screams arose melees had broken out everywhere as demonstrators leaned against marines who leaned back one could feel strain as the two leaned and leaned and tried to press the other into panic it only lasted a second really then the demonstrators broke and fled and donny watched as they emptied the bridge leaving behind portapots and sandals and squashed tab cans and water buckets the battlefield detritus of a vanquished enemy there seemed no point in pursuing marines stand easy the sergeant major yelled masks off the masks came off and the boys sucked hard at the air good job good job anybody hurt yelled the colonel but before anybody could answer a considerable ruckus arose to the left policemen were clustered around the railing of the bridge and the word soon reached the marines that someone had panicked as they had approached and jumped off a police helicopter hovered low an ambulance arrived and paramedics got out urgently police boats were called but it took only a few minutes to make it clear that someone was dead chapter six the scandal played out pretty much as expected depending on the perspective of the account girl killed in demonstration the post headlined the more conservative star said demonstrator dies in bridge mixup marines murder girl argued the washington city paper no matter for the marine corps the news was very bad indeed seven liberal house members demanded an investigation into the matter of amy rosenzweig seventeen of glencoe illinois who had evidently panicked in the tear gas and the approach of the marines and climbed over the railing before anybody could reach her though several young marines tried she was gone walter cronkite appeared to generate a small tear in his left eye gordon petersen of wtop developed a catch in his voice as he discussed the incident with his coanchor max robinson why marines wondered the post two days later on its editorial page us marines are among the worlds most feared fighting forces an elite who have honored their country and their service in hostile environments since but what were they doing on the th street bridge may i surely with their esprit de corps and constant immersion in the theory and practice of land warfare at its most savage they were a poor choice for the justice department to deploy against peaceful demonstrators who had taken up a harmless occupation of the bridge as an expression of the longprecious tradition of civil disobedience the dc police force the park police or even guardsmen from the districts own unit all riottrained and all experienced in dealing with demonstrations would have been preferable to combat infantrymen who tend to perceive all confrontations as us against them the place for the marines is on the battlefields of the world and the parade ground of the eighth and i barracks not on american streets if the tragedy of amy rosenzweig teaches us anything it teaches us that as for the eighth and i marines in the immediate aftermath they were trucked back to the barracks where they remained on alert and in isolation for two days teams from the fbi and the district police and the us park police worked over the members of alpha company second platoon second squad whod been on the extreme left wing of the crowd control formation and who had seen the girl hanging on for dear life three of them had actually dropped their rifles thrown away their masks and helmets and rushed to her but in the instant before they reached her she closed her eyes and gave her soul to god relaxing backward into space they got to the railing in time to see her hit the water thirtyfive feet below they got dc police there within seconds and within minutes a dc rescue boat was on the scene if theyd had a rope they would have rappelled down to the water themselves but a quickly arriving platoon sergeant had forbidden any of them to jump off the bridge in attempts to rescue it was just too high and it wouldnt have mattered when she was located thirteen minutes later it became quickly apparent that amys neck had been broken by the impact of striking the water at an extreme angle a report later exonerated the marines and made it clear that no actual force had been applied to amy the marines said she chose to martyr herself the media said the marines killed her who knew the truth on the third day they arrested crowe rather under small arms and under the supervision of two officers from the naval investigation service lieutenant commander bonson and ensign weber four marine military policemen marched into the barracks where he and the rest of b company were relaxing while maintaining readyalert status and put him in handcuffs captain dogwood and the battalion colonel watched it happen then lieutenant commander bonson came up to donny and said in a loud voice good job corporal fenn damn fine work good work fenn said weber you got our man in the aftermath a space seemed to spread around donny he felt it open up as if oceans of atmosphere had been vacuumed out of the area between himself and his squad and others in the platoon nobody would meet his eyes some looked at him in horror others merely left the vicinity went into other squad bays or outside to lounge near the trucks what the hell did he mean asked platoon sergeant case uh i dont know sergeant donny said uh i dont know what the hell they were talking about you had contact with ms they talked to me about what ah well and donny swallowed they had some security concerns and somehow i got let me tell you something goddammit fenn if it happens in my platoon you come tell me about it you got that this aint a oneman goddamn motherfucking operation you come tell me fenn or by god i will make your young sorry ass sorry you didnt the mans blazing spit flew into donnys face and his eyes lit up like flares a vein throbbed on his forehead sergeant they told me i dont give a monkeys fuck what they told you fenn if it happens in my platoon i have to know about it or you aint worth pig shit to me copy that corporal yes sergeant you and me boy we got some serious talk ahead donny swallowed yes sergeant now get these men off their asses im not going to have them sitting around all goddamn day like they just won the fucking war all by themselves get em on work detail drill em do something with them yes sergeant and you and i will talk later yes sergeant donny turned in the wake of sergeant cases departure which was more like an ejection from a jet fighter than a normal retrograde adjustment okay he said to the squad okay lets get outside and run through some riot control drills theres no point just sitting in here but nobody moved all right come on guys im not shitting around here you heard the man we have an order they just stared at him some looked hurt the rest disgusted i didnt do anything donny said i talked to some navy lifers and thats all donny if i flash the peace sign in a bar will you turn me in to nis someone asked all right fuck that shit donny bellowed i dont have to explain anything to anybody but if i did id point out i didnt rat anybody out now get into your gear and lets get the fuck outside or casell have us on a barracks party until next tuesday the men got up but their slow heaviness expressed their bitterness wholl take crowes place someone asked there was no answer julie was released from the lockup at the washington coliseum at pm that same day after fortyeight hours of incarceration with several hundred of the more recalcitrant demonstrators at least physically it was almost pleasant being arrested the cops were old hands by this time and as long as everybody cooperated the process was all right she spent two nights on a cot in a field where the washington redskins practiced when it was their season the seats of the junky old place rose above like a pentecostal cathedral from the twenties and in the pen all the kids had a good time and nobody watched them too carefully grass was abundant the portable toilets were cleaner than the ones at potomac park the showers were never crowded and she got a good wash for the first time since leaving arizona in the peace caravan some of the boys caught fantasy touchdown passes in what had to have been an end zone but no word at all from donny had he been there on the bridge she didnt know shed looked for him but then itd all dissolved in confusion and tears as more of the gas flooded in she remembered crumpling rubbing her eyes desperately as the gas drifted by and then there was the shock of the marines and she found herself looking into the eyes of a boy a child really big and booming behind his lenses she saw fear in them or at least as much confusion as she herself felt and then he was by her and the marine line moved on and as she watched teams of policemen pounced on the demonstrators behind the lines and led them away to buses it was handled very simply no big deal at all to anybody concerned only later in the lockup did the word come that a girl had somehow died julie tried to work it out but could make no sense of it the marines had seemed quite restrained really it wasnt anything like kent state still it was an appalling weight a girl was dead and for what why was it necessary in the lockup they had a television and amy rosenzweigs young and tender face freckled under sprigs of reddish hair was everywhere she looked to julie like a girl shed grown up with though she could not remember seeing amy amid the crowd but that wasnt surprising for there had been thousands and much confusion on the ground they let her out and she went back to the campground in potomac park it was like a civil war encampment after gettysburg mostly empty now that the big week was over and the kids in their multitudes had returned to their campuses and the professional revolutionaries to their secret cabals to plot the next move in the war against the war litter was everywhere and the cops no longer bothered a few tents still stood but the sense of a new youth culture had vanished there was no music and no campfires and the peace caravan had departed all that is except for peter oh hi hi how are you fine i stayed behind jeff and susie are driving the micro back everybody is with them theyll be all right i wanted to stay here see if you needed anything im okay peter really i am have you seen donny at all him jesus you know what they did to that girl and you want to know where he is donny didnt do anything besides i read the marines tried to save her if there hadnt been any marines amy would still be here peter said obstinately and then the two just looked at each other he drew her close and hugged her and she hugged back thanks for hanging around peter ah its okay how was the coliseum okay not so bad they finally reduced charges parading without a permit they let us all go today well he said if you want me to drive you to the marine barracks or something i will whatever you want i have a vw from a guy its no problem im supposed to get married this week thats fine thats cool good luck and god bless let me see if i can help you in any way i think i ought to hang here until i hear from donny i dont know what happened to him sure said peter thats a good idea the alert was finally cancelled at that afternoon to the cheers and relief of the companies it took an hour or so to actually stand downthat is to return the rifles to the armory to shed and repack the combat gear in its appropriate place in the lockers to shed the utilities bag them for the laundry shower and shave but by when the work was done the captain at last released his menthe married to go home the rest to relax in town or on base as they preferred with only a few left on skeleton duty such as duty nco or armory watch that is except for donny he was done and still in his cone of isolation finally changing into civviesjeans and a white izod shirtwhen a runner came from headquarters and said he was wanted asap no he didnt have to dress in the uniform of the day donny returned to captain dogwoods office where bonson and weber waited captain we could take him to our offices or would you allow us to use yours yes sir go ahead said dogwood who wanted to get home to see his own wife and kids too stay here duty nco will lock up when youre finished thank you captain said bonson so donny was alone with them at last they were in civilian clothes this time weber looking like the sigma nu hed undoubtedly been at nebraska and the dour bonson in slacks and a black sport shirt buttoned to the top he looked almost like a priest of some sort coffee no sir oh sit down fenn you dont have to stand yes sir thank you sir donny sat we want to go over your testimony with you tomorrow therell be an arraignment at the judge advocate generals offices at the navy yard nothing elaborate its simply a preliminary to an indictment and trial ten hundred well send a car your undress blues will be fine ive arranged with captain dogwood for you to be off the duty roster then i think well give you a nice bit of leave two weeks by that time we should be able to cut orders for your new stripes sergeant fenn how does that sound well i tomorrow wont be hard fenn i assure you youll be sworn in and then youll recount how at my instruction you befriended crowe and traveled with him into a number of peace movement functions youll tell how you saw him in the presence of peace movement strategists such as trig carter you saw them in serious conversation intense conversation you neednt testify that you overheard him giving away deployment intelligence just tell what you saw and let the jag prosecutor do the rest its enough for an indictment hell have a lawyer a jag jg wholl ask you some rote questions then its over and done and off you go bonson smiled clean and simple said weber sir i just i dont know what i can tell them there were hundreds of people at those parties i saw no evidence of conspiracy or deployment intelligence or now donny said bonson leaning forward and trying a smile i know this is confusing for you but trust me youre doing your country a great service youre doing the marines a great service but i donny said weber they knew they knew knew they knew we had third infantry committed in virgin ia that the dc national guard was a complete fuckup the st airborne was stuck at justice and the nd down at the key bridge and that the cops were frazzled beyond endurance after eighty straight duty hours it was an elaborate game of chessthey move here we countermove they move there we countermoveall set up to get them to that bridge where theyd be faced by united states marines where the chances of a bigtime screw up on television were huge and thats just what they got another martyr another catastrophe the justice department humiliated a propaganda victory of immense proportions theyre parading with amys name in london and paris already give them credit it was as skillful a campaign as there was yes sir but we tried to save her the girl panicked it had nothing to do with us oh it had everything to do with you said bonson they wanted her going off the bridge and the marines to take the fall see how much better that is than the washington metro police or some thirdrate national guard unit most of whomd be demonstrating themselves if they had the chance no they wanted a big scandal to be laid right at the marines feet and thats what they got and crowe gave it to them now it is mandatory to get this fact before the public to show that we were betrayed from within and to move swiftly to restore confidence in the system by eliminating the treason and i cant think of a more edifying contrast for the american public than between crowe an ivy league dropout with his fancy connections and you a decorated combat veteran from a small western town doing his duty itll be very educational yes sir said donny good good ten hundred look sharp corporal you will impress the jag officers i know you will you will inherit your own future the future you and i have been working on i know it yes sir said donny they rose all right weber were finished here you relax fenn tomorrow is your big day the beginning of the rest of your life ill get the car sir said weber no ill get it youyou know tell him whats cooking yes sir bonson left the two younger men alone look fenn im the bad cop im here to give you the bad news ive got photos of you smoking grass with crowe okay man they can really nail you with them i mean big time i told you this guy bonson was cold he is beaucoup cold you know so give him what he wants which is another bad boys scalp to hang up on his lodge dole hes sent a bunch to the nam and he wants to send more i dont know why what he is driving at but i know this he will rotate your ass back to the land of bad things and not ever even think about it again hes got you cold its you or its crowe man dont throw your life away for nothing dig yes sir good man fenn knew youd see it our way at donny just walked out the front door of the barracks who was there to stop him some corporal in first platoon had duty nco that night and he was scribbling in the duty logs in the first sergeants office as donny passed donny walked to the main gate and waved at the sentry there who waved him past technically the boy was to look for liberty papers but in the aftermath of an alert such niceties of the marine way had fallen aside donny just walked crossed i street headed down the way took a left and there found un bothered his impala he climbed in turned the key and drove away it didnt take him long to reach potomac park site of the recently abandoned may tribe a few tents still stood a few fires still burned he left his car along the side of the road and walked into the encampment asked a few questions and soon found the tent julie he called but it was peter who came out shes sleeping he said well i need to see her it would be better if she slept im watching out for her the two faced each other both wore jeans and tennis shoes jack purcells but donnys were white as he washed them every week peters didnt look as though he had washed them since the fifties donny wore a madras shortsleeved buttondown shirt peter had some kind of tiedyed tshirt on baggy as a parachute going almost to his knees donnys hair was short to the point of neuroticism with a little pie up top peters was long to the point of neuroticism a mass of curly sprigs and tendrils donnys face was lean and pure peters wore a bristle of scraggly red beard and a headband thats very cool said donny but i have to see her i need her i need her too well she hasnt given you anything shes given me her love i want her to give me her love well youll have to wait awhile im tired of waiting look this is ridiculous go away or something i wont leave her unguarded who do you think i am some kind of rapist or killer im her fiance im going to marry her peter said julie coming out of the tent its all right really its all right are you sure julie looked tired still she was a beautiful young woman with hair the color of straw and a body as lean and straight as an arrow and brilliance showing behind her bright blue eyes both boys looked at her and recommitted to her love again are you okay donny asked i was in the lockup at the coliseum oh christ it was fine it wasnt anything bad you killed a girl said peter we didnt kill anyone you killed her by telling her being on that bridge mattered and that we were rapists and murderers you made her panic you made her jump we tried to save her you fucking asshole you killed her now youre a big tough guy and you can kick the shit out of me but you killed her stop screaming i never killed anyone who didnt have a rifle and wasnt trying to kill me or a buddy peter its okay you have to leave us alone christ julie you have to leave us ahhh all right but dont sayanyhow youre a lucky guy fenn you really are he stormed away in the darkness i never saw him so brave said julie he loves you so much hes just a friend im sorry i didnt get here earlier we were on alert there was a lot of shit because of amy im very sorry about amy but we didnt have a thing to do with it oh donny i want to marry you i love you i miss you then lets get married theres this thing donny said this thing yeah by the way ive technically deserted im ua unauthorized absence ill be reported tomorrow at morning muster theyll do something to me probably but i had to see you donny let me tell you about this thing and so he told it from his recruitment to his attempts to enter into a duplicitous friendship with crowe to his arrival at the party to his strange behavior that night until finally the action on the bridge crowes arrest and tomorrows responsibilities oh god donny im so sorry its so awful she went to him and in her warmth for just a second he lost all his problems and was donny fenn of pima county all over again the football hero the big guy that everybody thought so highly of who could do a in fourseven and bench press yet take pride in his high sats and the fact that he was decent to his high schools lowliest creeps and toads and never was mean to anybody because that wasnt his way but then he blinked and he was back in the dark in the park and it was only julie her warmth her smell her sweetness and when he left her embrace it was all back again donny havent you done enough for them i mean you got shot you lay in that horrible hospital for six months you came back and did exactly what they said when does it end it ends when you get out i dont hate the corps its not a corps thing its these navy guys these superpatriots who have it all figured out oh donny its so awful i dont work that way i dont like that stuff at all thats not me not any of it cant you talk to somebody cant you talk to a chaplain or a lawyer or something do they even have the right to put you through that well as i understand it its not an illegal order its a legitimate order its not like being asked to do something thats technically wrong like shoot kids in a ditch i dont know who i could talk to who wouldnt say just do your duty and theyll send you back to vietnam if you dont testify thats the gist of it yeah oh god she said she turned from him and walked a step or two away across the way she could see the potomac and the dark far shore that was virginia above it a tapestry of stars unscrolled dense and deep donny she finally said theres only one answer yeah i know go back do it thats what you have to do to save yourself but its not like i know hes guilty maybe he doesnt deserve to get his life ruined just because donny just do it you said yourself this crowe is not worth a single thing youre right donny finally said ill go back ill do it ill get it over im eleven and days ill get out inside a year with an early out and we can have our life thats all there is to it thats fine thats cool ive made up my mind no you havent she said i can tell when youre lying youre not lying to me you never have but youre lying to yourself i should talk to someone i need help on this one and im not good enough if you love me and i hope and pray you do then your judgment is clouded all right who then whoindeed there was only one answer really not the chaplain or a jag lawyer not platoon sergeant case or the first sergeant or the sergeant major or the colonel or even the commandant usmc trig trig will know well go see trig bitterly from afar peter watched them they embraced they talked they appeared to fight she broke away he went after her it killed him to sense the intimacy they shared it was everything he hated in the worldthe strong the handsome the blond the confident just taking what was theirs and leaving nothing behind he watched them finally go toward donnys old car and climb in his mind raging with anger and counterplots his energy unbearably high without willing it he raced to the vw larry frankel had lent him he turned the key jacked the car into gear and sped after them he didnt know why he didnt think it would matter but he also knew he could not help but follow them chapter seven peter almost missed them he had just cleared a crest when he saw the lights of the other car illuminate a hill and a dirt road beyond a gate then flash off his own lights were off but there was enough moonlight to make out the road ahead he pulled up to the gate and saw nothing that bore any signal of meaning except a mailbox painted white with the name wilson scribbled on it in black he was on route about five miles north of germantown what the hell were they up to what did they know what was going on he decided to pull back a hundred yards and just wait for a while suppose they ran in there and turned around and collided with him on the road that would be a total humiliation instead he decided just to watch and wait at the top of the hill they turned the engine off below lay a farm of no particular distinction a nondescript house a yard a barn propane tanks and old tractors rusted out lay in the yard there was no sound of animals the farm in fact looked like a dust bowl relic yet something was going on twin beams illuminated the yard and donny with his unusually good eyesight could make out a van with its lights on a shroud of dust and two men who were in the process of moving heavy packages of some sort out from the barn into the van by the light of the headlamps i think thats trig donny said i dont know who the other guy is shall we go down donny was suddenly unsure i dont know he said i cant figure out what the hell is going on hes helping his friend load up at this hour well hes an irregular guy the clock doesnt mean much to him that was true trig wasnt your ninetofiver by any interpretation all right said donny well walk down there but you hang back let me check this out dont let them see you until we figure whats happening ill call you in okay im just not feeling good about this okay you sound a little paranoid he did some hint of danger filled the air but he wasnt sure what it was what it meant where it came from possibly it was the mere strangeness of everything the way nothing really made any sense possibly it was his own fatigue raw after the many hours on alert they headed down the hill and donny detoured them around the house until at last they came upon the two men from the rear donny could see them better now both working in jeans and denim shirts they were loading by wheelbarrow immensely awkward sacks of fertilizer into the van packing it very full ammonium nitrate the sacks said dust that the wheelbarrow tires ripped up from the ground filled the air floating in large shimmering clouds which shifted through the beams of the truck lights and in the yellower light that blazed from the barn door it lit wherever it could coating the truck the men everything both trig and the other man wore red bandannas around their faces pushing julie back into the dark donny stepped out and approached coughing at the stuff in the air as it filled his mouth and throat with grit he stepped farther nobody noticed him trig he called trig turned instantly at his name but it was the other man who reacted much faster turning exactly to donny his dark eyes devouring him he had a full tangled web of blond hair much thicker than trigs and was large and powerful next to trigs delicacy they looked like a poet and a stevedore standing next to each other trig its me donny donny fenn he stepped forward a little hesitantly donny jesus christ i didnt expect you well you said to come on out i did yeah come on in donny meet robert fitzpatrick my old friend at oxford halloo said robert pulling off his own bandanna to show a smile that itself showed a mouthful of porcelain spades a movie stars gleam of a smile so youre the war hero eh weve hopes for you that we do need boyos like you for the movement well stop this bloody thing and get the west field covered in horse shit and ammonium nitrate if im a judge of things roll up your sleeves boy and get to work we could use some back the goddamned pickup broke down and im stuck with this piece of shit to git the stuff out to the spreader were doing it at night to beat the heat robert hes been on some kind of alert for seventytwo hours he cant do manual labor trig said no i no were almost done it doesnt matter you left so suddenly ah one more demonstration i was worn out what did it prove ive lost my will for the movement youll get your will back boyo said the giant fitzpatrick heartily ill go get us a beer for the recharge you wait here donny fenn no no i just had a thing i wanted to talk over with trig oh trigll steer you right no doubt about it he said his voice light with laughter its a drink ill be gittin trig you lads talk with that he turned to the house and headed in so what is it donny its crowe they arrested him violations of the uniform code of military justice im supposed to testify against him inhe looked at his watchabout seven hours i see maybe you dont i was asked to spy on him that was my job thats why i got close to him i was supposed to report to them on his offbase activities and try and put him with known members of the peace groups thats why i was with him at the party that night thats why i came to your party i was ordered to spy trig stared at him for a while then his face broke into the oddest thing a smile oh thats your big secret man thats if he laughed now really hard donny wise up you work for them they can ask you to do that if they say so thats your duty thats the game in washington these days everybodys watching everybody everybodys got an agenda a plan an idea theyre trying to push or sell i dont give a damn its worse they have some idea you were weather underground and you planned the whole thing i mean can you imagine anything so stupid he was feeding you deployment intelligence so the may tribe could humiliate the corps boy their imagination never fails to amaze me so what should i do trig thats what im here to ask about crowe should i testify what happens if you dont theyve got some pictures of me smoking dope funny i dont smoke dope anymore but i did to get in with him they could send me to portsmouth or more likely the nam they could ship me back for a last goround even though im short theyre really assholes arent they yeah but thats neither here nor there is it this isnt about them we know who they are this is about you well then its easy easy easy testify for one reason you cant let them get you killed what would that prove who benefits from the death of lochinvar who wins when lancelot is slain im just a guy trig you cant give yourself up to it somebodys got to come out on the other side and say how it was im just im just a guy people were always insisting to donny that he was somehow more than he really was that he represented something hed never gotten it it was just because he happened to be goodlooking but underneath he was just as scared just as ineffective just as simple as anyone else no matter what trig said i dont know said donny is he guilty that would matter it doesnt matter what matters is you or him thats the world you have to deal with you or him i vote him any day of the week i vote him but is he guilty im no longer in the inner circle im sort of a roaming ambassador so i really dont know oh youd know youd know is he guilty trig paused finally he said well i wish i could lie to you but goddammit no no hes not guilty there is some weird kind of intelligence they have at the top i just get glimmerings of it but i dont think its crowe but im telling you the truth that doesnt matter you should dump him and get on with your life if hes not guilty of that hes guilty of lots of other stuff donny looked at trig for a bit trig was leaning against the fender of the van he lifted a milk carton and poured it over his head and water gushed out scraping rivulets in the dust that adhered to his handsome face trig shook his wet hair and the droplets flew away then he turned back donny for christs sake save your own life reter was no good at waiting he got out of the car and walked along the shoulder of the road it was completely dark and silent unfamiliar sensations to a young man whod spent so much time ocson city streets now and then he heard the chirp of a cricket up above the stars towered and pinwheeled but he was not into stars or insects so he noticed neither of these realities instead he reached the gate paused a moment and climbed over he saw before him a faint rise in the land almost a small hill and the dirt road that climbed it he knew if a car came over the hill and he were standing on that road hed be deadcold caught in the lights so he walked a distance from the road then turned to head up the hill figuring he could then drop to the ground if donny and julie returned gently he walked up the hill feeling as alone as that guy who had walked on the surface of the moon he reached the top of the hill and saw the farmhouse below him no sight of julie but he saw trig and donny slouched on the fender of a van in the yard between the house and the barn and they were chatting animatedly relaxed and intimate there was no sign of danger no sign of weirdness just two new friends bullshiting in the night but then small things began to seem off what was trig doing way out here what was this place what was going on it connected with nothing in peters memory of trig puzzled he stepped forward and almost tripped as he bumbled into something two figures rose before him oh shit he thought for they wore suits and one of them carried a camera with a long lens clearly they were feds spying on trig they had the pug look of fbi agents with blunt faces and crew cuts one wore a hat they did not look happy to be discovered wwho are you peter asked in a quavering voice what are you doing i dont think i can sell him out said donny donny this isnt a western there are no good guys do you hear me this is real life hardball style if its you or crowe do not give yourself up for crowe i suppose thats the smart move said donny so there said trig i made your decision easy for you all you have to do is cooperate with them come on when the war is over theyll reduce his sentence he may never even serve a day theyll work some deal hell get out and go on with the rest of his life he wont even be upset donny remembered that once upon a time even crowe had given him the same advice roll over on me in a second donny if it ever comes to that somehow crowe had known it would okay he finally said do your duty donny but think about what it costs you okay think about how you feel now then when you get out do me one favor okay no matter what happens to me promise me one thing trig winced as if in pain in the hot light of the headlights though perhaps something had just gotten in his eye there was an immense familiarity to that look the strain on his face the set of it the clearness of vision and and what sure donny said open your mind open your mind to the possibility that the power to define duty is the power of life and death and if people impose duty on you maybe theyre not doing it for your best interests or the countrys best interests but for their own best interests okay donny force yourself to think about a world in which each man got to set his own duty and no one could tell anyone what to do what was right what was wrong the only rules were the ten commandments i stammered donny here said trig i have something for you i was going to mail it to you from baltimore but thisll save me the postage and the fuss its no big deal he went over to some kind of knapsack on the ground fished around and came out with a folder which he opened to reveal a piece of heavy paper sometimes he said when the spirit moves me im even pretty good im much better at birds but i did okay on this one its nothing donny looked it was a drawing on a creamy page trimmed from that sketchbook trig was always carrying incredibly delicate and in a spiderweb of ink that depicted himself and julie as they stood and talked in the trees at west potomac park there was something special about it he got them both maybe not exactly as a photograph but somehow their love too the way they looked at each other the faith they had in each other wow said donny wow yourself i dashed it off that night in my book it was neat the two of you gives me hope for the world now go on get the hell out of here go back to your duty trig drew him close and donny felt the warmth the musculature and maybe something else too passion somehow oddly misplaced but genuine and impressive trig was actually crying over the shoulders of the two fbi agents peter saw donny and trig embrace and then donny stepped out of the light and was gone hed head to his car which peter now saw was but fifty or so yards away he was screwed donny would see him here with the two feds who showed no sign at all of moving and he would have made an ass out of himself he felt despair rising in his gorge i have to go he said to the larger of the two plainclothes officers no the man said back and the other moved to embrace peter as if to wrestle him to the ground peter squirmed out of the mans grip but he was grabbed and thrust to the ground the two men loomed over him this is ridiculous he said they seemed to agree they looked at each other foolishly not quite sure what to do but suddenly one of them pointed then the engine of donnys car came to life and its lights flashed on the man with the camera pulled away from peter leaving the other the bigger to lean on him and ran toward the gate well did he help said julie as they walked through the dark yeah said donny yes he did he really did ive got it figured out now should i go meet him no hes in a very strange mood im not sure whats going on lets just get out of here ive got some things to do what did he give you its a picture its very nice ill show you later they walked through the dark up the hill donny could see the car ahead he had an odd tremor suddenly a sense of not being alone it was a freakish thing sometimes useful in indian country that sensation of being watched he scanned the darkness for sign of threat but saw nothing only farmland under moon no movement or anything who was that blond guy she asked his pal fitzpatrick big irish guy they were loading up to spread fertilizer thats strange he said they decided to do the hard part of the job in the cool of the night hell it was only fertilizer who knows what was going on with trig i dont know he was uh strange is all i can call it he had the same look on his face that the time photographer got when he was carrying that bleeding kid in from the cops in chicago and his own head was bleeding too he was very set very determined but somehow underneath it all very emotional he seemed like he was facing death or something i dont know why or what it spooked me a little poor trig maybe even the rich boys have demons he wanted to hug he was crying maybe there was something weirdo in it or something i felt his fingers in my muscles and i felt how happy he was to be hugging me i dont know very weird stuff i dont know they reached the car and donny started it turning on the lights he backed into the grass turned around and headed down the road to the gate jesus he said duck for at that moment a figure suddenly rose from a gulch a man in a suit but too far away to do anything a camera came up donny winced at the bright beam of flash as it exploded his night vision fireballs danced in his head reminding him of nighttime incoming hotel echo but he stepped on the gas gunned up the road and turned right then really floored it jesus they got our picture he said a fed that guy had to be fbi holy christ my face was turned said julie then youre okay i dont think he got a license number because my rear plate illumination bulb is broken he just got my picture a lot of good thatll do them a fed man this whole thing is strange i wonder whats going on she said whats going on is that trigs about to get busted trig and that fitzpatrick guy we were lucky we werent rounded up id be on my way to the brig poor trig said julie yes said donny poor trig the man let him up he brushed himself off i havent done anything peter explained ive come to see my friends you have no right to detain me do you understand i havent done anything the man stared at him sullenly im going now this is none of your business he said he turned and walked away the agent had seemed genuinely cowed he stepped away awaiting a call but none came another step filled him with confidence but he didnt see or hardly feel the judo chop that broke his spine and in the fullness of his tender youth and in the ardor of his love for his generation and its pure idea of peace killed him before he hit the ground chapter eight donny reached dc around four in the morning and he and julie checked into a motel on new york avenue in the tourist strip approaching downtown they were too tired for sex or love or talk he set the cheap alarm for and slept deeply until its ungentle signal pulled him awake donny she said stirring herself sweetie ive got some things to do now you just stay here get some more sleep i paid for two nights ill call you sometime today and well decide what to do next oh donny she blinked awake even out of sleep with a slightly puffy face and her hair a rats nest she seemed to him quite uniquely beautiful he leaned over and kissed her dont do anything stupid and noble she said theyll kill you dont you worry about me he said ill be all right he dressed and drove the mile or so through the section of city called se passing union station then left up the hill until he was in the shadow of the great capitol dome turning down pennsylvania then down eighth he arrived found parking on a street just off the shops across from the barracks locked the car and headed to the main gate from across eighth street the little outpost of marine elegance seemed serene the officers houses along the street were stately and magnificent between them donny could see men on the parade deck in their modified blues at parade practice endlessly trying to master the arcane requirements of duty and ritual the imprecations of the ncos rose in the air harsh precise demanding the grass on which the young men toiled was deep green intense and pure like no other green in washington in that hot bleak spring finally he walked across the street to the main gate where a pfc watched him come corporal fenn youve been reported ua the pfc said i know ill take care of it ive been ordered to notify your company commander of your arrival do your duty then private do you call shore patrol they didnt say anything about that but i have to call captain dogwood go ahead then im changing into my duty uniform yes corporal donny walked through the main gate across the cobblestone parking lot and turned left down troop walk to the barracks as he went he was aware of a strange phenomenon the world seemed to stop or at least the marine corps world it seemed that whole marching platoons halted to follow his progress he felt hundreds of eyes on him and the air suddenly emptied of its usual fill of barked commands donny went in climbed the ladder well as he had done so many hundreds of times turned left on the second deck landing and into the squad bay at the end of which was his little room he unlocked his locker stripped slipped into flip flops and a towel and marched to the showers where he scalded himself in water and disinfectant soap he washed dried and headed back to his room where he slipped on a new pair of boxers and pulled out his oxfords they could be better for the next ten minutes he applied the full weight of his attention to the shoes in regulation old marine corps fashion until he had burnished the leather to a high gleam as he finished the shoes the tough professional figure of platoon sergeant case came to hover in the door i had to put you on ua fenn he said in that old corps voice that sounded like sandpaper on brass do you want me to article fifteen your young ass i was late i had personal business i apologize youre not on the duty roster they say youve got some legal obligations at ten hundred yes sergeant in the navy yard well ill get you off report you do the right thing today marine do you hear me yes sergeant case left him alone after that though he hadnt been so ordered and in fact didnt even know the uniform of the day he decided to put on his blue dress a uniform he pulled on socks and taped them to his shins so that theyd never fall selected a pair of blue dress trousers from the hanger and pulled them on he tied his shiny oxfords he pulled on a tshirt and over it finally the blue dress tunic with its bright brass buttons and red piping he pulled tight the immaculately tailored tunic and buttoned up to that little clerics collar where the eagle globe and anchor stood out in brass hasrelief he pulled on a white summer belt drawing it tight giving him the torso of a young achilles on a stroll outside troy his white summer gloves and white summer cover completed the transformation into total marine the medals reduced to ribbons stood out on his chestnothing spectacular for the marines are a dour bunch not into show only a smear of red denoting the very hot day when hed slithered through rice water and buffalo shit with half the world shooting at him to pull a wounded pfc back into the world to life to possibility the blur of purple was for the bullet that had passed through his chest a few weeks later the rest was basically crap a national defense ribbon the inservice rsvn award the presidential unit citation for the overall iii marine amphibious force presence in the land of bad things the vietnamese cross of gallantly and expert marksman in rifle and pistol with second awards it was no chest of fruit salad but it did say this man is a marine whos been in the field who was shot at who tried to do his duty he adjusted the white summer cover until it came low over his blue eyes then turned and went to face commander bonson he left the barracks and headed toward the captains office where he was to be picked up the xo wandered by and he snapped off a quick salute fenn is that the uniform of the day for what i have to do sir yes sir fennnever mind go ahead thank you sir two ncos including case watched him go by the time he reached troop walk by some strange vibration in the air everyone knew he was in his full dress blues the men in their modifieds watched him with suspicion maybe a little hostility but above all curiosity the uniform of course was not the uniform of the day and for a marine to strut out in so flagrant a gesture of rebellion was extremely odd he could have been naked and caused less of a ruckus donny strode down troop walk aware of the growing number of eyes upon him he had a fleeting impression of men running to catch a glimpse of him going even across the way when he passed by center house the bases boq a couple of offduty first lieutenants came out onto the porch in bermudas and ts to watch him pass by he turned into the parking lot where a tan government ford with a squid driving waited by the steps he then turned left climbed and walked across the porch and into the first sergeants office which led to captain dogwoods office the first sergeant holding a cup of coffee with semper fi emblazoned on the porcelain nodded at him as orderlies and clerks scurried to make way theyre waiting on you fenn yes first sergeant said donny he stepped into the office captain dogwood sat behind his desk and bonson and weber in their summer khakis sat across from him sir corporal fenn reporting as ordered sir donny said ah very good fenn said dogwood did you misunderstand the uniform of the day i sir no sir donny said sir permission to speak sir another moment of silence fenn said the captain id consider carefully before let him speak said bonson eyeing donny without love donny turned to face the man fully sir the corporal wishes to state categorically that he will not testify against a fellow marine on charges of which he has no personal knowledge he will not perjure himself he will not take part in any proceedings involving the uniform code of military justice sir fenn what are you pulling asked weber we had an agreement sir we never had an agreement you gave me orders to investigate which i did against my better instincts and in contravention to every moral belief i have i did my duty my investigation was negative sir that is all i have to say sir fenn said bonson fixing him with a mean glare you have no idea what forces youre playing with and what can happen to you this is no game this is the serious business of defending the security of our nation sir i have fought for our nation and i have bled for our nation no man who hasnt has the right to tell me about defending our nation whatever his rank sir finally sir may i sincerely say sir you are an asshole and a creep and you havent done one thing for the united states of america and if you want to meet me out back lets go bring weber ill kick his ass too fenn said dogwood all right captain dogwood said bonson i see this is the kind of marine you have here at eighth and i im very disappointed this reflects on you captain and my report will so state fenn if i were you id start packing dont forget your jungle boots he turned and walked out that was stupid fenn said weber fuck you weber you asskissing creep weber swallowed and turned to dogwood restrict him to quarters his orders will be cut by four then he turned and walked out dogwood went to the phone and talked in an intimate voice with someone then he hung up sit down fenn said dogwood turning back to donny do you smoke no sir well i do shaking a little he lit up a marlboro and went to the door welch get in here welch scurried in yes sir you have until four welch to get liberty papers cut for corporal fenn get em back here for my signature seventytwo hours if you have to run over to personnel at henderson hall you take my car and driver dont stop for traffic do you understand uh well sir i its highly irregular im not you heard me welch said the captain now get going he turned back to donny okay fenn i cant save you from vietnam but i can get you some time off before you have to go if i can get your orders cut before bonsons paperwork catches up with you yes sir you go change into civvies now you be ready to take off as soon as possible yes sir ithank you sir oh just a moment yes here she is a woman walked into the room pleasant in her late twenties donny recognized her from the picture on the desk as dogwoods wife here mort she said handing an envelope over she turned to donny you must be very foolish young man or very brave i dont know maam fenn here its six hundred dollars cash its all we had in our quarters itll take you and your girlfriend someplace for a few days sir i no no go ahead son take it enjoy yourself pay it back when you can and when you get to the nam keep your ass down that shithole isnt worth another marine not a single one now go go go son and good luck part ii sniper team sierrabravofour rsvn i corps februarymay chapter nine the rain fell in torrents in i corps it was the end of the rainy season and no rainier season is rainier than the one in the republic of south vietnam da nang the capital of this dying empire was wet but some further hundred klicks out wetter still lay the fortified fire base a few of the marines left in the land of bad things called dodge city a ramshackle slum of sandbags mm howitzers sshops bunkers barbed wire and filthy open fourholers it was the tail end of a lost war and nobody wanted to get wasted before the orders were cut that got these sad boys home but there were marines even beyond dodge city out in indian country there in a tangle of scrub trees near the top of a hill identified on maps only by its height in metershill two of them cowered in the downpour watching the drops accumulate on the rims of their boonie caps gather and finally drop off while the rain beat a cold tattoo against the ponchos that covered both of them and their gear one of them dreamed of home it was lance corporal donny fenn and he was getting very short in may his fouryear enlistment was up he was home free he knew his deros by heart as did every man in the nam the ones who first came in the ones who were still there date of estimated return from overseas service donnys was may he was a twotour guy with a purple heart and a bronze star and though he no longer believed in the war he did believe passionately that he was going to make it he had to on this wet morning donny dreamed of dry pleasures he dreamed of the desert from where hed come pima county arizona the town of ajo and the hot dry air that pulsed down from the sonoras out of mexico dry as the devils breath he dreamed of baking in such a place going back to college on to law school he dreamed of a house of a family a job most of all he dreamed of his young wife who had just written him and the words were inscribed in his mind now as he sat in the downpour you keep your spirits high marine i know youll make it and i pray for that day you are the best thing that ever happened to me and i cannot live without you so if you get killed i am going to be plenty angry i might never talk to you again i would be so mad he had written her back just before this boonie jaunt oh you sweet thang i do miss you so things are fine here i didnt know spiders could get big as lobsters or that it could rain for three solid months but these are useful facts and will come in ever so handy back in the world but the sarge will keep me alive because hes the smartest marine that ever lived or breathed and he said if i got wasted who the hell would he pick on and that would be no fun at all rolled into his hatband swaddled in cellophane was a picture of julie now out of her hippie phase though she worked at the tucson veterans hospital among the wounded from another war and was even talking of a nursing career now in the picture julies beauty was like a beam in the night for a man lost and starving a shiver rose through donnys spine a deep and relentless cold the world had liquified it was mud fog or rain no other elements existed it was an almost incandescent world whose low lights yielded no hint to time of day the vapors simply floated in gray murk a kind of universal declamation of misery under his poncho he felt the coldness of one of the few ms left in vietnam with a twentyround magazine leaning into his leg ready for instant deployment if sierrabravofour were bounced but that would never happen because the sergeant was so skilled at picking hides he carried two canteens a pack full of crats mostly barbecued pork four m grenades a colt automatic an m spotting scope a black phosphatebladed kbar ten extra twentyround nato mags three claymore mine bandoleers one m electrical firing device a canvas bag full of flares and a flare launcher and enemy of his life bane of his existence most hated of all objects on the face of the earth a prc radio fourteen pounds of lifeline to dodge commo check said the sergeant who sat a few feet from donny gazing at the same rainblasted foliagedense landscape the plains and paddies and jungles and low mean hills get on the horn pork shit said donny for deploying the radio meant moving moving meant breaking the steamy seal the poncho had formed around his neck which meant cold water would cascade down his neck into the sweaty warmth of his body there was no colder place than vietnam but that was okay because there was no hotter place either donny stirred in the tent of his poncho got the prick up and on knew its freak was preset accurately and managed somehow leaning it forward precariously to let its four feet of whip antenna snap forward and out into the wet air he brought the phone to his ear up through his poncho and pushed the onoff toggle to on and yes a shivery blade of water sluiced down between his shoulder blades underneath his jungle cammies he shivered said fuck under his breath and continued to struggle with the radio the problem with the pricks wasnt only their limited range their dense weight their lineofsight operational capabilities but more critically their short battery lives therefore grunts used them sparingly on preset skeds contacting base for a fast sitrep he pressed send foxtrotsandmansix this is sierrabravofour over he pressed receive and for his efforts got a crackly soup of noise no big surprise with the low clouds the rain and the terrains own vagaries at play sometimes they got through and sometimes they didnt he tried again foxtrotsandmansix this is sierrabravofour do you read is anybody there hello knock knock please open the door over the response was the same maybe theyre all asleep he said naw said the sergeant in his rich southern drawl slow and steady and funny as shit its too late to be stoned and too early to be drunk this is the magic hour when them boys are probably alert keep trying donny hit the send button and repeated his message a couple more times without luck im going to the backup freak he finally stated the sergeant nodded donny spread the poncho so that he could get at the simple controls atop the unit two dials seemed to grin at him next to the two butterfly knobs that controlled them one for megahertz the other for kilohertz he diddled looking for to which dodge city sometimes defaulted if there was heavy radio traffic or atmospheric interference and as he did the radio prowled through the wave band of communications that was vietnam in early propelled by the weird reality that it could receive from a far greater distance than it could send they heard a lost truck driver trying to get back to highway a pilot looking for his carrier a commo clerk testing his gear all of it crackly and fragmented as the signals in their varying strengths ebbed and flowed some of it was in vietnamese for the arvn were on the same net some of it was army for there were more soldiers than marines left by fiftyodd thousand some of it was special forces as a few of the big acamps still held out to the north or west some of it was fire missions permission to break off search requests for more beer and beef finally donny lit where he wanted ah foxtrotsandmansix this is sierrabravofour do you copy sierrabravofour foxtrotsandmansix here yes we copy what is your sitrep over tell em were drowning said the sergeant foxtrotsandmansix were all wet nothing moving up here nothing living up here foxtrot over sierrabravofour does swagger want to call an abort over they want to know do you want to call an abort the hunterkiller mission was slated to go another twentyfour hours before air evac but the sergeant himself appeared to be extremely low on the probability of contact at this time affirmative he said no bad guys anywhere theyre too smart to go out in shit like this tell em to get us the hell out of here as soon as possible thats an affirmative foxtrotsandmansix request air evac over sierrabravofour our birds are grounded youll have to park it until we can get airborne again shit theyre souped in said donny okay tell em well sit tight and wait for the weather to break but we aint bringing home any scalps donny hit send foxtrot we copy well sit tight and get back to you when the sun breaks through over sierrabravofour roger that out the radio crackled to silence okay said donny that about ties that one up yeah said the sergeant with just a hint of a question in his voice pork he said after a second or two was you paying attention while you were going to the backup freak you hear anything the sergeant was like a cop who could understand and decipher the densest code or the most brokenup sound bits on the radio no i didnt hear a thing said donny the chatter you know the usual stuff okay do me a favor pork he always called donny pork he called all his spotters pork hed had three spotters before donny pork you run through them freaks real slow and you concentrate i thought i heard a syllable that sounded like gent gent as in gentprefer blondes you got a blonde you should know no as in urgent donnys fingers clicked slowly through the chatter on the double dials as a hundred different signals came and went in the same fractured militare se made more incomprehensible by radio abbreviations the tangle of codes and call signs alphafourdelta deltasixalpha whiskeyfoxtrotniner irontreethree rathole zulusix tan san nhut control on and on good morning vietnam how are you today its raining it meant nothing but the sergeant leaned forward his whole body tense with concentration un shivery in the wet hardly even human in his intensity he was a thin stick of a man twentysix with a blond crew cut a sunburn so deep it had almost changed his race cheekbones like bed knobs squinty gray squirrelshooters eyes percent american redneck with an accent that placed him in the backwoods of some underdeveloped principality far from sophisticated living but with an odd grace and efficiency to him he had no dreams not of desert not of a farm or a city not of home not of hearth he was total kickass professional marine corps lifer and if he dreamed of anything it was only of that harsh and bitter bitch duty whom hed never once cheated on whom hed honored and served on two other tours one as a platoon sergeant in sixtyfive and another running longrange patrols up near the dmz for sog if he had an inner life he kept it to himself they said hed won some big civilian shooting tournament and they said his daddy was a marine too back in world war ii and won the medal of honor but the sergeant never mentioned this and who would have the guts to ask he had no family he had no wife or girlfriend he had no home nothing except the marine corps and a sense that he had been produced by turbulent hard scrabble times of which he preferred not to speak and on whose agonies he would remain forever silent he was many other things but only one of them mattered to donny he was the best man he was good he was so fucking good it made your head spin if he fired someone died an enemy soldier always he never shot if he didnt see a weapon but when he shot he killed nobody told him otherwise and nobody would fuck with him he was super cool in action the ice king who just let it happen kept his eyes and ears open and figured it out so fast it made you dizzy then he reacted took out any moving bad guys and went about his business it was like being in vietnam with mick jagger or some other legendary star because everybody knew who bob the nailer was and if they didnt love him by god they feared him because he was also death from afar the marine corps way he was more rifle than man and more man than anybody even the nva knew who he was it was said a pi astre bounty had been placed on his head the sergeant thought this was pretty funny but in the end it would kill him donny thought the war would eat him up in the end he would try one more brave and desperate thing eager somehow to keep it going to press himself even further and it would in the end kill his heroic ass hed never hit his deros for boys like this there was no such thing as deros vietnam was forever he reminded donny of someone but donny hadnt figured it out there was something about him however oddly familiar oddly resonant this had struck him before but he could never quite nail it down was it a teacher somewhere was it a relative a marine from his earlier tour or his time at eighth and i for a time hed thought it was ray case his furious platoon sergeant there but as he got to know bob that connection vaporized case was a good tough professional marine but bob was a great marine they didnt make many of them like bob lee swagger but who was he like why did he seem so familiar donny shook the confusion out of his head swagger sat under the poncho the water dripping off his boonie hat his eyes almost blank as he listened to the crackly tapestry of radio he was as equally laden as donny the taped bull barrel of his m sniper riflereally just a remington varmint with a redfield x scope aboardpoked out from the neck of his poncho as he did what he could to keep the action and the wood which would swell with moisture dry he also carried four m grenades two claymore bandoleers an m electrical firing device a automatic two canteens and a pack full of crats preferred poison ham and powdered eggs and seventytwo rounds of mil lake city arsenal match ammo the grain load used by army and marine highpowered shooters at camp perry but he was a man who traveled well prepared he had a randall survivor knife with a sawtooth blade a colt baby hammerless in an aviators shoulder holster under his camo utilities and strapped to his back an m grease gun and five thirtyround magazines there he said you hear it swear to christ i heard something donny had heard nothing in the murk of chatter still he slowed his diddling and redialed watching the little numbers on the face crackle through the gap as he shifted them finally he lit on something so soft you could miss it entirely and he only received it because it seemed to be right on the cusp of the megahertz click to another freak if he took the tension off the knob the signal disappeared but raspy and distant they did hear it and the words seemed to define themselves out of the murk until they became distinct anyone on this net anyone on this net how you read me over urgent goddammit over there was no answer this is arizonasixzulu i have beaucoup bad guys all over the goddamn place anyone on this net charliecharlienovember you there over hes way out of our range donny said and who the hell is arizonasixzulu donny wondered hes got to be one of the special forces camps to the west they use states as call signs they call em fobs forward operating bases hes trying to reach charlie charlie november which is sog command and control north at da nang but arizonasixzulu got a callback arizonasixzulu this is limaninermike at outpost hickory is that you puller

then over roger limaninermike said arizonasixzulu and out god bless and good luck arizonasixzulu out said lima and the freak crackled into nothingness man those guys are going to get roasted said donny this weather aint lifting for days you got that map case said swagger let me see that thing what were those coordinates shit i dont remember said donny well then said bob its a good thing i do he opened the case that donny shoved over went through the plasticwrapped sheaves of operational territory s and at last came to the one he wanted he studied hard then looked over you know goddamn if i aint a fool at map reading i do believe you and i are the closest unit to them special forces fellows they are west of us at kham due ten klicks out of laos we are in grid square whiskey charlie they are up in whiskey delta as i make it thats about twenty klicks to the west donny squinted his sergeant indeed had located the proper square and the special forces camp would therefore have been yes about twenty klicks butthere were foothills a wide brown snake of river and a mountain range between here and there all of it indian territory im figuring bob said one man moving fast he might just make it before the main force unit and those boys would have to move up through this here an loc valley you got into those hills youd have a hell of a lot of targets christ said donny you just might slow em up enough so that air could make it in when the weather broke a cold drop of rain deposited itself on donnys neck and plummeted down his back a shiver rose from his bones raise dodge again pork tell em im going on a little trip im going too said donny bob paused then he said my ass you are i wont have no shorttimer with me you hunker here call in extraction when the weather clears dont you worry none about me ill get into that camp and extract with arizona bob i no youre too short youd be too worried about getting whacked with three and days till deros and if you werent i would

somebody has to call in air who works the map for the coordinates and the radio suppose youre bounced from behind who takes out the fast movers who rigs the claymores you are fixing to git yourself killed lance corporal and much worse you are pissing me off beaucoup i am not bugging out i will not bug out bobs eyes narrowed he suspected all heroism and selfsacrifice because his own survival wasnt based on any sense of them but rather on shrewd professional combat skills even shrewder calculation of odds and shrewdest of all a sense that to be aggressive in battle was the key to coming out alive on the other side what are you trying to prove kid you been a hardass to prove something ever since i teamed with you im not trying to prove anything i want no slack thats all zero fucking slack i go all the way thats all there is when i get back to the world maybe then its different but out here goddamn it i go all the way his fierceness softened swagger whod coaxed many a boy through bad times with shit coming in whod gotten the grunts moving when the last thing they wanted to do was move who never lost a spotter to a body bag and lost a hell of a lot fewer young marines than some could say but this stubborn boy perplexed him all the way all the time only one of em who got up earlier than he did and who never once made a mistake on the pr emission equipment checks donny aint nobody going to ever say you bugged out im trying to cut you some room boy no sense dying on this one this is a bob show this is what old bob was put here to do it aint no college football game im going goddamn we are sierrabravofour and i am going man you sure you were born in the right generation you belong in the old breed you salty bastard with my dead old man okay lets gear up call it in im going to shoot us a goddamn compass reading to that grid square and when were done ill buy you a steak and a case of jack daniels donny took the moment to peel off his boonie cap and pull out the cellophanewrapped photo of julie he stared at it as the raindrops collected on the plastic she looked so dry and far away and he ached for her three and days till deros he would come home donny would come marching home again hurrah hurrah oh baby he said to himself oh baby i hope youre with me on this one every step of the way lets go pork sang bob the nailer chapter ten after a time donny stopped hurting he was beyond pain he was also ever so briefly beyond fear they traveled from landmark to landmark along swaggers charted compass readings over the slippery terrain the rain so harsh some time you could hardly breathe at one moment he was somewhat stunned to discover himself on the crest of a low hill when had they climbed it he had no memory of the ascent he just had the sense of the man ahead of him pulling him forward urging him on oblivious to both of their pains oblivious also to fear and to mud and to changes in the elevation after a while they came to a valley to discover the classical vietnam terrain of rice paddies separated by paddy dikes the dikes were muddy as shit and in a few minutes the going on them proved slow and treacherous swagger didnt even bother to tell him he just lifted his rifle over his head stepped off the break and started to fight through the water churning up mud as he went what difference could it make they were so wet it didnt matter but the water was thick and muddy and at each step the muddy bottom seemed to suck at donnys boots his feet grew heavier the rain fell faster he was wetter colder more fatigued more desperate more lonely at any moment some lucky kid with a carbine and a yen to impress his local cadre could have greased them but the rain fell so hard it drove even the vc and the main force nva units to cover they moved across a landscape devoid of human occupation the fog coiled and rolled once from afar the vapors parted and they saw a village a klick away down a hill and donny imagined what was going on in the warm little huts the boiling soup with its floating sheaves of bible tripe and brisket sliced thin and fish heads floating in it and the thought of hot food almost made him keel over this is nothing he told himself think of football think of twoadays in august no no think of games think of think of think of making the catch against oilman high think of third and twelve weve never beaten them but for some odd reason late in this game were close but now weve stalled think of setting up at tight end instead of running back because you have the best hands on the team think of julie a cheerleader in those days the concern on her face think of the silliness of it all it all seemed so important beating oilman why was that so important it was so silly then donny remembered why it was important because it was so silly it meant so little that it meant so much think of going off the set faking inside then breaking on a slant for the sidelines as vercolone the quarterback broke from his disintegrating pocket and began to rotate toward him curling around his arm cocked then uncocked as he released the ball think of the ball in the air think of seeing it float toward you vercolone had led you too much the ball was way out of reach there was no noise there was no sensation there was only the ball sliding past but think of how you went airborne that was the strange thing he did not ever remember leaping it just happened one of those instinct things as the computer in your head took over your body and off you went he remembered straining in the air and with his one hand stretched out to the horizon the slap of contact as the ball glanced off his longest fingers popped into the air and seemed to pause forever as he slid through the air by it now about to miss it but somehow he actually pivoted in air got his chest out to snare it as it fell then clasped his other hand against it pinning it to him as he thudded to the ground and by the grace of a god who must love jocks it did not pop out he had caught it for a first down and three plays later they scored and won the game beating an ancient enemy for the first time in living memory oh that was so very good that was so very good the warmth of that moment came flooding back across him its meaningless glory warming and giving him just the slightest tingle of energy maybe he would make it but then he went down floundering feeling the water flood into his lungs and he struggled coughing out buffalo shit and a million paramecium a harsh grip pulled him out and he shook like a wet dog it was swagger of course come on swagger yelled through the din of pounding rain were almost out of the paddies then all we got is another set of hills a river and a goddamn mountain damn aint this fun water according to the map the river was called la trang it bore no other name and on the paper was a squiggly black line its secrets unrevealed as it lay before them in reality however it was swollen brown and wide over spilling its banks and was a swift deadly current the rain smashed against its turbulent surface like machine gun fire guess what said swagger you just got a new job huh you just got a new job youre now the lifeguard why cause i caint swim a lick he said with a broad smile great said donny i cant either oh this ones going to be a pisser damn whyd you insist on this trip i was momentarily deluded into thinking i was important that kind of thinkinll git you killed every damn time now lets see if we can find some wood or something they ranged the dangerous bank of the river and in time came to a bombedout village the gunships and phantoms had worked it over pretty well nothing could have survived the hell of that recent day no structure stood only timbers piles of ash liquified to gunk in the pounding rain craters everywhere a long smear of burned vegetation where the napalm splashed through killing everything it touched a cooking pot lay on its side speared by a machine gun bullet so that it blossomed outward in jagged petals the stench of the burning still clung to the ground despite the rain there were no bodies but just out of the kill zone a batch of newly dug graves with nowdead buddhist incense reeds in cheap black jars had been etched into the ground two were very very small i hope they were bad guys said donny looking at the new cemetery if we run this fucking war right swagger said wed have known they was bad because wed have people on the ground up close not this shit not just hosing the place down with firepower nobody should have to die because hes in the wrong place at the wrong time and some squid pilots got some ordnance left and dont want to land on no carrier with it donny looked at him in five months of extreme togetherness bob had never said a thing about the way the war was waged what it cost who it killed why it happened his instead was the practical craft of mission and its close pal survival how to do this thing where to hide how to track what to shoot how to kill how to get the job done and come back alive well nobodyll ever know thats for goddamn sure said bob unless you get out of this shit hole and you tell em you got that pork thats your new mos witness you got that familiar again where was this from what did this mean what sounded so right about it the same melody slightly different instrument ill tell em cause im too dumb to tell em theyll never listen to a hillbilly like me theyll listen to you boy cause you looked the goddamn elephant in the eye and came back to talk about it got that got it good now lets scare up some wood and build us noahs ark they scrounged in the ruins and came up after a bit with seven decent pieces of wood which bob rigged together in some clever boy scout way with a coil of black rope he carried he lashed his and donnys rifles the two packs and harnesses all the grenades the map case the canteens the prc the flares and flare gun and the pistols to it okay you really cant swim i can sort of well i can a bit too the deal is you cling hard to this thing and you kick hard ill be on the other side keep your face out of the water and keep on fighting no matter what and dont let go the currentll take you and youll be one dead puppy dog and nobodyll remember your name till they inscribe it on some monument and the pigeons come shit on it aint that a pretty thought very pretty so lets do it pork you just became a submariner the water was intensely cold and stronger than zeus in the first second donny panicked floundered almost pulled the rickety raft over and only bobs strength on the other side kept them afloat the raft floated diagonally across and the swiftness and anger of the river had it in an instant and donny clinging with both desperate hands to the rope lashings bob had juryrigged felt swept away taken by it the coldness everywhere his feet flailed touched nothing he sank a bit and it gushed down his throat and he coughed and leaped like a seal freeing himself it was all water above and beneath his chin in the stuff his eyes and face pelted by it as it fell from the gray sky at a brutal velocity kick goddammit he heard bob scream and with his legs he began a kind of strangely rhythmic breaststroke the craft seemed to spurt ahead just a bit but there came a moment when it was all gone fog obscured the land and he felt he was thrashing across an ocean the english channel at the very least a voyage that had forgotten its beginning and couldnt imagine its ending the water lured him downward to its black numbness he could feel it sucking at him fighting toward his throat and his lungs and it stank of napalm gunpowder aviation fuel buffalo shit peasants who sold you a coke by day and cut your throat by night dead kids in ditches flaming vines friendlyfire casualties the whole fucking unstoppable momentum of the last eight years and who was he to fight it just another grunt a lance corporal and former corporal with a shaky past it seemed so huge so vast it seemed like history itself fight it goddammit came swaggers call from the other side and then he knew who bob was bob was trigs brother bob and trig were almost the same man somehow despite their differing backgrounds they were the aristocrats of the actual singled out by dna to do things others couldnt to be heroes in the causes they gave their lives to to be always and forever remembered they were odin and zeus they were dangerously special they got things done they had an incredible vitality and life force the war would kill them thats why both had commanded him to be the witness he now saw it was his job to survive and sing the story of the two mad brothers bob and trig consumed in devoured by killed in the war trig was dead trig had blown himself up at the university of wisconsin along with some pitiful graduate assistant who happened to be working late that night they found trigs body smashed and ruptured by the explosive it made him famous briefly a freak of headlines harvard grad dies in blast carter family scion kills self in bomb blast trig carter the gentle avian painter turned martyr to the cause of peace it had killed trig as trig had known it would thats what trig was telling him that last night now he understood he had to make it back to tell the story of trig and his mad brother bob eaten each in his own way by the war would it ever be over someone had him he swallowed and looked and swagger was yanking him from the water to the shore where he collapsed heaving with exhaustion now hear this the smoking light is now lit said bob from the wet river through the wet rain they finally reached the mountain it wasnt a great mountain donny had seen greater mountains in his time in the desert hed even climbed some swagger said he was from mountain country too but donny had never heard of mountains in the south or oklahoma or arkansas or whatever mysterious backwoods the sniper hailed from the mountain was dense with foliage over hard rock wide open to observation from hundreds of meters out pick your poison oh christ said donny looking at the steep slope time had no meaning it seemed to be twilight but it could have been dawn he looked upward and the water pelted him in the face i want to get halfway up in the next two hours bob said i dont think i can gulped donny i dont think i can either said bob and whats worse if that goddamn main force battalion is in the area heading on that base camp theyre sure to have security out just the thing to keep boys like us out of their hair i cant do it donny said i caint do it neither said swagger but its gotta be done and i dont see no two other boys here do you if i saw two others believe me id send them yessirree oh shit donny said well look at it this way we only got where we got cause we came through full monsoon we go back when the rains dry up victor c gonna come out hes gonna find us hes gonna kill us we werent invited into his goddamn yard and hes gonna be plenty pissed so we gotta make that special forces base camp or we are going to die out here for sure thats just about the size of that piece of shit and thats all there is to it he smiled not out of happiness or glee but possibly because he was too exhausted to do anything else wish i had a dexedrine he said but i dont believe in that shit came back from my second tour with a monkey the size of a ape on my butt had to work like hell to kill that furry bastard too now that wasnt much fun at all the man wasnt in vietnam in some sense he was vietnam hed done it all sniped raided taken hills led recons worked intel advised arvn units run interrogations done analysis fought in a thousand firefights killed who knew how many visited hospitals talked to generals he was one part of his whole goddamned generation rolled into one this was entirely new but unsurprising hed been a speed freak maybe hed done heroin maybe hed caught the clap maybe hed been tattooed maybe hed murdered prisoners he was trig at least in the way that hed done everything to win the war that trig had done in his parallel universe to end it a furious relentless crusade presaged on the obsolete notion that one man could make a difference you remind me of a guy donny said oh yeah some hillbilly on the radio lum or the other one abner they come from my hometown no believe it or not a peacenik oh a commie he has long hair and looked like jesus his shit didnt stink i bet mine does but good pork no he was like you a hero he was bigger than the rest of us he was a legend to be a legend dont you have to be dead aint that part of the job description he is dead he managed to get his ass wasted demonstrating against the war now that do take some kind of genius level intelligence and i remind you of him son you must have the fever bad he just wouldnt quit there wasnt any quit in him yeah well theres plenty of quit in me pork one more job then i am going to quit for the rest of my life now lets just git a move on which way we go up the switchbacks theyll bounce us only one way straight up christ well eat picnic time itll be the last meal you git till this is over or you get killed and you get a nice steak in heaven dump your crats and your canteens and your use your entrenching tool set it at the angle we going to use it to pull our way up you got that i dont sure you do watch me quickly and expertly he shed himself of most of his gear only the weapons remained he fished a crat out of his dumped pack and quickly used his can opener to whip up cold eggs and ham which he gobbled quickly go on chow time eat something donny set out to do the same and in a few seconds was pulling down the barbecued pork cold but flavorful when were done you gimme the radio i aint carrying as much weight ill take your rifle the hell you will nobody touches the rifle but me of course the basic rule he remembered when swagger had come looking for him sitting forlornly on outpost duty at a forward observation post his third week at dodge city you fenn uh yeah uh sergeant swagger names swagger im the sniper donny had a momentary intake of breath in the dark he could hardly see him just a fierce wraith of a man sheathed in darkness speaking in a dense southern accent bob the nailer the one with the pi astre bounty on his head and over thirty kills donny had the sense that all was quiet that the other men had just willed themselves to nothingness out of fear or respect for bob the nailer though he could not see the snipers eyes donny knew they burned at him and ate him up i just put my spotter on a medevac back to the world with a hole in his leg said the sniper im looking for a replacement you shot expert you have the highest get at dodge you have twentyten vision you done a tour won a medal so you been shot at some and wont panic all that dont mean shit you was at eighth and i that means you done the ceremonial stuff which means you have a patience for detail work and a willingness to be an unnoticed part of a bigger team i need that you interested me i good perks ill get you steak and all the bourbon you can drink when were in we live like kings ill keep you off crap like night watch and ambush patrols and forward observation and shitburning details ill get you rr anywhere you want bad shit a you dont touch the rifle nobody touches the rifle b you dont do drugs i catch you with a buzz on i ship you home under guard and youll spend two years in portsmouth c you dont call nobody gook clink slope or zip these are the very finest soldiers in the world they are winning and they will win we kill them but by god we kill them with respect those are the only three rules but they aint to be bent or even breathed hard on or you can sit here in this shit hole waiting for someone to drop a mortar shell on your head and somehow i got a feeling every shit detail every shit patrol every pieceofcrap garbage job that comes up youre number one on the fuck list i hope you like the stink of burning shit because youre going to smell a lot of it back in the world i had some problems said donny i got a bad rap i wouldnt cooperate i figured it from your jacket some kind of infraction of orders you lost your rating hey kid this aint the world this is the nam have you noticed it dont mean shit to me you got that you do the jobs i give you one hundred percent and ill back you one hundred percent you may get killed you will work hard but you will have fun killing people is lots of fun now you want in or what i guess im in within thirty minutes donny had been relieved of duty and moved into the scoutsniper squad bay with ssgt swagger ncoicor as some called him ncgic noncommissioned god in chargeand the only man whose word mattered anywhere in the world he had never broken one of the rules until now he had weighed each m round swagger carried against the oneinamillion chance of an offcharge at lake city he had cleaned bobs and grease gun and his own m and he shined and dried the jungle boots he laid out and assembled the gear before each mission he polished the lens of the spotting scope he checked the pins on the grenades the plastic canteens for mildew he handenameled the brass on the gear dead black he did laundry he learned elevation windage and range estimation he kept range cards he filled out afteraction reports he studied the operating area maps like a sacred text he handled flank security and once killed two nvc who were infiltrating around bobs position he learned prc protocol and maintenance he worked like hell and he had never broken one of the rules only bob touched the rifle bob broke it down after each mission cleaned it to the tiniest crevice scrubbed it dry re zeroed it treated it like a baby or a mistress he and only he could touch or carry the rifle it aint i dont trust you it aint you drop it and it gets knocked out of zero and you dont tell me and i miss a shot and somebody probably me gets killed its just that the bedrock here is simple clear powerful and helps us both nobody touches the rifle but me good fences make good neighbors ever hear that one i think so well the rifle rule is my fence got that i do entirely sergeant you call me sergeant around the lifers here in dodge in the field you call me bob or swagger or whatever the hell you want dont call me sergeant in the field one of them boys might be listening and he might decide to kill me because he heard you call me sergeant got that pork i do and he had never forgotten that rule or any of the rules until now i forgot he said in the rain to swagger about the rifle damn fenn i was just getting to like you too i thought you se going to work out bob said needling him ever so gently but then it was back to mission okay you done eating you got your shit wired in tight this is it over this hill through their security and then sleep a bit comes morning we get to do some shooting bob went first down to soaked tiger camos and boonie cap his rifle slung upside down on his back he carried the m grease gun in one hand and the entrenching tool in the other and he used the tool as a kind of hook to sink into roots of trees or the tangles of vegetation to get himself up the steep incline a few more feet he moved with slow almost calm deliberation the rain fell still in torrents in the darkening gloom and it rattled off the leaves and against the mud how could it rain so hard so long was god ending the world washing away vietnam and its sins its atrocities its arrogances and follies it seemed that way donny was fifty yards to the left doing the same trick but behind swagger and working carefully not to get ahead bob was the eyes up front to the right donnys responsibility was behind and to the left the flank he was on but he saw nothing just felt the chill of the biting rain and felt the weight of the m one of the last few left in the nam for this job really the plastic m would have been more ideally suited but bob hated the things calling them poodle shooters and wouldnt let a man in his unit carry them every now and then bob would halt them with a raised right hand and both men would drop low to the ground hidden in the foliage waiting clinging desperately against the incline but each time whatever bob had noticed proved to be nothing a false alarm and they continued their steady slow climb twice they crossed paths switchbacks etched into the vegetation and bob waited for five minutes before allowing them out on the open ground even for the seconds or so that it exposed them the darkness was falling it was harder and harder to see the jungle far from relaxing as they climbed actually seemed to be getting denser there was a time when donny felt himself cut off entirely from bob and a shot of panic came to him what if he got lost what would he do he would wander these ghostly mountains until they caught him and killed him or he wore down and starved you boys aint so tough he heard from somewhere and realized it was a mocking memory of a football coach somewhere back in his complicated athletic career no we aint so tough he thought we never said we were we just tried to do our job that was all but then he came out of the rubberysmelling thorns that had swallowed him and saw a figure to the right and recognized it for its caution and precision of movement to be bob he started to riseno nobobs hand was up urgently signaling him still and back he froze and dropped on his belly low to the ground even as bob himself did the same he waited nothing no just the sound of the rain some occasional thunder now and then a streak of distant lightning it seemed sothe next thing he was aware of motion on his left he did not move he did not breathe how had swagger seen them how did he know what gave them away another step and it was all over but somehow out of some trick of instinct or predators preternatural nerve endings bob had stunned him into silence and motionlessness a second before they arrived before him the men passed by no more than ten feet away sliding effortlessly through the foliage and the undergrowth he could smell them before he could see them they had the odor of fish and rice for that was what they ate they were small bandylegged guys the pros of the army of the republic of north vietnam a point man a squad leader a squad in file picking its way carefully through the jungle high above the last path twelve of them they were bent forward under beige rain capes and wore regulation dark green uniforms those absurd pith helmets and carried aks and complete combat gearpacks canteens and bayonets three or four of them wore rpgs the hellish rocket grenades strapped to their backs he had never been so close to the actual enemy they seemed almost magical or mythological somehow the phantoms of so many nightmares at last given flesh they terrified him if he moved or coughed it was over theyd turn and fire whole minutes before he could get his m into action he had a bad thought of himself dying up here at the hands of these tough little monkeymen sliding so confidently through the rain and the jungle that were exhausting him almost as if one were talking to him he heard the silence breaking a few feet away ahn i mua nhieu qua phai roi chac khqng c nguoi my dm nay came the buddys bitter answer both voices propelled by the explosive lung energy of vietnamese so foreign to american ears and which sounded almost like belches bihn sii dung noi nghe came a sharp cry from the head of the unit a sergeant the same the world over and whatever the army clamping down on his naughty grunts the patrol moved slowly along in the dying light and the falling rain then slowly disappeared around a bend in the slope but bob held donny still for a good ten minutes before giving the okay excruciating seconds of deathlike stillness in the cold and wet which cramped the muscles and hurt the brain but at last bob motioned and he slowly uncoiled and began to move up again gradually bob navigated his way over you okay yeah how the hell did you see them the point mans canteen jingled against his bayonet i heard it thats all luck man its better to be lucky than good who were they thats flank security from a main force battalion that means were getting close they put out security teams when they move a big unit through same as us the sergeant had flashes for the number three battalion i dont know what regiment or nothing but i think the biggest unit up this ways was the th infantry division man they close down that special forces camp tomorrow the rain stays bad they could get to dodge city the day or so after tomorrow is this some big offensive theres several newly vietnamized units there itd do em a lot of good to kick all that arvn ass great i wonder what they were saying the first one says man its raining like shit and his buddy says aint no americans coming out in this and the sarge yells back hey you guys shut up and keep moving you speak vietnamese donny said in wonderment picked up a little not much but i can get by come on lets get out of here we got to rest big day tomorrow we kick butt and take names you bet on it marine chapter eleven fob arizona was in bad trouble puller had lost nineteen men already and the vc had gotten mortars up close over to the west and were pounding the shit out of them so that he couldnt maneuver and that main force unit would be in tomorrow at the latest but worse hed sent out matthews with a fourman assault unit to take out the mortars and matthews hadnt come back jim matthews three tours msgt jim matthews benning the zone one of the old guys who dated all the way back to korea had done everythinggone the rage of it flared deep in major pullers angry angry brain this wasnt supposed to be happening goddamn them this wasnt supposed to be happening kham due was way out on its lonesome near laos where it had fed in crossborder recon teams for years but was largely invulnerable because of the umbrella or air power so the nva didnt even bother with main force units close by where had this one come from he was feeling very custerlike that sick moment when he suddenly realized he was up against hundreds maybe thousands and where the hell had this weather come from and how fast could this bigass toughasshit battalion get down here oh he wants us he smells our blood he wants us pullers antagonist was a slick operator named huu co thahn a senior colonel commanding no battalion rd infantry regiment th infantry division fifth peoples shock army puller had seen his picture knew his resume from a wealthy sophisticated indo french family and even a graduate of the ecole militaire in paris before deserting to the north in sixtyone after revulsion at the excesses of the diem regime he had become one of their most able field grade military commanders a sure general a mortar shell fell outside close by and dust shook from the rafters of the command post anybody hit he called no sir came his sergeants reply the bastards missed any word from matthews no sir major richard w puller pulled on his boonie cap and slithered out the dugout door to the trench and looked around at his shaky empire he was a lean desperate man with a thatch of gray hair and had been in fifth special forces since including a tour in the british special air service regiment even seeing some counterinsurgency action in malaysia hed been to all the right schools airborne ranger jungle national war college command and staff at leavenworth he could fly a chopper speak vietnamese repair a radio or fire an rpg this was not his first siege he had been encircled at pleiku in for more than a month under serious bombardment hed been hit then a chinese caliber machine gun bullet which would kill most men he hated the war but he loved it he feared it would kill him but a part of him wanted it never to end he loved his wife but had had a string of chinese and eurasian mistresses he loved the army but hated it also the former for its guts and professionalism the latter for its stubbornness its insistence always of fighting the next war by the tactics of the old but what he hated most of all was that he had fucked up he had realty fucked up gambling the lives of his team and all his in digs that the nva couldnt get him during his window of vulnerability he was responsible for it all it was happening to them because it was happening to him and nobody could save his ass the main gate was down and where his ammo dump had been smoke still boiled from the ground rising to mingle with the low clouds that hung everywhere the sshops were a shambles as were most of the squad but a unit of vc sappers that had gotten into the compound the night before and actually taken over the third squad staging area and what remained of the commo shack had been finally dislodged in handtohand with the dawn no structure remained most of the wire still stood but for now that was the mortar objective to pound avenues into his defenses so that when huu co and his battalion got here they wouldnt get hung up in the shit as they came over him backed by their own mortars and a complement of crewserved weapons puller looked up and caught rain in the eye and felt the chill of the mist night was falling would they come at night theyd move at night but probably not attack at least not in force theyd send probers draw fire try and get arizona to use up its low supplies of ammo on bad or unseen targets but mainly work to keep the defenders rattled and sleepless for the no battalion would the weather break on the armed forces net the meteorological forecasts were not promising but puller knew theyd try like hell and if they could get birds up theyd get em up but maybe the pilots were reluctant whod want to fly into heavy smallarms fire to drop napalm on a few more dinks when the war was so close to being over whod want to die now at the very tag end of the thing after all the years and all the futility he didnt know the answer to that one himself puller looked down his front to the valley he could see nothing in the gloom of course but it was a highway and huu co would be barreling down it at the double time like a fat cat in a limousine knowing they ran no danger from the phantoms or the gunships major puller major puller you ought to come see this quick it was sergeant bias one of his master sergeants who worked with the montagnards a tough little guamese who had seen a lot of action on too many tours and also didnt deserve to get caught in a shit hole like fob arizona so late in a lost and fruitless war bias led him through the trenches to the west side of the perimeter crouching now and then when a new mortar shell came whistling their way but at last they reached the parapet and a montagnard with a carbine handed puller a pair of binocs puller used them to peer over the sandbags and saw in the treeline three hundred meters out something that was at first indecipherable but at last assembled itself into a pattern and then some details it was a stick and on the stick was jim matthewss head three quicksand one slow three strongs that was the rhythm the slow steady pace of accomplishment over the long years and the long bleeding now he was under pressure great pressure for one last quick far off the diplomats were talking there would be a peace soon and the more they controlled when that peace was signed the more they would retain afterward and the more they could build upon for a future he knew he would never see but his children might he knew he would not survive his children would be his monument he would leave a new world behind for them having done his part in destroying the terrible old one that was enough for any father and his life did not particularly matter he had given himself up to struggle to tomorrow to the ten rules of the soldiers life defend the fatherland fight and sacrifice myself for the peoples revolution obey the orders received and carry out the mission of the soldier strive to improve the virtues of a revolutionary soldier study to improve myself and build up a powerful revolutionary army carry out other missions of the army help consolidate internal unity preserve and save public properties work for the solidarity between the army and the people maintain the quality and honor of the revolutionary soldier all that remained was this last job the american green beret camp at kham due at the end of the an loc valley which must be eliminated in order to take more land before documents were signed three quicks one slow three strongs slow plan quick advance strong fight strong assault strong pursuit quick clearance quick withdrawal he had developed the plan over three years of operations gaining constant intelligence on the e sector of administrative division mr knowing that as the war wound down it would do it was explained to him by higher headquarters and as he himself understood to make an example of one of the camps quick advance that is where no battalion was now the men were seasoned toughened campaigners with long battle experience they moved quickly from their sanctuary in laos and were now less than twenty kilometers from the target which was already under assault by local viet cong infrastructure under specific orders from hanoi and from whom he got combat intelligence over the radio the column moved in the classical structure of an army on the quick derived not entirely from the great giap father of the army but also from the french genius napoleon who understood when no one in history since alexander had the importance of quickness and who slashed across the world on that principle so huu co senior colonel had elements of his best troops his sappers running security on each flank a mile out in two twelvemen units per flank he had his second best people also sappers at the point in a diamond formation all armed with automatic weapons and rpgs setting the pace ready to deliver grenades and withering fire at any obstacles his other companies moved in column by fours at the double time rotating the weight of the heavy mortars among them by platoons so that no unit was more fatigued than any other fortunately it was cool the rain was no impediment the men superbly trained shorn of slackers and wreckers by long years of struggle were the most dedicated moreover they were excited because the weather was holding low clouds fog everywhere their most feared and hated enemy the american airplanes nowhere in sight that was the key to move freely almost as if in the last century without the fear of phantoms or skyhawks screaming in and dropping their napalm and white phosphorous that is why he hated the americans so much they fought with flame it meant nothing to them to burn his people like grasshoppers plaguing a harvest yet those who stood against the flame as he had became hardened beyond imagination he who has stood against flame fears nothing huu co senior colonel was fortyfour years old sometimes memories of the old life floated up before him paris in the late forties and early fifties when his decadent father had turned him over to the french under whose auspices he studied hard but paris the pleasures of paris who could forget such a place that was a revolutionary city and it was there he first smoked gauloise read marx and engels and proust and sartre and nietzsche and apollinaire it was there his commitment to the old world the world of his father began to crumble at first in small almost meaningless ways did the french have to be so nasty to their yellow guests did they have to take such pleasure in their whiteness while preaching the oneness of man under the eye of god did they have to take such pleasure in rescuing bright indochinese like himself from their yellow ness but even still he wondered now would i have followed this course had i known how hard it would be huu co senior colonel fought in seven battles and three campaigns with the french in the first indochinese war he loved the french soldiers tough hardened men brave beyond words who truly believed theirs was the right to master the land they had colonized they could understand no other way he lay in the mud with them at dien bien phu in eighteen years ago praying for the americans to come and rescue them with their mighty air power huu co senior colonel learned the catholic god from them moved south and fought for the diem brothers in building a bulwark against the godless uncle ho in he led an infantry platoon against the binh xuyen in violent street fighting then later against the hoa hao cult in the mekong and was present at the execution of the cults leader ba cut in much of the killing he saw was of indochinese by indochinese it sickened him saigon was no paris either though it had cafes and nightclubs and beautiful women it was a city of corruption of prostitutes gambling crime narcotics which the diems not only encouraged but also from which they profited how could he love the diems if they loved silk perfume their own power and pomp more than the people they ruled whom they yet felt themselves removed from and immensely superior to his father counseled him to forgive them their arrogances and to use them as a vessel for carrying gods will but his father never saw the politics the corruption the terrible way they abused the peasants the remove from the people huu co went north in when the diems corruption had begun to resemble that of a city destroyed in the bible he renounced his catholicism his inherited wealth and his father whom he would never see again he knew the south would sink into treachery and profiteering and would bring flame and retribution upon itself as it had he was a humble private in the peoples revolutionary army he who had sat in cafes and once met the great sartre and de beauvoir at the deux maggots in the fourteenth arrondisement he a major in the army of the republic of south vietnam became a lowly private carrying an sks and wanting to do nothing but his duty to the fatherland and the future and seek purification but his gifts always betrayed him he was always the best soldier among them and he rose effortlessly though now without ambition he was a student officer after two years and his passage in the west and in the south after six months strenuous reeducation in a camp outside hanoi where he withstood the most barbarous pressures and purified himself for the revolutionary struggle only toughened him for the decade of war that was to follow now he was tired he had been at war since twentytwo years of war it was almost over really all that remained was the camp called arizona and between himself and it there stood nothing no unit no aircraft no artillery he would crush it nothing could stop him chapter twelve in the dream he had caught a touchdown pass a slant outside and as he broke downfield all the blockers hit their men perfectly and the defense went down like tenpins opening lanes toward the end zone it was geometry somehow or at least a physical problem reduced to the abstract very pleasing and far from the reality which was that you ran on instinct and hardly ever remembered things exactly he got into the end zone people cheered it was so very warm julie hugged him his dad was there weeping for joy trig was there also among them jumping up and down and so was sergeant bob lee swagger the sniper god a figure of preposterous joy as he pirouetted crazily laden with firearms and dappled in a war face of camouflage it was such a good dream it was the best the happiest the finest dream he ever had and it went away as such things do to the steady pressure of someone rocking his arm and the sudden baffling awareness that he was not there but here huh time to work pork donny blinked and smelled the wet odor of jungle the wet odor of rain and felt the wet cold swagger had already turned from him and was off making his arcane preps the dawn came as a blur of light just the faintest smear of incandescence to the east over the mountains on the other side of the valley in its way it was quite beautiful in that low light vapors of fog clung to the wet earth everywhere in valleys and hollows and gulches nestled thickly in the trees and though it wasnt at present raining surely it would rain soon for the low clouds still rolled over heavy with moisture still so quiet so calm so pristine come on whispered swagger into donny fenns ear donny shook sleep from his eyes and put his dreams of julie aside and reconfirmed his existence he was on a hillside in heavy foliage above the an loc valley near kham due and laos it would be another wet day and the weather had not broken so there would be no air we got to get lower said bob i cant hit nothing from up here the sergeant now wore the m grease gun on his back and in his hands carried the m sniper rifle a dull pewter remington with a thick bull barrel and a dull brown wooden stock it carried a redfield scope and a marine corps armorer had labored over it free floating the barrel truing up the bolt to the chamber glassbedding the action to the wood torquing the screws tight but it was still far from an elegant weapon built merely for effectiveness never beauty bob had smeared the jungle grease paint on his face and under the crinkled brow of the boonie cap his visage looked primitive he seemed a creature sprung from someones worst dreams some kind of atavistic war creature totally of the jungle festooned with pistols and grenades all smeared with the colors of nature even his eyes gone to nothing here paint up and well get going he said holding the stick of camo paint out to donny who quickly blurred his own features donny gathered his m and the impossibly heavy prc his real enemy in all this and began to ease his way down the slope with bob it seemed they were lowering themselves into the clouds like angels returning to earth the fog would not break it clung to the floor of the valley as if it had been enameled there no sun would burn it away not today at any rate now and then some jungle bird would call now and then some animal shudder would ripple from the undergrowth but there was no sense of human presence nothing metallic or regular to the eye donny scanned left bob scanned right they moved ever so slowly frustratingly slowly picking their way down until at last they were nearly to the valley floor and a field of waisthigh grass in the center of which a worn track had been beaten by men or buffaloes or elephants or whatever from far away at last came some kind of unnatural noise donny couldnt identify it and then he could it was the noise of men somehownothing distinct not breaking talk disciplinesomehow become a herd a living breathing thing it was no battalion still a few hundred yards away gearing up for the last six or so klicks of quick march to the staging area for their assault bob halted him with a hand okay he said heres how we do it you got the map coords donny did he had memorized them grid square whiskeydelta good if the sky clears and the birds come youll have line of sight tothem and you can go to the air force freak and you talk em in they wont have good visuals you talk em down into the valley and have em plaster the floor what about you youll be dont you worry about that no squid phantom jock is flaming me i can take care of myself now listen up that is your goddamn job you talk to em on the horn youre the eyes dont you be coming down after me you got that you may hear fighting you may hear small arms dont you fret a bit thats my job yours is to stay up here and talk to the air after the air moves out you should be able to git to that snakeeater camp you call them tell them youre coming in pop smoke and come in from the smoke so they know its you and not some nva hero got that you should be okay if i can hold these bad boys up for a bit what about security im security my job is to help you to cover your ass what the hell good am i going to do parked up here listen pork ill fire my first three shots when i get visuals then ill move back to the right maybe two hundred yards because theyll bring heavy shit down ill try and do two three maybe four more from there heres how the game works i pull down on a couple then i move back but guess what after the third string i aint moving back im moving forward thats why i want you right here ill never be too far from this area i dont want em to know how many guys i am and theyll flank me and i dont want em coming around on me i guarantee you they will have good tough fastmoving flank people out so you go to ground about twenty minutes after i first hit them they may be right close to you thats all right you dig in and sink into the ground and youll be all right just watch out for the patrols i know theyll call in them boys we saw last night theyll be back that i guarantee you will get killed you will get killed im telling you you cannot im giving you a straight order you follow it dont give me no littleboy shit im telling you what you have to do and by god you will do it and thats all there is to it or i will be one pissedoff motherfucker lance corporal fenn i you do it goddammit fenn you do it and thats all there is to it or i will have you up on charges and instead of going home youll go to portsmouth this was bullshit of course and donny saw through it in a second it was all bullshit because if swagger went into the valley without security he was not coming back he simply was not thats what the physics of firepower decreed and the physics of firepower were the iron realities of war there was no appeal he was throwing his life away for some strangers in a camp hed never see he knew it had known it all along it was his way more like trig hungry to die as if the war were so inside him he knew he could not live without it there would be no life to go home to he had kept himself hard and pure just for this one mad moment when he could take on a battalion with a rifle and if he could not live it was also clear that he would fight to the very end it was as if he knew there would be no place for warriors in any other world and so he may as well embrace his fate not dodge it jesus bob you got it square yes you are a good kid you go back to the world and that beautiful girl you go to her and you put all this bad bullshit behind you do you copy roger roger time to hunt sierrabravofour last transmission and out and with the snipers gift for subtle swift movement bob then seemed to vanish he slithered off down the hill to the low fog without looking back bob worked down through the foliage aware that he was clicking into the zone he had to put it all behind him there could be nothing in his head except mission no other memories or doubts no tremor of hesitation to play across the nerves of his shooting he tried to get into his war face to become in some way war it was a gift his people had his father had won the medal of honor in the big one against the japs messy business on iwo jima and then come home to get the blue ribbon from harry truman and get blowed out of his socks ten years later by a noaccount piece of trash in a cornfield there were other soldiers in the line too hard proud men true sons of arkansas who had two gifts to shoot and see something die and to work like hogs the long hot day it wasnt much its what they had but there was also a cloud of melancholy attached to the clanoff and on over the swagger generations back to that strange fellow and his wife whod shown up in tennessee in from who knew where theyd been a line of killers and lonely boys exiles there was a blackness in them hed seen it in his father who never spoke of war and was as beloved as a man in a backwater like blue eye arkansas could be even more so than sam vincent the county prosecutor or harry etheridge the famous congressman but his father would have black dog days he could hardly talk or stir hed sit in the dark and just stare out at nothing what was dogging him the war some sense of his own luck a feeling for the fragility of it memories of all the bullets that had been fired at him and the shells and how nothing had hit him in his vitals that kind of luck had to run out and daddy knew it but he went out anyway and it killed him what could save you nothing if it was in the cards by god it was in the cards and daddy knew that and faced up to it like a man looked it in the eyes and spat in its blackcat face until at last it reared up and bit him in a cornfield on the polk county line nothing could save you bob pressed on sliding deeper into the fog odd how it clung like clouds of wet wool hed never seen anything like it in the nam and this here was his third tour the fear began to eat at him as it always did some fools said he had no fear he was such a hero but that only proved how little they knew the fear was like a cold lump of bacon grease in his stomach hard and wet and slick that he could taste and feel at all times you could not make it go away you could not ignore it and anybody who said you could was the worst damned kind of fool go on be scared he ordered himself let it rip this may be it but the one thing that scared him most of all wasnt dying not really it was the idea of not doing the job that was something to fear in the heart he would do the job by god that he would trees he slid through them tree to tree his eyes working testing looking for possibilities a hide a fallback a line of movement not under fire a good field of fire damn this fog could he even see them could he read ranges gauge the drop on the long shots cover or just concealment where was the sun nope didnt matter no sun a thin cold rain had begun to fall how would that affect the trajectory what was the wind the humidity how wet was the stock of the rifle had it bloated and was now some little swollen knot rubbing secretly against the barrel fucking up his point of impact had the scope sprung a leak and was now a tube of fog worthless leaving him with nothing or were there nva ahead had they heard him coming were they laughing as he bumbled closer were they drawing a bead even as he considered the possibility he tried to exile the fear as he had exiled his own past and future and concentrate on the mechanical the aspect of craft that lay before him how he would reload fast enough if it came to that since the remingtons didnt have no stripper clips and the m had to be threaded in one round at a time should he set up his two claymores to cover his flanks he didnt think he had time help me he prayed to a god he wasnt sure existed maybe some old gunny up there above the clouds just watching out for bad boys like him on desperate jobs for people who didnt even know his name he halted he was in trees had good tree cover and good fog a fallback to a hilltop and then he could cut back the other direction professionally he saw that this was it a perfect choke point with targets in the open fog to cover him a rare opportunity to get at the nva in the open lots of ammunition if this is it by god then this is it he thought settling in behind a fallen tree literally slipping into a bush as he squirmed to find a good position he found his prone and although he couldnt get one leg flat on the ground for the gouge of a rock or a stump he got most of his body down drawing stability from the earth itself the rifle was back and in left grip lightly on the forearm sling tight as it ran from the wood lashed around that forearm and headed tautly to the stock right hand on the small of the stock finger still off the trigger breathing easy trying to stay cool another day at the office he was situated so no light would reflect off his lens the trees around him would muffle and defuse the sound of the shots in the first minutes anyhow no one would be able to figure out where the shots were coming from he slid his eye behind the scope finding the proper three inches of relief nothing it was like peering into a bowl of cream drifting whiteness the outline of two or three scrub trees no sense of the hills forming the other side of the valley a slight downward angle into vertigo nothing stood out from which to estimate range he checked his watch hours they would be along soon not moving quite so quickly because of the fog but confident that it hid them and that in hours theyd be in possession of arizona so come on you bastards what are you waiting for then he saw one it was the hunters thrill after the long stalk that magical moment when the connection between hunter and hunted fragile as a china horse first establishes itself blood rushed through him old buck fever everybody gets it when they see the beast they will kill and eat thats how primordial it is i will not eat you he thought but by god i will kill you more emerged jesus christ the first thin line of sappers in cloth hats with foliage attached rifles at the high port eyes strained at maximum alertness more tightly bunched an infantry platoon battle ready caped and pithhelmeted chest web gear green bata boots and aks type and no other identifying insignia the platoon leaders at the front behind them in a tight little knot the staff their ranks unrecognizable in the muddy uniforms you never saw this a north vietnamese infantry battalion moving at the halftrot through a choke point in tight formation not spread out for four thousand meters or broken down and moving in cells to reassemble under dark the pilots never saw it the photos never got it the nva goddamn their cold professional souls were too quick too subtle too disciplined too smart for such movement they moved at night in small units then reassembled or they moved through tunnels or in bombfree cambo or laos always careful risking nothing knowing surely that the longer they bled the american beast the better their chances became possibly no american had seen such a thing the co was pushing them hard gambling that he could beat the weather whack out arizona and be gone speed was his greatest ally the bleak weather his next the rain fell harder pelting the ground but it did not stop the north vietnamese who seemed not to notice onward they came he snicked off the safety and through the scope hunted for an officer a radio operator an ammunition bearer with rpgs an nco a machinegun team leader the targets drifted before him floating through the crucifer of the crosshairs that he was about to kill never occurred to him the way his mind worked he thought only that he was about to shoot finally you little brother an officer youngish with the three stars of a captain lieutenant at the head of an infantry platoon he would go first then back swiftly to a radio operator then swing left as you run the bolt and go for the guy with the chicom rpd put him down then fall back that was the plan and any plan was better than no plan the reticle of the redfield scope wobbled downward bouncing ever so slightly tracking the first mark staying with him as the shooter took his long breath hissed a half of it out found bone to lock under the rifle told himself again to keep the gun moving as he fired prayed to god for mercy for all snipers and felt the trigger break cleanly chapter thirteen gooooooood morning vietnam said the guy on vt captain taneys portable and hello to all you guys out there in the rain well fellas ive got some bad news looks like that old mr sun is still awol thats ua for you leathernecks nobodys gonna stop the rain today but itll be great for the flowers and maybe mr victor charles will stay indoors himself today because his mommy wont let him outside to play what a moron said captain taney arizonas xo the weather should break tonight as a high pressure zone over the sea of japan looks like its making a beeline for shit said puller why did he put himself through this it would break when it would break standing in the parapet outside his command bunker he glanced around in the low light watching the floating mist as it seethed through the valley that lay beyond should he put an op out there so theyd know when the rd was getting close but he no longer controlled the hills so putting an op out there would just get its people all killed the rain began to fall thin and cold vietnam why was it so cold he had spent so many days in country over the past eight years but never had felt it this biting before not good sir said taney no it isnt taney any idea when theyll get here you mean huu co hes already here he pushed em hard through the night and the rain hes no dummy he wants us busted before our air can get up yes sir you have that ammo report ready captain yes sir mayhorne just finished it we have twelve thousand rounds of left and a couple more thousand carbine rounds were way low on frags seventynine rounds and belted not a claymore in the camp christ ive got mayhorne distributing the belted but were down to five guns and i cant cover any approach completely we can set up a unit of quickmovers with one of the guns to jump to the assault sector but if he hits us more than one place at once we screw the pooch he will said puller bleakly thats how he operates the pooch is screwed you know sir some of these yards have family here in the compound i was thinking no said puller if you surrender huu co will kill them all thats how he operates we hang on pray for a break in the weather and if we have to go hand to hand in the trenches with the motherfuckers was it ever this bad in sixtyfive sir puller looked at taney who was about twentyfive a good young spec forces captain with a tour behind him but in sixtyfive hed been a high school hotshot what could you tell him who could even remember it was never this bad because we always had air and there were plenty of firebases around ive never felt so fucking on my own thats what trying to be the last man out gets you captain let it be a lesson get out get your people out copy i copy sir okay get the platoon leaders and the machine gun team leaders to my command post in fifteen and they both heard it what was that it sounded like a then another one came a solitary rifle shot heavy obviously echoing back and forth across the valley who the fuck is that taney said thats a sniper said puller they waited it was silent then the third shot and puller could read the signature of the weapon hes not firing fast enough for an m hes shooting a bolt gun and that means hes a marine a marine way the hell out here in indian territory i dont know who this guy is but he sounds like hes doing some good then came a wild barrage of full automatic fire the lighter crisper sound of the chicom xmm the aks fired then the gunfire fell silent shit said taney sounds like they got him the sniper fired again lets run the prc and see if we can pick up enemy radio intelligence puller said they must be buzzing about this like crazy puller and his xo and sergeant bias and y dok the yard chieftain all went down into the bunker cameron puller said to his commo nco you think youve got any juice left in the prc yes sir lets do a quick scan see if you can get me enemy freaks they ought to be close enough to pick up yes sir sir if air comes and we need to talk em in air isnt coming today cameron not today but maybe someone else has cameron fiddled with the radio mast on the prc snapping a cord so that it flew free above the wood and dirt of the roof then clicked it on and began to diddle with the frequency dials they like to operate in the twelve hundreds he said he pulled through the nets not bringing anything up except static the fucking united states navy bellowing about beating the air force academy in a basketball game andshit yeah said puller leaning forward cant you get us in a little tighter its them isnt it sir asked taney oh yes yessy yessy yessy said the head man y dok who wore the uniform of a major in the arvn except for the red tribal scarf around his neck yep is dem yep is dem he was a merry little man with blackened teeth and an inexhaustible lust for war afraid literally of nothing dok can you follow asked puller whose vietnamese was good but not great he was getting odd wordsattack dead haltand he couldnt follow the verb tenses they seemed to be describing a world he couldnt imagine oh he say they under assault on right by platoon strength of marksmen snipers the snipers come for them ma my american ghosts he says most officers dead and most machine gun team leaders alsooh oh now he dead too y dok hear bullet hit him as he talk good shit i tell you major puller got good deaths going oh so very many good deaths a platoon said taney the nearest marine firebase is nearly forty klicks away if it hasnt rotated out how could they get a platoon over here and why would they send a platoon its not a platoon said puller they couldntno not overland across that terrain not without being bounced but a team a team marine sniper teams are twomen shows they can move like hell if they have to jesus taney listen to this and be aware of the privilege youve been accorded what you are hearing is one man with a rifle taking on a battalionstrength unit of about three hundred men dey say dey got him said y dok shit said taney god bless him said puller he put up a hell of a fight dey say american is dead and head man say you fellas get going you got to push on to the end of the valley and de officer say yes yes he going tooh oh ho ho ho he laughed showing his blackened little teeth no no no no no he got dem oh yes he just killed man on radio i hear scream oh he is a man who knows the warriors walk dot i know he got the good deaths very many going on you can say that again said puller chapter fourteen when the trigger broke the north vietnamese captain lieutenant turned as if to look at bob just once before he died all the details were frozen for a second he was a small man even by nva standards with binoculars and a pistol an instant ago he had been full of life and zeal when the bullet struck him it sucked everything from him and he stood with grave solemnity colorless as all the hopes and dreams departed him if he had a soul this would be where it fled to whatever version of heaven sustained him then it was over with the almost stiff dignity of formal ceremony he toppled forward bob threw his bolt fast tossing out the spent shell but never breaking his eye relief with the scope a good trick it only took a lifetime to master in the perfect circle of nine magnifications he saw the men who were his targets looking at one another in utter confusion there was no inscrutability in their expression they were dumbfounded because this was not supposed to happen not in the rain in the fog in the perfect freedom of their attack not after their long night march their good discipline their toughness their belief they had no immediate theory to explain it no this was not possible bob pivoted the rifle just a bit found a new target and felt the jolt as the rifle fired two hundred yards out and two tenths of a second later the grain bullet arrived at odd feet per second the tables say that at that range and velocity it will pack close to two thousand foot pounds of energy and it hit this man a machine gun team leader standing near his now dead commanding officer low in his stomach literally turning him inside out that was what such a big bullet did it operated on him opening his intimate biological secrets to those around him not a killing shot but one that would bleed him out in minutes quickly bob found another and within the time it takes to blink an eyelash fired for the third time and set that one down too the north vietnamese did not panic though they could not hope to pick out bob in the fog and the muzzle blast was diffused they only knew he was on the right somewhere someone calmly issued orders the men dropped and began to look for a target a squad formed to flank off to the right and come around it was standard operating procedure for a unit with much experience and professionalism but bob slithered away quickly and when he felt the fog overwhelm him he stood and ran ahead knowing he had but a few seconds to relocate would they take the casualties and continue to march would they send out flanking parties would they take the time to set up mortars what will they do he wondered he ran one hundred yards fast slipping three new cartridges into the breech as he jounced along because he didnt want to waste time loading when he had targets that was shooting time precious he slipped down off the incline onto the valley floor and crouched as he moved through the elephant grass an odd nowhere place sealed off by vapors he came at last to the center of the track and got a good visual without the grass he was now three hundred yards away and saw only the dimmest of shapes in the fog sinking to a quick ricepaddy squat he put the glass to them put the crosshairs on one quartering them high to account for a little drop at that distance and squeezed the trigger maybe he was shooting at a stump but the blob fell and when he quartered another it fell too he did that twice more and then the blobs disappeared theyd dropped into the grass or had withdrawn he couldnt tell now what now back the flankers will come but slowly thinking possibly theyre up against a larger force not even bothering to crouch he ran again full force through the mist suddenly the nva opened up and he dropped but the sleet of firepower did not come his way and seemed more of a probing effort a theoretical thing meant to hit him where by calculation he should be he watched as tracers hunted him a good hundred yards back liquid splashes of neon through the fog so quick and gossamer they seemed like optical illusions when they struck the earth they ripped it up a blizzard of splashy commotion then the firing stopped he dropped squirmed ahead and came to a crook in a tree quickly he slipped four more rounds into the ms breech throwing the last one home and locking the bolt downward with the sensation of a vault door closing the rifle came up to him and he seemed to have lucked into a thinner spot in the veil of fog where suddenly they were quite visible an officer was talking on the radio phone as around him men fanned out bob killed the officer killed two of the men then he got a good shot at a man with four rpgs on his back squirming for cover put the crosshairs onto a warhead and fired once force multiplier the quadruple detonation ripped a huge gout in the earth possibly driving others back possibly killing some of them he didnt wait to count casualties or even take a quick look at his results he crawled again through the high elephant grass the sweat pouring off him he crawled for what seemed like the longest time tracer rounds floated aimlessly overhead clipping the grass making the odd whup sound a bullet fighting wind will make once when the firing stopped he thought he sensed men around him and froze but nothing happened when at last he found some trees so that he could go back to work he discovered he was much farther back in the column before him as the vapors drifted and seethed were some men who seemed less soldiers than beasts of burden so laden were they with their equipment this was simple murder he took no pleasure in it but neither did he consider it deeply targets take them down eliminate them take them out numbly he did the necessary jnuu co senior colonel had a problem it wasnt the firepower there wasnt much firepower it was the accuracy when he shoots brother colonel his officer told him he hits us he is like a phantom the men are losing their spirit huu co fumed silently but he understood in a frontal attack his men would stand and fight or charge into guns that was battle this was something else the terrible fog the mysterious bullets singing out of it with unerring accuracy seeking officers and leaders killing them then silence maybe there are more than one someone said i believe there are at least ten someone else said no said huu co there is only one and he has only one rifle it is a boltaction rifle so therefore he is an american marine because their army no longer uses bolt actions one can tell from the time between the rounds the lack of double shots or bursts you must be calm he preys on your fear that is how he works he can see through the fog no he cannot see through the fog he is in the hills to the right clearly and as he moves he encounters disparities in the density of the mist when it is thin he can see to shoot get the men down into the grass if they stand they will be killed brother colonel should we continue to march how many can he kill our duty lies at the end of the valley not here it was a legitimate point raised by commissar tien phuc go the political officer indeed under certain circumstances duty demanded that officers and men simply accept a high rate of casualty in payment for the importance of the mission rule no defend the fatherland fight and sacrifice myself for the peoples revolution but this is different said huu co the fog makes it different and his accuracy indiscriminate fire may be sustained as fair battle loss the sniper presents a different proposition both philosophically and tactically if the individual soldier feels himself being targeted that has disproportionate meaning to him and erodes his confidence in the west they call it paranoia a very useful term meaning overimaginative fear for the self he will give himself up to a cause or a mission in the abstract but he will not give himself up to a man its too personal too intimate huu co is right argued his executive officer nhoung we may not simply accept losses as we travel for the weight becomes immense and when we reach our goal the men are too dispirited what then have we accomplished as you decide said phuc go but you may be criticized later and it will sting for many many years huu co accepted the rebuke he had been criticized in a reeducation camp in for nine long months and to be criticized in the vietnamese meaning of the term was excruciating bravely he thrust ahead a man like this can inflict a surprisingly high number of casualties particularly upon officers and noncommissioned officers the heart of the army without leadership the men are lost he can attrit our officer staff if we do not deal with him now and immediately i want second platoon on the right supported by a machine gun team on each end for suppressive fire they are to maneuver on a sweeping movement while the rest of the unit holds up in the high grass i want radio contact with company number two sappers and recall them and assign them in the blocking role they must move quickly latest reports say the weather will not break we have some time and i prefer by far to maintain unit integrity than to push on at this time we will take him in good time patience in all things that is our way communicate with your leaders and the fighters now is not the time for rash action this is a test of discipline and spirit that is understood sir then lets do our duties brothers i anticipate success within the hour and i know you will not let me down jdonny lay in the high grass working the spotting scope but the range was too far a good four hundred meters and in the valley he just saw the drifting mist and heard the gunfire he took his right eye away from the scope and looked out with both of them again nothing the shooting rose and fell rose and fell punctuated now and then by two or three heavy rifle cracks bobs shots at one point some kind of multiple blast came had bob fired a claymore he didnt know but he didnt think the sniper would have time as hed been moving this way and that through the hills he was well situated half buried in a clump of vegetation halfway up a hill a little above the fog he could see far to the right and far to the left but he didnt think anybody could get the drop on him he had a good compass heading to the special forces camp at kham due and knew if he had to be could make it in two or three hard hours he drank a little water from his one remaining canteen he was all right all he had to do was sit there wait for air direct the air then get the hell out of there if no air came then he was to move under cover of nightfall he was not to go into the valley he thought of a familiar remark scrawled in magic marker on marine helmets and flak jackets yea though i walk in the valley of death i shall fear no harm because i am the meanest motherfucker in the valley bravado sheer thumping bravado chanted like an incantation to keep the reaper away im not going into the valley of death he thought those arent my orders i followed my orders i did everything i was told i was specifically ordered not to go into the valley of death he accepted that as both a moral and a tactical proposition as ordered by a senior staff nco no man could challenge that nor would one want to or try to i am fine he told himself i am short i am fine i am three and days till deros i have my whole goddamned life in front of me and no man can say i shirked or ducked or dodged no one can ever wonder if my beliefs were founded on moral logic or my own cowardice i have to prove nothing then why do i feel so shitty it was true he felt truly sick angry at himself almost to the point of revulsion down there swagger was probably giving away his life and donny had somehow missed the show everybody cared about him trig too had cared about him what was so special about him that he had to survive he had no writers gift he was not conversational or charismaticno one could listen to him he could be no witness why me whats so special about my ass he heard them before he saw them it was the thupthupthup of men running coming at the oblique he didnt jerk or move quickly and in an instant was glad he hadnt for sudden moves like that get you spotted they passed about twentyfive meters ahead of him in single file fast movers stripped of helmets and packs and canteens racing toward duty and combat it was the twelveman flanking patrol recalled by radio to move on the sniper from behind he could see how it would work theyd form a line and flankers would drive bob into them or theyd come upon him from the rear in either event bob was finished if donnyd had the grease gun he might have gotten all twelve in a single burst but probably not that was very tricky shooting if he had a claymore set up he might have gotten them too but he didnt he had nothing but his m he watched them go and they pounded along with grace economy and authority they disappeared into the fog i have my orders he thought my job is the air he thought then he thought fuck it and got up to take them from behind they came as he thought they would good trained men willing to take casualties a platoon strength unit fanning through the high grass bob could make them out in the mist dark shapes filing through the weaving fronds he thought of a deer hed once seen in a foggy cornfield back in arkansas and old sam vincent whod tried to be a father to him after his own had passed telling him to fight the buck fever to be calm to be cool he heard sam now be cool boy dont rush it you rush it its over and you cant never get it back and so he was calm he was death he was the kind hunter who shot for clean kills and no blood trails who was a part of nature himself but he wasnt he was war at its crudest he had never had this feeling before it scared him but it excited him also i am war he thought i take them all i make their mothers cry i have no mercy i am war it was an odd thought just fluttering through a mind far gone into battle intensity but it could not be denied the platoon leader will be to the left not in the lead hell be talking to his men holding them together he hunted for a talking man and when he found him he shot him through the mouth and ceased his talking forever i am war he thought he shifted quickly to the man whod run to the fallen officer and almost took him but instead held a second and waited for another to join him grab him take command and turn himself to issue orders senior nco i am war he took the nco the men looked at each other dead targets in his eyes and in a moment of utter panic did exactly the right thing they charged at him he couldnt possibly take them all or even half of them he couldnt escape or evade there was only one thing to do he stood warcrazed face greenblack with paint eyes bulged in rage and screamed come on you fuckers i want to fight some more come on and fight me they saw him standing atop the rise and almost en masse pivoted toward him they froze confronting him a mad scarecrow with a dangerous rifle atop a hill of grass unafraid of them for some insane reason they did not think to fire the moment lingered all craziness loose in the air a moment of exquisite insanity then they ran at him he dropped and slithered the one way they would not expect right at them he slithered ahead desperately snaking through the grass until they began to fire they paused a few feet from him fired their weapons from the hip as if in some terrified human ceremony aimed at slaying the devil the rounds scorched out ripping the stalks above his head to land somewhere behind it was a ritual of destruction they fired and fired reloading new mags sending their bullets out to kill him literally obliterating the crest of the hill he crawled ahead until he could see feet and spent brass landing in heaps the firing stopped he heard in vietnamese the shouts brothers the american is dead go find his body comrades you go find his body he is dead i tell you no man could live through that if he were alive he would be firing at us even now fine go and cut his head off and bring it to us father ho wants me to stay here somebody must direct ill stay brother allow me to give you the privilege of examining the body you fools well all go reload make ready shoot at anything that moves kill the american demon kill the demon my brothers he watched as the feet began to move toward him get small he told himself be very very small he went into a fetal position willing himself into a stillness so total it was almost a replication of genuine animal death it was a gift he had the hunters gift to make his body of the earth not upon it he worried only about the smell of his sweat rich with american fats that could alert the wisest of them feet came so close he saw canvas boots and a pair of shower clogs they won this fucking war in shower clogs the two pairs of feet sloughed through the grass each vivid in the perfection of its detail the man in shower clogs had small dirty tough feet the clogs were probably just an afterthought he could fight barefoot in snow or on gravel the others boots were holey torn taped together a hobos comic footwear something red skeltons clem kadiddlehopper might wear but then the boots marched on passing by and bob scooted ahead slithering through the grass until he came to a fold in the earth he rose checked around and saw nothing in the mist and then raced off to the right down the fold toward the column which had probably resumed its movement toward arizona then he crashed into the soldier nva the two looked at each other for one stupid moment bob and this obvious straggler the idiot whod wandered away the mans mouth opened as if to scream even as he fumbled to bring his ak to bear but bob launched at him in an animal spring of pure evil brutality smashing him in the mouth with his skull and driving downward on him pinning the assault rifle to his chest under his own dense weight he got his left hand about the mans throat crushing it applying the full pinning weight of his body while at the same time reaching for his randall knife the man squirmed and bucked spastically his own hands beating at bobs neck and head then one hand dipped also for a knife presumably but bob rolled slightly to the left and drew his knee up and drove it into the mans testicles with all the force he could muster he heard the intake of breath as the concussion folded his enemy then he had the knife and no impulse halted him he drove it forward into the belly turned it sideways so the cutting edge sliced into entrails and drew it to the left the man spasmed fighting the pain his hand flying to bobs wrist gagging sounds leaking from a constricted throat bob yanked the knife out and stabbed upward feeling the blade sink into throat he fought for leverage over the dying soldier got himself upright and astride the heaving chest and drove the blade two or three more times into the torso the man arching with each stroke he sat back he looked about saw the remington a few feet away he wiped the randall blade on his camoflaged trousers and slipped it back into the upsidedown sheath on his chest he checked quickly two pistols a canteen he picked up the remington but had no time to look for his hat which had fallen off in the struggle a lick of salty blood ran down from the point on his crown where hed headbutted the north vietnamese and it arrived at the corner of his mouth shocking him he turned looked at the man why had it been so easy why was the man so weak the answer was obvious the soldier was about fourteen hed never shaved in his life in death his face was dirty but essentially undisturbed his eyes were open and bright but blank his teeth were white he had acne bob looked at the bloody package that had been a boy a feeling of revulsion came over him he bent retched up a few gobs of undigested crat gathered his breath wiped the blood off his hands and turned back to the path that lay ahead of him which led to the column i am war he thought this is what i do huu cos political officer phuc go was adamant a stocky little man whod been to russian staff school phuc go had the blunt force of a party apparatchik a man who lived and breathed the party and was a master of dialectics brother colonel you must move despite the cost to waste more time is to lose our precious advantage how many can a single man kill can he kill more than forty possibly fifty that is well under a twenty percent casualty rate that is entirely acceptable to the party sometimes the fighters lives must be spent to accomplish the mission huu co nodded solemnly up ahead sporadic fire broke out but the column had bogged down again there was no word from the flanking patrol and no word from the sappers whod been recalled still the american assailed them with wellaimed shots cadre his particular specialty how did he know cadre wore no rank pins carried few symbols of the ego of leadership such as riding crops swords or funny hats leaders were indistinguishable from fighters both in party theory and in actual practice yet this american had some instinct for command and when he fired he brought down leaders not always but in high enough percentage to be disruptive he is hitting our cadre brother political officer and what if we push on and he robs us over the kilometers of our leadership and we get to the objective and no leaders come forth and our attacks fail what will the party say then whose ears will ring the most loudly with criticism our fighters can produce leaders from amongst themselves that is our strength that is our power but our leaders must be trained and to squander them for nothing but the ego of a political officer who seeks the glory of seeing his column destroy an american fort late in an already victorious war may itself be a decision that is commented upon i wonder dear brother colonel if indeed there are not vestiges of western humanitarianism the sick decadence of a doomed society still within your soul you worry too much about such things as the petty lives of individuals when it is the movement of the masses and the forces of history and our objective that should be your concern i am humble before my brothers excellent and perceptive critique said the colonel i still believe in patience over the long journey and that in patience lies virtue dearest colonel said the man his face lighting with fire i have sworn to the commissar that the american fort shall fall i therefore demand that you give the order to move forward without regard to phuc go stopped talking it was difficult to continue without a lower jaw and a tongue he stepped backward the blood foaming brightly across his chest and gurgling from the hole that had been his mouth odd arguments came from him so arcane and densely constructed they could not be followed his eyes turned the color of an old twofranc coin and he died on his feet falling backward into the high grass amid a splash of muddy water that flew up when he hit the wet ground around the senior colonel men dived for cover but the senior colonel knew the american would not fire he realized that he would be spared in his way the american was like a psychiatrist as much as a sniper and he operated on the body of the people to remove the selfimportant the vain the overbearing political officer phuc go was an angry man and had been addressing his senior colonel aggressively with brisk and dramatic hand movements and a loud voice in the gestural vocabulary of superiority examining them the american had assumed that it was he who was in command it was he who was dressing down a naughty inferior thus the senior colonels total lack of ego and presence had rendered him effectively invisible in the snipers scope there was another shot down the column a sergeant fell screaming the senior colonel turned one man standing among many cowering men and said conversationally to his xo send out another platoon i fear our antagonist has evaded the first and keep the men low in the grass we need not die for party vanity or some americans hunt for glory the order was sent the senior colonel turned back to the hills where the american still hunted them you sir he thought in the language of his youth forgotten all these years you sir are tres formidable then he went back to considering how to kill the man fuller cursed the clouds they were low wet dense thicker than the blood on the floor of the triage tent and they rewarded his anger with a burst of rain which fell like gunfire slopping through the mud no air not today not with these low motherfuckers choking the earth he looked back to his shabby empire of mud and slatternly bunkers and smashed squad hootches and blown latrines a ragged curl of smoke still rose from where the dump had been blown yesterday tribesmen and cadre huddled behind parapets or ran from place to place risking rifle fire the mud smelled of buffalo shit and blood and the acrid tang of burned powder a mortar shell detonated nearby and he dropped behind his own parapet as a scream went up medic goddammit medic but there was no medic jack deems whod been with him since sixtyfive and was crosstrained both as a medic and a demolitions expert a very good professional soldier indeed was hit yesterday shot in the chest bled out screaming the names of his children puller shivered another mortar shell hit thank god the vc units only had mms which lofted a grenadesized bit of explosive into arizona and could take out a man only if they scored a lucky direct hit or they got him in the open and took him down with shrapnel but when senior colonel huu co and his bad boys showed up theyd have a weapons platoon with chicom type s in mm and those suckers were bad news if they chose not to go for the direct kill they could batter arizona to pieces with that much throwload then move in and shoot the wounded that would be it then theyd fade into the hills the whole front would go it was exquisitely planned just as american strength was ebbing but arvn confidence not high enough the temptation too huge to deny and therefore getting them out of their normal defensive posture for the first time since sixtyeight puller looked again down the valley which was shrouded in mist and felt the bonechilling rain on the back of his neck he stared as if he could penetrate that drifting seething but altogether blank nothingness but he could not now and then a shot or two sounded the heavy smack of the marines it was always answered with a fusillade that marine was still at it man you are a tiger he thought dont know you brother but you are one fucking tiger you are the only thing between us and a complete screwing of the pooch they no get him said y dok no said puller wishing he could break a team out to bring in the sniper but knowing he couldnt and that it would be evil waste to try no but they will goddamn them now they had him they were going to get him but it was a question of when early or late where had these guys come from then he knew they had to be the sapper unit out on flank security brought back fast from out there probably huu cos best troops real pros bob lay on his belly on the crest of a small knoll still as death breathing in un measurable increments underneath him he was wedded to the remington sniper rifle whose bolt now gouged him cruelly in the stomach he could see through the wavering scope and watched as they came for him somehow they knew this was his hill it was some hunters very good instinct then he realized they found the dead soldier in the gully and tracked me as he had moved through the wet elephant grass hed probably left a pattern of disturbance where the grass was wiped clean where the turf was trampled good men could follow much less now they had him on this goddamned hill it would be over in a few minutes oh these guys were good they had spread out and were moving up very methodically two threemen elements of movement two of cover no more than three men too widely spaced for three shots were visible at any one moment and then only for seconds they were willing to give up one of the three to find him and take him out soldiers he knew he had to get to his grease gun if they got close and he was stuck with the remington with one cartridge in the spout and a boltthrow away from another shot he was done now it was his turn to move ever so slowly ever so noiselessly learn from them he instructed himself learn their lessons patience caution calmness freedom from fear but above all the discipline of the slow move he had a complicated thing before him without making a sound he had to reach back under his rain cape release the sling of the m draw it forward around his body ease open the ejection port cover and finger hole the bolt back then and only then would he have a chance but that destination was long minutes away the rain fell in torrents now disguising his noise just a bit but these were sharp trained men their ears would hear the sound of canvas rubbing on leather or metal sliding across flesh or they would smell his fear acrid and penetrating or they would see his movement irregular against the steadier rhythms of nature ever so slowly he eased over to his side from his belly an inch at a time shifting his hand back over the crest of his body now he could hear them calling to each other they spoke the language of birds coo coo came the call of a dove in a part of the south where there were no doves coo came the response from the right coo came another one clearly from behind now they knew he was here for the trail had led up the hill but had not led down it they had not cut across it he was thoroughly cooked his fingers touched metal they crawled up the grip of the grease gun pawed climbed up to the tubular receiver and found the sling threaded through its latch his fingers struggled against the snap on the sling oh come on he prayed these little fuckers could be tough they could rust shut or simply be tightly fitted and need too much leverage to free up why didnt you check it agh asshole he ordered himself to check the sling snap a thousand times if he ever got out of this fix so that he would never ever again forget come on baby please come on with his fingers pulling his thumb pushing he battled the thing it was so small so absurd twelve men were twentyfive yards away hunting him and he was hung up on the cold wet ground trying to get a fucking littleah it popped with a metallic click that he believed could be heard all the way to china but nobody cooed and he wasnt jumped and gutted on the spot the gun slid free and down his back but he captured it quickly with his hand and now withdrew it very slowly bringing it around drawing it close to him like a woman to treasure for the rest of his life he smelled its oily magnificence felt its tinny greatness a reliable ugly piece of world war ii improvisation it probably cost a buck fifty to manufacture from hubcaps and sleds and bikes picked up in scrapmetal drives in the forties thats why it had such a cheap toylike rattly feel to it with his fingers he deftly sprung the latch on the ejection port then inserted a finger into the bolt hole that he had just revealed with the finger he pushed back felt the bolt lock then let it come forward he dropped down and drew the gun up to him coo coo chapter fifteen the message came by radio to the hasty command post dug into the side of a hill it was from the sapper patrol on the right flank brother colonel gasped sergeant van trang we have the american trapped on a hill half a kilometer to the west we are closing on him even now he will be eliminated within the quarter hour huu co nodded van trang was a banty little north countryman with the heart of a lion if he said such a thing was about to happen then indeed it would happen excellent said the colonel out there are no shots his xo told him not since the unfortunate phuc go was martyred huu co nodded considering yes now was the time even if he couldnt get the whole battalion through the pass he could get enough men through to overwhelm arizona but he had every confidence in van trang and his sappers they were the most dedicated the best trained the most experienced if they had the american trapped the incident was over all right he said send runners to one two and three companies lets get the men out of the grass get them going fast fast fast now is the time for speed we have wasted enough time and energy on this american the xo rapidly gave the orders huu co went outside all around him men rose from the grass shook the accumulated moisture from their uniforms and formed up into loose company units a whistle sounded from in front of the column behind huu co with amazing swiftness members of the combat support platoon broke down the hasty command post so that nothing remained then they too went to their positions lets go said huu co and with a gaggle of support personnel around him he too began to move at the halftrot ahead through the mist and the rain to the end of the valley where the americans were under siege the long train of men moved quickly bending back the grass overhead the blessed clouds still hung low and dense to the surface of the earth no airplanes would come he would make arizona by nightfall give the men a few hours rest then move them into position and sometime after midnight strike with everything he had from three directions it would be over from the right it came at last the sudden flurry of fire the sound of grenade detonations a few more shots and then silence they got him the xo said to him excellent said huu co at last we have triumphed frankly between you and i the american provided a great service the political officer brother co i agree of course he loved the party too much and the fighters not enough such men are necessary said huu co sometimes that american said the xo he was some kind of fighter himself if they were all like that our struggle would be nowhere near its conclusion i wonder what motivates a man like that huu co had known americans in paris in the early fifties and then in saigon in the early sixties they had seemed innocent almost childish full of wonder incapable of deep thought they are not a serious people he said but i suppose by the odds every now and then you get one who is i suppose said the xo im glad we killed this one i prefer the good ones dead he lay very composed trying not to listen to his heart or to his mind or to any part of his body which yearned to survive instead he listened to nothing and tried to plan they are tracking you they will come right to you if you let them carry the fight you will die you must shoot first shoot to kill attack decisively if you are aggressive you may stun them they will expect fear and terror aggression is the last thing they expect he tried to lay it all out under the knowledge that any plan even a bad plan is better than no plan shoot the visible ones spray till the mag empties throw grenades fall away to the left fall back into better cover in the trees but most of all get off this hill they were very close cooing softly to one another haying converged they were patient calm very steady oh these were the best they were so professional no problems getting the job done one suddenly stood before him the man was about thirty very tough looking his face a blank he held an american carbine he seemed to have some trouble believing what lay before him on the ground bob fired a fiveround burst into his body sending him down he pivoted rising and in the same second saw others turning toward him he swept the grease gun across them a long thudding burst watching the bullets chop through the grass in a blizzard of spray ensnare his opponents and take them down spent shells poured spastically from the breech of the junky little piece as it rattled itself dry in the silence that followed he heard the ping of grenade pins being pulled and frantically threw himself backward rolling through the grass feeling it lash and whip at him as he went so glad hed left the pack behind the first grenade detonated about ten yards away and he felt the pain as several pieces of shrapnel tore at his arm and the side of his body that was exposed but still he rolled and another grenade detonated this one still farther away he came to a stop could hear some hustling around and pulled a grenade from his belt pried the pin out and lofted it in the general direction of his enemies as it explodedwas that a scream he heardhe got a new magazine into the submachine gun and though he had no targets lost himself in the madness of firing he emptied the magazine stupidly in a sustained blast the gun thudding the bullets fanning out to splash through the grass atomizing stalks they struck ripping sheets of mud spray from the earth then he rolled backward and continued to propel himself down the hill in one moment of repose he got another magazine into the gun but before he could see targets he heard the soft crush of something heavy landing nearby and he went flat as a grenade detonated sending a spout of earth high into the sky and numbing his eardrums now he heard nothing his hearing was momentarily gone and his vision blurred the left arm hardly worked it had numbed out and he saw that it was bleeding badly oh shit fire came at him from three points short professional bursts from aks they probed sending the rounds skirmishing after him in three vectors he assumed that a few more were working around behind him thats it he thought i buy it this is it oh fuck i tried so hard dont let me chicken out here at the end oh please let me be brave but he wasnt brave his anger melted a profound sense of regret washed over him so much he hadnt done so much he hadnt seen he felt the powerful pain of his own fathers death upon him and how now that he was gone no one would be left alive to mourn and miss earl swagger god help me daddy i tried so goddamned hard i just didnt make it a shot kicked up next to his face stinging his neck with pricks of dirt another one buzzed by close they were all shooting now all of them that were left i aint no hero he thought oh please god please dont let me die here oh i dont want to die please please please but nobody answered and nobody listened and it was all over it was finished bullets cracked past or hit nearby evicting gouts of angry earth and pelting spray he willed himself back shrinking to nothingness but there was only so far he could go his eyes were shut they had him the next round wouldthree fast booming cracks heavy and powerful then two more silence swagger bob lee you all right bob lifted his head about forty yards away a young marine stepped out of the elephant grass donnys boonie hat had fallen to his back and his hair was golden even in the gray light and the misty rain he was an improbable blackandgreenfaced angel with the instrument of his sergeants deliverance the us rifle m mm nato stay down bob called i think i got em all stay down in that second two men fired at donny but missed the bullets pulling big spouts from the valley floor bob turned to watch their shapes scuttle away in the grass and he walked bursts over both of them until they stopped moving he crouched waiting nothing no noise just the ringing in his ears the pounding of his heart the stench of the powder after a bit he went to them one was dead his arms thrown out the blood congealing blackly as it pooled to form a feast for ants the other a few yards away was on his back and still breathed he had left his ak feet away as hed crawled after taking the hits but now exhausted he looked up at bob with beseeching eyes his face and mouth were spotted with blood and when he breathed heavily bob heard the blood bubble deep in his lungs the hand seemed to move maybe he had a grenade or a knife or a pistol maybe he was begging for mercy or deliverance from pain bob would never know nor did it matter threeround burst center chest it was over donny came bounding over we got em all i didnt think i could get here in time christ i hit three guys in a second great shooting marine jesus you saved this old mans fucking bacon bob said collapsing youre all right im fine dinged up a bit he held out his bloody left arm his side also sang of minor penetration in a hundred or so places oddly what hurt the most was his neck where the impacting nva round had blown a handful of nasty dirt into the flesh and hair of his scrubby beard and for some reason it stung like a bastard oh christ i thought i was cooked i was finished wasted greased man i was a gone motherfucker lets get the fuck out of here you wait i left the rifle up top just let me catch my breath he sucked down a few gulps of the sweetest air hed ever tasted then ran up the hill the m lay where he had dumped it its muzzle spouting a crown of turf its bolt half open and gummed also with turf he grabbed it and ran back to donny map donny fished it out of the case handed it over all right bob said hes sure got that column moving again weve got to move on pass them and jump them again theres not much light left bob looked at his seiko jesus it was close to hours time flies when youre having fun fuck he said he had a moments gloom no light no shoot they were going to get close enough to stage an assault in the dark and all the snipers in the world wouldnt make a spits worth of difference shit he said but bobs mind was so fogged with delirium adrenaline and fatigue it wasnt processing properly he had the vague sense of missing something as if hed left his iq points up there on that ugly little hill it was donny who pulled another sack from around his waist opened it and out came what looked like a small tubular popgun and a handful of white star illumination flares the bag was heavy with the cartridges flares he said can you shoot by flares if i can see it i can hit it bob said they moved swiftly through the gloom amid small hills in the elephant grass ever mindful they were paralleling the movement of the enemy main force in the valley ever mindful that there were still scouting units out in the area if and when the nva discovered their dead recon team they might send still other men after them they moved at the halfjog through a fog of fatigue and pain bobs arm hurt desperately and he didnt have any painkillers not even aspirin his head ached and his legs felt withered and shaky they followed a compass heading re shooting it each time they moved around a hill the elephant grass was tall and concealing but it cut at them mercilessly there wasnt much water left and even in the falling dark bob could see that the clouds hadnt broken still hung low and close a wicked pelting rain started delivering syringes of cold where it struck them soon the trip became pure blind misery two hungry deadtired filthy men running on faith and hope toward a destination that might not even exist bobs mind slipped in and out he tried to concentrate on the job ahead but it would not stay at one point he called a halt i got to rest he said we been pushing pretty hard donny said bob slipped down into the grass youve lost a lot of blood im okay i only need a little rest i got some water here take some water then whatll you drink i dont need to shoot i just fire flares you need to shoot you need the water youd think all this fucking rain the last thing wed be is thirsty i feel like i just played two football games without quarters or half times just two games straight through oh man bob said taking a big swig of donnys water feeling its coolness rush down his flaming throat after this im going to sleep for a month said donny no after this said bob you are going on rr to be with your wife if i have to go to the goddamned general and asskick him myself it was almost full dark somewhere birds were beginning to call the jungle was close just beyond the hill line there was however nothing alive in view once again they seemed alone in the world lost in the hills stuck in a landscape of desolation suddenly bobs mind sped to other possibilities i got a idea he said you got tape dont you carry tape i think i told you to donny reached into a bellows pocket of his cammies pulled out a roll of gray duct tape this would be tape no that would be tape yes okay now goddamn the spotting scope dont tell me you dumped your spotting scope you didnt leave that back with your gear did you fuck said donny i brought everything except a helicopter hmmm sink tent phantom jet mess hall oh yeah here he pulled another piece of gear slung around his shoulder it was a long tubular green canvas carrying case strapped at either end which carried an m x spotting scope complete with a folded tripod it was for glassing the really far targets he unslung it and handed it over now what oh just you watch greedily bob bent to the scope case unscrewed it and reached out to remove a dullgreen metal telescope disjointed slightly with a folding tripod underneath it must have cost the marine corps a thousand bucks beautiful aint it he asked then he rammed its delicate lens against donnys rifle muzzle shattering it into a sheet of diamonds he reamed the tube out on the rifle barrel grinding circularly to take out all the glass and the delicate internal mechanisms for focus adjustment he unscrewed and threw away the tripod then he seized the canvas case took out his randall survivor and began to operate what are you doing donny asked you never mind but you get my rifle cleaned up no rules today hurry pork we gotta get a goddamned move on donny worked some rough maintenance on the gun clearing the muzzle of mud and grass scraping the dirt and in a few minutes had it ready to shoot again he looked back to see that bob had sawed off one end of the scope case and cut a smaller hole through the other giving him a green tube about twelve inches long bob wedged the spotting scope tube back into the case here you hold that goddamn muzzle up for me he commanded and working swiftly commenced to wedge the scope case and scope on the muzzle then wrap yards of tape around the case and the muzzle securing the case so that it projected a good eight inches beyond the muzzle it looked like some kind of silencer but donny knew it wasnt a silencer what is field expedient flash suppressor said bob flash is just powder burning beyond the muzzle if you can lengthen the cover on the barrel itll burn up in there not in the air where itll light me up like a christmas tree its pretty flimsy and wont hold much more than a few dozen shots but by god i dont want them tracking my flash and hitting me with the goddamned kitchen sink now lets mount out a last fast the troops were driven by duty and destiny an extraordinary accomplishment the long doubletime march from laos the ordeal of the sniper in the valley the victory over the man and now on to the green beret camp at kham due battalion no was just a kilometer away from the staging point maintaining good order moving smartly huu co senior colonel glanced at his watch and saw that it was near midnight they would be in place in another hour and could use a little time to relax and gather themselves then the assault teams would stage and the weapons platoon would set up the mm type s and the last stage would commence it would be over by dawn the weather wouldnt matter still it was holding beautifully for him above there was a starless night gray and dim the clouds close to the earth in his old mind his western mind he could believe that god himself had willed the americans from the earth it was as if god were saying enough begone back to your land let these people be in his new mind he merely noted that his luck had held and that luck is sometimes the reward for boldness the fatherland appreciated daring and skill he had gambled and won and the eventual fall of the kham due camp would be his reward it is good said the xo yes it is said huu co when this is over i will but nhoungs face suddenly lit up huu co turned to wonder about the source of illumination a single flare hung in the sky beneath a parachute bringing light to the dark night as it settled the light grew brighter and there was one lucid moment in which the battalion gathered as it plunged toward its study seemed to stand out in perfect clarity it was a beautiful moment too suffused with white light gentle and complete exposing the peoples will as contained and expressed through its army nestled between close hills churning onward toward whatever tomorrow brought unhesitatingly heroic stoic selfsacrificing then the shot rang out fuller dreamed of chinh his second tour he hadnt planned to it just happened she was eurasian lived in cholon hed been in the field eleven months and suffering from combat exhaustion had been brought back to macv in saigon given a staff job just to save him from killing himself it was a safe job back then sixtyseven a year before tet and chinh was just there one day the daughter of a french woman and a vietnamese doctor more beautiful than he could imagine was she a spy there was that possibility but there wasnt much to know it was brief intense pure pleasure not a whisper of guilt her husband had been killed she said by the communists maybe it was so maybe it was not it didnt matter the communists killed her one night on the road in her citreon after shed spent hours making love with him she ran through an ambush theyd propped for an arvn official just blew her away he dreamed of his oldest daughter mary she rode horses and had opinions she hated the army watched her mother play the game suck up all the way through in the shit posts like gemstadt or benning always making a nice home always sucking up to the cos wife i wont have it mary said i wont live like that what does it get you his wife had no answer its what we do she finally said your father and me were both in the army thats how it works it wont work that way for me she said he hoped it wouldnt she was too smart to end up married to some lifer some mediocrity who would go nowhere and only married her because she was the daughter of the famous dick puller the lion of pleiku whod taken a chicom in the chest and wouldnt even let himself be medevaced out and who died in the shitty little forward operations base at kham due a year after the war was lost threw himself away for nothing that nobody could make any sense of puller came awake it was dark he checked his watch it would start soon be over soon he smelled wet sand from the soaked bags out of which the bunker was built dirt and mud gun oil chinese cooking blood the works the complete total that was life in the field but he had an odd sensation something was happening he looked at his watch and saw that it was nearly midnight time to get up andsir it was young captain taney who would probably also die tonight yeah itsahyou wont believe it what hes still out there who puller thought instantly of huu co him him that goddamned marine sniper does he have night vision no sir you can see it from the parapet you can hear it hes got flares idle didnt get good targets not enough light but in the shimmering glow of the floating flares he got enough movement fast frightened scurrying the occasional hero who would stand and try and mount a rally the runner who was sent to the rear to report to command the machine gun team that peeled off to try and flank him the flares fired with a dry faraway pop like nothing else in the nam they lit at about three hundred feet with a spurt of illumination then the chute would open and grab the wind and theyd begin to float downward flickering spitting sparks and ash it was white it turned the world white the lower they got the brighter it got but when they swung in the breeze they turned the world to a riot of shadows chasing each other through the dimness of his scope but still hed get targets hed fire at what his instincts told him was human what looked odd in the swinging light the sparks the glow that filled the world the crowd of panicked men who now felt utterly naked to the snipers reach the night belonged to charlie it was said not this night it belonged to bob theyd worked it right no movement not now it was too dark to move and theyd get mixed up get out of contact with one another and that would be that donny was on the hilltop bob halfway down the bad guys were moving left to right beyond them one hundred yards out where the grass was shorter and there wasnt any cover it was a good killing zone and the first element of the column was hung up pinned in the grass believing that if they moved they would die which was correct donny would fire a flare and move a hundred steps or so on the hilltop while bob waited for the flare to get low enough to see the movement bob would fire twice maybe three times in the period of brightest light then hed move too the same one hundred steps through the grass and set up again forward then theyd move back they couldnt see one another but they had the rhythm theyd send people up after him but not soon enough they wouldnt be sure where the flares were coming from because god bless the little fireworks they didnt trail illumination as they ascended bob couldnt even see the reticle he just saw the movement and knew where the reticle would be because thats where it always was and he fired the rifle cracking its flash absorbed in the steel tube that surrounded the muzzle but would sooner or later have to give way no one could yet see where the shots were coming from the flare floated showering sparks in its cone of light bob saw a man drop into vegetation and he put a bullet into him he flicked the bolt fast jacking out the spent case and watched as another man came through the light to his fallen comrade and he killed him too the trick was the light the flares had to be constant there couldnt be a dark moment when there was no light because these guys would move on him then and theyd be too close too fast and it would be over it lasted for ten minutes then having planned it donny stopped firing and bob stopped firing they both fell back met at the far side of the hill and took off on the dead run leaving behind the confusion they moved on looking for another setup thatll slow em itll take em ten minutes to figure out were gone then theyll get moving again we should be able to hit them again i want to set up on that side now you watch me donny had the m at high port bobs rifle was slung and he carried the m in his hands though he was down now to two magazines both his handguns were cocked and locked okay you ready i think so you cover me if i take fire gotcha bob stepped out of the grass onto the valley floor he felt so naked he was all alone the wind whistled and once again it began to rain the nva must have been a half klick or so behind suddenly the sky behind them lit up an assault team had moved up to and taken the now empty hill on which they had situated grenade blasts rocked the night and blades of the sheer light slashed from the concussion heavy automatic weapons fire followed again they were slaying the demon bob got halfway across then turned with his grease gun to cover and called out for donny to join him come on he shouted the boy came across the valley floor and passed bob and went to set up on the other side bob raced over quickly they found another hill you get on up there bob said when you hear me shoot you fire the first flare im going to open up further out this time meanwhile you set up claymores im down to about twenty rounds and i want a fallback if we get bounced well counter bounce with the claymores then fall back set them up and wait to pop flares password is fuck i dont know make up a password ahjulie julie as in julie is beautiful roger that roger that you hear movement coming to you and he dont sing out julie is beautiful you go to claymores use the confusion to fall back and find a hide then you wait until tomorrow and call in a bird after a while okay therell be a bird tomorrow got it got it if i dont make it back same deal fall back go to ground call in a bird theyll be buzzing all over this zone tomorrow no problem now how many flares you got donny did a quick check on his bag looks like about ten okay when theyre gone theyre gone then were out of business fall back hide bird okay check said donny you all right you sound kind of shaky im just beat im tired im scared shit you cant be scared im scared enough for both of us i got all the fear in the whole fucking world i dont just this last bad thing then we are the fuck out of here and im going to make sure you get home in one piece i give you my word you done yours nobody can say he didnt do his you done it all ten times over you get to go home after this one i swear to you there was an odd throb in his own voice that bob had never heard before where did it come from he didnt know but somehow bob had a blinding awareness that in some way the life of the world now depended on getting donny home in one piece donny was the world somehow and if he bob got him killed out here for this shit he would answer for all eternity very strange nothing hed ever felt before on any battlefield im cool donny said see you in a bit sierrabravofour donny watched the sergeant go the man was like some mars or achilles or something so lost in the ecstasy of the battle that he somehow didnt want it to end didnt want to come back once again donny had the odd feeling that he was destined to witness all this and tell it to whom who would care who would listen the idea of soldiers as heroes was completely gone now they were baby killers or if not that they were fools suckers morons who hadnt figured out how to beat the machine so maybe that was his job to remember the bob lee swaggers of the world and when the times somehow changed the story could be retrieved and told how one crazy arkansas sumbitch mean as a snake dry as a stick brave as the mountains took on and fucked up an entire battalion for almost nothing really except so that nobody would ever say of him he let us down what made such a man his brutal hard scrabble childhood the corps as his home his love of fighting his sense of country nothing explained it it was beyond explanation why was he so meaninglessly brave what compelled him to treat his life so cheaply donny made it to the top of the hill it was a queer little empire much smaller than the last hill a little hump that overlooked the larger valley before it here is where they would fight he unstrapped his three claymores bandoleers and took the things out your basic ma directional mine jesus were these nasty little packages about eight inches across and four inches tall they were little con vexes of plasticsheathed c impregnated with about seven hundred pieces of buckshot apiece you opened a compartment pulled out about one hundred meters of wire unspooled it to your safe hole and there crimped it to the electrical firing device m which came packed in the bandoleer and looked like a green plastic hand exerciser when you clamped it you jacked a goose of electricity through the wire to the detonator the pound and a half of c went kaboom and the seven hundred steel balls went sailing through the air at about two thousand miles an hour for a couple of hundred feet anything in their wayman beast vegetable or mineralgot turned to instant spaghetti just the thing for human wave attacks night ambushes perimeter defense or those annoying staff meetings though the marine corps thoughtfully added the message front toward enemy for its dimmer recruits so they wouldnt get mixed up in all the excitement and blow a nasty hole in their own lines donny pulled down the folding scissors legs on each mine made sure that the front indeed faced the enemy and set up the three of them about sixty feet apart atop the hill there was some little technical business to be done involving blasting caps shipping plug priming adaptors the detonator well wire crimped and so on then the wire was fed backward where he used his entrenching tool to dig a quick low hole though he knew that if he ever had to go to the mines it meant there were enough zips coming at them that whether he survived the backblast or not was kind of a moot point he took a last swig on his canteen and tossed it away he wished he had a crat left but hed left them back with most of his gear now however instead of the usual huge burden he felt almost lightheaded he had no food no canteen no spotting scope no claymores the only burden beside his m magazines was the goddamned prc tied tightly to his back by a couple of cruel straps he even dared peel it off and now felt really light he felt like dancing the freedom from the ache of going into battle with sixty pounds of gear and then twenty pounds of gear and now nothing was astonishing he had trained himself to ignore the ache in his back now it vanished cool he thought i get to die without a backache first time in my career in the nam then the shot came and donny hastily pulled out his flare device slipped a flare into the breech screwed it shut and thrust it against the ground to fire like a tiny mortar the flare popped out and hissed skyward seeming to disappear a second passed then the night bloomed illumination as the flare lit its chute opened and it began to float down into the valley showering sparks and white it was snowing light bob was shooting now the last act had begun they were much closer than he anticipated the scope was cranked down to three power so that he could get as clear and wide a view as possible still they werent targets so much as possibilities squirms of movement that in their rhythm seemed human against the stiller spectacle of the natural world though it was all made stranger yet by the rushing shadows the swing of the flare created as it descended he saw he fired something stopped moving or just went down hed had eighty rounds he was down to less than twenty god i killed some boys today jesus fucking christ i did some killing today i was death today i was the marine corpss finest creation the stone killer destroying all that moved before me something moved he shot it it stopped clearly the nva couldnt locate him and he was so close and now the boss man had made a decisionto keep going to take casualties to make the rallying point for the attack on arizona to march through the minefields as a russian general had put it it was as though he were saying to bob you cant kill us all we will defeat you through our willingness to absorb death that is how we won this war that is how we will win this battle he could hear sergeants screaming bi bi bi meaning go go go urging the troops onward but they could not see him because of his flash hider the panic the fear the troops did not want to go clearly hed gotten into their heads that was the sniper thing that was what was so terrible about the sniper he was intimate and personal in a way which nothing else that kills in war can be his humanness preys on your humanness and it was hardest for even the most disciplined of troops to face he jacked out a round into the breech fired watched someone die he fired again quickly in the fading light then another flare popped the light renewed and he saw more targets so close it was criminal murder to take them but that was his job tonight he took them reloaded fell back through the high grass emerged when another flare fired off and killed some more he was gone totally in the red screaming urgency of his own head not a man anymore but a total killing system conscienceless instinctive his brain singing with blood lust it was so easy co nhoung was gone the bullet snuffed his life out in a second drilling him through the neck with the sound of an ax hitting a side of raw beef nhoung died on his feet and hit the ground a corpse his soul flew away to be with his ancestors we are dying he can see us there is no hope a young soldier screamed shut up you fool yelled huu co yearning to reach to the sky and crush those blasphemous flares with his bare hands then rip the skulls from the bodies of the sniper and his spotter theyre on the left this time he screamed again because he had seen the xo fall to the right pushed by the impact of the bullet on the left fire for effect brothers fire now kill the demons his troops began to open fire helterskelter without much thought the lacy neon of the tracers jumping through the darkness like spiderwebs ripping vaguely where they struck tree or vegetation but the point of it was to calm them while he figured out what to do he stood a flare lit over his head he was in bold relief and the flare seemed to be falling directly toward him the man next to him fell stricken the man behind him fell stricken he was in the cone of light he was the target it didnt matter his life didnt matter number one assault platoon advance one hundred meters to the left number two assault platoon provide covering fire during the movement weapons platoon set up mortar units to be ranged at meters on the hill at hours to our front machine gun platoon set up automatic weapons one hundred meters to the right he waited for the sniper to kill him but instead an astonishing thing happened no bullet came at all the sniper lit a torch and began waving at him as if to say here i am come kill me he could see the man surprisingly close waving the torch there he is kill him you see him kill him huu co shouted as he came out of the grass another flare popped low this time filling the night with white light the spectacle was awesome through the scope jacked up three times he saw men run in panic he saw the blind fire directed outward he saw men in the center of the position yelling desperately commanding officer he thought oh baby if i can do you i can call this one a day three men stood the center of the scope found one and he pulled the trigger withdamnenough jerk so the shot went high and he knew he hit high in the neck in the perfect circle of the scope his target sank backward stiff and totaled bob cocked fast but the flare died he could hear nothing the fire lashed outward pointlessly unaimed mere fireworks as if the terrified were trying to drive demons away another flare popped low and bright and harsh bob blinked at the brightness of it saw another man stand fired taking him down as he pivoted slightly he went past a second man to a third fired quickly hit him off center and put him down then he came back to the second man as he rushed through the bolt cycle got you youre it youre the man he caught his breath steadied himself the flare seemed to be falling right toward this brave individual and bob saw that yes this was him whoever he was the officer alone stood taking the full responsibility of the moment he called directions so forcefully bob could hear the vietnamese vowels through the noise of the fire he was fortyish small tough very professional looking and on his green fatigues he wore the three stars of the senior colonel visible only now because the light was so bright as the flare descended bob took a seconds worth of breath noticing that in the brightness of the instant the reticle had even materialized the crosshairs stood out bold and merciless upon the colonels chest and in that second bob took the slack out and with the snap of a piece of balsa wood shattering the trigger went the rifle recoiled death from afar was sent upon its way but something was wrong instead of a sight picture bob saw bright lights bouncing balls of sheer incandescence his night vision shattering as he blinked to clear but the world had caught on fire flames ate the darkness it made no sense then he realized what had happened the juryrigged suppressor sustained in its nest of tape had finally yielded to the hammering of muzzle blast and flash slipped down into the trajectory of the bullet deflected it and exposed directly to the detonation of flash the canvas exploded into flame the rifle had become a torch signaling his location he stared at it for an oafish moment realized it was his own death and threw the whole mad blazing apparatus away now there was nothing left except the remotest possibility of survival he turned to flee as bullets clipped about whacking through the stalks he was hit hard on the back driven to the earth the pain was excruciating he saw it very clearly i am dead i die now this is it but no life sprung before his eyes he had no sense of wastage loss recrimination only sharp and abiding pain he reached back to discover not hot blood but hot metal a bullet aimed for his spine had instead hit the slung m grease gun driving it savagely into him but doing him no permanent harm he shucked the disabled weapon and began to slither maniacally through the grass as the world seemed to explode around him he didnt know what direction he just crawled pathetically a fool begging for life so far from heroic it was ludicrous thinking only one phrase like a mantra i dont want to die i dont want to die i dont want to die he kept going through his terror and came at last to a little nest of trees into which he dove and froze men moved around him in the darkness shots were fired but the action after the longest time seemed to die away and he slipped in another direction he got so far when someone shouted and then goddamn them the nva fired their own flares theirs were green less powerful but they had more of them the sky filled with multiple suns from a distant planet sparky green descending through green muck as if it were an aquarium in a moment of primeval fear bob simply turned and ran he ran like a motherfucker he ran crazily insanely to escape the cone of light but even as it promised to die another blast of candlepower lit the night as another dozen or so green chicom flares popped this seemed to be the place he ran upward screaming madly julie is beautiful julie is beautiful saw donny rise above him with his m in a good solid standing offhand and begin to fire on his pursuing targets very professionally bob ran to the boy feeling the armies of the night on his butt and dove into donnys shallow hole claymores he screamed theyre not close enough donny responded bob rose more flares came and this time a whole company seemed to be rushing at them to destroy them now he screamed no screamed donny who had the three firing devices where had this kid got this much cool he held them the shots cracking up the hill tracers flicking by the green flares floating down the screams of the rushing men louder and louder until he fell back smiled and squeezed the three firing devices simultaneously chapter sixteen donny had three m mags left with twenty rounds each bob had seven rounds in his one loaded magazine and seven rounds in his with no extra magazines donny had four grenades bob had his randall survivor donny had a bayonet that was it shit said donny were cooked said bob shit said donny i fucked up said bob sorry pork i could have led them away from here i didnt have to come back up this hill i wasnt thinking it doesnt matter said donny the nva scurried around at the base of the hill presumably theyd carried off their dead and wounded but it wasnt clear yet what their next move would be they hadnt fired any flares recently but they were maneuvering around the hill bob supposed for the last push they may think we have more claymores he said but probably they dont it was dark donny had no flares they crouched in the hole at the top of the hill one facing east the other west the dead ms with their firing wires lay in the hole too getting in the way the stench of c oddly pungent filled the air even now close to an hour after the blasts donny held his m bob a pistol in each hand they could see nothing a cold wind whipped through the night theyll probably set up their s zero us and take us out that way why take more casualties then they can be on their way we tried said donny we fought a hell of a fight said bob we hung em up a bit your old dad up in ranger heaven would be proud of you i just hope they find the bodies and my next of kin is notified you ever file that marriage report no it didnt seem important no offpost living in the nam yeah well you want her to get the insurance benefits dont you oh she doesnt need the money they have money my brothers could use it for school its okay the way it is nothing much to say they could hear movement at the base of the hill the occasional secret muttering of ncos to their squads i lost the picture donny said thats what bothers me julies picture yeah when sometime in the night no the late afternoon when i went after that flank security unit i dont remember my hat fell off it was in your hat yeah well tell you what i cant git you out of here and i cant git you the medal of honor you deserve but if i can git you your hat back would you say i done okay by you you always did okay by me yeah well guess what your hat fell off your head all right but you been so busy and now youre so tired you aint figured out that you was wearing a cord around the hat to pull it tight in the rain its still there its hanging off your neck across your back jesus donny reached around his neck and felt the cord he drew it tight pulled the hat up from around his back and removed it shit he said because he could think of nothing else to say go on said bob thats your wife look at her donny pulled at the lining of the hat and removed the cellophane package unpeeled it and removed a little curled and bent slightly damp the photograph he stared at it and could see nothing in the darkness but nevertheless it helped in his mind she was there one more time he wanted to cry she was so sweet and he remembered the three days theyd had they got married in warrenton virginia and drove up to the skyline drive and rented a cabin in one of the parks they spent each day going for long walks that place had paths that ran along the sides of the mountains and you could look down into the shenandoahs or if you were on the other side into the piedmont it was green rolling country checkerboard farms as far as you could see beautiful all right maybe it was his imagination but the weather seemed perfect it was early may spring and life was breaking from the crust of the earth with a vengeance green buds everywhere sometimes it was just them alone in the world high above the rest of the earth or was it just that all soldiers remember their last leave as special and beautiful here look said donny its too dark go on look he commanded the first time he had ever spoken sharply to his sergeant swagger gave him a sad look but took the picture he looked at julie but saw nothing still he knew the picture it was a snapshot taken in some spring forest and the wind and the sun played in her hair she wore a turtleneck and had one of those smiles that made you melt with pain she seemed clean somehow so very very clean straw blond hair straight white strong teeth a tan face an outdoorsy face she was a beautiful girl model or moviestar beautiful bob had a brief broken moment when he contemplated the brute fact that no one nowhere loved him or would miss him or give a shit about his death he had no one a middleaged lawyer in arkansas might shed a tear or two but he had his own kids and his own life and the old man would probably still miss bobs father more than hed miss bob that was the way it went shes a greatlooking young woman bob said i can tell she loves you a lot our honeymoon skyline drive my old captain gave me six hundred dollars to take her away when i got my orders cut emergency leave he got me three days he was a great guy i tried to pay him back but the letter came back and it was stamped saying he had left the service thats too bad he sounds like a good man they got him too yeah they get everyone in the end no i dont just mean them they i mean a specific guy with influence who set about to purify the world we were part of the purification process id still like to look that guy up commander bonson heres to you commander bonson and your little victory you won in the end your kind always does flare green high then two or three more green suns descending git ready said bob they could hear the ponkponkponk as a few hundred yards away three mm mortar shells were dropped down their tubes the shells climbed into the air behind a faint whistle then reached apogee and began their downward flight get down screamed bob the two flattened into the mud of the shallow hole the three shells landed fifty meters away exploding almost simultaneously the noise split the air and the two marines bounced from the ground ah christ a minute passed three more flares opened green and almost wet spraying sparks all over the place bob wished he had targets but what the hell difference did it make now he lay facedown in the mud feeling the texture of vietnam in his face smelling its smells knowing he would never see another of its dawns ponkponkponk the shells climbed whispering of death and the end of possibilities then descended oh jesus bob prayed oh dear jesus let me live please let me live the shells detonated thirty meters away triple concussions loud as hell something in his shoulder began to sting even before he landed again in vietnam having been lifted by the force of the blast acrid chinese smoke filled his eyes and nostrils he knew the drill somewhere a spotter was calling in corrections fifty back right fifty that should put you right on it oh it was so very near i was a bad son donny sobbed im so sorry i was a bad son oh please forgive me i was a bad son i couldnt stand to visit my dad in the hospital he looked so awful oh daddy im so sorry you were a good son bob whispered fiercely your daddy understood dont you worry about it none ponkponkponk bob thought of his own daddy he wished hed been a better son too he remembered his daddy pulling out in his state trooper cruiser that last night in the twilight who knew it was a last time his mother wasnt there his daddy put his hand out to wave to bob then turned left heading back to blue eye and would there go on out us to his rendezvous with jimmy pye and his and jimmys deaths in a cornfield that looked like any other cornfield in the world the explosions lifted them and more parts of bob seemed to go numb then sting this triple shot bracketed the position this was it they had them they had merely to drop a few more shells down the tube and the direct hit would come out of statistical inevitability and it would be all over fire for effect im so sorry donny was sobbing bob held him close felt his young animal fear knew there was no glory in any of it only an ending a mercy and who would know they lived or died or fought here on this hilltop im so sorry donny was sobbing there there bob said someone fired an orange flare over on the horizon it was a big one it hung there for the longest time and only far past the moment when reasonable men would have caught on did it at last dawn on them that it wasnt a flare at all it was the sun and with the sun came the phantoms the phantoms came low screaming in from the east along the axis of the valley their jet growls filling the air almost splitting it they dropped long tubes that rolled through the air into the valley beneath and blossomed or anger than the sun or anger and hotter than any sun with the power of thousands of pounds of jellied gasoline god screamed bob air air they peeled off almost in climbing victory rolls and a second flight hammered down filling the valley with its cleansing flame then the gunships cobras not like snakes but like thrumming insects thin and agile in the air they roared in their miniguns screaming like chainsaws ripping through lumber just eating up the valley the radio bob said donny rolled over thrust the prc at bob who swiftly got it on searched for the preset band that was the airground freak hit eight hit eight donny was screaming and bob found it turned it on to find people looking for him bravofour sierrabravofour come in please immediate where are you sierrabravofour this is yankeeninerpapa yankeeninerpapa i am army fac at far end valley i need your position immediate over yankeeninerpapa this is sierrabravofour goddamn aint you boys a sight where are you sierrabravofour over i am on a hill approximately two klicks outside arizona on the eastern side of the valley uh i dont got no reading on it i dont got no map i drop smoke sierrabravofour drop smoke yankeeninerpapa i drop smoke bob grabbed a smoke grenade pulled the pin and tossed it whirls of angry yellow fog spurted from the spinning hissing grenade and fluttered high and ragged against the dawn sierrabravofour i eyeball your yellow smoke over yankeeninerpapa that is correct uh i have beaucoup bad guys all around the farm i need help immediate can you clean out the barnyard for me yankee ninerpapa over wilco sierrabravo yall hang tight while i direct immediate stay by your smoke out in seconds the cobras diverted to the little hill upon which bob and donny cowered the miniguns howled the rockets screamed then the gunships fell back and a squadron of phantoms flashed by low and fast and directly in front of bob and donny the napalm bloomed hot and bright in tumbling flame the smell of gasoline reached their noses soon enough it was quiet sierrabravofour this is yankeezulunineteen i am coming in to get you it was the bird the huey army od its rotors beating as if to force the devil down as it settled over them whipping up the dust and flattening the vegetation bob clapped donny on the back of the neck and pushed him toward the bird they ran the twentyodd feet to the open hatch where eager hands pulled them away from the land of bad things the chopper zoomed skyward into the light hey donny said over the roar its stopped raining chapter seventeen even in the hospital huu co senior colonel was criticized it was merciless it was relentless it went beyond cruelty each day at hours he was wheeled into the committee room his burned left arm swaddled in bandages his head dopey with painkillers his brain ringing with revolutionary adages with which nurses and doctors alike pummeled him in all his waking hours he sat stiffly in the heat waiting as the painkillers gradually diminished facing faceless accusers from behind banks of lights senior colonel why did you not press on despite your casualties senior colonel who advised you to halt your progress and send units to deal with the american sniper senior colonel are you infected with the typhus of ego do you not trust the fatherland and its vessel the party senior colonel why did you waste time setting up mortars when a small unit could have kept the americans pinned and you might have made your attack on the camp arizona before dawn senior colonel did political commissar phut go argue with you as to the best course of action before his heroic death and if so why did you discount his advice do you not know he spoke with the authority of the party the questions were endless as was his pain they were also right in their implication he had behaved unprofessionally egged on by the demon of western ego whose poison was evidently deep in his soul un purged by years of rigor and asceticism he had allowed it to become a personal duel between himself and the american who so bedeviled him he had given up the mission to kill the american and failed at both if intelligence reports could be believed he was in disgrace no meaningful future loomed before him he had failed because his heart was weak and his character flawed everything they said about him was true and the criticism he received was not nearly enough punishment they could not punish him more than he punished himself he deserved the fury of hell he deserved oblivion he was a cockroach who hadbut then the strangest thing happened even as he endured yet another session feeling the unbending wills ofthe political officers crushing against the fragility of his own pitiful identity the doors were flung open and two men from the politburo rushed in handed an envelope to the senior inquisitioner which the man tore open and read nervously then his face broke into a huge smile of love and compassion he looked at huu co as if he were looking at the savior of the people the great uncle ho himself oh colonel he brayed in the voice of such sugary sweetness it seemed nearly indecent oh colonel you look so uncomfortable in that chair surely you would like a glass of tea tran quickly run to the kitchen get the colonel a glass of tea and some nice candy sugar beet american chocolate hersheys we have hersheys probably if i do say so myself with almonds almonds said the colonel who yes far down did in fact enjoy hersheys with almonds tran who had an instant before been upbraiding the colonel for his stupidity rushed out with the furious urgency of a lackey and returned in seconds with treats and drinks and almondstudded hershey bars for the new celebrity in very short time the committee had gathered around their new great friend and revolutionary hero the colonel and even old tran himself pushed the colonel to the automobile in his wheelchair inquiring warmly about the colonels beautiful wife and his six wonderful children the committee waved goodbye merrily as the colonel was driven away in a shiny citreon by the two politburo officers who said nothing but offered him cigarettes and a thermos of tea and did everything to assure his comfort why am i suddenly rehabilitated he asked i am a class traitor and coward i am a wrecker an obstructionist a deviationist a secret western spy oh colonel the senior of the men said laughing uncomfortably you joke you are so funny is he not a funny one the colonels wit is legendary and huu co saw that this man too was terrified what on earth could be happening and then he knew only one presence in the republic of north vietnam could explain such a sea change the russians at their military compound soviet experts from gruchief intelligence directorategrilled him intently though no effort was made to assign guilt the men were remote and intense at once in black spetsnaz combat uniforms without rank though subtle distinctions on the team could be recognized they never once mentioned politics or the revolution he understood clearly this wasnt preparation for a trial it was an intelligence operation they were very thorough in their western way he talked them through it slowly working first from maps and then after the first day from a scale model of the valley before kham due quickly built and painted with surprising accuracy the conversations were all in russian you were here when the first shots came how many he fired three times semiauto no bolt action he never fired quickly enough for semiauto though he was very very good with that bolt he may have been the fastest man with a bolt ive ever heard of the russians listened intently but it wasnt just the sniper that interested them that was clear no it was the whole action the loss of the sapper squad the sounds of fire from the right flank the presence of the flares the flares especially the flares you can describe them well yes comrade they appeared to be standard american combat flares bright white more powerful than our green chinese equivalent they hung in the air approximately two minutes and grew brighter as they descended they listened taking notes keeping elaborate charts and time lines trying to reconstruct the event in painstaking detail it was even clear they had interviewed other participants of the kham due battle they forced him to no conclusions instead they seemed his partner in a journey to understanding now colonel the team leader asked a small ratty man who smoked marlboros based on what weve learned i wonder if youd venture a guess as to what happened what is the significance of the flares particularly given their location visavis the angle of most of the fire directed at you clearly there was another man these american marine sniper teams they are almost always twomen operations yes the team leader said yes that is what we think also and interestingly enough the ballistics bear you out some men were killed by grain bullets which is the american match target ammunition which is the snipers round but we also recovered bodies with grain slugs which is the standard combat load of the m so clearly one of the rifles was the remington bolt action and the other the m of course thats different than the men killed by the fortyfivecaliber submachine gun we believe that was the snipers secondary weapon the colonel was astounded they had torn into this as if it were an autopsy as if its last secrets must be exhumed it was so important to them as if their most precious asset were somehow at risk and now they were committed totally to the destruction of the threat do you wish to know about these men the colonel did yes but his own ego had to be conquered for to learn about the men who had destroyed his battalion and his reputation and his future would be to further personalize the event and make it private an obsession an extension of his own life as if its significance were him and not the cause no i think not i care nothing for personality well spoken but alas it is now a necessity it is part of your new assignment well wasnt this interesting a new assignment under russian sponsorship what possibly could it mean and so it was that he learned of his primary antagonist a man called swagger a sergeant who had once won a great shooting championship and had done much damage to the cause of the fatherland in his three tours in vietnam and was even now prowling the glades in hunt of yet more victims they had a picture of him from something called leatherneck magazine and what he saw was what he expected he knew americans from paris and from his time in saigon with the puppets this one was a type perhaps exaggerated but familiar thin hard resilient braver even than the french brave as any germans in the legion cunning with that specially devious quality of mind that let him instinctively understand weakness and move decisively against it disciplined in a way the americans almost never were he would have made a brilliant party official so tight and focused was his mind the picture simply showed a sliteyed young man with prominent cheekbones his leathery face lit with a grin he held some ludicrous trophy thing in his arms next to him was an older version of the same man same slit eyes closecropped hair but with more vanity on his chest sergeant swagger accepts the congratulations of the commandant after winning at camp perry read the caption translated into the vietnamese it was warriors glee the colonel knew and he saw in those slit eyes the deaths of so many and the remorseless ness that had driven their executioner for this one he said the war is not a cause it is merely an excuse possibly said the russian intelligence chief perhaps even the war releases him to find his greatness but do you not think he has a certain discipline he is not profligate he is not one of their criminals like the calleys and the medinas he has never raped or murdered in combat he has no sexual weaknesses a pathology associated with psychopathy he is not a psychopath huu co said he is a hero though the line between them is thin possibly fragile he needs a cause to find his true self that is what i mean he is the sort who must have a cause to live he needs something to humble himself in front of take that from him and you take everything very good here here is more here is what we have it was more on swagger culled from various american public resources the package included unbelievably marine records obviously from a very sensitive source yes study this man study him well learn him he is your new responsibility yes of course i accept and what is the ultimate arrival of this project why his death of course his death and the death of the other one too they both must die he slept swagger he dreamed swagger he read swagger he ate swagger swagger engaged and caused the rebirth of the western part of his mind he struggled to grasp principles like pride and honor and courage and how their existence sustained a corrupt bourgeoisie state for such a state could not exist without the pure fire of such centurions as swagger standing watch ready to die on the rhines of its empires why me he asked the russian why not one of your own analysts what can our analysts know you have been fighting these people since you have been fighting them since but ours is a distant fight a theoretical fight yours is up close close enough to smell blood and shit and piss thats experience hard bought and much respected then another day brought another surprise reconnaissance photos taken from a highflying vehicle of some sort of what appeared to be a marine post in the jungles of some province of his own country i corps said the russian about forty kilometers from kham due one of the last american combat posts left in the zone they call it firebase dodge city a marine installation it is from here the american swagger and his spotter mount their missions yes yes well if were to take him itll be on his territory hell always have the advantage unless of course we can learn the terrain as well as he knows it surely local cadre well now isnt that an interesting situation local cadre have been extremely inactive in that region for some months this man swagger terrifies them they call him in your language quan toi the nailer the nailer like a carpenter the nailer he nails them at any rate at the local cadre level most combat operations have ceased that is why firebase dodge city still exists when so many other marines have been shipped home because the nailer has nailed so many people that nobody likes to operate in his area what is the point the war will be over soon he will be recalled that will be that but we cannot let that be that can we but try as he might huu co could not hate the american it seemed pointless the man was no architect of war no policy designer he clearly had no sadistic side to him no tendency toward atrocity he was merely an excellent professional soldier of the sort all armies have relied upon for thousands of years he had some extra gene for aggression some extra gene for shooting ability and that was it he was a believeror maybe not the colonel remembered from his other life the frenchman camus who said when men of action cease to believe in a cause they believe only in action it didnt matter nor did it matter that he wondered what the delay was why were they not moving now if this was so important why were they waiting what were they waiting for he applied himself to the problem and set out to master the terrain in and around firebase dodge city it was situated on a hill and the americans had deforested for a thousand yards all around it with their agent orange the camp was typical hed seen hundreds in his long years of war its tactical problems were typical too in many respects it was similar to the un fallen acamp arizona the doctrine was primitive but usually effective approach at night rally in the dark send in sappers to blow the wire attack in strength but for the killing of one sniper team that was a different tactical problem the team would probably exit at night that is if they werent helicopter extracted the trick would then be understanding from which point from the perimeter they would leave and what would be their typical passage across the open zone one could therefore hope to intercept them if one knew the terrain and the way swaggers mind worked studying the photos huu co saw three natural paths away from the camp through gulches enfilades natural depressions in the land where men would travel to avoid being spotted one would set an ambush at such points yes it would be possibly effective a long stalk luck playing the most likely role but if for some reason the americans could be induced to leaving during the day right say at first dawn a good shooter might have a chance to hit them from a hill not quite fifteen hundred yards out oh it was a long shot a desperately long shot but the right man might bring it off much more effectively say than an ambush team whos luck might be on or off but where would such a man be found he knew the north vietnamese certainly didnt have such a man in fact such a man such a specialist might not exist at least not effectively huu co said nothing about his the russians did not ask him and then one night he was awakened roughly by spetsnaz troopers and informed that they had a journey to make he climbed into a shiny black zil limousine in his dress uniform among four or five russians all talking and laughing boisterously among themselves they ignored him they drove into hanoi through darkened streets down the broad but now empty boulevards and by the ceremonial plazas where the american phantoms were displayed banners napped mightily in the wind onward to victory brothers and long live the fatherland and let us embrace the revolutionary future the russians paid them no mind and laughed and talked of women and alcohol and smoked american cigarettes they were like americans in many ways not an observant or respectful people but men who took their own destiny so much for granted that they could be annoying after a time huu co realized where they were going unmistakably they headed for the peoples revolutionary airfield north of hanoi passed through its wire defenses and guard posts with the wave of passes of the highest clearance and sped not to the main building but to an outoftheway compound which was heavily guarded by white men with automatic weapons in the combat uniforms of spetsnaz the hotshots who got all the sexy assignments and handled training for nva cadre on certain dark arcane secret arts the zil parked debarking its men who escorted huu co inside to discover an extremely comfortable little chunk of russia complete with televisions a bar elaborate western furniture and the like also many playboy magazines lay about and empty beer bottles and the walls were festooned with pictures of blond women with large gravitydefying breasts and no pubic hair russians thought huu co after a time the little party went out to the tarmac parked at the obscure end of a runway and awaited the arrival of someone designated solaratov whether a real name or a trade name huu co was not informed no rank either no first name just solaratov as if the name itself conveyed quite enough information thank you again it was chilly though no rain the hot season was hard on them but it had not arrived yet in the emerging gray light huu co stood a little apart from the crowd of bawdy laughing russian intelligence and spetsnaz people himself the solitary man not a part of their camaraderie and unsure why his presence was required yet clearly they wanted him here he was seeing things possibly no north vietnamese below the politburo level had seen why what was the meaning of it all the sound of a jet airplane asserted itself low but insistent coming in from the east out of the sun the plane flashed overhead glinting in the rising light revealing itself to be a tupolev tu codenamed by the americans badger a twinengine threeman bombing craft with a bubble canopy and sparkle of plastic at the nose it wore combat drab and its red stars stood out boldly against green camouflage its flaps were down and it peeled to the west found a landing vector and set down on the main runway it taxied for a distance then began to head over toward the little party standing by itself on the runway the plane halted and its jet engines screamed a final time then died a hatch door opened beneath the nose just behind the forward tire of the tricycle landing gear and almost immediately two aviators descended waved to the crowd then got aboard a little car that had come for them while russian ground crew attended to the airplane oh hell make us wait of course one of the russians said the bastard nobody hurries him hed make the party secretary wait if it suited his fucking purpose there was some laughter but after a while another figure descended from the aircraft climbing slowly down then landing on the tarmac he wore an aviators black jumpsuit but he was no aviator he carried with him something awkward a long flat case a musical instrument or something he turned to look at the greeters and his face instantly silenced them he was a wintry little man late thirties with a stubble of gray hair and a thick short bull neck his eyes were blue beads in a leather mask that was his grim face he had immense hands and huu co saw that he was quite muscular for so short a fellow with a broad chest and a spring of power to his movements no salutes were offered no exchange of military courtesies if he knew any of the russians he hid the information there seemed nothing emotional about him at all no sense of ceremony a man rushed to him to take the package he carried the little fellow silenced him with a vicious glare and made it apparent that he would carry the case the severity of his response driving the man back into humiliated confusion solaratov said the russian intelligence chief how was the flight cramped said solaratov i should tell them i only fly first class there was nervous laughter solaratov walked by the colonel without noticing him surrounded by sycophants and boot lickers he actually reminded huu co of a figure that had been pointed out to him back in the late forties in paris another man of glacial isolation whose glare quieted the masses who neverthelessor perhaps for that reason indeedattracted sycophants in the legions but who paid them no attention at all whose reputation was like the cloud of blue ice that seemed to surround him that one was named sartre chapter eighteen vietnam leaped up at him as if out of a dream green endless crusted with mountains voluptuous violent ugly beautiful all at once the land of bad things but also in some way the land of good things where i went to war donny thought where i fought with bob lee swagger it wasnt a dream it never had been it was the real mccoy as glimpsed through the dirty plastic of an aircraft dipping toward that destination from okinawa where grunts headed to the nam touched down on the way back from rr monkey mountain loomed ahead on the crazed peninsula above china beach and beyond that like downtown dayton the multi service base and airstrip at da nang displayed itself in a checkerboard of buildings streets and airstrips hills and stood like dusty warts beyond it the c oriented itself off the coastline dropped through the low clouds and slid through tropic haze until it touched down at the ghost town that had once been one of the most populous cities of the world the capital of the marine country of i corps home of the ruling body of the marine war the iii marine amphibious force the palms still blew in the breeze and around it the mountains still rose in green tropic splendor but the place was largely empty now its ma inside structure shrunken to a few tempo buildings an empty or at least vietnamized metropolis a few offices were still staffed a few barracks still lived in but the techies and the staffs and the experts whod run the war in vietnam were home safe except for the odd laggard unit like the boys of firebase dodge city and a few others in the haphazard distribution of lateleavers across i corps the plane finally stopped taxiing its four props ended their mission with a turbinepowered whine as their fuel was cut off the plane shuddered mightily paused like a giant beast and went still in seconds the rear door descended and donny and the cargo of twentyodd shorttimers and reluctant warriors felt the furnace blast of heat and the stench of burning shit that announced they were back he stepped into the radiance felt it slam him this fuckin place will git me yet said a black old salt with a dozen or so stripes on his sleeve and enough wound ribbons to have bled out a platoon aint you short someone asked i aint as short as the lance corporal he said winking at donny with whom hed struck up a bantering relationship on the flight over from kadena air force base on okie if i was as short as him id twist an ankle and head straight for sick bay hes a hero the other lifer said he aint going in no sick bay the old black sarge pulled him aside dont you be takin no badass chances in the bush you hear the man said two and days fenn shit dont git busted up it aint worth it this shithole place aint worth a thing if you aint a career sucker gittin the ticket punched one more time dont let the man git you i copy now git over to reception and git your grunt ass squared away peace said donny flashing the sign the sergeant looked around saw no one close enough to overhear or overlook and flashed the sign back peace and freedom and all that good shit bro he said with a wink donny hit reception with his sea bag to arrange temporary quarters for the night and the soonest chopper hop back to dodge city he felt good a week on maui with julie oh christ who wouldnt feel good could it have been any better swagger had slipped him an envelope as hed choppered out after debriefing and hed been stunned to discover a thousand dollars cash with instructions to bring none of it back why would swagger do such a thing it was so generous so spontaneousjust a strangeass way of doing things it waswell a young man back from the war with his beautiful young wife in the paradise of hawaii under a hot and purifying sun flush with money and possibility and so short he could finally after three years and nine months and days see the end see it made it im out she said its almost too cruel we could have this and then you could get killed no thats not how it works the nva fights twice a year in the spring and fall they fought their big spring offensive and now theyre all stuck up in a siege around an loc city fighting the arvn way down near saigon were out of it nothing will happen in our little area were home free its just a question of getting through the boredom i swear to you i dont think i could stand it theres nothing to worry about you sound like the guy in the war movie who always gets killed they dont make war movies anymore he said nobody cares about war movies then they made love again for what seemed like the th time he found new plateaus from which to observe her new angles into her new sensations tastes and ecstacies it doesnt get much better than this he finally said god hawaii well come back here on our fiftieth anni ver no she said suddenly as sweaty as he and just as flushed dont say that its bad luck sweetie i dont need luck i have bob lee swagger on my side he is luck itself that was then this was now and donny stood at the bank of fluorescentlit desks in a big green room that was reception until a buck sergeant finally noticed him put down the phone and gestured him to the desk donny sat handed over his documents hi im fenn hotel back from rr on sked heres my paperwork i need a billet for the night and then a jump out to dodge city on the fenn said the sergeant looking at the order all right let me just check it out looks okay youre one of the guys in the kham due he entered donnys return in the logbook stamped the orders adroitly forged his captains signature and slipped them back to donny all in a single motion yeah that was me my nco pulled in some favors and got me rrd out for ten days youve been nominated for the navy cross jesus you wont get it though theyre not giving out big medals anymore well i really dont care theyll probably buck it down to a star i have a star no a silver wow hero too bad it dont count for shit back in the world in the old days you could have been a movie star i just want to make it back in one piece i can pay to see movies thats as close to movies as i want to get well then i have good news for you fenn you got new orders your transfer came through donny thought he misunderstood what i mean there must bewhat do you mean transfer i didnt ask for a transfer i dont see what here it is fenn your orders were cut three days ago you been dumped in charlie and assigned to battalion s thats us here in da nang were the administrative battalion for whats left of marine presence my guess is youll be running a pt program here in da nang for a couple of months before you deros out on the big freedom bird your days in the bush are over congratulations grunt you made it unless you get hit by a truck on the way to the slop chute no see i dont you go on over to battalion check in with the duty nco and hell get you squared away show you your new quarters youre in luck you wont believe this we closed down our barracks and moved into some the air force vacated cause they were closer to the airstrip airconditioning fenn airconditioning donny just looked at him as if the comment made no sense fenn this is a milk run you got it made in the shade its a numberone job youll be working for gunny bannister a good man enjoy i dont want a transfer donny said the sergeant looked up at him he was a mild patient man sandy blond hair professionalbureaucrat type of remf the sort of sandydry man who always makes the machine work cleanly he smiled dryly fenn he explained the marine corps really doesnt care if you want a transfer or not in its infinite military wisdom it has decreed that you will teach a pt class to lardass rearechelon motherfuckers like me until you go home you wont even see any more vietnamese you will sleep in an airconditioned building take a shower twice a day wear your tropicals pressed salute every shit bird officer that walks no matter how stupid not work very hard stay very drunk or high and have an excellent time youll take beaucoup threeday weekends at china beach those are your orders they are better orders than some poor grunts stuck out on the dmz or hill but they are your orders nevertheless and that is the name of that tune clear fenn donny took a deep breath where does this come from it comes straight from the top your co and your ncoic signed off on it no who started it come on i have to know the sergeant looked at him i have to know i was sierrabravofour sniper team i dont want to lose that job its the best job there is son any job the marine corps gives you is the best job but you could find out you could check you could see where it comes from i mean it is unusual that a guy with bush time left suddenly gets rotated out of his firebase slot and stowed in some makework pussy job isnt it sergeant the sergeant sighed deeply then picked up the phone he schmoozed with whomever was on the other end of the line waited a bit schmoozed some more and finally nodded thanked his coconspirator and hung up swagger thats your nco yes swagger choppered in here last week and went to see the co not battalion but higher the fmf pac co the man with three stars on his collar your orders were cut the next day he wants you out of there swagger dont want you humping the bush with him no more donny checked in with the pfc on duty at charlie got a bunk and a locker in the old air force barracks which were more like a college dormitory and spent an hour getting stowed away looking out the window he could not see a single palm tree just an ocean of tarmac buildings offices it could have been henderson hall back in arlington or cameron station the multi service px out at baileys crossroads no yellow people could be seen just americans doing their jobs then he went to storage to pick up his stowed gear and boonie duds and lugged the sea bag to supply to return it but learned supply was already closed for the day so he lugged the stuff back to his locker he checked back in at company headquarters to meet his new gunny and the co neither man could be foundboth had gone back to quarters early he went by the s officeoperations and trainingto look for bannister the pt nco and found that office locked too and bannister long since retreated to the staff nco club he went back to the barracks where some other kids were getting ready to go to the moviespatton already two years old was the pictureand then to the club for a night of dowsing their sorrows in cheap px budweiser they seemed like nice young guys and they clearly knew who donny was and were hungry to get close to him but he said no for reasons he himself did not quite understand he was tired he climbed into the rack early pulling clean newly issued sheets around him feeling the springiness of the cot beneath the air conditioner churned with a low hum pumping out gallons of dry cold air donny shivered pulled the sheets closer about him there were no alerts that night no incoming there hadnt been incoming in months at he was awakened by the drunken kids returning from the club but when he stirred they quieted down fast donny lay in the dark as the others slipped in listening to the roar of the air conditioner i have it made he told himself am out of here i am the original deros kid i am made in the shade i am the milkrun boy he dreamed of pima county of julie of an ordered becalmed and rational life he dreamed of love and duty he dreamed of sex he dreamed of children and the good life all americans have an absolute right to if they work hard enough for it at odark he arose quietly showered in the dark pulled on his bush utilities and gathered up his gear and headed out to the chopper strip it was a long walk in the predawn above him mute piles and piles of stars were humped up tall and deep like a mountain range now and then from somewhere in this dark land came the faroff artificial sound of gunfire once some flares lit the horizon somewhere something exploded the choppers were warming up he ducked into the operations shack chatted with another lance corporal then jogged to the marinegreen huey its rotors already whirring on the tarmac he leaned in and the crew chief looked at him this is whiskeyromeofourteen thats us youre the bus to dodge city yeah youre fenn right we took you outta here two weeks back great job at kham due fenn can you hump me back to the city its time to go home climb aboard son we are homeward bound chapter nineteen you will crawl all night huu co explained to the russian if you do not make it they will see you in the morning and kill you if he expected the man to react once again he was wrong the russian responded to nothing he seemed in some respects hardly human or at least he had no need for some of the things humans needed rest community conversation humanity even he never spoke he appeared phlegmatic to the point of being almost vegetable yet at the same time he never complained he would not wear out he applied no formal sense of will against huu co and the elite commandos of the th sapper battalion on their long journey of ten thousand miles down the trail from the north he never showed fear longing thirst discomfort humor anger or compassion he seemed not to notice much and hardly ever talked and then only in grunts he was squat isolated perhaps desolated in his army huu cos heroes were designated brother ten when they distinguished themselves by killing ten americans this man huu co realized was brother five hundred or some such number he had no ideology no enthusiasms he simply was solaratov solitary the lone man it suited him well the russian looked across the fifteen hundred yards of flattened land to the marine base the enemy called dodge city studying it there was no approach no visible approach except on ones belly the long long way could you hit him from this range the russian considered i could hit a man from this range yes he finally said but how would i know it was the right man i cannot see a face from this distance i have to hit the right man that is the point the argument was well made so then you must crawl i can crawl if you hit him how will you get out this time im only looking but when i hit him ill wait till dark then come out the same way i came in theyll call in mortars artillery napalm even it is their way yes i may die in napalm not pleasant ive heard many scream as it ate the flesh from their bones its over in an instant but i had the impression it was a long instant the russian merely glared at him no recognition in his eyes at all even though theyd lived in close proximity for a week and had for days before that pored over the photos and the mockup of dodge city my advice comrade brother said huu co is that you follow the depression in the earth three hundred meters you move at dark in maximum camouflage they have night scopes and they will be hunting but the scopes arent one hundred percent reliable itll be a long stalk a terrible stalk i can only hope you are up to it and that your heart is strong and pure i have no heart said the solitary man i am the sniper for the first recon solaratov did not take his case which by now all considered a rifle sheath he carried no weapons except a spetsnaz dagger black and thin and wicked he left at nightfall dappled in camouflage looking more like an ambulatory swamp than a man behind his back the sappers called him not the solitary man or the russian but with the eternal insouciance of soldiers the human noodle because the stalks were stiff like unboiled noodles in seconds as he slithered off through the elephant grass he was invisible huu co noted that his technique was extraordinary a mastery of the self this was the ultimate slow he moved with delicacy one limb at a time a pace so slow and deliberate it almost didnt exist who would have patience for such a journey he is mad one of the sappers said to another all russians are mad said the other you can see it in their eyes but this one is really mad hes nuts the sappers waited quietly underground in elaborate tunnels built in the year of the snake they cooked meals enjoyed juryrigged showers and treated the event almost like a furlough it was a happy time for men who had fought hard been wounded many times at least six of them were brothers ten they were shrewd experienced professionals for his time huu co studied the photographs or waited up top hidden in the grass using up his eyestrain to stare at the strange fort fifteen hundred yards off which looked so artificial cut into the earth of his beloved country by men from across the sea with a different sensibility and no sense of history he waited staring at the sea of grass his arm hurt he could hardly close his hand when he grew bored he snatched a book from his tunic in english it was lord of the rings by jrr tolkein very amusing it took him away from this world but always when frodos adventures vanished he had to return to firebase dodge city and his deepest question when would the sniper return the fire ants were only the first of his many ordeals attracted to his sweat they came and crawled into the folds of his neck tasting his blood crawling biting feasting he was a banquet for the insect world after the ants others were drawn mosquitoes big as american helicopters buzzed around his ears lit on his face stung him gently and departed bloated what else spiders mites ticks dragonflies the whole phyla drawn to the miasma of decay a sweating man produces in the tropics on a hot morning but not maggots maggots are for the dead and perhaps in some way the maggots respected him he was not dead and moreover he fed the maggots much in his time on earth they left him alone it wasnt that solaratov was beyond feeling such things he felt them all right he felt every sting bite prick or tweak his aches and swellings and blotches and throbbings were the same as any mans he had just some how managed to disconnect the feeling part of his body from the registering part of his brain it can be learned and at the upper reaches of the performance envelope among those who are not merely brave willful or dedicated but truly among the best in the world extraordinary things are routine he lay now in the elephant grass approximately one hundred yards from the sandbag perimeter of firebase dodge city just outside the double strands of concertina wire he could see claymore mines facing him from a dozen angles and the halfburied detonators of other larger mines but he could also hear american rock and roll bellowing out of the transistor radios all the young marines seemed to carry and listening to it was his only pleasure i cant get no satisfaction someone sang with a loud raspy voice and solaratov understood he could get no satisfaction either the marines were unbearably sloppy he had seen the israelis from extremely close range in some of his ops and the british sas and even the fabled american green berets all were sound troops these boys thought the war was over for them they were worse than cubans or angolans they lounged around sunbathing played touch football or baseball or basketball sneaked out to smoke hemp got in fights or got drunk their sentries slept at night the officers didnt bother to shave nobody dressed in anything resembling a uniform and most spent the days in shorts undershirts or shirtless and shower shoes even when they went on combat patrol they were loud and stupid the point men paid no attention the flank security drifted in toward the column the machine gunner had his belts tangled around him and his assistant with other belts fell too far behind him to do him any good in a fight clearly they had not been in a fight in months if ever clearly they expected no such thing to occur as they waited for the order to leave the country once a patrol stumbled right over him five men hustling through the elephant grass on the way out for a night ambush mission walked so close to him that if any had been even remotely awake they would have killed him easily he saw their jungle boots big as mountains just inches from his face but two of the men were listening to radios one was clearly high one so young and frightened he belonged in school and the platoon leader stuck with these silly boys looked terrified solaratov knew exactly what would happen the patrol would go out a thousand yards and the sergeant would hunker them down in some high grass where theyd sit all night smoking and talking and pretending they werent at war in the morning the sergeant would bring them in and file a nocontact report it was the kind of war fought by men whod rather be anywhere except in the war each night solaratov would relieve himself handbury his feces drink from his canteen and slowly ever so slowly change position he didnt care what was in the encampment but he had to know by what routes an experienced man would make an egress on the way to a hunting mission how would swagger take his spotter out which part of the sandbag berm would they go over and from what latitudes was it accessible to rifle fire he made careful notes identifying eight or nine spots where there appeared to be a lane through the wire and the claymores and the mines where an experienced man would travel efficiently of course conversely the other marines would stay well clear of these areas he read the land looking for folds that led out of the camp to the treeline or a progression of obstacles behind which two men moving quickly could transverse on the way to the job they were the only two men still fighting the war they were the only two men keeping this place alive he wondered if the other soldiers knew it probably not twice he saw swagger himself and felt the hot rush of excitement a hunter sees when his prey steps into the kill zone but always he cautioned himself to be slow be sure not to become excited that caused mistakes from this vantage point swagger was a tall thin hard man who always appeared paradeground neat in his camouflaged tunic solaratov could read his contempt for the boys of dodge city but also his restraint his disinterest his commitment to his own duties that kept him apart from them he was aloof walking alone always solaratov knew this wellit was the snipers way the russian also noted that when swagger walked through the compound even the loudest and most disgruntled of the marines grew quickly still and pretended to work he worked silently and moved with economy of motion and style but he was not going on missions for now and seemed to spend much of his time indoors in a bunker that was probably intelligence or communications on the last day he saw him again from an even closer vantage point solaratov had worked up until he was but fifty meters from the complex of huts where swagger seemed to spend most of his time in hopes of getting a good look into the face of the man he proposed to kill by this time he was quite bold convinced that the marines were too narcissistic to notice his presence even if he stood and announced it through a bullhorn it was after the daily helicopter flight the huey dipped in fast landed at the firebases lz and a young man jumped out even as the rotors still spun and kicked up a pall of dust he disappeared into the complex but in time solaratov saw him this time with swagger it looked almost to be a fight the two raged at each other far from the others if he were armed it might have been a chance to take them both but there was no escape and if hed fired shots even these childish troopers could have brought massive firepower to bear and gotten him that wasnt the point he wasnt on a suicide mission he would never give himself up for an objective unless there was no other way and the objective represented something that was his own passionate deeply held conviction not a job for another department that he didnt fully trust to begin with so he just listened and watched the two had it out it was like a final confrontation between a proud father and his disappointing son or an upright son and his disappointing father he could hear the anger and the betrayal and the accusation in the voices what the fuck is wrong with you the older man kept screaming in the english that the russian had studied for years you cannot do this to me you do not have the moral authority to do this to me the younger screamed back on and on it went like a grand scene from dostoyevsky it was a mark of how each man was held in the respect of his comrades that no witnesses intruded no officers interceded their anger drove the young marines normally working hard on their suntans by this time inside finally the two men reached some kind of rapprochement they went back into the intelligence bunker and after a while the young man left alone and went over to what must have been the living quarters where he would bunk he emerged an hour or so later in full combat gear with a rifle and a flack vest and went back to the intelligence bunker solaratov knew at last the spotter is back there were no other sightings that day and at nightfall solaratov finished his last canteen rolled over and began the long crawl back to the tunnel complex in the treeline more than a thousand yards away senior colonel the human noodle is here the call from a sergeant rocked huu co out of sleep it was a good thing too as on most nights he was reliving the moment when the american phantoms came roaring down the valley and the napalm pods tumbled lazily from under their wings they hit about fifty meters ahead of his forward position in the valley and bounced majestically pulling a curtain of living flame behind them he arose swiftly and located the russian eating with gusto and lack of sophistication in the tunnels mess hall the russian devoured everything in sight including noodles fish head soup chunks of raw cabbage beef pork tripe he ate with his fingers which were now coated with grease he ate with perfect clarity and concentration pausing now and then for a satisfying belch or to wipe a paw across his greasy mouth he drank too glass after glass of tea and water finally when he was done he asked for vodka which was produced a small russian bottle he finished it in a single draught at last he turned and faced the senior colonel now i wash then i sleep maybe fortyeight hours then on the third day i will move out you have a plan i know when and where hell leave and how hell move its in the land if you can read the land you can read the other mans mind ill kill them both three days from now for the first time he smiled chapter twenty the huey dipped low and landed in a swirl of dust quickly the crew chief kicked off that runs suppliesa couple of crates of belted mm nato a couple more of mm nato for the ms package of medical provisions an intelligence pouch a command pouchnothing major just the routine deliveries of warand donny the chopper zoomed upward leaving him standing there in the maelstrom choking jesus youre back it was a lance corporal in another platoon a vague acquaintance yeah they tried to fire me but i love this place so much i had to come back jesus christ fenn you had it knocked nobody ever got out of here early the man sends you to the world and you come back to this shit hole short as you are man you are fucked in the head yeah well a hero the lance corporal spat derisively threw the intel and command packs around his shoulders and headed out to deliver the mail the ammo would sit until someone had the gumption to gather it in donny blinked and took a fraction of a second to reorient he knew he wanted to stay away from the command bunker and the old man officially he had no standing and he didnt want to face that shit until he faced swagger he went off to the scoutsniper platoon area where bob was king but when he got there two other ncos told him bob was now over in the intel bunker and he better get his young ass over there and get this squared away one of them pointed out to him that he was officially ua from his new assignment in downtown da nang and thered be hell to pay donny navigated through the sshop area of the base a warren of sandbagged bunkers with crudely stencilled signs until at last he came to s next to commo a low structure from which flew an american flag he ducked into it feeling the temp drop a few degrees in the dark shadow smelled the mildew of the rotting burlap bags that comprised the bunkers walls saw maps and photos hung on a bulletin board and two men hunched over a desk one of whom was most definitely swagger and the other of whom was a first lieutenant named brophy the company intelligence honcho and sniper employment officer swagger looked up down then back in a hurry what the fuck are you doing here he said fiercely im back ready for duty thanks very much i had a wonderful time now ive got a tour to finish and im here to finish it lieutenant this here boy is ua from da nang hed better get his young ass back there or hell finish up in the brig you put him on report or i will i want him gone swagger almost never talked to officers this way because of course like many ncos he preferred to allow them the illusion that they had something to do with running the war but he no longer cared for protocol and the officer a decentenough guy but way overmatched against a legend chose discretion over valor you work it out with him sergeant he said and beat a hasty advance to the rear i want you out of here fenn growled swagger no damn way you are too goddamn short you will be out there thinking about humping suzie q instead of humping i corps and you will get your own and my ass greased ive seen it a hundred times you recommended me for the navy cross now youre firing me i had a hearttoheart with my closest pal bob lee swagger and he told me you are black poison in the field i want you running a pt program somewhere you go home you git out of nam i fired you youre a marine and you follow orders and those are your orders why because i say so thats why im sniper team leader and ncoic of scoutsniper platoon its my call it aint your call i dont need your permission why fenn you are getting on my damn nerves im not going until you tell me why tell me why goddammit i earned that much swaggers eyes narrowedup tight like coin slots in a coke machine what is with you he finally asked ive had three spotters before you good boys all of them but no one like you you didnt have no limits youd do anything i goddamned asked you to i dont like that you dont have no sense if i had to think about it id say you were trying to get yourself killed or trying to prove something which amounts to the same goddamn thing now you come clean with me goddammit whats going on in that head of yours why the hell are you out here donny looked away he thought a bit and finally decided to spit it out all right ill tell you you cant tell anyone its between you and me swagger stared hard at him i knew a guy named trig i mentioned him to you well he was a star peacenik but a real good guy a hero too he was willing to give his life to stop the war well i hate the war too not only for all the reasons everyone knows but also because its killing people we cant afford to lose like trig itll kill you too sergeant swagger so im going to stop it i will chain myself to the white house gate if i have to i will throw my medals back on the senate steps if i have to i will blow myself up in a building its so fucking evil what we are doing to these people and to ourselves but i cannot let anybody say i quit i bugged out i shortcut my duty they can have no doubts about me so i will fight the war fullbang dead out till the day i deros and then i will fight fullbang dead out against it he was screaming sweating like an insane man hed flared up big as life larger than bob stronger than him menacing him for the first time inconceivable until it happened he stepped back now relaxing jesus said swagger you think i give a fuck what you think about the war i dont give a shit about politics im a marine thats all i care about he sat back all right ill tell you whats going on finally you have earned that ill tell you why i want you out of here theres somebody out there huh out there out where there in the bush some new bird thats why ive been huddling with brophy it was bucked down from headquarters theres a guy out there and hes hunting for me hes a russian we think the israelis have a very good source in moscow and they got a picture of a guy climbing into a tu for the normal intel run to hanoi they knew him because hed trained arab snipers in the bekaa valley and they tried to hit him a couple of times but he was too goddamn smart our people think he worked africa too lots of stuff in africa he may have been in cuba anywhere they got shit to be settled hes the one to settle it anyhow his name has something to do with solitary or single something like that he may be a championship shooter named t solaratov who won a gold medal in prone rifle at the sixty olympics then nsa got a radio intercept a week or two back one nva regional commander talking to another about this ahn so muoi as they call it they have this thing called brother ten which is an award and a nickname they call someone whos killed ten americans its as close in their language as they come to the word sniper anyhow in this intercept the officers were jawing about the white brother ten moving down the trail to our province white sniper in other words they got this special guy this russian hes coming after me and anybody im with jesus said donny you really pissed them off fuck em if they cant take a joke bob replied and heres the new joke im going to kill this guy im going to nail him between the eyes and well send the word back to them very simply do not fuck with the united states marine corps donny suddenly said its a trap its a trap thats right im going to play catandmouse with him only he thinks hes the cat when hes the mouse we want this bird swollen with confidence thinking hes the cock of the walk its all a big phony show so we can get him to hit me in a certain way only i aint gonna be there im gonna be behind his sorry ass and i will drill him clean and if i cant drill him i will call in gunships with so much smoke there wont be nothing left but cinders now that is dangerous work and it dont seem to me it has one thing to do with being a grunt in vietnam that is why i want your young ass out of here you aint getting killed in anything this personal this is between me and this solitary man thats it no i want in no way youre out of here this aint your show this is about me no this is about the kham due i was at kham due he wants to take us for kham due swell then he wants to take me ill go against him im not afraid of him you are an

an eyeful i want him to know were back and tomorrow were going out again i dont hes out there i guarantee you hes out there in the grass a hundred meters or so away but dont look at him he can he cant do shit if he shoots from this close well call in artillery and napalm the squidsll soak his ass in burning gas and he knows it hes a sniper not a kamikaze the challenge aint just gunning me no sir its gunning me and going back to hanoi to eat grilled pork fuck a nice gal and going home on the seven oclock bus to moscow but hes there setting up planning hes reading the land getting ready for us figuring how to do us the motherfucker but were going to bust his ass now come on yell donny got with the program chapter twentyone the russian finally opened his case quickly assembled the parts with an oily clacking sound until he had built what appeared to be a rifle the dragon he said huu co thought does he think im a peasant from the south soaked in buffalo shit and rice water he of course recognized the weapon as a dragunov the new sovietbloc sniper weapon as yet unknown to vietnam it was a semiauto in the old mosinnagant x caliber a tenround magazine a mechanism based on the aks though it had a long elegant barrel it wore a skeletal stock that extended from a pistol grip a short electrically illuminated fourpower scope squatted atop the receiver the sniper inserted the match rounds into the magazine then inserted the magazine into the rifle with a snap he threw the bolt chambering a round flicked the safety on then set the rifle down then he set to wrap the rifle in a thick tape to obscure the glint of its steel and the precision of its outline as he wound huu co talked to him you do not need to zero the scope never left the receiver so no i dont in any event it wont be a long shot as i have planned it possibly two hundred meters at the longest the rifle holds to four inches at two hundred meters and i always shoot for the chest never the head the head shot is too difficult for a combat situation he was fully dressed he wore a ghillie suit of his own construction and was well tufted with a matting of beige strips identical in color to the elephant grass his hat was tufted too and under it hed painted his face in combat colors a smear of ochre and black and beige sundown came a cry from above its time said him co the sniper rose and threw a large pack over his back the rifle strap diagonally over his shoulder and with a soft swaying as of many different feathers like some exotic bird he walked to the ladder and climbed out of the tunnel he rose in the dusk and huu co followed him it was but a few hundred feet to the treeline and the long crawl down the valley toward the american firebase you have this planned huu co asked i need to know for my report well planned said the russian theyll go out just before sunrise over their berm and through their wire i can tell you exactly where because its the one place where theyre higher there arent any subtle rises in the ground theyll continue in the rising light on a northnorthwest axis then turn to the west when the sun is full theyll have a last few hundred meters to go through the grass toward the north ive examined their own afteraction reports swagger runs his missions the same each time but what varies is where hell operate if hes headed south toward kontum hell go toward the than quit river if he heads north toward the hai van peninsula then hell go toward hoi an and so forth in any event that small rise out there thats his intersection which way will he turn from there im betting tonight its toward the north because he worked the west when he headed out toward kham due its the norths turn ill set up behind him that is between himself and the firebase hell never expect shots from that direction ill take them both when they come out from behind the hill itll be over quickly two quick rounds to the body two more when theyre down nobody from the base camp can reach me by the time im back here and ive got a good clean escape route with two fall backs if need be well thought out and so it is thats what i do there was little left to say the sappers gathered around the banty little russian clapped him on the back embarrassing him night was coming quickly all was silent and in the far distance the firebase stood like a sore on the flank of a woman for the fatherland huu co said for the fatherland chimed the tough sappers for survival said the sniper who knew better the last briefing was at sundown donny faced himself or rather the man who would be himself a lance corporal named featherstone roughly his own size and coloring featherstone would wear donnys camouflaged utilities carry his gear complete to claymores and m spotting scope and the only m that could be found in the camp featherstone and brophy similarly tricked out as bob lee swagger were bait featherstone a large slow boy was not happy at this job he had been volunteered for it by virtue of his similarity to donny now he sat looking very scared in the s bunker amid a slew of officers and civilians in various uniforms everybody except featherstone seemed very excited there was a kind of party like atmosphere long absent from firebase dodge city bob went to the front of the group as they sat down and addressed the primary players captain feamster who was co here at dodge city an intelligence major who represented the marine corpss higher interest in from da nang an army colonel whod choppered in from macv s an air force liaison officer and a civilian in a jumpsuit with a swedish k submachine gun who radiated agency from all his pores a map of the immediate area had been rigged on a large sheet of cardboard reducing the clearing around dodge city to its contours and landforms and the base itself to a big x at the bottom okay gentlemen bob started and no officer in the room felt it peculiar to be briefed by a staff sergeant or at least this staff sergeant lets run this through one more time to make sure everybodys on the same page in the hymn book the game starts at when fenn and i dressed in black and painted up like black whores head out its approximately thirteen hundred yards to what im designating area thats where based on my reading of the land and this guys operating procedure as the files from washington reveal i think hes going to operate fenn and i will set up about three hundred yards from his most probable shooting zone i dont want to get too close this bird has a nose for trouble at lieutenant brophy and lance corporal featherstone roll over the berm at the point designated roger one he pointed to it on the map why there sergeant this guy has eyeballed dodge city believe you me and maybe from as close as this bunker hes been here he knows where the best place to get quickly into this little dip here ishe pointedwhich gives you close to half mile of nearly unobserved terrain do you know that for a fact asked the leg colonel no sir i do not but before this problem came up its where i took my teams out ninety percent of the time unless we choppered somewhere hell know that too carry on sergeant from there the lieutenant and featherstone follow the route i have indicated he addressed the two of them directly its very important you stay there he cant get a good shot at you because he cant get close enough but hell know youre there hell start tracking you about five hundred yards out but youre still too far out to shoot he dont have a rifle that he can trust to make that far a shot plus he wants you out of sight of camp when he hits you so that hell have time to make his getout how do we know he just wont take them out then fade asked the air force major well sir again we dont but i been all over that ground i dont think he can get a shot when theyre in the gulch thats why they have to be right careful to stay there to move slowly now about one thousand yards out you got a littlebitty bit of hill its hill fiftytwo meaning it aint but fiftytwo meters high its hardly a tit you wouldnt give it a squeeze on saturday night i would said captain feamster and everybody laughed i may go do it now in fact after they settled down bob continued sir when yall git behind that hill you go flat i mean you dig in you stay put hes going to watch you come hell be set up on the other side where you come out to high ground and make your decision which way youre going to turn the mission you stay put now it may take some time this birds patient but you disappearing suddenly hes going to get annoyed then irritated hell move maybe just a bit but when he moves we put the glass on him i quarter him and waste his ass sergeant swagger it was brophy sir do you want us to move out in support after you engage him no sir i dont want no other targets in the zone if i see movement i may have to shoot without id id hate it to be you or featherstone yall just go to earth once you get behind that hill then move back under cover of the choppers if we have to call in choppers sounds good this sucks featherstone whispered bitterly to donny im going to get smoked i know it it isnt fair i didnt sign up for this shit youll be okay donny said to the shaky man you just walk then dig in and wait for help swaggers got it figured featherstone shot him a look of pure hatred anyhow continued swagger at the front of the bunker i take him when he rises to move if i dont get a solid hit or if i get a miss thats when i signal fenn whos sitting on the prc youve checked out the radio of course said donny at that moment i signal fenns on the horn with you air force boys it was the air force majors turn weve laid on a c hercules callsigned nighthagthree holding in orbit about five klicks away just off than nuc we can have night hag there in less than thirty seconds the night hag brings major pee four sidemounted vulcan twentymm miniguns and four nato miniguns it can unload four thousand rounds in less than thirty seconds itll turn anything in a thousand square yards to tenderized hamburger thats better than napalm or hotel echo sir much better more accurate more responsive to ground direction plus these guys are really good theyve been on these suppression missions for years they can pinwheel over a zone just above stalling speed like a gull floating over the beach only theyre pumping out lead all the while they bring unbelievable smoke the snake eaters love them you know the napalm problem it can go any way and if the wind catches it and takes it in your direction you got a problem sounds good said bob sergeant swagger it was the cia man whod brought the solaratov documents yes sir mr nichols im just asking is there any conceivable way you could take this man alive hed be an incomparable intelligence asset sir i should say hell yes ill try my damndest and well share whatever we git with our friends whove cooperated with us but this bastards tricky and dangerous as hell if i get him in the scope i have to take him out if he gets away we go to gunships thats all i respect your honesty sergeant its your ass on the line but let me tell you one thing the sovs have a new sniper rifle called the dragunov or svd he might have one ive heard of it sir weve yet to shake it out even the israelis havent uncovered one be very nice if you brought that out alive ill give it my best sir good man donny was supposed to get a last few hours of sleep before he geared up but of course he couldnt so much ran through his mind and he lay in the bunker listening to music coming from the squad bays a few dozen meters away ccr was banging out something from last year on somebodys tape deck it sounded familiar donny listened long as i remember the rain been coming down clouds of mystery falling confusion on the ground good men through the ages trying to track the sun and i wonder still i wonder wholl stop the rain it had some kind of antiwar meaning he knew the rain was war or had become war some of these kids had known nothing but the war it had started when they were fourteen and now they were twenty and over here and it was still going on it was coming for them theyd get caught in the rain thats why the song was so popular to them kids had picked it up in dc last year and it was everywhere he knew commander bonson had heard it he thought of bonson now bonson came back to him navy guy starchy dutyhaunted rigid blackandwhite bonson in his khakis his beard dark his flesh taut and white his eyes glaring set in rectitude he remembered the look on bonsons face when he told him he wasnt going to testify against crowe man that may have been worth it that one moment let solaratov grease my ass it was worth it the way his jaw fell the way confusionno clouds of mystery confusion on the groundcame into his eyes he could not process it he could not accept that someone would turn his little plan over someone would actually tell him to go fuck off derail his little train donny had a nice dream of it all the moment of soaring triumph hed felt oh thats just the beginning he thought i will get back to the world and we will see what became of commander bonson what his crusade got him what goes round comes round you put shit out in this world somehow you get it back donny believed that now sleep was impossible he rose restless bathed in sweat he had another three hours to kill before they mounted out he rose left the bunker and wandered for a bit not sure where he was going but then realizing he did in fact have a destination he was in grunt city among the line marines the proles of hotel who really were firebase dodge city he saw a shadow you know where featherstone would be two hootches back oh you the hero yeah hes back there getting ready to get his ass wasted in the grass the anger donny felt surprised him what the hell was this all about why was everybody so pissed at him what had he done donny walked back dipped into the hootch four bunks the fraternity squalor of young men living together the stink of rotting burlap the shine of various playmates of the month pinned to whatever surface would absorb a tack and of course the smell sweet and dense of marijuana featherstone sat amid a dark circle of fellow martyrs all stoned he was so still and depressed he seemed almost dead but it was clear he wasnt the ringleader here another marine was doing all the talking a bitter rant about we dont mean shit its all a game fucking lifers just getting their tickets punched that sort of thing donny butted in hey featherstone you wanna go light on that stuff you may have to move fast tomorrow you dont want that shit still in your head featherstone didnt seem to hear him he didnt look up hes gonna be dead tomorrow what difference does it make the smart guy said who invited you here anyhow i just came by to check on featherstone said donny he ought to pull himself out of this funk or hes gonna get wasted and if you guys claim to be his buds you ought to help him hes gonna get zapped tomorrow no matter what we who are not about to die salute him nothings going to happen to him hes going to go for a walk then hide in the bush a plane will come and shoot the fuck out of a zone yards ahead of him hell probably get a bronze star out of it and go back to the world a hero nobody cares about heroes back in the world well he just has to keep his head thats do you even know what this is all about yes what is it i cant tell you classified no not the shit about the russian sniper thats just shit you know what this is really about what are you talking about its about the championship the what the championship said the man fixing donny in a bitter dark gaze of what of snipers what in a gunny named carl hitchcock went home with ninetythree kills the most so far now along comes this guy swagger hes in the fifties till that stunt you pulled off in the valley they gave him credit for thirtyodd kills i hear hes up to eightyseven in one whack now he gets six more he ties he gets seven more hes the champ it doesnt mean shit to me and it doesnt mean shit in the world but for these lifers let me tell you something like that gets you noticed and you end up the fucking command sergeant major of the whole united states marine corps so what if a couple of grunts get wasted to get you your last few kills who the fuck cares about that thats shit said donny he looked at his antagonists name saw that it was one mahoney and then recalled yes another college guy mahoney always riding the line dozens of article s angry and pissed off and just desperate to get out of there its not shit its how military cultures operate if you knew anything about it at all ive been with swagger in the bush for six months ive never ever seen him claim credit for a kill i record the kills in a book as per regs i have to do that its the rule the sniper employment officer writes up the kills i just write down what i see swaggers never asked me to claim kills for him he doesnt give a shit about that on top of that the number thirtyseven or whatever is completely made up he had eighty rounds he probably hit seventyfive of those if he missed at all the record doesnt mean a thing thats a load of crap he just likes the killing man he must like to squeeze that little trigger and watch some gook dot go still its as close to being god as you can get theres something so psychotic about it you donny hit him left side of the face hard it was stupid in seconds h was down pinned and somebody kicked him in the head and his eyes filled with stars he squirmed and yelped but more body blows came and he felt the pressure of many hands pressing him down and still more punches driving through at last someone pulled his antagonists off him of course it was the pacifist mahoney settle down settle down mahoney screamed man youll get lifers in here and we are cooked donnys head flared someone had really nailed him you assholes he said you fucking crybaby assholes youre going to get your buddy wasted for nothing except your own sense of victimization you have nothing to be sorry about you made it youre golden all right all right said mahoney holding the swelling that distended his face you hit me they hit you lets call it even no one on staff has to hear about this man my fucking head aches said donny climbing to his feet youre not going to tell on anyone are you fenn it was just tempers we all get fucked if you tell shit said donny my goddamn head hurts get him an aspirin you want a beer we have some vietnamese shit but i think theres a couple of buds left get him a bud good cold bud no im all right he looked at them saw only dark faces and glaring eyeballs look lets forget all about this shit but just get himfeatherstone who still sat zombie like on the cotstraight for tomorrow okay he cant be fucked up out there hell get killed yeah sure fenn no problem and let me tell you guys something okay you kicked the shit out of me now you listen some eyes greeted his angrily in the low light but most looked away it was hot and rank with sweat and the odor of beer and marijuana you guys may say swagger is a psycho and he likes to kill and all that shit fine but have you noticed how come we never get hit and our patrols dont get ambushed have you noticed we havent had a kia in months have you noticed our only wounded are booby traps and theyre almost never fatal and theres almost no ambushes hasnt been an ambush in months maybe years you know why that is is it because they love you is it because they know youre all peaceniks and dope smokers and you flash the peace sign and all you are saying is give peace a chance is that why no voices answered his his head really hurt he had been whacked good his vision was blurry as shit no it has nothing to do with you nobody gives a fuck about you no its because of him of swagger because the nva and victor charles they fear him they are scared shitless of him you say hes psycho but every time he drops one of them you benefit you live you survive youre living on the goddamn time he buys for you by putting his ass in the grass hes your guardian angel and hell always wear the curse of being the killer the man with the gun while you guys have the luxury of not getting your pretty little hands dirty hell always be on the outside because of his kills he takes the responsibility he lives with it and you guys you worthless assholes youll go back to the world on account of it and all you can do is call him psycho man have you ever heard of shame you all ought to be ashamed he turned and slipped out into the night the russian lay motionless in the high grass on a little crest maybe twelve hundred yards out from the firebase in the dark he could see nothing except the steady illumination of guard post flares one fired every three or four minutes and the occasional movement of the marines from hootch to hootch in the night as sentries changed there was no sense whatsoever of anything wrong he was still tired from the nearly five hours of crawling but felt himself beginning to rally as the energy flooded back into him he looked at his watch it was the dragunov was before him in the grass it was time deftly he rolled over a bit unstrapped the pack pulled it off his back and opened it he took out a large cylindrical object an optical device mounted to an electronics housing it was soviet issue ppv a nightvision telescope too clumsy to be mounted on a rifle but fine for stable observation he set it into the earth before him and his fingers found the switch as a rule he didnt trust these things too fragile too awkward too heavy worse one grew wedded to them until they destroyed initiative and talent worse still one lost ones night vision to them but this time the device was the perfect solution to the tactical problem he was concealed but at great range he had to know exactly when and if the sniper team left in the hour before dawn so that he could move to his shooting position and take them as they emerged from behind the hill if they didnt come hed simply spend the day there waiting patiently he had enough water and food in the pack to last nearly a week though of course each day hed be weaker but today it felt good through the green haze of the device which crudely amplified the ambient light of the night he saw the camp in surprising detail he saw the lit cigarettes of smoking sentries he saw them sneak out into the night for marijuana or to defecate in the latrine or to drink somethingbeer he guessed but he knew where to look at the sandbag berm nearest to the intelligence bunker there was a crease at the base of the hill that led this way directly hed even been able to spot the zigzag in the concertina there and the gap in the preset claymore mines and the prongs of the other antipersonal mines buried in the approach zone it was a path where men could move and get out of the camp this is where it would come if it would come at all the first signal was just a flick of bright light as the flap on a bunker was momentarily pushed aside letting the illumination inside escape to register on solaratovs lens solaratov took a deep breath and in another second another brief flash came as he watched two men heavily laden moved to the sandbag berm and paused he watched he waited if only he had a rifle capable of hitting at fifteen hundred yards he could do it and be done but no such weapon existed in his own or his host countrys inventory finally a man rose peered over the edge of the berm then pulled himself over it and fell the threeodd feet to the ground he snaked down the dirt slope to a gully at the base in time another marine duplicated the efforts though he was a larger more ponderous man he too fell to the ground but gracelessly then he rolled down the dirt embankment and joined his leader the two hesitated in their next move watching waiting the leader lifted his rifleyes it had a scopeand searched the horizon for sign of an ambush making none out he lowered the weapon and spoke to the assistant the assistant rose unsteadily from cover and began to move ever so slowly through the mines and the claymores finding gaps in the wire exactly where they should be and slipping through them his leader followed him and when both were free of the approach zone the leader stepped forward and moving at a slow steady hunched pace began to work his way down the draw solaratov watched them until they disappeared they come he thought he flicked off the scope and began to slither through the grass toward his shooting position around the suns began to rise there were two of them both orange both shimmery both peering over the edges of the earths just beyond the far trees donny blinked hard blinked again his head ached you okay swagger hissed lying next to him im fine he lied you keep blinking what the hell is going on im fine donny insisted but swagger looked back into that patch of yellow grass and undulating earth he had designated area of course donny wasnt fine he thought of a book he once read about bomber pilots in world war ii and a soldier who saw everything twice he was seeing everything twice but he didnt scream i see everything twice like that guy did he had a simple concussion that was all not enough to sickbay him or bellyache him out of any job in the corpsexcept of course this one the spotter was eyes that was all he was what the hell happened to you huh what the hell happened to you youre swole up like a grapefruit someone bang you i fell its nothing goddamn you fenn this is the one fucking day in your life when you cannot have goddamn fallen oh christ you got double vision you got pain you got dead spots in your vision i am fine i am roger to go bullshit goddammit swagger turned back furiously he lay in blazing concentration on the ridge his sniper rifle before him gazing through a pair of binoculars sweeping area donny blinked wished he had a goddamn aspirin and put his eye to the m spotting scope planted in the earth before him using one eye resolved the doubleimage problem but not the blur it didnt matter that he looked only with his best eye there was still only a smear of visual information like a television set without an aerial getting mostly fuzz the right thing to do say sarge i have blurred vision sorry im not worth shit out here lets call an abort before they get into range and shit said bob they are moving too fast they have panicked they gonna be here in ten seconds donny looked back and saw fouractually twocamo boonie hats just above the fold in the earth that took them out of sight something was wrong they were moving too fast almost running the pressure of living a few seconds in a snipers scope had gotten to them they were headed in a beeline like halfmilers for the hill and the comfort it supposedly provided hell know that aint me goddammit what do we do said donny sickly aware that the situation had passed beyond his meager ability to influence and full of images of that scared featherstone called to be a hero by nothing more than freak physical similarity running to stop the shit from dribbling out his ass and the poor lieutenant unable to yell stuck with him trailing behind knowing that if he let him get away solaratov would take him down in a second fuck said bob bitterly get back on the scope maybe hell bite anyhow nmmmm the sniper considered why are they moving so fast they have a long journey ahead of them and they know there is much less chance of being observed if they move slowly than if they run he watched them now about five hundred yards out rushing pellmell along the gully almost out of sight possibly they want to get into the shelter of the trees before full daylight no no not possible theyve never operated like that before therefore there are two possibilities a they know a man is out here and they are scared or b they are bait they are pretenders and the real sniper is already out here looking in my direction for some kind of movement at which point he sends a bullet crashing my way of the two possibilities he had no favorites his preference was not to over interpret data it was always to pick the worst possibility assume that it was correct and counter react therefore i am being hunted therefore where would a man be to get a good shot at me he turned and to the east about three hundred yards away made out a low undulation in the shine of the rising sun not much really but just enough elevation to give a shooter a peek into this sea of grass here in the defoliated zone he looked at the sun hed be behind the sun because hed not want its reflection on his lens therefore yes the ridge but if he turned in that direction and put his own glass upon it then hed clearly get the reflection and the bullet therefore he had to move to the north or south to get a deflection shot into them slowly he began to move no goddammit said bob no what no he aint biting not at them two birds shit he paused considering should we pull back dont you get it goddammit we aint hunting him no more hes hunting us the information settled on donny uncomfortably he began to feel the ooze and trickle of sweat down his sides from his pits he glanced about the world which had seemed so benign just a second ago now seemed to seethe with menace they were alone in a sea of grass the sniper if bob no longer believed him to be in area could therefore be anywhere closing in on them even now no not yet because if he read the fake sniper team moving too fast he would not have had enough time to react and get out of there he would still be an hour by low crawl away shit said bob which way would he go hmmmm bluffed donny with no real idea of an answer if he figures them guys is fake and he looks around about the only place we could be to shoot at his ass would be here on this little ridge yeah yeah so to git a shot at our asses hows he going to move he going to try and flank us to the left or the right what do you think donny had no idea but then he did if the treeline equals safety then hed go that way wouldnt he to his right hed put himself closer to it not closer to dodge city but maybe thats how hed figure wed think so hed figure it the other way shit said donny no said bob no youre right because hes on his belly remember this whole things gonna play out on bellies and what hes looking at is an hour of crawling in the hot sun versus two hours and being a half hour from the treeline is a hell of a lot better than being three hours from it hed have to go to the west right he sounded as if he had to convince himself it would take a lot of goddamn professional discipline he continued arguing with himself hed have to make up his mind and cut free of his commitment to the only targets hes got man hes got a set of nuts on him if he can make that decision he seemed to fight the obvious for a bit then he said okay area one aint it no more designate area two on your map being the coordinates of a five hundred by five hundred grid square one thousand yards left his left make it northnortheast give me them coordinates donny struggled to get the map out then struggled with the arithmetic he worked it out coming up with a new fire mission hoping the dancing numbers his eyes were conjuring up were correct scrawling them in the margins of the map he had the sinking sensation of failing a math test hed never studied for call it in call it in now so we dont have to fuck with it later yeah donny unleashed the aerial to vertical then took the handset from its cradle snapped on power checking quickly to see that the prc was still set on the right frequency foxtrotsandmansix this is sierrabravofour over sierrabravofour this is foxtrotsandmansix send your immediate over ah foxtrot were going to go from area one to new target designated area two over sierra what the hell say again over ah foxtrot i say again we think our bird has flown to another pea patch which we are designating area two over sierra you have new coordinates all after over correct foxtrot new coordinates bravonovembertwotwothreetwotwoseven at zeroonethreefivezulujulyeightfive break over wilco romeo i mark it and foxtrot read the numbers back to him roger foxtrot on our fire mission request out copy here and out sierra said the radio donny clicked it off good said bob whod been diddling with a compass i make a route about five hundred yards over there to a small bump thats where well go we should be on his flank then assuming he goes the way i figure hes going got you get your weapon donny grabbed his rifle which was not an m or even an m or a grease gun instead because of the short order in which the job was planned it was the only scoped rifle that could be gotten quickly an old fatbarreled m winchester target rifle with a rattly old unerti scope in left in the da nang armory since the midsixties lets go bob said chapter twentytwo only bright blue sky above and swaying stalks of the grass the russian crawled by dead reckoning trusting skills it had taken him years to develop he moved steadily the rifle pulling ever so gently on his back it was according to the cosmos watch on his wrist he wasnt thirsty he wasnt angry he wasnt scared the only thing in his mind was this thing right now here get to elevation five hundred yards to the right look to the left for targets that in turn will be looking for targets to their front two of them two men like himself men used to living on their bellies men who could crawl who could wait through shit and piss and thirst and hunger and cold and wet snipers kill the snipers he came after a time to a small knoll he had been counting as he moved two thousand strokes that is two thousand halfyard pulls across the grass his head hurt his hands hurt his belly hurt he didnt notice he didnt care two thousand strokes meant one thousand yards he was there he shimmied up the knoll really more of a knob not four feet high he set himself up very carefully flat on the crest well shielded in a tuft of grass he checked the sun saw that it was no longer directly in front of him and would not bounce off his lens he brought the dragunov up slipped it through the grass close to his shoulder and his hand a smooth seconds easy capture and grasp then he opened his binocular case and pulled out a pair of excellent west german xs he eased himself behind their eyepieces and began to examine a world twentyfive times as large as the one he left behind the day was bright and owing to the peculiarity of the vegetation in the defoliated zone and the oddities in the rise and fall of the land he saw nothing but an ocean of yellow elephant grass some high some low and threadbare marked here and there by a rill of earth he felt as if he were alone on a raft in the pacific endless undulation and ripple endless dapple of shadow endless subtle play of color endless endless he hunted methodically never leaping ahead never listening to hunches or obeying impulses his instinct and brain told him the marines would be five hundred yards ahead of him on an oblique they would seek elevation their rifle barrels would be hard and flat and perfect against the vertical organization of the world he found the low ridge where by all rights they should have been sited and began to explore it slowly the x lenses resolved the world beautifully he could see every twig every buried stone every stunted tree every stump that had survived the chemical agent all those years ago every small hill everything except marines he put the glasses down a little flicker of panic licked through him not there they are not there where are they then why arent they there he considered falling back trying another day it was becoming an uncontrollable situation no he told himself no just stay still stay patient they think you are over there and you are over here after a bit their curiosity will get the best of them they are americans hardy active people with active minds attracted to sensations actions that sort of thing they havent the longterm commitment to a cause he will move he thought he was looking for me i was not there he will move blackness somewhere in his peripheral a flash of black solaratov did not turn to stare no he kept his eyes where they were fighting the temptation to crank them around and refocus let his unconscious mind far more effective in these matters scan for them blackness again he had it to the right almost three hundred yards away of course hes flanking me to my right slowly he turned his head slowly he brought up the binoculars nothing movement nothing movement he struggled with the focus the unnatural blackness was a face the marine sniper had blackened it at night for his long crawl into position hed shed his black clothes and now wore combat dapple camouflage but he had made a mistake he had forgotten to take off his face paint now black against the dun and yellow of the elephant grass it stood out just the slightest bit solaratov watched fascinated the man lowcrawled two strokes then froze he waited a second or two then lowcrawled another two his face its features masked by the paint was a study in warriors concentration tense drawn almost cracked with intensity his rifle was on his back wearing a tangle of strips for its own camouflage he tried to deny it but solaratov felt a flare of pleasure as intense as anything in his life he laid the binoculars down and raised the rifle to his shoulder finding the right position rifle to bone to earth finding the grip finding the trigger finding the eyepiece swagger crawled through his scope the crosshairs quartered his head the russians thumb took the safety off and he expelled half a breath his finger began its slow squeeze of the trigger goddamn bob said what is it donny said behind him its thinned out here goddamn less cover donny could see nothing he was lost in elephant grass it was in his ears his nose in the folds of his flesh the ants were feasting on him he heard the dry buzz of flies drawn to the delicious odor of his sweat and blood hed been cut a hundred or so times by the blades of the grass ahead of him were the two soles of bobs jungle boots shit bob said i dont like this one goddamn bit we could just call in the night hag shed chew the shit out of all this wed pop smoke so she wouldnt whack us up and if he aint here he knows we got him and hes double careful or he dont come back at all and we never know why he came and we dont git us a dragunov nah he paused you still got that model seventy i do all right i want you to reorient yourself to the right you squirt on ahead see that little hummock or something yeah you set up on that you scope it out for me if you say its okay im going to shimmy on over there to where its thick again ill set up over there and cover for you fair enough fair enough said donny he squirmed around took a deep breath and wiggled ahead damn boy i hope he aint in earshot youre grunting louder than a goddamn pig this is hard work donny said and it was he got up to the hummock peered over it he saw nothing go to the m nah dont got time just check it with your unertl donny slipped his eye behind the scope which was a long thin piece of metal tubing suspended in an odd frame when you zeroed this old thing it had external controls which meant the whole scope moved propelled this way and that by screws for windage and elevation it had been assembled sometime back in the early forties but rumor said it had killed more than its share of japs north koreans and vc it wasnt even a mm nato but the old springfield cartridge the long the optics were great he scanned the grass as far as he could see and saw no sign of human presence but the blur had not gone away he was aware he was missing fine detail he squeezed the bridge of his nose with his fingers and nothing improved no nothing out there nothing that he could see it looks clear i didnt ask how it looked i asked how it was clear clear okay said bob you keep eyeballing the sergeant began to creep outward this time at an even slower rate than before he crawled slowly ever so slowly halting each two pulls forward going still donny returned to his scope back and forth he swept the likely shooting spots seeing nothing it was clear this was beginning to seem ridiculous maybe they were out here in the middle of nothing acting like complete idiots the bees buzzed the flies ate the dragonflies skittered he couldnt keep his eye behind the scope for very long because it fell completely out of focus he had to blink look away when would the call come from bob that he was all right the trigger rocked back stacked up and was on the very cusp of firing where is the other one his finger came off the trigger there were two he had to kill them both if he fired the other might take him or seeing his partner with his head blown open simply slide back farther into the grass and disappear hed call in air possibly and solaratov would have to get out of the area where was the other one he looked up from the scope he realized he could see the sniper because for some odd reason the grass was thinner there the other one would be nearby covering as he was vulnerable he would be vulnerable for only a few more seconds a plan formed in solaratovs mind find the spotter kill the spotter come back and kill the sniper it was possible because of the semiautomatic nature of the weapon and the fact that the distance was under three hundred meters he returned to the scope and very carefully began to crank backward looking for another black face against the dun and the tan of the vertical thickets of stalks he came back a bit more no nothing nothing and there an arm the arm led to a body which led to the form of another prone man hunched over a riflehe took a gasp of air a little spurt of pleasureand then continued up the trunk to the torso to discover that it was indeed a man but he was not a spotter he was another sniper and his rifle was pointing exactly at him at solaratov the man fired donny looked up from his scope his head ached when would the call come from bob god he needed an aspirin he glanced about seeing nothing only the endless grass a dragonfly flashed close by it was odd how their wings somehow caught the sunlight and threw a reflection just likedonny went back to the scope he was so close the sniper was less than three hundred yards awayor rather the snipers for there was a smear of enemy blurry in the haze of donnys concussion well sunk in the grass the man was bent into his rifle moving slowly tracking and with a start donny realized he had located swagger kill him he ordered himself shoot do it now the crosshairs seemed to quarter the head he squeezed the trigger he lost his sight picture as the pressure increased he squeezed harder nothing happened the safety the safety he reached for where it should have been that nub in front of the trigger but it wasnt there thats where it was on an m on an m it was up on the bolt housing he took his eye off the scope looked for the flange that was the safety and snapped it forward he ducked to the scope saw the man had turned and the rifles muzzle was coming right at him he jerked at the trigger and the rifle fired bob crawled forward only a few more yards and then he was into the higher grass andthe shot so unexpected sounded like a drumbeat against his own ears he frozelost it the great bob lee swaggerand had a moment of twisted panic what huh oh christ then he picked himself up ran like a son of a bitch for the higher grass waiting to get nailed and trying to sort it out hes there i saw him donny screamed and instantly from three hundred yards out an answering shot sounded it struck near donny blowing a big puff of dirt into the air donny fired back almost instantly and bob looked saw the puff of dust where his shot hit get down he screamed now terrified that donny would take a shot in the head he dove into the brush righted himself squirmed until he could see the dusty bank he threw the rifle to his shoulder put his eye to the glass and saw nothing hes there donny screamed again but bob could see nothing then a shot cracked out seeming to come from the left and he swung his rifle just a bit saw some dust in the air from the disturbance of muzzle blast and fired he cycled fired again fast as he was able to not seeing a target but hoping one was there get down he screamed again get down and call foxtrot for air he worked the bolt but could not see the sniper in the dust that floated in the grass in the area donny had identified where was he where was he donny edged back a bit and the second shot blasted the earth just a few inches from his face owl the dirt blossomed as if a cherry bomb had detonated and a hundred tiny flecks of grit bit him he blinked slid back even farther he could hear bob screaming but he couldnt make the words out he thought the radio call air get air but then bob fired fired again and it filled donny with courage he squirmed up over the other side of the hummock going to a lefthanded shooting position he couldnt throw the bolt from here not easily but a lot less of him stuck out and that pleased him where is he where are you motherfucker through the scope he saw nothing just dust hanging in the air the slow wobble of grass signifying recent commotion but nothing to shoot at all he scanned left and right a few yards didnt see a damned thing he had this idea that he not bob would be the one who brought the russian down images from a forgotten boyhood book played suddenly through his mind that would be like lieutenant may getting the red baron instead of salty old pro roy brown a gush of excitement came to him and a spurt of intense pleasure where was he we can take him under fire from two sources he realized we can take this motherfucker air he heard bob scream yes air get the night hag in here smoke this fucker blow him toon a wide scan he saw him much farther back crawling away desperately got you he put the crosshairs on the bobbing head not a shape so much as a suggestion in the blur of his vision he tried to find the center quartered it with the scope felt in supreme control felt the trigger rock against his finger stack up just a tiny bit and then surprise the hell out of him when the shot occurred the mans rifle leaped his hat popped off and he rolled over into the grass still got him he screamed hit him air bob screamed get us air donny let the rifle slide away drew the prc off his back and hit the on switch foxtrot this is sierrabravo flash i say again flash flash we have contact over sierrabravo what are your needs are you calling air sierrabravo suddenly bob was next to him snatching the handset from him foxtrot get us night hag super fast im designating area two for the strike bring in night hag i say again immediate area two area two she is coming in sierrabravo watch your butt over i got him donny said i am popping smoke to designate my position for night hag over said bob he grabbed a smoker off his belt yanked the pin and tossed it it spun and hissed and torrents of green smoke began to pour out of it sierrabravofour this is night hag i eyeball green smoke over a new voice on the net declared even as they heard the roar of engines rising that is correct night hag we are buttoning up out bob pulled donny down and close to the hummock a shadow passed over them and donny looked up and saw the great plane as it flashed overhead began to bank it seemed huge and predatory its engines beating at the air it was pitch black an angel of death and it banked to the right raising a wing presenting the side of its fuselage to the earth it was about to devastate the eight miniguns fired simultaneously tongues of gobbling flame streaking from the black flank the sound not of guns firing quickly but just a steady screaming roar jesus said donny he thought of worlds ending of the end of civilization of hiroshima this sucker brought heat he couldnt imagine it the thousands of rounds poured from the guns to the earth each fifth one a tracer and the guns fired so fast it seemed they fired nothing but tracers the bullets didnt strike the earth so much as disintegrate it they pulverized raising clouds of destruction and debris the air filled with darkness as if the weather itself had turned to gunfire it was a locust plague of lead that devoured that upon which it settled earlier versions of this baby had been called puff the magic dragon but they only had one gun with eight night hag could put a mythological hurt on the world she just ate up area for what seemed like years but was in reality just a few seconds she had only thirty seconds worth of shooting time she ate so fast the plane pivoted as if tethered the roar of its engines huge as it curled above them then again its eight guns fired and again the ground shook and a blizzard of debris flew from the earth then it straightened out climbed slightly and began to describe a holding pattern sierrabravofour thats my best trick over night hag should be sufficient good work foxtrot you there over sierra this is foxtrot foxtrot lets move the teams out i think we got him i think we nailed him sierrabravofour wilco and good job out huu co senior colonel and the sappers watched the airplane hunt the sniper from the relative safety of the treeline it was quite a spectacle the huge plane wheeling the thunderous streams of fire it brought to the defoliated zone the rending of the earth where the bullets struck oh the human noodle will be turned to the human sieve by that thing one of the men said only the americans would hunt a single man with an airplane said another they would send an airplane to fix a toilet someone else shouted to the laughter of some others but huu co understood that the sniper was dead that the outlaw swagger had once again prevailed no man could withstand the barrage and what came later when in the immediate aftermath of the airplane when its dust still hung in the air five jeeps suddenly burst from the fort and came crashing across the field stopping right where two american snipers suddenly emerged from hiding a little to the east of the devastated area the men began to work methodically with flamethrowers the squirts of flame spurted out and where they touched they lit the grass the flames rose and spread and burned furiously as black oily smoke rolled upward the human noodle has now been roasted someone said the flames burned for hours out of control rolling across the prairie of the defoliated zone blazing vividly as more and more men from the post came out in patrols set up a line and began to follow the flames soon enough a flight of helicopters flew in from the east and began to hover over the field they were hunting for a body they will probably eat him if they can find him there wont be enough left they could put him in soup though the russian was a chilly little number huu co still had a moments melancholy over his fate the airplane made war so totally it was the most feared weapon in the american arsenal of super weapons how horrible to be hunted by such a flying beast and to feel the world disintegrating around you as the shells exploded he shivered a bit the americans picked through the blasted field for some time until nearly nightfall at one time finding something that excited them very muchhuu co watched through his binoculars but could not make it outuntil finally retreating brother colonel shall we retreat his sergeant wished to know there is clearly nothing left for us here no said the colonel we wait i dont know for how long but we wait it was a lance corporal from first squad who found the dragunov whooie he shouted lookie here gook sniper rifle corporal bring that over here called brophy good work the man pleased to be singled out came over with his trophy and turned it over to brophy theres your rifle bob said to the cia man nichols the command team crowded around the new weapon something no one had seen before like a kid unwrapping a christmas present nichols wrapped the camouflage tape off the weapon the legendary svd thats the first one weve recovered said nichols congratulations swagger thats not a small thing donny just looked at it feeling nothing his head pounding from the stench of the gasoline and the oily smoke it was a crudelooking thing not at all sleek and well machined looks like an ak got stuck in a tractor pull bob said he handled the weapon looked it over worked the action a few times looked through the scope then became bored with it and passed it on to other more eager hands he moved away from the crowd and watched with narrowed eyes and utter stillness as the marines probed the burn zone while others set up flank security under the cos direction meanwhile hueys and cobra gunships hovered about the perimeter do you think he got away donny finally asked him dont know them flames could have burned him up six or seven twentymm shells could have blown him to pieces and the flames charred what meat was left off the bone he could be indistinguishable from the landscape i suppose i just dont know i didnt see any blood trails wouldnt the flames have burned the blood maybe i dont know im pretty sure i hit him i think you did too otherwise id be a dead monkey im going to put you in for another medal i didnt do anything you saved my bacon said bob he seemed somehow genuinely shaken as if hed somehow learned today that he could die donny had never seen him quite like this man i could use me a bottle of bourbon tonight the sergeant added i could use it real bad donny nodded he had invested totally in the idea that he had shot the white sniper he recreated it in his mind the crosshairs on the head the jerk of the trigger the squirm of the man as if hit the flying hat the leap and twist of his rifle then stillness it felt like a hit somehow everything about it felt good but the rifle hadnt been found in the rough area where memory told him the sniper had been when hed taken his shot and he had the terrifying feeling un confessed to anyone that maybe in the blur of his concussiongone nowhed zeroed incorrectly and killed a phantasm not the real thing he couldnt bring himself to express this but it filled him with the blackest dread i dont see how he could have gotten away donny said nothing could stand up to it andnobodys that lucky no way he could have stood up to it if he was in the middle of it he was wasted no doubt about it at all butwas he in the middle of it that was the question and donny had no answer he and he alone had seen the sniper but by the time the plane was done chewing the world up and he looked again that world had changed it was tattered eviscerated the grass was flattened dust hung in the air then the flamethrower teams worked it over and it burned and burned hard to figure now exactly where hed been what hed seen where it had been well well see said bob meanwhile you come by tonight and well have us a drink or two swagger was drunk he was so drunk the world made no sense at all to him and he liked it that way the bourbon was like a nurses hand on his shoulder in the middle of the night when he awoke screaming in the philippines after having gotten hit on his first tour really messed up through the upper lung the nurse had touched him and said there there there now the bourbon said there there there fucking good stuff bob said the fuckinga best it is said donny smoking a giant cigar hed gotten from somewhere there were some others too brophy and nichols of the cia captain feamster the always mild xo the company gunnyfirebase dodge citys inner circle as it was drunk as skunks in the intel bunker somewhere mick jagger was blaring out over an eighttrack the one about satisfaction well we got some satisfaction today goddamn said feamster an amiable professional who would never make bird colonel we did we did confirmed the xo who would make brigadier because he agreed with everything that was said by anybody above him in rank a couple of other sergeants made faces at the xos fawning but only swagger caught it goddamn right he said to make the officers go away and after a bit they did he took another taste prairie fire crackling the sense of merciful blur the world again full of possibility now it was nicholss turn to pay homage the cia officer wandered over shyly and said you know it was a great day we didnt get no head on the wall said bob oh the russians dead all right said nichols nobody could live through that no but what im talking about is the rifle the rifle thought donny oh yeah the rifle you know how long weve been looking for that rifle nichols turned and looked at donny who puffed on his cigar took another swallow of bourbon and answered with a goofy smile well said nichols weve been looking since when evgenie dragunov drew up the plans at the izhevsk machine factory some of our analysts said it would revolutionize their capacities but others said no it was nothing looks like a piece of russian crap to me said bob i dont think them guys know shit about building a precision rifle they aint got no townie whelans or no warren pages or no p ackleys they just got tractor drivers in monkey suits donny couldnt tell if swagger out of some obscure sense of need was putting on the earnest ambitious intelligence officer or not well whatever said nichols now we dont have to wonder now well be able to tell and do you know what that means no nothing here this shit is over and it never meant shit to the russians except as a way to bleed us dry they wouldnt even send dragunovs to the nam thats how low on the priority list it was the dragunov was a higher priority than vietnam to them this didnt play well with swagger and a darkness came over his face but the cia man didnt notice and kept on yapping no russias interested in europe thats where all the russian divisions are now with the dragunovs coming down to platoon level in the next few years and reaching the other warsaw bloc countries after that what does that mean for our tactics what level of precision fire can they bring against us if they move are they committing to sniper warfare in a big way thatll have a great deal to do with our dispositions our troop strength our alignments our relationships to our allies and the general thrust of nato policy over the next few years dammit you gave it to us no one could get one no one could buy one they were nowhere except under lock and key and old bob lee swagger goes out in the bad bush and brings one back alive goddamn it was a good day his eyes were bright and happy he wasnt even drunk right now its been shipped priority flash to aberdeen in maryland for thorough testing at the army weapons lab theyll wring it out like you wont believe theyll make that rifle sing a real feather in your cap said donny a victory for our side one

great slug of bourbon then a draught on the cigar expelling the smoke like vapors of chemwar here i got something i want to show you yeah yeah ive showed you the photo look at this he reached into his pocket and drew out a folded sheaf of heavy paper and delicately unfolded it it was that trig guy he was an artist he did it bob looked at it unsteadily in the flickering light it was a creamy piece of paper very carefully torn along one edge but it wasnt the paper that caught bobs eyes it was the drawing itself bob didnt know a goddamned thing about art but whoever this bird was he had something he really caught donny in a few lines it was as if he loved donny somehow you could feel the attraction the girl was next to him and the artists feelings toward her were more complex she was beautiful hopelessly beautiful a girl in a million he felt a little part of himself die knowing hed never have a woman like that it just wasnt in the cards hed be alone all his life and maybe he preferred it that way hell of a nice picture said bob handing it back it is he really got her i think he was in love with her too everybody who sees julie falls in love with her i am so lucky and you know what said swagger no uhuh she is a damned lucky woman too shes got you you are the best you are going to have a happy wonderful life back in the world bob lifted the bottle took two deep swallows and

said wahoo shrieked donny and went off to find the man the days passed the sappers relaxed and treated the mission as a leave a time for restoring hardpressed spirits catching up on correspondence with loved ones renewing acquaintanceship with political and patriotic principles that could be lost in the heat of combat they lounged in the tunnel complex on the edge of the defoliated zone two thousand yards from dodge city enjoying the amenities at night huu co sent them on probing patrols nothing aggressive just simply to make certain the americans at dodge city werent up to anything he directed no engagements not at this time so the tiny men in the duncolored uniforms with the patience of biblical scholars simply waited and watched waited for what senior colonel the human noodle is not coming back no man could survive that we had best return to base camp and a new mission the fatherland needs us my instructions huu co told his sergeant are from the highest elements of the government and they are to support and sustain our russian comrade in any way possible until i determine that mission is no longer viable we shall stay yes sir long live the fatherland long live the fatherland but privately he had grave doubts it was true no man could stand up to the intensity of the air attack with those fastfiring guns and no man particularly could stand up to the flames from the american flamethrowers a ghastly weapon that he believed they would never use against enemies of their own racial grouping and of course this another failure not his surely but failure has a way of spreading itself out and tainting all who are near it he had led the mission he had helped plan it he had organized it was his heart not pure enough was he still infected with the virus of western vanity was there some character defect that attended to him and him alone that caused him to continually misjudge to make the wrong decision at the wrong time he rededicated himself to the study of marxism and the principles of revolution he read maos book for the four hundredth time and laotzus for the thousandth he buried his grief and fear in study his eyes ate the hard little knots of words his mind grappled with their deeper meanings their sub texts their contexts their linkages to past and present he was a hard taskmaster to himself he gave himself no mercy and refused to take painkillers for his crippled hand and its caul of burn only his dreams betrayed him only in his dreams was he a traitor he dreamed of paris he dreamed of red wine the excitement of the worlds most beautiful city his own youth the hope and joy of a brilliant future he dreamed of crooked streets the smell of cheese and pastry the taste of gauloises and pommes frites he dreamed of the imperial grandeur of the place of its sense of empire the confidence with which its monuments blazed it was on one such night as he tossed on his pallet his semiconscious mind rife with bright images out of lautrec that the hands of a whore imploring him to her bed became the hands of his sergeant beckoning him from sleep he rose it was dark candles had burned low the man led him from his chamber down earthen tunnels to the mess hall there in the dark a squat figure sat hunched over a table eating with unbelievable gusto the sergeant lit a candle and the room flickered then filled with low light it was the white sniper chapter twentythree they lay in the high grass or in the hills under the scrubby trees and bamboo watching and tracking but never shooting a vc squad moved into the zone of fire four men with aks infiltrating farther south easy shots he could have taken two and driven the other two into the high grass and waited them out and taken them too but farther south was only arvn and bob figured it was a vietnamese problem and the arvns could handle it or they could handle the arvns depending another time a vc tax collector clearly blew his cover and was making his rounds it was an easy shot odd yards into a soft target but bob said no the war was over for them they lay concealed or they tracked looking for sign of big bodies of men of units moving into position for an assault on firebase dodge city whose immediate environs they patrolled there was nothing it was as if a kind of enchantment had fallen over this little chunk of i corps the peasants came out and resumed work in their paddies the farmers went back to furrowing the hills with their oxpulled plows the rainy season was over birds sang now and then a bright butterfly would skitter about above fewer contrails marred the high sky and if you flicked across the fm bandwidths on the prc you could tell that the war had wound way down nobody was shooting at anything two weeks into it orders came for bob assigning him tdy to army weapons lab aberdeen proving ground aberdeen maryland he was slated to leave the day after donnys deros feamster told him since he was so short and enemy activity so quiet and nothing coming down from battalion s he and donny didnt have to go out anymore but the two said theyd do it anyway looking for signs of an assault but not for kills feamster may have gotten it that was okay by him he said that word of turning dodge city over to arvn forces was imminentvietnamization they called itand the whole unit would be derosed back to the states before the summer came no matter where the guys were in their tours this is pretty cool said donny bob just grunted and spat solaratov slept for two days solid and then rose and came to see huu co the story of his escape went untold he made no report how he had survived where he had gone what he had suffered all of it went unrecorded and no one dared ask him a medic attended his burns which were severe but not debilitating and he never complained or winced he seemed disconnected from the agonies of his body he had one trophy it was his spetsnaz field cap a floppy beige thing that looked like a deflated beret or an american sailor hat that had been run over by a tank it had two holes in it on the left side of the crown an entrance wound and an exit wound how could his head have survived such a thing he had no comment but liked to wiggle his fingers through the two holes at the sappers who would dash away in confusion on the morning he came to huu co he said these people are very good good craft good tactics very wellthoughtout planning i was impressed how did you possibly survive not a remarkable story luck guile courage the usual anyhow i am not prepared to give up the mission what do you require of us i will never maneuver close enough i see that now plus of course i lost my weapon much to my embarrassment i hope it perished in the flames or was destroyed by cannon fire he frowned failure in his profession was not an acceptable outcome but no matter i have certain requirements for a new weapon i will be shooting at over a thousand yards i can do it no other way that is unless i want to die myself and i prefer not to our armorers are dedicated to their jobs but i doubt we have a weapon capable of such accuracy yes i know nor frankly do we but you must have some small cache of american weapons no your intelligence people would maintain an inventory its common for guerrillas to turn the enemys weapons against himself yes now i will give you a very specific type of american weapon it must be found and delivered here within two weeks it has to be this exact weapon with no other would i have a chance yes but that is not all you must also contact the soviet spetsnaz unit at the airfield they will be required to acquire certain components from outside asia these are very specific also no deviation can be allowed there is a place where such a list can be filled out in just a few seconds and they will have access to capabilities to do so yes comrade i you see its not merely the rifle the rifle is only part of the system its also the ammunition i have to construct ammunition capable of the task which i have in mind he handed over the list which was in english huu co did not recognize the rifle by type nor the list of ingredients which appeared to be of a chemical or scientific nature he did recognize one word but it had no meaning to him match king the sniper worked with care he studied the reconnaissance photos of the area discussed the topography once again with huu co trying to find the right combination of elements he worked very very carefully after devising theories he went to test them exploring the area at night and spending his days hidden in the grass trying to learn what there was to learn this time he never went near the base he was acclimatizing himself to the very long shots and hunting for a shooting position he finally found one on a nameless hill that by his judgment was close to fourteen hundred yards from the base but it offered the most generous angle into the encampment with the least drop the least exposure to wind pressure the most favorable light in the early morning when such a thing would take place and it was also sited immediately to the north of the original ambush site a gamble but a calculated one solaratov reasoned that on general principle alone the american sniper team would be reluctant to go out the same way as the one that had almost gotten them killed but they would consider going out the opposite side too obvious therefore on their missions they would either leave above to the north or below to the south he had a oneintwo chance of encountering them and in the days that he waited he saw them leave the post three times tiny dots so far away hardly human fourteen hundred yards it was a hellaciously long shot it was a shot nobody had any business trying to make beyond six hundred yards the margin of error shrinks to nothing the play of the elements increases exponentially you would need more power than the dragunovs x round you would need more power than any round available under normal circumstances in either the north vietnamese or the american inventory because war had become a thing of light fastfiring weapons that kill by firepower not accuracy he had contempt for such a philosophy it was the philosophy of the common un trainable man not of the elite professional who masters all the variables in his preparation and who has geniuslevel skill at his task war nowadays no longer demanded special men but ordinary menlots of them he lay on the hill trying to will himself into the mental state necessary he had to be calm his eyesight perfect his judgment secure he had to dope the wind the mirage the temperature the angle of travel of the targets his bullets trajectory the time in flight everything at this range it was not like rifle shooting it was like naval gunfire for the bullet would have to rise in high apogee and describe an arc across the sky and float downward with perfect perfect placement there were not but a dozen men in the world who could take such a shot with confidence he watched through binoculars the marines far off scuttled about behind their berm making ready to depart confident that for them the war was almost over and for two of them it was finally the rifle it came almost at the end of the twoweek period and not without difficulty it had been a trophy in the peoples museum of great struggle in downtown hanoi thousands of schoolchildren had looked upon it with great horror as part of their political education it demonstrated the evil will of the colonialists and the capitalists that they took such great pains to construct the devils own tool in this it was very useful indeed and it took russian intervention at the highest levels to have it withdrawn from the permanent exhibit a special sapper unit was ordered to transport it down the trail of ten thousand miles to huu cos little hidden post on the outskirts of the defoliated zone of firebase dodge city the russian broke it down for the first step to mastering a rifle is to master what makes it work he studied the system the cleverness of it the robustness of it the rise and fall of springs the thrusting of rods the gizmo of the trigger group it was ingenious over engineered in the american fashion but ingenious this one had been crudely accurized with flash hider a fiberglass bedding for the action in the stock a wad of leather around the comb to provide a nest for the cheek in relation to the scope which was a mere fourpower and solaratov saw the weakest element in the system attached to the rifle parallel to but not above the barrel creating problems in parallax that had to be mastered but his main focus of interest was that trigger group a mesh of springs and levers that could be pulled whole from the receiver group he broke it down to the tiniest component then carefully polished each engagement surface to give the piece a crisper letoff at this point the box of components came from the soviet intelligence service they were the easiest mission requirements to acquire a soviet asset had merely gone to a southern california gun store and purchased them for cash they had been shipped to the soviet union via diplomatic pouch and to north vietnam by the daily tu flight to look at them was to see nothing these were actually reloading tools which looked like steel chambers of mysterious purpose and green boxes of bullets cans of powder dupont imr tools for re sizing the case pressing in new primers reinserting the bullet he knew that no military round could deliver the accuracy he needed and that it would take great attention to detail and consistency he took the entire rig for a days march to the north and there out of the eyes of westerners and vietnamese alike except for a security team of sappers and the evercurious huu co he set up a fourteenhundredmeter range shooting at two close targets white silhouettes that were easy to see and would not be moving like they would on the day of his attempt the scope was small and had an ancient obsolete reticle a post like a knife point rising above a single horizontal line additionally it did not have enough elevation to enable him to hit out to fourteen hundred meters close to three times the rifles known efficiency though well within the cartridges lethal capability he handfiled shims from pieces of metal and inserted them within the scope rings to elevate the scope higher and tightened the assembly with aircraft glue so that it would hold to a thousandyard zero over the course of his testing he worked with infinite patience he seemed lost in a world no one could penetrate he seemed distracted to an absurd degree almost catatonic his nickname the human noodle took on added comic meaning as he entered a zone of total vagueness that was actually total concentration he seemed to see nothing gradually increment by increment he managed to walk his shots into the target once he was on the target he began hitting regularly primarily through mastery of trigger control and breathing and finding the same solid position off a sandbag the sandbag was the important feature it had to be just so dense packed so tight and it had to support the rifles forestock in just such a way infinitely patient microexperimentation was gradually revealing the precise harmony among rifle and load and position and his own concentration that would make his success at least possible finally he took to having the sappers present the targets from over a berm so that he could see them for just the second theyd be visible hed teach himself to shoot fast it went slowly and he burned out the sappers with his patience his insistence on recleaning the rifle painstakingly every sixteen rounds his demand that all his ejected cartridges be located and preserved in the order that they were fired all the time he kept a notebook of almost unreadable pedantry as he assembled his attempts for a sniper he is a very dreary fellow the sergeant said to huu co you want a romantic hero said huu co he is a bureaucrat of the rifle infinitely obsessed with microprocess its how his mind works only the russians could create such a man no i believe the americans could too finally the day came when the russian hit his two targets in the kill zone twice in the same five seconds then he did it another day and then another all at dawn after lying the night through on his stomach i am ready he announced chapter twentyfour the sandbags were the hardest he had grown almost superstitious about them he would let no one touch them for fear of somehow shifting the sand they concealed and altering irrevocably their inner dynamics the human noodle has gone insane someone said no brother his comrade responded he has always been insane we are only noticing it now the sandbags were packed with the care of rare crucial medicines and transported back to the tunnel complex in the treeline with the human noodle watching them with the concentration of a hawk he literally never let them out of his sight the rifle and its scope strapped inside a gun case and more or less suspended and shockproofed by foam rubber pellets taken from american installations bothered him much less than the sandbags that held true for his gradual setup as well he began with the sandbags examining them minutely for leaks for some alteration of their density finding none he convinced himself he was satisfied and made the sappers delicately transport them to the treeline there he had rigged a kind of harness a flat piece of wood to be tied to his back when he was prone upon which the sandbags themselves were to be tied i hope he isnt crushed said huu co genuinely alarmed he could suffocate said his sergeant ever so delicately weighted down under the nearly one hundred pounds of sandtwo fortypound bags and a tenpound bagthe russian began his long crawl to the shooting position which was a good two thousand yards from the tunnel complex far from the burned zone it took six hourssix backbreaking degrading hours of slow steady crawl through the grass suffering not merely from back pain but from the crushing fear of his utter helplessness a man under a hundred pounds of sand crawling into enemy territory what could be more ridiculous more pathetic more poignant any idiot with a rifle could have killed him he had no energy his senses were dulled by the pain in his back and the breathless smash of the huge bags on his back he crawled he crawled he crawled seemingly forever he made it somehow and crawled back just before the first light of dawn looking more dead than alive he slept all day and all the next day because his back still ached on the third day again he crawled this time with the rifle and a batch of his specially constructed cartridges it was much easier he made it to the small hill well before dawn and had plenty of time to set up he loaded the rifle tried to find some sense of relaxation tried to will himself into the sort of trance he knew he needed but he never could quite relax he felt tense twitchy twice noises startled him his imagination began to play tricks on him he saw the great black plane hovering overhead and felt the earth open up as it fired he remembered crawling desperately his mind livid with fear as the world literally exploded behind him you could not crawl through such madness there was no through he crawled and crawled the explosions ringing in his ears dumbstruck that he had chosen to crawl in the right direction and what was the right direction if hes out there hes dead now he heard one marine say to another nothing could come through that said the other they were so close they were ten feet away chatting like workers on a lunch break solaratov willed himself to nothingness like an animal he ceased to consciously exist he may not even have been breathing not as normal humans would define it anyhow his pulse nearly stopped his body temp dropped his eyes closed to slits he gave himself up to the earth totally and let himself sink into it and would not let his body move a millimeter over the long day marines walked all around him once so close he could see the jungle boots he smelled the acrid stench of the burning gasoline when they used the flamethrowers and he sensed first their joy when they recovered the rifle he had abandoned in panic and then their irritation when no body itself could be located the body was right there almost under their feet it still breathed movement the flash of movement recalled him from that day to this one through his binoculars he could see movement just behind the berm in the predawn light though it was so far away the rifle was set into the bags firmly moored sunk into sand so dense and unyielding it was almost concrete the heel of its butt wedged just as tightly into the smaller bag he squirmed behind it felt himself pouring himself around the rifle not moving it a hair so perfectly was it placed his eye went to the eyepiece again he saw movement a face peering out up down then up again then down his finger touched the trigger his heart hammered here after so long the long hunt was over no he watched them rise the shooter then the spotter rolling over the sandbag berm so far away gathering themselves in a gulch at its bottom and then heading out infinite regret poured through him you were afraid to shoot no he told himself you were not able today you were not in the zone you could not have made the shot it was true better to let them go and gamble that sometime soon hed have another opportunity than to rush and destroy all the work hed invested and all the hopes and responsibilities riding on his shoulders no you did the right thing not months anymore not even days donny was down to a day one more day and he would spend it processing out then a wakeup and the chopper would arrive at the day after tomorrow and at it would leave and he would be on it hed be back to da nang in an hour processed out by on the freedom bird by nightfall home eighteen hours later deros date of estimated return from overseas how many had dreamed of it had fantasized about it for his generation the generation of men sent to do a duty they didnt quite understand and that made them especially hated in their own country this was as good as it got there would be no parades no monuments no magazine covers no movies no one waiting to call them heroes you only got deros your little piece of heaven you earned it the hard way and it wasnt much but thats what you got what a feeling hed never felt anything quite like it before so powerful and consuming it went deep into his bones it touched his soul no joy was so pure the last time after getting hit thered been only the fear and the pain and the long months in a crappy hospital no deros this time within twentyfour hours deros hey fenn he looked up it was mahoney the ringleader in the antiswagger mutiny under whose auspices hed gotten kicked in the head by somebody oh yeah said donny rising from his cot hey look i wanted to come by and tell you i was sorry about that thing that happened youre an okay guy it turned out all right

everything was calm he was home free but what the fuck was swagger up to it ate at him what deal was this it bothered him he cant go out he promised shit he rose slipped out the hootch and walked across the compound to the dark bunker of the s shop where he found bob feamster and brophy bent over maps sir permission to enter he said entering fenn what the hell are you doing here you should be checking your gear to turn in to supply tomorrow said feamster is something going on with sierrabravofour sierrabravofour is going back to the world thats whats going on with sierrabravofour said bob

we go we go full field packs claymores cocked and locked i would hate to get caught short on the last day cocked and locked rock and roll the whole goddamn nine yards donny said when did you take over this outfit im only doing my job you are a stubborn crazy bastard and i hope that poor girl knows what a hardhead shes looped up with at odark donny rose and found bob already up he slipped into his camouflages for the last time pulled the pack on canteens ready claymores ready grenades ready he painted his face jungle green and brown last time he told himself in the mirror he smiled showing white teeth against the earthy colors he checked his weapons three mags m eight mags there was a ritual here a natural order checking one thing then the next then checking it all again it was all ready he crawled from his hootch went to the s bunker where bob similarly accoutred except that he had the remington rifle instead of an m waited sipping coffee talking quietly with brophy over the map you dont have to go fenn said bob looking over to him im going said donny check your weapons then do a commo check donny examined his m pulling the bolt to seat a round in the chamber then letting it fly forward he put the safety on then took out the ascertained that the mag was full but the chamber empty as swagger had instructed him to carry the piece he ran the quick commo check and all systems were functioning okay said bob last briefing up here toward hoi an we go a straight northward course through heavy bush across a paddy dike we should hit hill by hours well set up there glass the paddies below in the valley for a couple of hours and head back by hours well be in by at the latest well stay in prc range the whole time good work said brophy you all set fenn bob asked gung ho semper fi and all that good shit said donny at last strapping the radio on getting it set just right he picked up his m and left the bunker the light was beginning to seep over the horizon i dont want to go out the north said bob just in case i want to break our pattern we go out the east this time just like we did before we aint never repeated ourself anybody tracking us couldnt anticipate that hes gone hes dead you got him said brophy yeah well they reached the parapet wall a sentry came over from the guard post down the way all clear swagger asked sarge i been working the night vision scope the past few hours aint nothing out there bob slipped his head over the sandbags looked out into the defoliated zone which was lightening in the rising sun he couldnt see much the sun was directly in his eyes okay he said last daytime to hunt he set his rifle on the sandbag berm pulled himself over gathered the rifle and rolled off donny made ready to follow how many days now four five he didnt know the canteen had bled its last drop of water into his throat yesterday before noon he was so thirsty he thought hed die he hallucinated through the night he saw men he had killed he saw sydney where he won the gold he saw women he had fucked he saw his mother he saw africa he saw cuba he saw china he saw it all i am losing my mind he thought everything was etched in neon his nerves fired his stomach heaved he had starvation fantasies i should have brought more food something in his blood sugar made him twitch uncontrollably this would be the last day he could stand it no more the days were the worst there was no shield from the sun and it had burned his body red in slivers between the brim of his soft cap and his collar the backs of his hands were now so swollen he could hardly close them but the nights were no better it got cold at night and he shivered he was afraid to sleep because he might miss the americans on their way out so he stayed awake at night and slept during the day except that it was too hot to sleep well the insects devoured him hed never leave this cursed chunk of bare ground in the most forgotten land in the world he could smell his own physical squalor and knew he was living beyond the bounds of both civilization and sanitation he was putting himself through the absolute worst for this job why was he here then he remembered why he was here he looked at his watch if they were going on a mission today this was the time theyd go wearily he brought the binoculars to his eyes and peered ahead he had to struggle with the focus and he lacked the strength to hold it steady why didnt i take that shot whenmovement he blinked unbelieving feeling the sense of miracle a hunter feels when after the long stalk he at last sees his game there was motion down there though it was hard to make out in the low light it looked like the movement of men from the bunkers toward the berm but he could not be sure he abandoned the binoculars shifted left and squirmed behind the rifle trying his hardest not to jar its placement he poured himself around it half mounting the sandbag into which the toe of its butt was jammed his fingers finding the grip his face swimming up toward the spot weld feeling the jam of his thumb against his cheekbone he looked through it saw nothing but in a second his focus returned he could see motion behind the berm a small gathering of men it was an unbearably long shot he now saw a shot no man had the right to take the wind the temperature the humidity the distance the light it all said you cannot take this shot yet he felt a strange calm confidence now all his agonies vanished whatever it was inside him that made him the best was now fully engaged he felt strong purposeful the world ceased to exist it gradually bled away as he gave himself to the circle of light before him his position perfect the right leg cocked just to the right to put some tension in his body tightening his adductor magnus but not too much his hands strong and steady on the rifle the spot weld perfect no parallax in the scope the butt strong against his shoulder it was all so perfect he controlled his breath exhaling most of it holding just a trace of oxygen in his lungs reticle he thought his focus went to the ancient reticle to the dagger point that stood up just beyond the horizontal line that bisected the circle of light and watched now in amazement as like a phantasm springing from the very earth itself a man came over the berm dappled in camouflage face painted but even from this far far distance recognizable as a member of his own rare species he did not command himself to fire one cannot one trusts the brain which makes the computations one trusts the nerves which fire the processed information down their networks and circuits one trusts that little patch of fingertip that alone on the still body must be responsive the rifle fired time in flight one full second but the bullet would arrive far before the sound of it did the scope stirred the rifle cycled lazily called another cartridge into its chamber and settled back all before ever so lazily the green man went down he knew the second would come fast and that to hit him he had to do the nearly unthinkable fire before he saw him fire on the sure knowledge that his love would propel him after his partner just hit the knowledge that the bullet must be on its way before the man himself had even decided what he must do but solaratov knew his man he fired just a split second before the second man jumped into view arms extended in urgent despair and as the man climbed the bullet traveled its long parabola rode its arc rising and falling as the man himself was squirming desperately over the berm and when it fell it met him exactly as he landed on the ground and lurched toward his partner and it took him down part iii hunting idaho the sawtooth mountains earlier this year chapter twentyfive the black dogs were everywhere they yipped at him at night preventing him from sleeping they haunted his dreams with their infernal racket they made him wake early crabby bitter spent were they dreams from bad old times or were they just the generalized melancholy that attends a man who begins to understand he can never be what he was before he reached fifty that his body and eyesight and gift of feel and stamina were on the decline or were they from some deep well of grief once opened impossible to shut down bob didnt know what he knew was that he awoke as usual with a headache it was not yet dawn but his wife julie was already up in the barn saddling the horses she clung to her habits even during his dark times ride early work hard never complain what a woman how he loved her how he needed her how he mistreated her he felt hungover but it was a dream of postalcoholic pain he had not allowed liquor to touch his lips since he didnt need it hed lost close to a decade and a half to the booze hed lost a marriage a batch of friendships half his memories several jobs and opportunities hed lost it all to the booze no booze he could do it each day was the first day of the rest of his life lord i need a drink he thought today as he thought every day he wanted it so bad bourbon was his poison smooth and crackling all harsh smoke and glorious blur in the bourbon there was no pain no remorse no bad thoughts only more bourbon the hip hurt inexplicably after many years of near painlessness it had begun to ache all over again he had to see a doctor about it and stop gobbling ibuprofen but he could not somehow make himself do it it hurts his wife would say i can tell you dont complain but your face is white and you move slowly and you sigh too much i can tell you have to see somebody he answered her as he answered everybody these days a sour grimace a furious stubbornness then wintry retreat behind what she once called the wall of bobness that private place he went even in the most public of circumstances where nobody not even his wife and the mother of his only child was admitted he went and stood naked under a shower and let its heat pound at him but it did not purify him he emerged in as much pain as he had entered he opened the medicine cabinet poured out three or four ibus and downed them without water it was the hip its pain was dull like a deep bone bruise that throbbed and lighted the fire of other pains in his knees and his head and his arms hed been hit in so many places over the years his body was a lacework of scars that testified to close calls and not a little luck he pulled on ancient jeans and a plaid shirt and a pair of good old tony lamas his oldest friends he went down to the kitchen found the coffee hot and poured himself a cup the tv was on something happening in russia this new guy everybody was scared of an oldfashioned nationalist they said like the czars in the nineteenth century he believed in russia over everything and if he got control things would get wobbly since they still had so many rockets and atomic warheads and were only a few hours work from re targeting americas cities there was an election coming up in a couple of months it had everybody worried even the name was scary it was passion actually it was pashin evgeny pashin brother of a fallen hero it made bobs headache worse he thought russia had fallen wed stood up to them their economy had collapsed theyd had their vietnam in afghanistan and it had all fallen apart on them now they were back in some new form it didnt seem fair bob didnt like russians a russian had hit him in the hip all those years ago and started this run of bad luck that just recently he thought hed beaten down but then it had returned ugly and remorseless bob finished the coffee threw on a barn jacket and an old beatup stetson and went out of the bright warm kitchen into the predawn cold looking like an old cowboy whod been to his last roundup a grizzle of beard clung to his still sunken jaws and he felt woozy a beat behind his mind filled with cobwebs and other junk just enough of the mountains were visible in the rising light they stirred him still but only just they were so huge caped in snow remote unknowing vaster by far than the mountains he had grown up in back in arkansas they promised what he needed solitude beauty freedom a place for a man who went his own ways and only got himself into deep trouble when he got involved with other men he saw the barn heard the snuffle and rasp of horses and knew that julie and nikki were saddling up for their morning ride a family ritual he was late his horse junior would be saddled too so that he could join them at the last second it was not right to earn the right to ride a horse you should saddle it yourself but julie let him sleep for those rare moments when he seemed to do so calmly she just didnt know what nightmares lay inside his calm sleep he looked about for his other enemy the landscape high in the mountains but still a good mile from the snow was barren he saw only the meadows where some cattle drifted and fed miles of dense trees and the rugged crinkles of the passes as they led to openings in the peaks that were the sawtooths but no reporters no agents no tv cameras hollywood jockeys slick talkers with smooth hair and suits that fitted like cream on milk he hated them they were the worst they had exiled him from a life he had loved it began when bob at the insistence of a good young man who reminded him a bit of his wifes first husband donny fenn had urged him to return to arkansas to look into the matter of the death of earl swagger his father in things got complicated and hairy fast some people tried to stop him and he had to shoot back no indictments were ever handed down as no physical evidence could be located and nobody in polk county would talk to outsiders but some rag had gotten wind of it linked him to another set of events that took place a few years before that and taken a picture of him and his wife julie as theyd walked out of church back in arizona some months later he woke up the next wednesday to discover that he was americas deadliest man and that he had struck again wherever exmarine sniper bob lee swagger hangs his hat men die it pointed out relating his presence to a roadside shootout that left ten men all felons dead and the mysterious deaths of three men including an exarmy sniper in the remote forest and recalling that some years earlier he had briefly been a famous suspect in the shooting of a salvadorian archbishop in new orleans until the government dropped the charges for reasons that were to this day unclear why he had even married the widow of a vietnam buddy the paper reported time and newsweek picked it up and for a few weeks there bob had the worst kind of fame his country could offer he was hounded by reporters and cameras wherever he went it seemed many people thought he held the keys to a fortune that he knew things that he was glamorous sexy a naturalborn killer which by some odd current loose in america made him in the argot hot so here he was on a ranch that was owned by his wifes fathers estate as an investment property living essentially on charity without a penny to his name except for a piddling pension and no way of making one the future was unsettled and dark the peace and quiet and good living he had achieved seemed all gone where am i going to get the money my pension aint enough by a damn sight though it had never been expressed he had become convinced that his wife secretly wished hed do something with the one asset he owned his story which many people believed was worth millions he walked toward the barn watching the sun just begin to smear the sky over the mountains the black dogs came upon him and overpowered him halfway between the structures that was his name for them the sense that he was a worthless failure that everything he touched turned to shit that his presence hurt the two people he cared about the most that everything hed done had been a mistake every decision wrong and anybody whod gone along with him had ended up dead the dogs came fast and hard they got their teeth into him good and in seconds he was no longer in the barnyard under the mountains where a red sun was about to pull itself up and light the world with the hope of a new day but in some other dank foul place where his own failures seemed the most prominent land form and the only mercy was bourbon well mister nice of you to join us called julie he looked at his wife at her smile which continued to dazzle him if even now there seemed a layer of fear behind it he had seen her first on a cellophanewrapped photograph that a young man had carried in his boonie cap in vietnam and maybe he had fallen in love with her in that second or maybe he fell in love with her the second the young man died and she was the only part of him still alive still it took long years many of them soaked in bourbon before hed finally met her and by the odd twists that his life seemed always to take ended up being the lucky jerk she took as her second husband yet now was it falling apart on him daddy daddy yelled nikki eight running to meet him she grabbed his bluejeaned leg howdy honey hows my girl this morning oh daddy you know were going to ride up to widows pass and watch the sun come across the valley we do that every morning maybe we ought to find a new place honey said julie she loves that view im only saying bob said it might be nice to change forget it it dont mean a thing he had more edge in his voice than hed meant where had it come from julie shot him a hurt look at his harsh words and he thought well thats fine i deserve that and he had himself in control everything was fine he was fine it wasi do get tired of riding the same goddamn place every goddamn morning you know there are other places to ride all right bob she said i mean we can ride there no problem is that where you want to ride sweetie if thats where you want to ride thats fine i dont care daddy good thats where well ride who was talking he was talking why was he so mad where was this coming from what was going on but then he had himself back and he was fine again and it would beand why the hell is she riding english you want her to be some fancy person you want her to go to little shows where she wears some red jacket and helmet and jumps over fences and all the fags clap and the rich people come and drink champagne and she learns her old man who dont talk so good and swears a mite he aint up to them folks who ride english hes just an old farm boy from shitapple arkansas is that what you want he was yelling it had come on so fast so ugly it had just blown in a squall of killing anger why was he so mad these days it made him sick bob his wife julie said with slow fake sweetness i just want to widen her horizons open up some possibilities daddy i like english its more leg than stirrup it doesnt hurt the horse well i dont know nothing about english im just a cops kid from hick town arkansas and i didnt go to no college i went into the marine corps nobody ever gave me nothing when i see her riding like that he bellowed for a while as julie got smaller and smaller and nikki began to cry and his hip hurt and his head ached and finally junior spooked oh fuck it he said what the hell difference does it make and stormed back to the house hed left the tv on and sat before it nursing his fury angered by the terrible unfairness of it all why couldnt he support his family what could he have done different what could he do after a bit he turned and watched the two of them ride out through the fence and head up toward widows pass good that was fine they could do that he was better off alone he knew where he wanted to go he stood raging with fury and though it was early turned and walked to the cellar door went down into it hed meant to set up a shop here where he could reload for next hunting season and work out some ideas he had for wildcat cartridges new ways to get more pop out of some old standards but somehow hed never found the energy he didnt know how long theyd be here he didnt know ifhe went instead to the workbench where a previous occupant had left a set of old rusty tools and nails and such and reached around to grab what was stashed there it was a bottle a pint of jim beam subtly curved like a claymore with its black label and white printing the bottle had weight and solidarity to itit felt serious like a gun he hefted it went to the steps and sat down the cellar smelled of damp and rot for this was wet country snowy in the winter and ripe for floods in the spring hed been so long in dry country this all seemed new its smell was unpleasant mildew perpetual moisture he held the bottle in his hand examined it carefully shifting it ever so slightly sent the cargo inside sloshing this way and that like the sea at china beach where hed gone on rr one time or another but he couldnt say on which of his three tours his hand closed around the cap of the bottle its seal still pristine just the slightest twist of his hand could open it much less strength than that required to kill a man with a rifle which he had done so many times he looked carefully at the thing he waggled it just a bit feeling the slosh of the fluid its brown ness was clear and butterscotchy it beckoned him onward yes do it one sip just to take the edge off to make the bad pictures go away blunt the worries about money and prying reporters and tv cameras to retreat to some sacred private land of blur and wobble and laughter where only good times are remembered drink to the lost drink to the boys drink to the dead boys of vietnam drink to poor donny drink to what happened to donny and how donny haunted him how he had married donnys wife and fathered donnys child and done what could be done to resurrect donny to keep donny still on this earth yes drink to donny and all the boys killed before their time for veet nam to stop communism oh how the bottle called him fuck this he thought i have a wife and a daughter and they are out on the range without me and so i had best get to them that is one thing left i can do he put the bottle back and climbed the stairs his hip hurt but what the fuck he headed for the barn his horse and his wife and daughter chapter twentysix they rode up through the meadow found the track through the pines and followed that always trending upward the air was cool though not really cold and the suns presence in the east over the mountains gave the prospect of warmth julie nuzzled her coat closer tried to cleanse her thoughts of trouble and put her anger at her husband and what had happened to their life behind her her daughter the better rider galloped ahead merrily the ugliness of the scene in the barn seemingly forgotten nikki rode so well she had a gift for it a natural affinity for the horses and was never happier than when she was out in the barn with the animals tending them feeding them washing them but nikkis happiness was also somewhat illusory as they neared the treeline and the ride across the high desert toward widows pass and the trip to overlook the far valley she drifted back to her mother mommy she said is daddy sick yes he is said julie is he going to be all right your father is as strong as ten horses and he has faced and beaten many enemies in his long and hard life hell beat this one too what is it mommy nikki asked its a terrible disease called posttraumatic stress disorder it has to do with the war he was in he was in heavy fighting and many of his very close friends were killed he was strong enough to put that behind him and build us a very fine and happy life but sometimes there are things that just cant be kept away its like a little black dog has escaped from the secret part of his brain and come out it barks it bites it attacks his old wounds are hurting but also his memory keeps recalling things he thought it had forgotten he has trouble sleeping he is angry all the time and doesnt know why he loves you very very much though no matter what happens and how he acts he loves you very much i hope hes all right he will be he needs our help though and he needs the help of a doctor or something hell understand that eventually and get some help and then hell be better again but you know what a stubborn man he is the two rode on in silence i dont like it when he yells at you it scares me hes not really yelling at me honey hes yelling at the men who killed his friends and the men who sent him over there to fight that war and then walked away from it hes yelling for all the poor boys who got killed and never came back to the lives they deserved and were forgotten he loves you mommy i know he does honey but sometimes thats not enough hell be all right i believe he will be too he needs our help but he needs mostly to help himself get some medication find a way to take advantage of his very special skills and knowledge i can ride western i dont mind i know its not about that really its about how mad he is at things he cant stop we just have to love him and hope that he sees how important it is to get some help they were out of the trees the high chaparral was desolate rock strewn clustered with primitive forms of vegetation ahead in the shadow of the snowcaps the cut in the earth between mountains that was called widows pass beckoned and beyond it after a course on a shelf of dirty rock and broken slope a precipice from which could be seen as much beauty as has been put on earth julie loved it and so did nikki bob loved it too they rode here nearly every morning it got the day off to a fine start oh here we go baby be careful the track was tricky and julie was speaking more to herself than to her nimble daughter or to her daughters horse the better athlete of the two animals she felt the tension come into her this was delicate work and she wished her husband were here how had they ended up like this nikki laughed when the noise came it didnt shock or surprise the sniper he had waited in the dawn for targets before he knew it had to come sooner or later and it did it didnt fill him with doubt or regret or anything it simply meant time to work the noise was a peal of laughter girlish and bright it bounced off the stone walls of the canyon from the shadow of a draw onto this high plain from close to a thousand yards off whizzing through the thin air the sniper wiggled his fingers finding the warmth in them his concentration cranked up a notch or so he pulled the rifle to him in a fluid motion well practiced from hundreds of thousands of shots in practice or on missions its stock rose naturally to his cheek as he pulled it in and as one hand flew to the comb the other set up beneath the forearm taking the weight of his slightly lifted body building a bone bridge to the stone below he found the spot weld the one placement of cheek to stock where the scope relief would be perfect and the circle of the scope would throw up its image as brightly as a movie screen he cocked one knee halfway up toward his torso to build a muscular tension into his position as he had been trained to do the child the woman the man hey there she turned at the voice to see her husband riding toward her and her heart soared but then it subsided it was not bob lee swagger but the neighboring rancher an older widower named dade fellows another tan tall leathery coot on a chestnut roan he controlled exquisitely mr fellows hello mrs swagger howre you this morning well were just fine hello there honey hi dade said nikki dade was an occasional hangeron at the ranch welcome for his knowledge of the area his sure way with animals and guns yall havent seen a dogie or two up this way my fence is down and im a little short theyre so stupid they might have come this way no its been completely quiet were riding through the pass to see the sun come across the valley that is a sight isnt it would you care to join us well maam ive got a full day and id like to find my baby cows but hell why not i aint seen the sun rise in quite a while im up too early you work too hard mr fellows you should slow down if i slow down i might notice how old i got he laughed and what a shock that would be okay there nikki you lead the way ill follow your mother nimble nikki took her big chestnut along the climbing path and it rose between the narrow canyon walls until they seemed to swallow her then she sunk into shadow where the pass was really deep julie was close behind and as her eyes adjusted to the dark she saw her daughter break clear into the light at the end of the enfilade was a shelf of land that ran along the mountainside for half a mile gently trending upward and then it reached a vantage point on the far valley nikki laughed at the freedom she felt when she emerged and in a second had freed her horse to find its own pace it preferred speed and began to gallop a fear rose in julies heart she could never catch the girl nor stay up with her if she had to and she felt the urge to call out but suppressed it as pointless for there was no stopping nikki a naturalborn hero like her father the eightyearold galloped ahead the horses bounding grace eating up the distance to the vantage point julie then came into the light and saw that safely nikki had slowed to a walk as she neared the precipice she turned back and called come on mr fellows youll miss it im coming maam he yelled back at her she cantered ahead feeling the rise of the mountains on either side but also the freedom of the open space ahead of her its beauty lightened her burden and the mountains looked down solemn and dignified and implacable she approached nikki even as she heard fellows coming up behind her driving his horse a bit harder look mommy nikki cried holding her horse tight between her strong thighs leaning forward and pointing out here there was no downslope beyond the edge just sheer drop which afforded a vista of the valley beyond the ridge of mountains beyond that as the sun crested them the valley was green and undulating thatched with pines yet also open enough to show off sparkling in the new sun its creeks and streams across the way there was a falls a spume of white feathery water that cascaded down a far cliff under the cloudless sky and in the pale power of the not yet fully risen sun it had a kind of storybook quality to it that was even if youd seen it a hundredodd times breathtaking aint that something said fellows that is the true west the one they write about yes sir swagger had aged as all men do even as the sniper himself had aged but he was still lean and watchful and there was a rifle in the scabbard under his saddle he looked dangerous like a special man who would never panic who would react fast and shoot straight which is exactly what he was his eyes darted about under the hood of his cowboy hat he rode like a gifted athlete almost one with the animal controlling it unconsciously with his thighs while his eyes scanned for signs of aggression he would not see the sniper the sniper was too far out the hide too carefully camouflaged the spot chosen to put the sun in the victims eyes at this hour so that hed see only dazzle and blur if he looked the crosshairs rode up to swagger and stayed with the man as he galloped along finding the same rhythm in the cadences finding the same updown plunge of the animal the shooters finger caressed the trigger felt absorbed by its beckoning softness but he did not fire he knew the range perfectly meters moving target transversing laterally left to right but also moving up and down through a vertical plane by no means an impossible shot and many a man in his circumstances would have taken it but experience told the sniper to wait a better shot would lie ahead the best shot with a man like swagger thats the one you took swagger joined his wife and the two chatted and what swagger said made her smile white teeth flashed a little tiny human part in the sniper ached for the womans beauty and ease hed had prostitutes the world over some quite expensive and beautiful but this little moment of intimacy was something that had evaded him completely that was all right he had chosen to work in exile from humanity seven hundred thirtyone meters he cursed himself thats how shots were blown that little fragment of lost concentration which took you out of the operation he briefly snapped his eyes shut absorbed the darkness and cleared his mind then opened them again to what lay before him swagger and his wife had reached the edge meters before them would run a valley unfolding in the sunlight as the sun climbed even higher but what this meant to the sniper is that at last his quarry had ceased to move in the scope he saw a family portrait man woman and child all at nearly the same level because the childs horse was so big it put her up with her parents they chatted the girl laughed pointed at a bird or something seethed with motion the mother stared into the distance the father his eyes still seeming watchful relaxed just the tiniest bit the crosshairs bisected the square chest he stroked the trigger and the gun jarred and as it came back in a fraction of a second he saw the tall mans chest explode as the remington mm magnum tore through it it was a moment of serene perfection until she heard a sound that reminded her somehow of meat dropping on a linoleum floorit had a flat moist dense reverberation to it somehowand at that same instant felt herself sprayed with warm jelly she turned to see dades gray face his eyes lost and locked on nothingness as he fell backward off his horse his chest had been somehow eviscerated as with an ax its organs exposed and spewing blood in torrents his heart decompressing with a pulsing jet of deoxygenated almost black liquid spurting in an arc over the precipice he hit the ground in a cloud of dust landing with the solidity of a sack of potatoes falling off a truck as his horse panicked and bucked hooves flailing in the air as a nurse from too many nights in a reservation er julie was no stranger to blood or to what mysteries lay inside of bodies but the transformation was so instantaneous that it shocked her even as from far off the report of a rifle shot finally arrived the sound seemed to unlock her brain from the paralysis into which it had blundered she knew in the next nanosecond that they were under fire and in the nanosecond after that her daughter was in danger and she found the will to turn and yell run as loud as possible and yanked hard to the left on her reins driving her horse into nikkis to butt it about my daughter she thought dont kill my daughter but like hers nikkis reflexes were fast and sure and the girl had already reached the same conclusion reeled her horse to the left and in another second both horses were free of the ruckus caused by dades plunging animal go shrieked julie kicking and lashing her horse with the reins the animal churned ahead its long legs bounding over the dirt toward the narrow enfilade of the pass she was to the left of and a little behind nikki that is between nikki and the shooter which is where she wanted to be the horses thundered along careering madly for safety and julie was bent over the neck of hers like a jockey but she could not keep up with nikkis which a stronger animal with a much lighter load began to gun away and ahead exposing the child nikki she screamed then the world went it twisted into fragments the sky was somehow beneath her dust rose like a gas thick and blinding and she felt herself floating her heart gathering fear for the knowledge of what would come next the horse screamed piteously and she slammed into the ground her head filling with stars her will scattering in confusion but as she slid through the dust and the pain feeling her skin rip and something in her body shatter and the horse scampered away she looked to see that nikki had halted and was circling around toward her she rose astounded that she could move through all the fire that was eating her skin and had a moment when she noticed the blood pouring across her shirt she staggered went to one knee but then rose again and screamed at nikki no no run run waving her away desperately the girl pulled up confused the fear bright on her face run for daddy julie screamed then turned herself and began to scramble for a ravine to the right a copse of rough vegetation and tough little trees hoping that the shooter would follow her and not the girl nikki watched her mother run toward the edge of the shelf then turned herself lashed the horse felt it churn into a gallop the dust of the slashing hooves floated everywhere clotting her breathing and the tears on her face matted up with it but she stayed low and whipped the horse and whipped it again and though it neighed in pain whipped it still a third time gouging it with her english boots and in seconds the dark shadows of the enfilade covered her and she knew she was safe then she heard a shot chapter twentyseven he fired and the sight picture at the moment of ignitionthe stout heroic chest quadrisected perfectly by the crosshairs zeroed exactly for a range of seven hundred meterstold him instantly that he had hit as the scope came back he saw red from the falling body just a fraction of a seconds worth but square in the full chest until it was lost in the dust then he shifted to the woman buthe was astonished by the swiftness with which the woman responded his whole shooting scenario was based on her utter paralysis when her husbands chest exploded she would be stupefied and the next shot would be easy the woman reeled her horse about almost instantaneously and he was astounded at how much dust floated into the air you cannot anticipate everything and he had not anticipated the dust he had no shot for almost a second and then faster than he could have begun to imagine she and the child were racing hellbent and crazed toward the pass and safety he had a momentary flash of panicnever before had such a thing happenedand took his eye from the scope to get an unimpeded visual on the fleeing woman she was much farther away than he had figured the angle was oblique dust floated in the air impossible shot only seconds remained as she and the girl raced toward the pass he fought his terror and instead let the rifle sit and picked up his secret advantage in all this a set of leica binoculars with a laser range finder since unknown distance shooting is almost pointless and he put the glasses on her to see the readout as it shot back to him straight and true she was now meters now racing away his mind did the computations as he figured the lead all while setting the binocs down and reacquiring the rifle flipping through a bolt throw with the shell ejecting cleanly to the right a lifetimes experience and a gift for numbers told him he had to shoot a good nine meters ahead of herno no it would be nine if she were preceding at an exact ninety degrees but she was on the oblique more like fortyfive or fifty degrees so he compensated to seven meters a mildotthat is one of a series of dots etched into the crosshairsin the scope at this range was about thirty inches so when he went back to the rifle he led her six mils and a mil high that is putting her just inside the edge of the solid part of the horizontal cross hair impossible shot incredible shot close to eight hundred meters on a fastmover at the oblique away from him in heavy dust the rifle jolted in recoil and came back to reveal a ruckus of disturbance he could see nothing the horse was down then up bucking and kicking in fury dust floating in the air he cycled the bolt again where was she the child was forgotten but that was not important he searched the dust then put the rifle down and seized the binoculars which would give him a much bigger field of vision where was she had he hit her was she about was she dead was it over he waited for centuries and without oxygen but now there she was hithe could see the blood on her blue shirtand stiff with the pain of the fall but she had not gone into shock was not surrendering and like many who discover themselves in mortal circumstances for the first time giving up to lie and wait for the final blow heroically she moved away from the horse and the dust to the edge soft target giving herself up for the girl who didnt matter she was at the edge he put the binoculars squarely on her and had just a glimpse of her face only the fleetest impression of her beauty a melancholy closed upon him but his heart was strong and hard and he put it away he pressed a button to fire a spurt of smart laser at her and it bounced back and he looked to the readout and got a range of meters and knew hed have to hold dead center of the first low vertical mildot he set the binocs down went back to the rifle and saw her at the edge just standing there daring him to concentrate on her while the daughter vanished into the shadows of the pass the womans foolish courage sickened him her dead husbands insane courage sickened him who were these people what right did they have to such nobility of spirit why did they consider themselves so special what gave them the right he put the center of the first mildot below the horizontal cross hair on her the hatred flared as he pulled the trigger the rifle jolted time in flight was about a second maybe a little less as the grains of mm remington magnum arched across the canyon tracing an invisible parabola unstoppable and tragic he had the briefest second to study her composed calm on two feet defiant even at the end holding her wound then she disappeared as presumably the bullet struck her she tumbled down and down raising dust until she vanished from sight he felt nothing he was done it was over he sat back amazed to discover the inside of his jacket soaked with sweat he felt only emptiness just like the last time hed had this man in his scopeonly the professionals sense of another job being over he put the scope back on the man clearly he had been eliminated the gravity of the wound its immensity its savagery was apparent even from this distance but he paused so resilient so powerful such an antagonist why take the chance it felt unclean as if he were dishonoring someone who might be as great as himself but he again yielded to practicality this wasnt about honor among snipers but doing the job he threw the bolt ejecting a shell and put the crosshairs squarely on the underside of the chin exposed to him by the mans supine splayed position this would drive a bullet upward through the brain at eighteenhundred feet per second a fourinch target at meters another great shot he calmed himself watched the crosshairs still and felt the trigger break the scope leaped then leaped back the body jerked and again there seemed to be a cloud a vapor of pinkish mist hed seen it before the head shot evacuating brains in a fog of droplets the fog dissipated there was nothing more to see or think he rose threw the rifle over his shoulder he gathered the equipmentthe tenpound sandbag was the heaviestand re cased the binoculars he looked about for traces of himself and found plenty scuffs in the dust the three ejected shells which he scooped up he grabbed a piece of vegetation from the earth and used it to sweep the dust of his shooting position rubbing back and forth until he was convinced no sign of his having been there existed he threw the brush down into the canyon before him and then set out walking trying to stay on hard ground so as to leave no tracks he climbed higher into the mountains expertly and without fear he knew it would be hours at the least before any kind of police reaction to his operation could be commenced his problem now would be the remote possibility of running into random hunters or hikers and he had no wish to kill witnesses unless he had to which he would do without qualm he walked and climbed for several hours finally passing over the crests and descending to rough ground he hit his rendezvous spot by three and got out the small transmitter and sent his confirmation the helicopter arrived within an hour flying low from the west the evac was swift and professional he was done chapter twentyeight bob rode up through the trees and across the barren high desert to the mountains he loped easily along trying to calm himself wondering if he could make it before the sun rose fully the black dogs seemed to have gone back to their kennel they kept no schedule nothing set them off they were just there some days and not some others who knew who could tell who could predict he tried to think coherently about his future clearly he could not stay here much longer because the weight of living off his inlaws was more than he could bear it turned all things sour and made him hate himself but he doubted he could get started in his profession which was running a layup barn for horses not until he sold his spread in arizona and had the money to invest in an upgraded barn and other facilities plus it would mean getting to meet the local vets getting them to give him referrals maybe the place was already crowded with layup barns he could sell his story too bad old sam vincent wasnt around to advise him but sam had come to a sorry end in that arkansas matter which even now bob had his doubts about starting up it got a lot of people killed for not much but the settling of forgotten scores he had some shame left in him for that thing maybe scores werent worth it but if sam wasnt around who could he trust the answer was nobody he had an fbi agent friend in new orleans and a young writer still struggling with a book but not yet having had any success who could he approach the jackals of the press no thank you maam they turned him off beaucoup no the story thing wasnt any solution to his problems not without the advice of somebody he trusted that left shooting he knew his name was worth something in that worldsome fools considered him a hero even like his father a blasphemy he couldnt begin to even expressand the idea of making that pay somehow sickened him but if he could pick up work at a shooting school where they taught selfdefense skills to cops and military personnel maybe that could bring in some money and some contacts he thought he knew some people to call maybe that would work at least hed be among men whod been in the real world and knew what it meant to both put out and receive fire he tried to imagine such a life the sound was clear and distinct though far off no man knew it better than he rifle shot through the pass highvelocity round lots of echo a bigbore son of a bitch he tensed feeling the alarm blast through him and had a moment of panic as he worked out that it was possible the shot had come from exactly where julie and nikki ought to be in the next split second he realized he didnt have a rifle himself and he felt broken and useless then he heard a second shot he kicked junior and the horse bolted ahead he raced across the high desert toward the approaching mountains his mind filling with fear hunters who happened to get a good shot at a ram or an antelope in the vicinity of his women random shooters plinkers but not up this high maybe there was some trick of the atmosphere which made the sound of the shots travel from miles away up through the canyons and it only now reached him and was meaningless he didnt like the second shot a stupid hunter could shoot at something wrong but then he wouldnt shoot again if he shot again he was trying to kill what he was shooting at there was a third shot he kicked the horse bucking a little extra speed out of it then he heard the fourth shot christ now he was really panicked he reached the darkness of the pass but had a moments clarity and realized the last thing he should do would be to race out there in case someone was shooting as he slowed the animal down to a walk he saw nikkis horse its saddle empty come limping toward him a stab of pain and panic shot through his heart my baby what has happened to my baby oh christ what has happened to my baby a prayer not one of which had passed his lips in vietnam came to him and he said it briefly but passionately let my daughter be all right let my wife be all right daddy there she was huddled in the shadows crying he ran to her snatched her up feeling her warmth and the strength of her young body he kissed her feverishly oh god baby oh thank god youre all right oh sweetie what happened wheres mommy he knew his wildeyed fear and near loss of control were not helping the girl at all and she sobbed and shuddered oh baby he said oh my sweet sweet baby soothing her trying to get both himself and her calmed down back in some kind of operational zone honey honey you have to tell me wheres mommy what happened i dont know where mommy is she was behind me and then she wasnt what happened we were looking at the sunrise across the valley mr dade was there suddenly he blew up mommy screamed the horses bucked and we turned and rode for safety mommy wasoh daddy she was right behind me wheres mommy daddy oh daddy what happened to mommy okay sweetie you have to be brave now and get a hold of yourself we are going to have to ride out of here soon you have to settle down and be calm im going to go look for mommy no daddy no please dont go hell kill you too honey now you be calm i will take a looksee you stay here in the shadows when you feel up to it gather your horse and get juniors reins we will be riding like hell out of here very shortly all right his daughter nodded solemnly through her tears bob turned whipped off his hat and slithered along the wall of the pass toward the light as he neared it he slowed way down fast movement would attract the eye draw another shot if the bad boy was still scoping swagger thought he wouldnt be swagger thought hed hit his primary and his secondary and the girl couldnt figure in anything and so he was beating it to higher elevations or his pickup or whatever who knew that had to be figured out later the issue now was julie he edged ever so slowly toward the light at last setting himself so that he had a good vantage point some dust still hung in the air but the sun was bright now he could see poor dade about one hundredodd yards away right at the edge from dades broken posture alone it was clear the old man was finished but a monstrous head wound testified to no possibility of survival bad work expanding bullet presumably fired in through the eye or something a cranial vault explosion gobbets of brain and blood flung everywhere he looked about for a sign of his wife but there was none he saw her horse over in the shade calm now chewing on some vegetation he looked about for a hide in case she had gotten to one but there were no rocks or bushes thick enough to conceal or protect her that left the edge he tried to recall what lay beyond the edge and built an image of a rough slope littered with scrub vegetation and rocks down a few hundred feet to a dense mess of pines where the creek ran through was that right or was it some other place he thought to call but held back the sniper hadnt seen him yet there really wasnt a decision to be made he knew what had to be done he slipped back to where nikki who had now collected herself stood with the two horses do you have any sense of where the shots came from sweetie did you hear them at all i only remember the last one as i was riding and had reached the pass it came from behind okay he said if the shot came from behind that probably meant he was shooting from across the canyon on the ridgeline that ran anywhere from two hundred meters to one thousand meters away that jibed with the position of dades body too whatever it meant the shooter was cut off from where they were by the gap between the mountains and wouldnt be able to reach them from here on out unless he came after them but he wouldnt come after them hed fall back get to safe ground hit his escape route and be out of here all right he said we are getting the hell out of here and bee lining straight for home where well call the sheriff and get him and his boys in here she looked at him stricken but mommyshes out there i know she is honey but i cant get her now if i go out there he may shoot me and then what have we got he didnt think he would be he had worked it out to the next logical step whoever had done the shooting his target was not dade fellows but bob lee swagger someone had reconned him planned the shot knew his tendencies and lay in wait from a safe hide a long way off it was a sniper bob felt another professional she might be hurt she might need help bad listen to me honey when you are shot if its a bad hit you die right away like poor mr dade if it aint hit you seriously you can last for several hours i saw it in vietnam the body is very tough and itll fight on its own for a long time and you know how tough mommy is so theres no real advantage to going to mommy right now we cant risk that shes either already dead or shes going to pull through theres nothing in between ii want mommy said nikki mommys hurt i want mommy too said bob but sweetie please trust me on this one we cant help mommy by getting ourselves killed he may still be there ill stay said nikki youre such a brave girl but you cant stay we have to get out of here get the state cops and a medical team here fast do you understand baby girl thats whats best for mommy all right his daughter shook her head she was not convinced and nothing would ever convince her but bob knew in his marine heart that he had made the right decisionthe tough one but the right one chapter twentynine it had to happen sooner or later and he was glad it happened sooner it had to be gotten out of the way mr swagger said lieutenant benteen the chief investigator of the idaho state police would you mind stepping over here for a second sir bob knew what was coming as he stood on the escarpment two and a half hours had passed since the shooting his daughter was with a female state police detective and a nurse back at the house here an investigation team and coroners team worked the crime site while below a team of sheriffs deputies struggled through the trees and underbrush for a sign of julie swagger across the gorge detectives and deputies looked for evidence of the shooting site ferried there by a state police helicopter that idled on that side of the gap i figured you would be talking with me said bob you go ahead lets get it done with yes sir you know when a wife is killed its been my experience that ninetyeight percent of the time the husband is somehow involved if he didnt do the thing himself seen a lot of that sure it figures so i have to ask you to account for your whereabouts at the time of the shooting i was on the other side of the pass riding up to join my wife and daughter we usually go out for an early morning ride today we had words and i let the girls go alone then i got mad at myself for letting my damn ego seem so important so i went after them i heard four shots and rode like hell to find my baby girl in the shadows of the pass i looked out and saw poor dade i decided the best thing was to get nikki back to the house where i called you all and you know the rest did it occur to you to look for your wife it did but i had no medical supplies and i didnt know if the shooter was around so i thought it best to get the girl out of here and call in the sheriff and a medical team you are sir i believe a marksman of some note i am a shooter yes i was a marine sniper many years ago i won the big shoot they hold in the east back in the wimbledon cup they call it not for tennis for longrange shooting also i have been in some scrapes over the years but sir can i point a thing out go ahead mr swagger i think youll find them shots came from the other side of the gap thats what my daughter said and thats what the indication of dades body said now there aint no way i could have fired those shots from over there and gotten to my daughter over here in a very few seconds theres a huge dropoff then some rough country to negotiate i was with my daughter within thirty seconds of the last shot you can also see the tracks of my horse up here from the ranch house and no tracks that in any way connect me with what went on over there and finally you have surely figured out by now that poor dade is gone because whoever pulled the trigger thought he was hitting me duly noted mr swagger but i will have to look into this further to let you know i will be asking questions i have no choice you go ahead do i need a lawyer i will notify you if you are considered a suspect sir thats how we do it out here thank you but you were a shooter who used a rifle with a scope and if i dont miss my best guess this was a pretty piece of shooting with just such a rig possibly i dont know yet this couldnt be some sniper thing some other sniper maybe someone getting even with you for something in your past i dont know sir i have no idea at all the lieutenants radio crackled and he picked it up benteen here over lieutenant i think we found it got a couple of shells and some tracks a coffee thermos and some messedup ground you care to come and look ill hop right over walt thanks he turned to bob they think they found the shooting position care to look at it mr swagger maybe you can tell me a thing or two about this sort of work i would like to see it yes sir theres no word on my wife not yet theyll call as soon as they know then lets go of course the chopper was a huey it was always a huey and bob had the briefest of flashbacks as the odor of aviation fuel and grease floated to his nose the bird rose gracefully stirring up some dust and hopped the canyon to the ridgeline on the other side and set its cargo down bob and the lieutenant jumped out and the bird evacuated a hundred yards away and up a state policeman signaled and the two men followed a rough track up to the position there the younger cop stood over a little patch of bare ground something glittered and bob could see two brass shells in the dust there were some other marks and scuffs and a kmart thermos this appears to be the spot said the young officer maybe well get prints off the thermos benteen said bob bent and looked at the marks in the earth see that he said pointing to two circular indentations in the dust right at the edge of the patch those are marks of a harris bipod the rifle rested on a harris bipod yeah said the cop bob turned and looked back across the gulf to where dades body still rested under a coroners sheet he gauged the distance to be close to two hundred meters dead on maybe a little downward elevation but nothing challenging a hard shot mr swagger no i would say not he said any halfpracticed fool could make that shot prone off the bipod with a zeroed rifle so you would look at this and not necessarily conclude that its a professional snipers work no in the war we did most of our shooting at four hundred to eight hundred meters on moving targets this is much simpler the distance is close his angle to the target was dead on the target was still then he misses the other two shots he takes at my wife or at least he didnt hit her squarely then he comes back and hits the old man in the head as he lays dead in the dirt no as i look at this i cant say i see anything that speaks of a trained man to me it could have been some random psycho someone who had a rifle and the itch to see something die and suddenly he sees this chance and his darker self gets a hold of him its been known to happen yes it has still it would be a mighty big coincidence wouldnt it that such a monster just happens to nail your wife i mean given who and what you were as you say such things have been known to happen lets take a look at the shell cant pick it up till we photo it said the younger man hes right thats procedure okay you mind if i squat down and get a look at the head stamp go ahead bob bent down brought his eyes close to the shells rear end what is it asked benteen sevenmillimeter remington mag is that a good bullet yes sir it is very flat shooting very powerful they use them mainly in hunting over long distances rams lopes elk the like lot of em in these parts a hunters round then not a professional snipers round it is a hunters round ive heard the secret service snipers use it but nobody else he stood looked back across the gap bipod marks circular where the bipod sat in the dust supporting the rifle two mm remington mag shells range less than two hundred meters a good easy shot nearly anyone could have made it with a reasonable outfit now what was bothering him he didnt know but there was some oddness here too subtle for his conscious mind to track maybe his unconscious brain the smarter part of him would figure it out he shook his head to himself mainly what is wrong with this picture i wonder why theres only two shells said benteen if he fired four times that would be two missing only one said bob he may not have ejected the last shell as for the third shell maybe it caught on his clothes or something or he kicked it when he got up or it was right by him and he picked it up thats not surprising the shells are light they get moved about easily you can never find all your shells i wouldnt pay too much attention to that was that it good point said the elderly officer but then the radio crackled again old benteen picked it off his belt listened to the stew of syllables then turned to bob they found your wife chapter thirty she would live she lay encased in bandages the broken ribs five of them were difficult time alone would heal them the shattered collarbone where a bullet had driven through missing arteries and bloodbearing organs by bare millimeters would heal with more difficulty and orthopedic surgery lay ahead the abraded skin from her long roll down the mountainside the dislocated hip the contusions bruises muscle aches and pains all would heal eventually so now she lay heavily sedated and immobile in the intensive care unit of the boise general hospital linked to an ekg whose solid beeping testified to the sturdiness of her heart despite all the fractures and the pain her daughter sat on her bed flowers filled the room two boise cops guarded the door the doctors prognostication was optimistic and her husband was there for her what happened she finally said do you remember not much the police have talked to me poor mr fellows he was in the wrong place at the wrong time i am very sorry about that who did this the police seem to think it was some random psycho in the hills maybe a militia boy full of foolish ideas or someone who just couldnt handle the temptation of the rifle have they caught anybody no and there were no distinguishable prints on a cheap thermos they recovered they really dont have much a couple of shells some scuffs in the dust she looked off nikki was coloring steadily a big disney book the scent of flowers and disinfectant filled the room i hate seeing you here bob said you dont belong here but i am here she said ive asked sally memphis to come up and stay with you shes a couple of months pregnant but she was eager to help i called dade fellowss daughter and she said her father has a ranching property over in custer county remote and safe in a valley when you get better i want sally to move you up there i want you and nikki protected what are you talking about nikki honey why dont you go get a coke daddy i dont want a coke i just had a coke well sweetie why dont you get another coke or get daddy a coke all right nikki knew when she was being kicked out she got up reluctantly kissed her mother and left the room i havent told the cops he said because they wouldnt get it and they couldnt do anything about it but i dont think this is a wandering johnny with a rifle i think we got us a bigtime serious professional killer and i think im the boy hes after why on earth there could be many reasons as you know i have been in some scrapes i dont know which of em would produce this but what that means is until i get this figured out i believe you are in more danger around me than less and i need freedom i need to get about to look at things to get some items sorted out this guys got a game going on me but now i have the advantage because for a few days more he wont know he missed me i have to operate fast and learn what i can in the opening bob you should talk to the fbi if you dont think these idaho people are sophisticated enough i dont have anything theyd recognize yet i have to develop some evidence id just get myself locked in the loony bin oh lord she said this is going to be one of your things isnt it there was a long moment of quiet he let the anger in him rise then top off then fall then he began to hurt a little what do you mean things oh you have these crusades you go off and you get involved in some ruckus you dont talk about it but you come back spent and happy you get to be alive again and do what you do the best you get to be a sniper again the war never ended for you you never wanted it to end you loved it too deeply you loved it more than you ever loved any of us i see that now julie honey you dont know what youre saying youre on painkillers i want you to be comfortable im just going to look into some things for a while she shook her head sadly i cant have it now its come to my daughter the war it killed my first husband and now its come into my life and you want to go off and fight it all over again and my daughter who is eight had to see a man die do you have any idea how traumatizing that is no child should have to see that ever i agree but what we have is what we have and it has to be dealt with it cant be ignored it wont go away he could see that she was crying get some help she finally said call nick hes with the fbi call some marine general hell have connections call one of those writers whos always wanting to do a book with you get some help take some money from my familys account and hire some private guards dont be bob the nailer anymore be bob the husband and bob the father bob the man at home i cant stand that this is in our life again i thought it was over but its never over sweetie i didnt invent this its not something i thought up please youre upset you had a terrible experience youre in what we call posttraumatic stress syndrome where it keeps flashing before your eyes and youre angry all the time ive been there time is going to heal you up your mind as well as your body she said nothing she looked at bob but wasnt seeing him any longer but i have to deal with this okay just let me deal with this oh bob she started to cry again i cant lose you too i cant lose both you and donny to the same war i cant i cant bear it i just have to look into this ill be careful i know this stuff i can work a lot faster alone and youll be safer without me there at all okay she shook her head disconsolately you have to answer me a question or two please all right after a bit she nodded you went over this with the cops only they wont let me see the report but they dont have a clue hes already got them outfoxed now im assuming no two shots followed upon each other closely is that right she paused again thinking and then at last yielded yes there must have been at least two seconds between shots it felt like less than that but if he hits dade in the chest then he hits you in the collarbone and youre forty fifty yards away it took him some time to track and fire so it had to be at least two maybe three seconds you wont put nikki through this no nowhe hits you moving im guessing you were really galloping right yes thats a pretty good shot he sat back his respect slightly increased an oblique fastmover at two hundred yards why does he hit you in the collarbone and not in the full body its my right collarbone not my left one she said that means he was aiming at my back dead center what i remember is the horse seemed to stumble forward just a bit and the next second it was like somebody hit me in the shoulder with a baseball bat the second after that i was down there was dust everywhere nikki came back to me somehow i got up i was afraid hed shoot at her so i yelled at her then i ran away from her so that hed shoot me instead it still makes no sense if hes two hundred yards out then the time in flight is so minimal he hits the sight picture he sees and he dont shoot if he dont see the right sight picture youre sure the horse stumbled i felt it then whack and i was down there was dust everywhere the horse was crying okay next i heard four shots fired one into dade the knockdown shot the third shot then the fourth into dades head thank god i never saw that but there was a third shot i think so but i went off the edge you jumped off the edge you werent knocked down i jumped god great move right move great move smart move guts move guts move that gets you a medal in the marine corps it was all i could think to do so he did take a third shot he was shooting at you man i cannot figure why he is missing why is he missing you jump but at two hundred meters or less with a sevenmillimeter remington mag what he sees is what he gets he cant miss from that range maybe hes not so good maybe hes not maybe the cops are right its some psycho maybe it is but that would cheat you out of your crusade wouldnt it so it cant be a psycho its got to be a master sniper he let her hostility pass another thing i cant figure is how come hes shooting at you at all youd think once he did me its over thats it time to but then something came into his mind no no i see he has to hit you because he knows exactly how quickly you could get back to the ranch and a phone and thats cutting it too close nikkis not a problem shes probably not together enough to think of that but he has to do you to give himself the right amount of time to make his getaway hes figured out the angles i can see how his mind works very methodical very savvy maybe youre dreaming all this up maybe i am but you want the mantoman thing i can tell you against him just like vietnam just like all the other places god i hate that war it killed donny it stole your mind it was so evil but then nikki came back with a coke for her dad and a nurse came in with pills and their time alone was finished chapter thirtyone the wind howled it was cloudy today and maybe rain would fall bobs horse junior nickered nervously at the possibility stamped then put his head down to some mountain vegetation and began to chew bob stood at the shooters site it was a flat nest of dust across an arroyo not more than two hundred meters from where dade had been shot and maybe from where julie fell if he had had a range finder he would have known the range for sure but those thingslaserdriven these days much more compact than the barr and stroud hed once ownedcost a fortune and only wealthy hunters and elite swat or sniper teams had them it didnt matter the range was fairly easy to estimate from here because the body sizes were easy to read if you know the power of your scope as presumably this boy would you could pretty much gauge the distance from how much of the body you got into your lens that worked out to about three hundred yards and then it was a different matter altogether you entered a different universe when the distances were way out why did you miss her he wondered shes running away shes on the horse the angle is tough the only answer is youre a crappy shot youre a moron youre some asshole whos read too many books and dreamed of the kick you get looking through the scope when the gun fires and you see something go slack so you do the old man then you swing onto the racing woman her horse bounding up and down and its too much shot for you you misread the angle you misread the distance you just aint the boy for the job okay you fire you bring her down theres dust and then she emerges from the dust running toward the edge she wants you to shoot her so you concentrate on her not the girl youve really got plenty of time theres no rush theres no updown plunge as there would be on a horse its really a pretty elementary shot but you miss again this time totally no you aint the boy you think you are that added up that made sense some asshole who thought too much about guns and had no other life no family no sane connection to the world it was the sickening part of the second amendment computation but there you had it some people just could not say no to the godlike power of the gun but how come there aint no tracks apparent contradiction hes not good enough to make the shot but he is good enough to get out cold without any stupid mistakes like the print of his boot in the dust which would at least narrow it down a bit yet he leaves two shells and a thermos yet all three are clean of prints how could that be is he a professional or not or is he just a lucky amateur bob looked at the bipod marks still immaculate in the dust undisturbed by the process of making plaster casts of them they would last until the rain and then be gone forever they told him nothing bipod big deal you could buy the harris bipod in any gun store in america varmint shooters used them and so did police snipers some men used them when they took their rifles to the range for zeroing or load development but not usually because the bipod fit by an attachment to the screw hole in which the front swing swivel was set that meant the screw could work lose under a long bench session and that it could change the point of impact much more readily than a good sandbag some hunters used them but it was a rarity because you almost never got a prone position in the field so the extra weight was not worth it some men used them because they thought they looked cool would that be our guy he stared at imprints of the legs trying to divine a meaning from their two neat square images no meaning arrived nothing but contemplating the bipod got him going in another direction whats he see bob wondered whats he see from up here so he went to the prone and took up a position indexed to the marks in the dust from there he had a good straighton view of dades position yes and the shotwith the stable rifle the sun behind you the wind calm as it was at that point in the dayit was just a matter of concentrating on the crosshairs trusting the rig squeezing the trigger and presto instant kill you threw the bolt and no more than a few seconds later you had the woman he now saw how truly heroic julie had been ninehundredninetynine out of a thousand inexperienced people just freeze on the spot sniper cocks pivots a degree or so and he has a second kill but bless her brilliant soul she reacted on the dime when dade went down and off she went with nikki he had to track her bob had a thought here what happens if the point where she was hit wasnt within pivot range of this spot what happens if theres some impediment but there wasnt it was an easy crank an arc of about forty degrees nothing in the way you just track her lead her a bit and pull the trigger why did he miss bob thought he had it he probably didnt keep the rifle moving as he pulled the trigger thats why he hits her behind the line of her spine hes centered on her but he stops when he fires and the bullet arriving a tenth of a second later drills her trailing collarbone that made a sort of sense though usually when you were tracking a bird or a clay with a shotgun and you stopped the gun you missed the whole sucker not just hit behind on it maybe the birds moved faster on the other hand the range was a lot farther than any wing or clay shooting on the third hand the velocity of the rifle bullet was much faster there were so many goddamned variables he sat back used to be pretty goddamned good at this stuff he thought used to have a real talent for understanding the dynamics of a two or threesecond interval when the guns were in play none of this made any goddamned sense not really and he had no way of figuring it out and his head ached and it was about to rain and destroy the physical evidence forever and junior nickered again bored okay he thought rising troubled facing the fact that he had not really made any progress he turned to go back to the horse and his empty house and his unopened bottle of jim beam and then he saw the footprint yeah the cops missed a footprint thats likely he looked more closely and saw in a second that it was his own footprint a tony lama boot size the one he was wearing yes it was his goddamned own a little hard to id because hed turned and sort of stretched it out and that was it there it was he turned back quickly and stared at the bipod imprints if he has to pivot the bipod the bipod marks would be distorted theyd be rounded from the fast forceful pivot as he followed her and one would inscribe an arc through the dust but these bipod marks were squared off perfectly bob looked at them closely yes round perfect the mark of the bipod resting in the dust until the rain came and washed it away he saw it now this was a classic phony hide this hide was built to suggest the possibility that a screwball did the shooting but our boy didnt shoot from here he shot from somewhere else a lot farther out bob looked at the sky it looked like rain he rode the ridgeline for what seemed like hours the wind increasing the clouds screaming in from the west taking the mountains away it felt like fog damp to the skin up here the weather could change just like that it could kill you just like that but death wasnt on his mind rather his own depression was the chances of finding the real hide were remote if traces remained at all when the rain came they would be gone forever again he thought nicely thought out not only does the phony hide send the investigation off in the wrong direction it also prevents anyone from seeing the real hide until it is obliterated by the changing weather so if he does miss something the weather takes it out bob was beginning to feel the others mind extremely thorough a man who thinks of everything will have rehearsed it in his mind a hundred times has been through this time and time again he knows how to do it knows the arcane logic of the process it isnt just pure autistic shooting skill its also a sense of tactical craft a sense of the numbers that underlie everything and the confidence to crunch them fast under great pressure then rely on the crunching and make it happen in the real world also stamina courage the guts of a burglar the patience of a great hunter he knew we came this way but some mornings we did not he may have had to wait he was calm and confident and able to flatten his brain out and wait for the exact morning that was the hardest skill the skill that so few men really had but you have it dont you brother a sprinkle of rain fell against his face it would start pounding soon and the evidence would be gone forever why didnt i think this through yesterday id have had him or some part of him but now no it would be gone hes won again he searched for hides looking down from the trail into the rough rocks beneath every so often thered be a spot flat enough to conceal a prone man but upon investigation each spot was empty of sign and as he rode of course he got farther out and from not everywhere on the ridge was the shelf of land visible where both dade and julie could be hit in the same sweep so on he went feeling the dampness rise and his sense of futility rise with it he must have missed it he thought or its already gone damn he was a long way out he was a long way out he was getting beyond the probable into the realm of the merely possible yet still no sign and junior drifted along the ridge over the small trail tense at the coming rain bob himself chilled to the bone and close to giving up he couldnt be out this far he rode on even farther no sign yet he stopped turned back the target zone was miniature it was far distant it wasbob dismounted let junior cook in his own nervousness hed thought hed seen a little point under the edge of the ridge nothing much just a possibility he eased down peeking this way and that convinced that no he was too far out he had to go back and look for something he had missed but then he saw something just the slightest bit odd it was a tuft of dried brush caught halfway down the ridge wind damage but no other tufts lay about what had dislodged it probably some freak accident of nature but on the other hand a man wiping away marks of his presence in the dust he might just have used a piece of brush to do it then tossed the brush down into the gap but it caught and as it dried out over the two days it turned brown enough so a man looking for the tiniest of anomalies might notice it bob figured the wind always ran north to northwest through this little channel in the mountains if the wind carried it it would have come off the cliff just a bit farther back he turned and began to pick his way back in that direction and had already missed it when looking back to orient himself to the tuft of bush he noticed a crevice and peering into it he looked down to see just the tiniest coffinsized flatness in the earth where a man could lie unobserved and have a good view of the target zone he eased down oriented himself to where dade had died and julie fell he was careful not to disturb the earth in case any scuff marks remained but he could see none at last he turned to get his best and first look at the killing zone from the shooting site jesus christ he was eight hundred maybe a thousand meters out the killing zone was a tiny shelf far off at the oblique there were no features by which he could get an accurate distancebysize estimation and even on horseback the targets would have been tiny the scope wouldnt have blown them up too much either too big a scope would have amplified the wobble effect until a sight picture was simply unobtainable and worse it would have had too small a breadth of vision at this range if he lost contact with his targets he might never have gotten them back in time he had to be shooting a x nothing bigger than a x but probably a thats some shooting thats beyond good thats in some other sphere careful precise deliberate mathematical longrange shooting is very good shooting knowing instinctively how far to lead a moving target in the crux of the fraction of the second youve got knowing it automatically subconsciously that is great shooting man that is so far out there its almost beyond belief he knew of one man who could hit that shot but he was dead a bullet having exploded his head in the ouachitas there might be two or three others buthe now saw too why the shooter had missed the kill on julie he didnt make a mistake he had the shot perfectly he was just betrayed by the physics of the issue the bullets time in flight when he fired he had her dead to rights but it takes a second for the bullet to travel that long arc to float down on her and theres plenty of time even in that limited period for her to alter her body movement or direction enough to cause the miss thats why dade is at least an easier shot hes not moving to say nothing of at the oblique on horseback galloping away as julie was bob sat back his head ached he felt dizzy his heart beat wildly he thought of another man who might have done this hed buried the name and the memory so far it didnt usually intrude though sometimes in the night it would come from nowhere or even in the daylight it would flash back upon him that which he had tried to forget but he had to find out there had to be a sign somehow some way the shooter would have left something that only another shooter could read oh you bastard come on you bastard show me yourself let me see your face this once he forced himself to concentrate on the hard scrabble dirt before him he felt a raindrop cold and absolute against his face then another the wind rose howling junior made restive whinnied uncomfortably the rain was moments away he looked and he could see it a gray blur hurtling down from the mountains it would come and destroy the sniper had planned for it he was brilliant well schooled in stratagems but who was he bob leaned forward he saw only dust then no no yes yes he leaned forward even farther and up front where the dust had clearly been swept clean he saw very small particulate residue tiny beads of it tiny grains white sand white sand from a sandbag because a great shooter will go off the bag prone the rain began to slash he pulled his jacket tight if the sandbag was hereit had to be to index the rifle to the killing zonethen the legs were splayed this way he bent to where theyd have been hoping for the indent of a knee anything to leave a human mark of some sort but it was all scratched out and gone and now the rain would take it forever the rain was cold and bitter it was like the rain of kham due it would come and wipe anything away but then he went down farther and amid the small and meaningless dunes he at last found what he had yearned for it was about two inches of a sharp cut in the dust with notches for the thread holding sole to boot yes it was an imprint of the shooters boot the edge of the sole the tiny strands of thread the smoothness of the contour of the boot itself all perfectly preserved in the dust the shooter had splayed his foot sideways to give him just the hint of muscular tension that would tighten his muscles up through his body it was an adduct or muscle adductor magnus that was the core of the system as isolated by a coach whod gotten so far into it hed worked out the precise muscles involved that was russian a shooting position developed by the coach a lozgachev prior to the fiftytwo olympics where the eastern bloc shooters simply ran the field in sixty someone else had been coached by a lozgachev and his system of the magic adductor magnus to win the gold in prone rifle t solaratov the sniper chapter thirtytwo it was late at night outside the wind still howled and the rain still fell it was going to be a threeday blow the man was alone in a house that was not his own halfway up a mountain in a state he hardly knew at all his daughter was in town close to her injured mother in the care of a hired nurse until an fbi agents wife would arrive in the house there was no sound a fire burned in the fireplace but it was not crackly or inviting it was merely a fire and one that hadnt been tended in a while the man sat in the living room in somebody elses chair staring at something he had placed on the table before him everything in the room was somebody elses at fiftytwo he owned nothing really some property in arizona that was now fallow some property in arkansas that was all but abandoned he had a pension and his wifes family had some money but it wasnt much to show for fiftytwo years in fact what he had to show for those fiftytwo years was one thing and it was before him on the table it was a quart bottle of bourbon jim beam white label the very best he had not tasted whiskey in many years he knew that if he ever did it might kill him he could wash away on it so easily because in its stupefying numbness there was some kind of relief from the things that he could not make go away in any other way well sir he thought tonight we drink the whiskey he had bought it in in beaufort south carolina just outside parris island he had no idea why he was there it seemed some drunken journey back to his roots the basic training installation of the united states marine corps as if nothing existed before or after it was the end of an epic sevenweek drunk the second week of which his first wife had fled for good not many memories of the time or place could be recalled but he did remember staggering into a liquor store and putting down his ten spot getting the change and the bottle and going out in the heat to his car where what remained of his belongings were dumped he sat there in the parking lot hearing the cicadas sing and getting set to crack the seal and drown out his headache his shakes his flashbacks his anger in a smooth brown tide but that day for some reason he thought to himself maybe i could wait just a bit before i open it up just a bit see how far i can get he had gotten over twelve years out of it well yes sir tonight is the night i open it up bob cracked the seal on the bottle it fought him for just a second then yielded with a dry snap slid open with the feeling of cheap metal gliding on glass he unscrewed the cap put it on the table then poured a couple of fingers worth into a glass it settled brown and stable not creamy at all but thin like water he stared at it as if in staring at it he could recognize some meaning but he saw the futility and after a bit raised it to his lips the smell hit him first like the sound of a lost brother calling his name something he knew so well but had missed so long it was infinitely familiar and beckoning and it overpowered for that was the way of whiskey it took everything and made everything whiskey that was its brilliance and its damnation too the sip exploded on his tongue hot with smooth fire raspy with pouring smoke with the totality that made him wince his eyes burned his nose filled he blinked and felt it in his mouth sloshing around his teeth even at this last moment it was not too late but he swallowed it and it burned its way down like a swig of napalm unpleasant as it descended and then it hit and its first wave detonated and there was fire everywhere he remembered he forced himself to last mission donny was deros he should have been out processing no the little bastard he couldnt let anything alone he had to be so perfect he had to be the perfect marine he had to go along why did you let him did you hate him was there something in you that wanted to see him get hit was it julie was it that you hated him so fiercely because he was going back to julie and you knew youd never have her if he made it donny hadnt made it bob did have julie he was married to her though it took some doing so in a terrible sense he had gotten exactly what he desired he had benefited hadnt seemed so at the time but the one johnny who came out of the fracas with more than he went into it was he himself gysgt bob lee swagger usmc ret dont think he warned himself dont interpret list list it all dredge it up he had to concentrate only on the exactness of the event the hard questions the knowable the palpable the feel able what time was it odark may duty nco nudges me awake but i am already conscious and i have heard him come sarge yeah fine i rise before the sun i decide not to wake donny yet let him sleep hes deros tomorrow on his way back to the world i check my equipment the m is clean having been examined carefully the night before both by myself and the armorer eighty rounds of m mm nato match ammunition have been wiped and packed into pouches on an harness i slip into my shoulder holster for my over that i pull on my cammies i lace and tighten my boots i darken my face with the colors of the jungle i find my boonie cap i slip into the gear with the ammunition the canteens the all checked last night i take the rifle which hangs by its sling off the nail in the bunker wall slide five ms into it closing the bolt to drive the top one into the chamber i pull back to put on safe just behind the bolt handle im ready to go to the office its going to be a hot one the rainy season is finally over and the heat has come out of the east settling like a mean old lady on us poor grunts but its not hot yet i stop by the mess tent where somebodys already got coffee going and though i dont like the caffeine to jimmy my nerves its been so quiet of late i dont see any harm in having a cup a pfc pours it for me into a big khaki usmc mug and i feel the great smell then take a long hard hot pull on it damn that tastes good thats what a man needs in the morning sitting in his living room the fire burning away bob took another sip on the whiskey it too burned on the way down then seemed to whack him between the eyes knock him to blur and gone he felt the tears come may i head to the s bunker and duck in lieutenant brophy is already up hes a good man and knows just when to be present and when not to be hes here this morning freshly shaved in starched utilities there seems to be some sort of ceremonial thing going on morning sergeant morning sir overnight your orders came through on the promotion im here to tell you youre officially a gunnery sergeant in the united states marine corps congratulations swagger thank you sir youve done a hell of a job and i know youll be bangup beaucoup number one at aberdeen looking forward to it sir maybe the lieutenant feels the weight of history maybe he knows this is bob the nailers last goround three tours in the nam with an extension for the last one to give him nineteen straight months in country he wants to observe it properly and that satisfies me in some way brophy gets it and thats good we go over the job we work the maps its an easy one ill go straight out the north side over the berm and out to the treeline then we work our way north toward hoi an through heavy bush and across a paddy dike we go maybe four klicks to a hill that stands meters high and is therefore called hill well go up it set up observation and keep a good marine corps eyeball on ban son road and the thu bon river im done killing its straight scout work im here for firebase security nothing else along those lines we plan to look for sign of largebody troop movements to indicate enemy presence on the way out and the way back the lieutenant himself types up the operational order and enters it in the logbook i sign the order its official now i tell the clerk to go get fenn its were running a little late because ive let fenn sleep why did i do this well it seemed kind i didnt want to break his balls on the last day he really isnt needed until we leave the perimeter as the mission has been well discussed and briefed the night before he knows the specs better than i do he shows up ten minutes later the sleep still in his eyes but his face madeup green like mine someone gets him some coffee the lieutenant asks him how hes doing he says hes fine he just wants to get it over with and head back to the world you dont have to go fenn i say im going he says why why does he have to go what is driving him i never understood it then i dont understand it now there was no reason not one that ever made no sense to me it was the last the tiniest the least significant of all the things we did in the nam it was the one we could have skipped and oh what a different world wed live in now if we had bob threw down another choker of bourbon hot fire napalm splashes the whack between the eyes the brown glory of it check your weapons i tell fenn and then do commo donny makes certain the m is charged safety on he takes out his drops the mag sees that the chamber is empty thats the way ive told him to carry it then he checks out the prc which of course reads loud and clear since the receiving station is about four feet away but we do it by the numbers just like always you all set fenn i ask gung ho semper fi and all that good shit says donny at last strapping the radio on getting it set just right then picks up the weapon just as i pick mine up we leave the bunker the light is beginning to seep over the horizon its still cool and characteristically calm the air smells sweet but then i say i dont want to go out the north just in case i want to break our pattern we go out the east this time just like we did before we aint never repeated ourself anybody tracking us couldnt anticipate that why did i say that what feeling did i have i did have a feeling i know i had one why didnt i listen to it youve got to pay attention because those little things theyre some part of you you dont know nothing about trying to reach you with information but now there was no reaching back all these years he had made a snap decision because it felt so right and it was so wrong bob finished the glass with a last hot swig then quickly poured another one two fingers neat as on so many lost nights over so many lost years he held it before his eyes as the blur hit him and almost laughed he didnt feel so bad now it was easy you could just dig it out that simply and it was there before him as if recorded on videotape or as if after all these years the memory somehow wanted to come out at last hes gone hes dead you got him says brophy meaning the white sniper is gone theres nobody out there dont worry about it he should have been dead too we cooked his ass in mm and the night hag sprayed him with lead the flamethrower teams barbecued him to melted fat and bone ash who could live through that we recovered his rifle it was a great coup waiting to be studied back at aberdeen by none other than yours truly butwhy did we believe he was dead we didnt find no body we only found the rifle but how could he have survived all that fire and the followup with the flamethrowers and then the sweep with grunts no one could have survived that then again this was a terrifically efficient professional he didnt panic hed been under a lot of fire hed taken lots of people down he kept his cool he had great stamina yeah well i tell the lieutenant we reach the eastern parapet wall a sentry comes over from the guard post down the way all clear i ask sarge i been working the night vision scope the past few hours aint nothing out there but how would he know the night vision is only good for a few hundred yards the night vision tells you nothing it simply means theres nobody up close like a sapper platoon why didnt i realize that he took another dark long swallow it was as if something hit him upside the head with a twobyfour and his consciousness slipped a little he felt his bourbonpowered mellowness battling the melancholy of his memory as it presented itself to him after all these years i slip my head over the sandbags look out into the defoliated zone which is lightening in the rising sun i cant see much the sun is directly in my eyes i can only see flatness a slight undulation in the terrain low vegetation blackened stumps from the defoliant no details just a landscape of emptiness okay i say last day time to hunt i always say this why do i think its so cool its stupid really i set my rifle on the sandbag berm pull myself over gather the rifle and roll off i land and theres a moment there where everything is fine and then theres a moment when it isnt ive done this hundreds of times before over the past nineteen months and this feels just like all those times then time stops then it starts again and when i try to account for the missing second it seems a lot has happened ive been punched backwards come to rest against the berm itself for some reason my right leg is up around my ears i can make no sense of this until i look down and see my hip pulped smashed pulsing my own blood like a broken faucet somewhere in here i hear the crack of the rifle shot which arrives just a bit after im hit it makes no sense at all and i panic then i think mother fuck im going to die this fills even my hard heart with terror i dont want to die thats all im thinking i dont want to die theres blood everywhere and i put my fingers on my wound to stanch it but the blood squirts out between them its like trying to carry dry sand it slips away i can see bone shattered i feel the wet again an odd second where there is no pain and then the pain is so heavy i think ill die from it alone im thinking of nothing but myself now theres no one in the world but me a single word forms in my head and its morphine bob looked into the amber bourbon so still so calm the wind rushed outside cold and harsh he heard himself screaming im hit from across the years and saw himself hip smashed blood pouring out and he knew what happened next he took a swallow it landed hard he was quite drunk the world wobbled and twisted fell out of and back into focus a dozen times he was crying now he hadnt cried then but he was crying now no he screamed but it was too late for the boy had leaped over the berm too to cover his sergeant to inject morphine to drag the wounded man to cover donny lands and at that precise moment he is hit the bullet excites such vibration from him as it crashes through that the dust seems to snap off his chest theres no geyser no spurt nothing he just goes down dead weight his pupils slipping up into his head from far off comes the crack of that rifle is there something familiar in it why does it now seem so familiar the sound of it played in his ears crisp echoless far away but clear familiar why familiar rifles and loads all have their signature but this one what was it what about it what information did it convey what message did it carry donny i cry as if my cry can bring him back but hes so gone theres no reaching him he collapses into the dust a foot or so from me with the crash of the uncaring and how i do it i dont know but i somehow squirm to him and hold him close donny i scream shaking him as if to drive the bullet out but his eyes are glassy and unfocused and blood is coming out of his mouth and nose its also coming out of his chest pouring out no one ever gets how much blood there is theres lots of it and it comes out like water thin and sloppy and soaking his eyelids flutter but hes not seeing anything theres a little sound in his throat and somehow i have him in my arms and now im screaming corpsman corpsman i hear machine gun fire someone has jumped to the berm with an m and is throwing out suppressive fire arcs and arcs of tracers that skip out across the field lifting the dirt where they hit a mm recoilless rifle fires big booming flash that blows a mushroom cloud into the landscape to no particular point and more and more men come to the berm as if repulsing a humanwave attack meanwhile brophy has jumped and hes on both of us and there are three or four more grunts pressing against us firing out into the emptiness brophy hits me with morphine then hits me again donny i scream but as the morphine whacks me out i feel his fingers loosening from my wrist and i know that he is dead bob hit the bottle again this time dispensing with the glass the fluid coursed down his mind was now almost thoroughly wasted he couldnt remember donny anymore donny was gone donny was lost donny was history donny was a name on a long black wall were there even any photos of him he tried to recall donny but his mind wouldnt let him gray face unfocused eyes staring at eternity the sound of machine gun fire the taste of dust and sand blood everywhere brophy jacking the morphine in its warmth and spreading easing numbness i wont let go of donny i must hold him still theyre trying to pull me away over the berm the blackness of the morphine taking me out i sleep i sleep days pass im lost in morphine im finally awakened by a corpsman hes shaving me that is my pubic region huh i say so groggy i can hardly breathe i feel inflated creamy with grease bound by weight surgery gunny he says youre going to be operated on now where am i i ask the philippines onstock naval hospital orthopedic surgery ward theyll fix you up good you been out for a week am i going to die hell no youll be back in the major leagues next season he shaves me the light is gray i

command sergeant major of the marine corps i hurt so bad okay gunny im done let me give you some mike only a little though to make the pain go away he hits me with it i go under and the next time i awake im in full traction in san diego where ill spend a year alone which will be followed by a year in a body cast also alone but now the morphine hits and thank god once again i go under the light awakened him then noise the door cracked open and sally memphis walked in thought id find you here oh christ what time is it mister its eleventhirty in the morning and you ought to be with your wife and daughter not out here getting drunk bobs head ached and his mouth felt dry he could smell himself not pleasant he was still in yesterdays clothes and the room had the stench of unwashed man to it sally bustled around opening window shades outside the sun glared the threeday blow had lasted only one and then was gone idaho sky pure diamond blue blasted through the windows lit by sun bob blinked hoping the pain would go away but it wouldnt she was operated on at seven am for her collarbone you should have been there then you were supposed to pick me up at the airport at ninethirty remember sally who had just graduated from law school was the wife of one of bobs few friends a special agent in the fbi named nick memphis who now ran the bureaus new orleans office she was about thirtyfive and had acquired over the years a puritan aspect to her unforgiving and unshaded she was going to start as an assistant prosecutor in the new orleans district attorneys office that fall but shed come here out of her and her husbands love of bob i had a bad night ill say it aint what it appears he said feebly you fell off the wagon but good thats what it appears i had to do some work last night i needed the booze to get where i had to go you are a stubborn man bob swagger i pity your beautiful wife who has to live with your flintiness that woman is a saint you never are wrong are you i am wrong all the time as a matter of fact just dont happen to be wrong on this one here loo key here he picked up the uncapped bottle of jim beam three quarters gone and walked out on the front porch his hip ached a little sally followed he poured the stuff into the ground there he said no drunk could do that its gone its finished it wont never touch these lips again so why did you get so drunk do you know i called you you were hopeless on the phone nope sorry dont remember that why the booze i had to remember something that happened to me long ago i drunk for years to forget it then when i got sober finally i found i disremembered it so i had to hunt it out again so what did you learn on your magical mystery tour i didnt learn nothing yet but you will she said i know where to look for an answer he finally said and where would that be theres only one place she paused oh ill bet this one is rich she said it just gets better and better yep he said i dont never want to disappoint you sally this one is really rich where is it where a russian put it where he hid it twentyfive years ago but its there and by god ill dig it out what are you talking about its in my hip the bullet that crippled me its still there im going to have it cut out chapter thirtythree it was dark and the doctor was still working bob found him out back of the jennings place down the road from the holloways where hed had to help a cow through a difficult birth now he was with a horse called rufus whom the jennings girl amy loved although rufus was getting on in years but the doctor assured her that rufus was fine he would just be getting up slower these days he was an old man and should be treated with the respect of the elderly like that old man over there the doctor said pointing to bob mr swagger said amy id heard youd left these parts i did he said but i came back to see my good friend dr lopez amy honey ill send over a vitamin supplement i want you to add to rufuss oats every morning i bet thatll help him thank you dr lopez its all right honey you run up to the house now i think mr swagger wants a private chat bye mr swagger goodbye sweetie said bob as the girl skipped back to the house thought those reporters chased you out of this place for good the doctor said well i did too the bastards are still looking for me whered you go to cover a ranch up in idaho twentyfive miles out of boise just temporarily waiting for all this to blow over i knew you were something big in the war i never knew you were a hero my father was a hero i was just a sergeant i did a job thats all well you ran a great layup barn i wish youd come back into the area bob theres no firstclass outfit this side of tucson maybe i will but you didnt come all this way to talk about horses said dr lopez no doc i didnt in fact i flew down this afternoon took the twoten american from boise to tucson rented a car and here i am bob explained what he wanted the doctor was incredulous i cant just do that give me a reason i am plumb tired of setting off airport alarms i want to get on an airplane without a scene thats not good enough i have an oath as well as a complex set of legal regulations bob and let me point out one other thing you are not an animal well said bob actually i am i am a homo sapien but i know you are the best vet in these parts and you have operated on many animals and most of em are still with us today i remember you nursed billy hancocks paint through two knee operations and that old boys still roaming the range that was a good horse it was a pleasure to save that animal you never even charged him i charged him plenty i just never collected every few months billy sends me ten or fifteen dollars it should be paid up by the next century well i am a good horse too and i have this here problem and thats why i come to you if i go to va it could take months for the paperwork to clear if i go to a private md i got a passel of questions i have to answer and a big operating room to tie up and weeks to recover whether i need it or not i need this thing now tonight tonight i need you to go in on local dig it out and sew me up bob we are talking about serious invasive work it would take any normal man a month to recover under intensive medical care you wont be whole again for a long time doc i been hit before you know that i still come back fast its a matter of time i cant tell you why but im under the gun on time i have to find something out so i can go to the fbi i need a piece of evidence i need your help oh lord i know you did a tour over there its a thing guys like us have in common we ought to help each other when we can no one else will thats for sure said dr lopez you was a combat medic and you probably saw more gunshot wounds and worked on more than any ten mds you know what youre doing i saw enough of it over there its a nasty thing to fire a bullet into a man said bob i was never the same and now that i am getting old i feel my back firing up because of the damage it did to my structure and the va dont recognize pain they just tell you to live with it and cut your disability ten percent every year so on i go and on all of us go with junk in us or limbs missing or whatever that war was a very bad idea nothing good ever came out of it i copy you there i wouldnt be here if i didnt have no other choice i need that bullet you are a fool if you think what i can offer you is as safe as modern hospital medicine you dig the bullet out and put in the stitches if you dont do it ill have to do it myself and that wont be pretty i believe you would bob well they say you are one tough son of a bitch you better be because youre going to need every bit of tough to get through the next few days bob lay on his back looking at the large mirror above him the ugliness of the entrance wound was visible he hated to look at it the bullet had hit him almost dead on at a slight downward angle plowed through skin and the tissue of his sheathing gluteus medius muscle then shattered the plate like flange of the hip bone deflecting off to plunge down the inside of his leg ripping out muscle as it went the bullet hole was unfilled it was that alone and nothing else a channel a void an emptiness in his hip that plunged inward surrounded by an ugly pucker of ruined flesh no false hip said dr lopez feeling at it examining it carefully no sir said bob they patched it up with bone grafts from my other shin and screws on cold days them screws can light up let me tell you did it break a leg too no sir it just tore up tissue traveling down the leg the doctor probed bobs inner thigh where a long dead patch described the careening bullets terrible passage through flesh bob looked up away feeling the acute humiliation of it the doctors operating theater was immaculately clean though out of scale to human bodies as its most usual patients were horses with leg or eye problems except for the two of them it was deserted well youre lucky dr lopez said i was afraid it still might be hung up in the mechanics of the hip if that had happened you were out of luck i couldnt take it out without permanently crippling you i am lucky said bob yeah the doctor said i can feel it here nested in the thigh down close to the knee i know what happened they had to screw your hip together with transplants the deep muscular wound of the bullet didnt matter to them they didnt even bother to look for it they just sewed it up they were trying to keep you alive and ambulatory not make sure you could get through airport metal detectors you can get it bob this is going to hurt like hell i have to cut through an inch of muscle get down close to the femur i can feel it in there you will bleed like a dog on the roadway i will sew you up but you will need a good long rest this isnt a small thing it isnt a huge thing but you ought to spend at least a couple of weeks off your feet you cut it out tonight ill sleep here and be gone in the morning you give me a good pain shot and that will be that you are a hard case said the doctor my wife says the same your wife and i bet anyone that ever met you all right you sit back im going to wash you up then shave you then ill go scrub and well give you a painkiller and well do whats gotta be done bob watched with a numb leg and an odd feeling of dislocation the doctor had put an inflatable tourniquet around the upper leg to cut down on blood loss then hed wrapped his leg in a sterile ace bandage and now he cut through it a horizontal incision with a scalpel an inch deep and three inches long into the lower inside of his right thigh bob felt nothing the blood jetted out in a spurt as if an artery had been snipped but it hadnt and as the initial jet was soaked up by the bandage the new blood crept back to seep out of the ugly gash hed seen so much blood but the blood he remembered was donnys blood because the bullet had shattered his heart and lungs it had gotten into his throat fast and hed gagged it out there was so much it overcame his pipes and found new tunnels out of which to surge it came from his nose and mouth as if hed been punched in the face donnys face was ruined taken from them all by the blackred delta as it fanned from the center of his face down to his chin the doctor tweaked and squeezed the incision opening it as one would a coin purse then he took a long probe and inserted it into the wound and began to press and feel is it there i dont have ityeah yeah there it is i ticked against it it seems to be encapsulated in some scartype tissue id guess thats standard for an old bullet he removed the probe now sticky with blood gleaming in the bright light of the operating theater and set it down picking up a new scalpel he cut more deeply more blood flowed im going to have to irrigate he said through his mask i cant see much all that damn blood they will do that on you wont they said bob lopez merely grunted squirted a blast of water into the wound so that it bubbled it was so strange swagger could feel the water as pressure not unpleasant even a little ticklish he could feel the probe could almost feel as the pincers tugged at the bullet the sensations were precise the doctor tugging at the thing which was evidently quite disfigured and jammed into some tissue and wouldnt just pop out as a new bullet would bob felt all these details of the operation he saw the opening in his leg saw the blood saw the doctors gloved fingers begin to glow with blood and the blood begin to spot his surgeons gown and smock but he felt nothing it could have been happening to someone else it was unrelated to him at last with a tiny tug lopez pulled the bloody pincers out of the wound and held the trophy up for bob to see the bullet was crusted in gristle white and fatty and the doctor cut it free with his scalpel it had mangled when it had met his bone its me plat collapsing into its body so that it was deformed into a little flattened splat like a mushroom oddly askew atop the column of what remained but it hadnt broken into pieces it was all there an ugly little twist of gilding metal sheathing lead and its original aerodynamic sleekness its missile ness was still evident in the twisted version he could see striations running down it where the rifles grooves had gripped it as it spun through the barrel so long ago on its journey toward him can you weigh it yeah right ill weigh it and then ill wax it and then ill giftwrap it while you quietly bleed to death just hold your horses bob he dropped the bullet into a little porcelain tray where it tinkled like a penny thrown into a blind mans cup then went back to bob please weigh it said bob you ought to be committed the doctor said he irrigated the wound again poured in disinfectant and inserted a little sterile plastic tube for drainage then he quickly and expertly sewed it up with coarse surgical thread after finishing he restitched with a finer thread then he bandaged the wound wrapped an inflatable splint around it and blew hard until the splint held the leg stiff nearly immobile then he loosened the velcro on the tourniquet and tossed it aside pain nothing said bob youre lying i felt you begin to tense five minutes ago okay it hurts a bit yeah actually it now hurt like hell but he didnt want another shot or anything that would drug him flatten him keep him woozy he had other stuff to do okay said the doctor tomorrow ill rebandage it and remove the tube but itll relieve the pressure tonight now please i have to know weigh it i have to know dr lopez rolled his eyes took the porcelain cup to a table where a medical scale was sitting and fiddled and twisted all right said the doctor go on said bob its grains are you sure im very sure christ whats wrong this thing just got so twisted it dont make no sense at all he slept dreamlessly for the first time in weeks in one of doc lopezs spare bedrooms the pain woke him early and the unbearable stiffness in the leg the doctor redressed the wound then replaced the inflatable splint no major damage you ought to be able to get around a little bit he had some crutches lying around and advised bob to seek professional medical help as soon as possible bob could not walk or bathe but he insisted on going to the airport on the power of ibuprofen and will alone whitefaced and oily with sweat he was pushed to the tenfifteen plane in a wheelchair by a stewardess and used the crutches to get aboard he got to enter the plane early it was like being important no one was seated next to him as the flight was only half full the plane took off stabilized and eventually coffee was brought he took four more ibus washed them down with the coffee then at last took out his grisly little treasure in its plasticine envelope well now aint you a problem brother he thought examining the little chunk of metal mushroomed into the agony of impact frozen forever in the configuration of the explosion it had caused against his hip bone one hundred sixtyeight grains big problem the only grain bullet in the world in was americanthe sierra grain match king the supreme caliber target round then and pretty much now he was expecting a grain soviet bullet for the mm x as fired in either a dragunov or the old mosinnagant sniper rifle no this boy was working with an american hand load as the grainers werent used on manufactured bullets until the services adopted the m in the early nineties nor was it the grain match american bullet loaded equally into the m round or the ml nato round no american hand load tailored planned its last wrinkle worked out a serious professional shooter at the extended ranges of his craft that meant this was a total effort even to somehow obtaining american components in rsvn to get the absolute maximum out of the system why he tried to think it out t solaratov has lost his dragunov the fieldexpedient choice would then be an american sniper rifle presumably available in some degree within the nva supply system after all half their stuff was captured bob bet it was an md the sniper version of the old m garand rifle that the gis won world war ii with the more he thought about it the more sense it made up to a point yes that would explain the almost subconscious familiarity of the sound signature in his time hed fired thousands of rounds with an m it had been his first marine rifle a solid chunky robust brilliantly engineered piece of work that would never let you down this is my rifle this is my gun this is killing this is for fun every recruit had marched in his underwear around the squad bay some indeterminate number of hours a ton of unloaded ml on his shoulder parris islands sucking bogs out beyond the wire his dick in his left hand that primitive rhyme sounding in his ears under the guidance of a drill instructor who seemed like a god only crueler and tougher and smarter yeah he thought he uses a garand rifle with a scope he works out the load with the best possible components he takes me down hes the hero looking at the striations imprinted in the copper sheathing of the bullet by its explosive passage up the barrel that day he guessed closer examination by experts would prove them to be the mark of a rifling system that held to ten twists per inch not twelve for that would prove the bullet was fired from a match grade ml and not an m he saw the logic in that too it made sense to choose a over a because downrange the with its longer cartridge case and higher powder capacity would deliver more energy particularly beyond a thousand yards it really was a longrange cartridge as so many deer had found out over the years the was a mere wannabe but heres where he hit the wall if in fact he decided to go with the cartridge then why the hell wouldnt he have used a model a bolt gun that was the marine sniper rifle of the first five years of the war there had to be plenty of those still around hell even donny had come up with one of them in that one shot at solaratov theyd had why would the russian use the less accurate considerably more problematic semiauto instead of one of the most classic sniper rifles in the world carl hitchcock the great marine sniper of with his ninetytwo kills hed used a t with a sportsmans stock and an x unerti externally adjusted scope that would be the rifle to use what the hell was this russian bird up to could it be no model s available well he could check out combat losses through friends in the pentagon but it seemed impossible that the russian wouldnt be able to pick up a model he could probably have gotten one of bobs own model remingtons if hed wanted it what was there about the ml that made it mandatory for the russians selection it was indeed a very accurate rifle maybe hed wanted the semiauto capacity to bracket the target to put three or four shots into the area fast in hopes that one would hit nah not at that range each shot had to be precise the problem with the garand as a sniper rifle was it was at its best with national match iron sights it ruled in service rifle competition in which telescopic sights were not permissible but the weapon became difficult when a scope was added because its straightdown topside en bloc loading and straightup ejection made it impossible to mount the scope over the axis of the bore instead through a complicated system never really satisfactory the ml had worn a parallel scope one mounted a little to the left of the action that meant at a given range the scope was intersecting the target but it was not on the same axis as the bore which made rapid computation very difficult particularly when the target was not exactly zeroed or moved or some such yet he chose this rifle what the hell was going on bob mulled trying to make sense of it all he had the feeling of missing something there was a thing he could not see he could not even conceive of it what am i missing what in me prevents me from seeing it i cant even conceive it sir oh yes he said looking up at the flight attendant youll have to put up your lap tray and straighten your seat back were about to land at boise oh yeah sorry wasnt paying any attention she smiled professionally and he glimpsed out the windows to see the sawtooths the downhomey little boise skyline and the airfield named after a famous ace whod died young in war chapter thirtyfour bob drove to the hospital straight from the airport during a brief gap in the power of the ibuprofen his incision began to knit in truly exquisite pain he knew bruising would start by tomorrow and the thing would be agonizing for weeksbut he didnt want to stop he drove through the quiet bright streets of boise as unpretentious a town as existed anywhere and finally reached the hospital where the crutches got him in the ibuprofen got him beyond the agony again and an elevator got him to his wifes room outside of which his daughter and sally memphis waited oh hi daddy sweetie how are you he said gathering up his daughter and giving her a big hug oh its great to see my gal are you okay you doin what sally says im fine dad whats wrong with you sweetie nothing just a little cut on my leg thats all he said as sally shot him a disbelieving look he chatted with his daughter for a bit and with sally whose response to him was cool it seemed that julie was sleeping now but there hadnt been any real complications from the surgery they thought shed get out sometime soon and sally had made arrangements to go to the small ranch in custer county as bob had planned she agreed with him that it was a safe security arrangement at least until the situation clarified finally julie awakened and bob went in to his wife her torso was in a fullbody cast that supported the arm on the side where the collarbone had been shattered his poor girl she looked so wan and colorless and somehow shrunken in the cast oh sweetie he said rushing to her she smiled but not with a lot of force or enthusiasm and asked how he was and he didnt bother to answer her but instead went on about her caught up on her medical situation checked on the security arrangements finally told her he thought he was on to something i could tell youre all lit up its a long story theres something i cant figure out and i need help bob how can i help you i dont know anything ive told you everything i know no no i dont mean about it i mean about me now youve lost me honey i got this thing i have to figure out it doesnt make no sense to me so either its wrong or i am wrong if its wrong theres nothing i can do about it if its me thats wrong then i can figure it out oh lord i get shot and its all about you he let the cut simmer not responding finally he said im very sorry you got hit im very happy you survived you should concentrate on how lucky you were to make it through not how unlucky you were you handled yourself well you took control you were a hero you got your life you got your daughter you got your husband it aint no time to be angry she said nothing it aint about me its about us i have to figure this thing out cant you let the police the fbi do it theyre all over the place thats their job your job is to be here with your family i have a man hunting me the more around you i am the more danger youre in dont you see that so youll be off again i knew it you werent there when i got shot you werent there when i lay in that gulch for three hours you werent there when i was operated on you werent there when i came out of the operation you havent been taking care of your daughter youre evidently not going with us to the mountains i hear youve been drinking youve obviously been in some kind of fight or something because of the terrible way youre limping and the way your face is completely sheetwhite and all you want to do is go off again and somehow youre happy i wasnt in a fight i had a bullet cut out of my leg thats all its nothing im sorry he said this is the best way i think i dont know how much of this i can take i just want this to be over then stay here stay here with usi cant that puts you in danger hell know soon enough if not yet that i wasnt the man he hit so hell come back i have to be able to move to operate to think to defend myself not only that if he comes after me again and youre there again do you think i can defend you nobody can defend you let him come after me thats what he was trained to do maybe i can get him maybe not but i sure as shit aint going to let him go after you bob she said bob i called a lawyer what i said i called a lawyer what is that supposed to mean it means i think we ought to separate certain moments you just feel your chest turning to ice it just freezes solid on you you have trouble breathing you swallow theres no air then theres no saliva in your mouth your ears hammer your head aches blood rushes through your veins pumping crazily youre that close to losing it it had never happened to him when the shit was flying in the air and people were dying all around him but it happened now why he finally said bob we cant live like this its one thing to say we love each other we have a family we take care of each other its another when you go off every so often and i hear rumors that people are dead and you wont talk about it its another when youre so angry all the time you wont talk or touch me or support me and you snap at me all the time i can just make so many excuses to our daughter but then the next thing the worst thing the war comes into our house and im shot with a bullet and my daughter sees a man die before her very eyes and then you go off again i love you lord i love you but i cannot have my daughter going through that again imim very sorry julie i didnt see how hard this was on you its not just the violence its that you somehow love it so its that its always in you i can see it in your eyes the way youre always searching the terrain the way youre never quite relaxed the way theres always a loaded gun close at hand the way you drive me out youre not a sniper anymore that was years ago but youre still over there i cant compete with the war in vietnam you love her more than us bob breathed heavily please dont do this to me i cant lose you and nikki i dont have anything else youre all i value in this world not true you value yourself and what you became secretly youre so happy to be bob the nailer different from all men better than all men loved and respected or at least feared by all men its like a drug addiction i feel that in you and the angrier you get and the older you get the worse it becomes he could think of nothing to say please dont do this to me we should be apart please i cant lose you i cant lose my daughter ill do what you want ill go with you to the mountains i can change i can become the man you want you watch me i can do it please bob ive made up my mind ive been thinking about this for a long time you need space i need space the shooting business just makes it more important i have to get away from you and get my own life and get away from the war its not the war it is the war it cost me the boy i loved and now its cost me the man i loved it cannot take my daughter ive thought all this through im filing for separation after i recover im returning to pima county and my family we can work out financial details it doesnt have to he had or ugly you can always see nikki any time unless youre off at war or in the middle of a gunfight but i just cant have this im sorry it didnt work out any better but there you have it ill go just promise me youll think it over dont do anything stupid or sudden ill take care of this business dont you see i cant have you taking care of this business and getting yourself killed i cant lose someone else it almost killed me the first time you think you had it hard in your traction and your va hospital well i never came back there isnt a day i dont wake up and not remember what it felt like when the doorbell rang and it was donnys brother and he looked like hell and i knew what was happening it took me ten maybe twenty years to get over that and i only just barely did he felt utterly defeated he could think of nothing to say ill go now he said you need to rest ill say goodbye to nikki ill check on you stay in contact thats okay isnt it yes of course you be careful well be all right when this is all over youll see ill fix it i can do that i can fix myself change myself i know it bob i know i can he bent and kissed her bob what you wanted to ask me what was wrong with you why you couldnt figure something out yes ill tell you why its because of the great male failing of your age vanity youre publicly modest but privately insanely proud you think everything is about you and that blinds you to what is going on in the world thats your weakness you have to attack your problem without ego and vanity approach it objectively put yourself out of it t its the truth ive never told you that but its the truth your anger your violence your bravery its all part of the same thing your pride pride goeth before the fall you cannot survive unless you see through your pride all right all right he said and turned to leave here i am right back where i started from he thought the room was shabby a motel on the outskirts of boise not a chain but one of those older forties places on a road that had long since been surpassed by other brighter highways i am slipping he thought i am losing everything the room smelled of dust and mildew every surface was slightly warped wood the bathroom was only nominally clean the lightbulbs were lowwattage and pale i drank a lot of bourbon in rooms like this he thought he was here on more or less sound principles the first was that by this time whoever had been trying to kill him surely realized he had missed and was back on the hunt again therefore the ranch house with its clothes its life was out he knew that place and to go there was to get yourself killed this time for real with no poor old dade fellows to stop the bullet so after doubling back and crossing his own tracks a dozen times and setting up looksees for followers and finally satisfying himself nobody was onto him yet he was here paid cash too no more credit cards because whoever this bird was working for he might have a way of tracking credit cards no more phone calls except from public phones what he needed now was a gun and cash like any man on the run the cash he knew he could get he had left from a libel case the late sam vincent had won for him years ago and hed moved it from a cache in arkansas to a cache here in idaho if he was clear again tomorrow he would get it a gun was another problem he felt naked without one and the gun laws here in idaho werent troubling yet but there was still that goddamn sevenday wait by national law he could head back to his property where his commander was stored away but did he really want to carry it on a daily basis suppose he had to take an airline or wandered into a bank with a metal detector sometimes it was more trouble than it was worth besides how could he shoot it out against a sniper with a mm remington magnum with a if the white sniper found him it was over that was all bob sat back turning the tv on by remote discovering to his surprise that it worked the news came on bob paid no attention it was just white noise his head ached he held a bottle in his hands between his legs as he lay on the bed on a thin chintz bedspread jim beam at the boise likrmart recently purchased there were water spots on the ceiling the room stank of ancient woe of raped girlfriends and beaten wives and hustled salesmen cobwebs fogged the corners the toilet had a slightly unwholesome odor to it like heads hed pissed in the world over i am losing it he thought he tried to press his brain against the riddle again he felt if he could get that he would have something why all those years ago did soloratov use an ml rifle a much less accurate semiauto it appeared to be one of those mysteries that had no solution or even worse the answer was mundane stupid boring he couldnt get a bolt gun so he settled for the most accurate american rifle available an mid sniper yes that made perfect sense but but if he could get an mid he could get a model t or a remington it dont make no goddamn sense it doesnt have to make sense he told himself not everything does some things just cant be explained they happen in a certain way because thats the way of the world bob looked at the bottle again his fingers stole to the cap and the plastic seal that kept the amber fluid and its multiple mercies from his lips and yearned to crack it and drink but he didnt wont never touch my lips again he remembered telling someone liar lying bastard talking big not living up to it he tried to lose himself in what was on the tube the news some talking head from russia oh yeah it sounded familiar big elections coming up everybody all scared because some joker who represented the old ways was in the lead and would carry the day and the cold war would start up all over again the guy was this evgeny pashin handsome big guy powerful presence bob looked at him thought we won that war he said to himself thought that was one we did okay in and now heres this guy and hes going to take over and restore russia and all the missiles go back into the silos and its the same old crock of shit man there was no good news anywhere was there he was feeling powerfully maudlin he yearned for his old life his wife his layup barn the sick animals he was so good at caring for his perfect baby daughter enough money man had it knocked it all was taken away from him he turned the tv off and the room was quiet but only for a moment a couple of units down somebody was yelling at somebody somewhere outside a kid was crying other tvs vibrated through the walls traffic hummed along looking out the window he saw the buzz of neon blurry and mashed together from fast food joints and bars and liquor stores across the way man i hate to be alone anymore he thought thats why solaratov will get me he likes being alone i lived alone for years i fought alone but i lost whatever edge i had i want my family i want my daughter the lyrics of some old rock and roll song sounded in his ears moist rich poignant black is black he heard the music want my baby back yeah well you am t going to get her back you re just going to sit here until that fucking russian hunts you down and blows you away ceiling discolored cobwebs mildew the sound of other peoples grief over the traffic and me stuck by myself with no goddamn way in hell to figure out what i got to figure out you think everything is about you and that blinds you to the world his wife had told him yeah as if she would know she really never did get him he thought bitterly his hand involuntarily cranked on the bottle top and he heard it crack as the seal broke he opened the bottle looked down into the open muzzle he knew a form of doom lay behind that muzzle it was like looking down the barrel of a loaded rifle the incredible temptation it had to some weak and deranged people because to look down it was to look straight into deaths own eye so it was with the bottle for an exdrunk look into it take what it has to offer and you are gone you are history he yearned for the strength to throw it out but knew he didnt have it he raised the bottle to his lips wise with the knowledge that he was about to die and brought the bottleyou think everything is about you bob stopped he considered something so fundamental hed not seen it before but suddenly it seemed as big as a mountain his assumption that solaratov came to vietnam to kill him and had returned to idaho to kill him but suppose it wasnt about him what could it be about then he tried to think the sniper had a semiauto he could fire twice fast he had to take them both to make sure of hitting one but suppose i wasnt the one he had to hit well who else was there only donny could it be about donny chapter thirtyfive he awoke early without a hangover because he had not been drunk he looked at his watch and saw that it was eight here which meant it was eleven in the east he picked up the phone then called henderson hall united states marine corps headquarters arlington virginia he asked to be connected to the command sergeant major of the corps got an office and a young buck sergeant and eventually got through to the great man himself with whom hed served a tour in vietnam in sixtyfive and run into a few odd friendly times over the years bob lee you son of a bitch howdy vern they aint kicked you out yet tried many a time its them pictures i got of a general and his goat thosell git a man a long way in washington theyll git you all the way the two old sergeants laughed so anyhow bob lee what you got cooking you aint written a book yet not yet maybe one of these years look i need a favor youre the only man that could do it so name it im flying to dc this afternoon i need to look at some paperwork it would be the service jacket of my spotter a kid that got killed in may what was his name fenn donny lance corporal formerly corporal i have to see what happened to him over his career what for whatre you looking for hell i dont know i got something to check out involving him what it is i dont know its come up though didnt you end up marrying his widow i did yeah a terrific lady were sort of on the outs now well i hope you get it straightened out this may take me a day or so or maybe not i can probably get it if not from here from our archives out in virginia real fine sergeant major i appreciate it much you call me when you get in i will bob hung up hesitated thought about the booze he did not drink and then dialed the boise general hospital and eventually was connected to his wifes room hi he said its me how are you did i wake you no no im fine sally took nikki to school theres nobody around how are you oh fine i wish youd reconsider i cant he was silent for a while all right he finally said just think about it all right now i have something else to ask what i need your help this last little thing just a question or two something you would know that i dont what its about donny oh god bob i think this may have something to do with donny im not sure its just a possibility i have to check it out please you know how i hate to go back there im over that now it took a long time its a nothing question a marine question thats all bob please she sighed and said nothing why was he sent to vietnam he had less than thirteen months to serve but he had just lost his rating he was a full corporal and he showed up in nam just a lance corporal so he had to be sent there for punitive reasons they did that in those days it was punitive i thought it was but that doesnt sound like donny i only caught bits and pieces of it i was only there at the end it was some crisis they wanted him to spy on some other marines who they thought were slipping information to the peace marchers there was this big screw up at a demonstration a girl got killed it was a mess he was ordered to spy on these other boys and he got to know them but in the end he wouldnt he refused they told him theyd ship him to vietnam and he said go ahead ship me to vietnam so they did then he met you became a hero and got killed on his last day you didnt know that i knew there was something i just didnt know what is that a help yes it is do you know who sent him no or if i did i forgot it was so long ago okay im going back to dc what bob ill only be gone a few days im flying out there ive got to find out what happened to donny you listen to sally you be careful ill call you in a few days oh bob ive got some money some cash dont worry dont get in trouble im not getting in any trouble i promise ill call you soon there it was wes pac he remembered the first time he had seen it that magic frightening phrase when the orders came through for that first tour in wes pac western pacific which was marine for vietnam he remembered sitting outside the company office at camp lejeune north carolina and thinking oh brother i am in the shit thats it said the sergeant majors aide thats it said bob he sat in the anteroom in henderson hall with the tall thin young man with hair so short it hardly existed and movements so crisp they seemed freshly drycleaned we got it this morning from naval records storage facility annandale sergeant major used lots of smoke he served with the cos chief petty officer on the old iowa city youll tell him i appreciate it yes sir im sniperrated by the way great school out at quantico they still talk about you understand you fought a hell of a fight at kham due long time ago son i can hardly remember it i heard of it a hundred times said the young sergeant i wont ever forget it well son thats kind of you ill be in my office next door you let me know if you need anything else thank you son the jacket was thick all that remained of fenn don ny js almost but not quite four years in the marine corps it was full of various orders records of his first tour in the nam with a line unit his bronze star citation his silver star nomination for kham due travel vouchers shot records medical reports evaluations going back to parris island in the faroff land of when he enlisted get results the paper trail any military career good bad or indifferent inevitably accumulates over the passage of time there was even a copy of the death in battle report filled out by the longdead captain feamster who only survived donny a few weeks until the sappers took out dodge city but this one sheet now faded and fragile was the one that mattered this was the one that sent him to the nam headquarters usmc cmlt may special order transfer number ref a cmc ltr dfb may b mco f in accordance with reference a effective august the personnel listed on the reverse hereof are transferred from this command to wes pac iii maf for duties specified by co wes pac iii maf prior to transfer the commanding officer will assign as primary the mos shown for each individual in accordance with the authority contained in existing regulations travel via government procured transportation is directed for all travel performed between this command and wes pac iii maf in accordance with paragraph joint travel regulations each individual listed on the reverse hereof is directed to report to the disbursing officer within three working days after completion of travel involved in the execution of these orders for an audit of refunds it was signed of peatross major general us marine corps commanding and below that bore the simple designation dist n and wny tempo c rm bob had received just such a document three times and three times hed come back from it at least breathing not donny it got him a name inscription on a long black wall with bunches of other boys whod much rather have been working in factories or playing golf than inscribed on a long black wall bob turned it over not to find the usual computerized list of lucky names but only one fenn don ny j l cpl company b marine barracks washington dc mos the rest of the copy was junk citations of applicable regulations travel information a list of required items all neatly checked off srb health record dental record orig orders id card and so on and the last melancholy list of destinations on the travel sub voucher from norton afb in california to kadena afb on okinawa to camp hansen on okinawa and on to camp schwab before final deployment to wes pac iii maf meaning western pacific iii marine amphibious force donnys own penmanship known so well to bob from their months together seemed to scream of familiarity as he looked at it now what he thought whats this supposed to mean he tried to remember his own documents and scanned this one for deviations but his memory had faded over the years and nothing seemed at all different or strange it was just orders to the land of bad things thousands and thousands of marines had gotten them between and there seemed to be nothing no taint of scandal no hint of punitive action nothing at all in donnys evals particularly those filed in his company at the marine barracks there were no indications of difficulty in fact those recordings were uniformly brilliant in content suggesting an exemplary young man a ssgt ray case had observed as late as march cpl fenn shows outstanding professional dedication to his duties and is wellrespected by personnel both above and below him in the ranks he performs his duties with thoroughness enthusiasm and great enterprise it is hoped that the corporal will consider making the marine corps a career he is outstanding officer material bob knew the secret language of these things where praise is the standard vocabulary cases belief in donny clearly went beyond that into the eloquent even donnys loss of rating order which demoted him from corporal to lance corporal dated may was empty of information it carried no meaning whatsoever it simply stated the fact that a reduction in rank had occurred it was signed by his commanding officer m c dogwood captain usmc no article s no captains masts nothing in the record suggesting any disciplinary problems whatever had happened to him it had left no records at all he stood up and went to the door of the sergeant majors aide is there a personnel specialist around id like to run something by him i can get mr ross he worked personnel for six years before coming to headquarters thatd be great in time the warrant officer arrived and he too knew of bob and treated him like a movie star but he scanned the documents and could find nothing at all unusual exceptnow this is strange gunny yes sir cant say i ever saw it before and what is that mr ross well sir on this last order the one that sent fenn to vietnam see herehe pointedit says dist n that means distribution to normal sources ie the duty jacket the new duty station pentagon personnel mdw personnel and so forth the usual grinding wheels of our great bureaucracy in action yes sir but what i see here is odd in parentheses and wny tempo c rm what would that mean well id guess washington naval yard temporary building c room whats that i dont know i was twelve in any idea how i could find out well the only sure way is to go to the pentagon get an authorization and try and dig up a washington naval personnel logbook or phone book or at least an mdw phone book from the year they might have one over there then youd just have to go through it entry by entryit would take hoursuntil you came across that designation oh brother said bob the next night bob drove his rented car out to a pleasant suburban house in the suburbs of america and there had dinner with his old pal the command sergeant major of the united states marine corps his wife and three of his four sons the sergeant major grilled steaks out on the patio while the two younger boys swam in the pool and the sergeant majors wife marge threw together a salad some south carolina recipe for baked beans and stewed tomatoes she was an old campaigner herself and bob had met her twice before at a reception after he had been awarded the distinguished service cross for kham due four years after the incident itself a year after he finally left the physical therapy program and the year he decided he could no longer cut it as a marineand the next year when he did retire hows suzy she asked and bob remembered that she and his first wife had had something of an acquaintanceship at that point hed been higher in rank than the man who was hosting him oh we dont talk too much you heard i went through some bad times had a drinking problem she left me and was smart to do it shes married to a cadillac dealer now i hope shes happy i actually ran into her last year marge said she seemed fine she asked after you youve had an adventurous few years i seem to have a knack for trouble bob you wont get verns career in any trouble he retires this year after thirtyfive years id hate to see anything happen no maam ill be leaving very shortly my time here is done i think they had a nice dinner and bob tried to hide the melancholy that seeped into him here was the life he would have had if he hadnt gotten hit if donny hadnt gotten killed if it all hadnt gone so sour on him he yearned now for a drink a soothing blur of bourbon to blunt the edge he felt and he recalled a dozen times on active duty when he and this man or a man just like this man had spent the night recalling sergeants and officers and squids and ships and battles the world over and enjoying immensely their lives in the place where theyd been born hardwired to spend it the united states marine corps but that was gone now face it he thought its gone its finished its over that night they went to a baseball game legion ball where the youngest boy a scholarship athlete at the university of virginia got three hits while giving up only two as pitcher over the games seven innings again a wonderful america the best americathe suburbs on a spring evening the weather warm the night hazy baseball family and beer do you miss your wife asked the sergeant majors wife i do a lot i miss my daughter tell me about her oh said bob shes a rider shes a great horsewoman her mother has her riding english in case she decides to come east for college and off he went for twenty uncontrollable minutes missing his daughter and his wife and the whole thing even more black is black he thought want my baby back the game was over and in triumph everybody went back to the sergeant majors house beer was opened though bob had coke some other senior ncos came over and bob knew a few and all had heard of him it was a good time cigars came out the men moved outside the night was lovely and unthreatening then finally a young man showed up trim about thirty with hard eyes and a crew cut in slacks and a polo shirt bob understood that he was the sergeant majors oldest boy a major at quantico in the training command back recently from a rough year in bosnia and before that an even nastier one in the desert bob was introduced and they chatted and once again he encountered a young man who loved him what good did it do if his own family didnt but it was nice all the same and eventually the talk turned to his own day hed spent it in the dod library in the pentagon where the sergeant majors pass had got him admitted going painfully through old phone books trying to find out what this office was any luck asked the sergeant major yeah finally room in tempo c in the washington navy yard it was the location of an office of the naval investigative service those squid bastards said the command sergeant major at least now ive got a name to go on bob said the co was some lieutenant commander named bonson w s bonson i wonder what became of him bonson said the gunnys son ward bonson i guess said bob well said the young officer he shouldnt be too hard to find i served a tour with the defense intelligence agency in ninetyone he was in and out of that shop you knew him i was just a staff officer he said he wouldnt notice or remember me who is he asked bob hes now the deputy director of the central intelligence agency chapter thirtysix he watched through binoculars as the car a black ford sedan arrived at am and picked up the occupant of briarwood reston virginia bob followed at a distance the lone passenger sat in the back reading the morning papers as the car wound its way through the nearly empty streets it progressed toward the beltway then followed that road north toward m at the george washington parkway it surged off westward until it reached langley and then took that otherwise unremarkable exit bob languished back then broke contact as the car disappeared down the unmarked road that led to the large installation that was unnamed from the road but which he knew to be the headquarters of the central intelligence agency instead he drove back to reston and relocated the house he parked on the next court overit was in a prosperous unit of connected townhousesand slid low into the seat it took almost two hours before he figured the pattern there were two security vehicles one a black chevy nova and the other a ford econoline van each had two men in them and one or the other showed up every forty minutes pausing on the street in front of the house and on the street in back at that point one of the men walked around back bent in the weeds and checked something presumably some sort of trembler switch that indicated if any kind of entry had been made bob marked the address and drove to the nearest convenience store there he called the fire department and reported a fire in the house two down on the court by the time he got back three trucks had arrived men were stomping in bushes two cop cars with flashing light bars had set up perimeter securityit was a carnival when the black nova arrived an agent got out showed credentials conferred with the police and firemen then went to bonsons door unlocked it and went in to check the house and secure it he went around back to reset the trembler switch bob went found a place for lunch then came back and parked a court down the line he checked his watch to make certain neither of the patrol vehicles was expected then walked back to bonsons house where he knocked on the door no answer came and after a bit he used his credit card to pop the door and slipped inside an alarm immediately began to whine he knew he had sixty seconds to defuse it the sound of the device enabled bob to find it in ten seconds which left fifty without giving it a lot of thought bob pressed and nothing happened the alarm still shrilled he then hit and the alarm ceased how had he known not that difficult most people dont bother with learning numbers they learn patterns that can easily be found in the dark or when they are tired or drunk and the lefthand side of the nineunit keypad is the simplest and the most obvious the four corners is the second most obvious he waited a bit then slipped out the back and found the trembler switch attached to an electric junction outside the house it blinked red to indicate entry with his case knife he popped the red plastic cone off the bulb unscrewed the bulb then squeezed and compressed the red cone to get it back on covering his tracks in the loam he reentered the house soon enough the cia security team rechecked the house on their rounds but when the agent got out to check the trembler indicator he did not get close enough to note the jimmied bulb he was tired hed been through a lot he returned to the truck like his codes bonsons home was plain the furniture was spare but luxurious mostly scandinavian and leather but it was not the home of a man whose pleasures included pleasure it was banal expensive almost featureless one room was a designated office with a computer terminal awards and photos on the wall that could have been of any business executive except that they showed a furiously intense individual who could not broadcast ease for a camera but always seemed angry or at least focused he was usually pictured among other such men some of them famous in washington circles his house was clean almost spotless a university of new hampshire bachelors and a yale law degree hung on the wall nothing indicated the presence of hobbies except possibly a slightly fussy fondness for gourmet cooking and wines in the kitchen but it was the house of a man consumed by mission by his role in life by the game he played and dominated no wife no children no relatives no objects of sentimentality or nostalgia seemingly no past and no future instead simplicity efficiency a onepointed existence bob poked about there were no secrets to be had nothing that could not be abandoned the closet was full of blue suits white shirts and red striped ties the shoes were all black brooks brothers five eyelets he appeared to have no casual wear no blue jeans no baseball caps or sunglasses or fishing rods no guns no porno collections no fondness for show tunes or electric trains or comic books there were huge numbers of bookscontemporary politics history political science but no fiction or poetry there was no meaningful art in the home nothing soiled nothing that spoke of uncertainty irrationality or passion bob sat and waited the hours clicked by then the day itself it turned to night it got later finally at pm the door opened and the lights came on bob heard a man hanging up his raincoat closing the closet he walked into the living room took off his suit coat loosened a tie and unbuttoned his collar he had his mail which included some bills and the new issue of foreign policy he turned on a cd stereo player and light classical oozed out of the speakers he mixed himself a drink went to the big chair and sat down then he saw bob wwho are you what is this youre bonson right who the hell are you bonson said rising bob rose more pugnaciously pushed him back into the chair hard asserting physical authority and the willingness to do much harm fast and well bonsons eyes flashed fearfully on him and read him for what he was a determined focused man wellversed in violence he recognized instantly that he was overmatched he got quiet quickly bob saw a trim fiftysevenyearold man of medium height with thinning hair slicked back and shrewd eyes the suit pants and shirt he wore fit him perfectly and everything about him seemed unexceptional except for the glitter in his eyes which suggested he was thinking rapidly the false alarm yeah i should have figured do you want money do i look like a thief who are you what are you doing here you and i have business are you an agent is this something over a vetting or an internal security report or a career difficulty there are channels and procedures you cannot do yourself any good at all with this kind of behavior it is no longer tolerated the days of the cowboys are over if you have a professional problem it must be dealt with professionally i dont work for your outfit at least not for thirty years or so who are you bonson said his eyes narrowing suspiciously as he tried to click back to his file on thirty years ago swagger marine corps i done some work for yall up near cambodia sixtyseven i was in college in i aint here about im here about by that time you was a squid lieutenant commander in nis your specialty was finding bad boy marines and having them shipped to the nam if they didnt do what you said i asked some questions i know what you did that was a long time ago i have nothing to apologize for i did what was necessary one of those boys was named donny fenn you had him shipped from eighth and i to nam even though he was under his thirteen he served with me he died with me on the day before deros jesus christswagger the sniper oh now i get it oh christ youre here for some absurd revenge thing i sent fenn to nam he got killed its my fault that is probably how your mind works what about the north vietnamese dont they have something to do with it oh please dont make me laugh another cowboy you guys just dont get it do you this aint about me what do you want i have to know what happened back then what happened to donny what was that thing all about what did he know what are you talking about i think the russians tried to kill him i think it was him they were targeting not me ridiculous there was no russian involvement thats classified high topsecret you have no need to know ill decide whats ridiculous ill decide what i need to know you talk bonson or thisll be a long evening for you jesus christ said bonson finish your drink and talk bonson took a swallow how did you find me i shook your social security number out of your service records with a social security number you can find anybody all right you could have made an appointment im in the book i prefer to talk on my terms not yours bonson rose poured himself another bourbon drink sergeant not for me fair enough he sat down all right there was russian involvement tertiary but definite but fenn could not have known a thing he knew nothing that would make him valuable enough for the russians to target i went over that case over and over it believe me he could not have known a thing tell me the fucking story ill decide what it means all right swagger ill tell you but understand i am only doing so under what appears to be threat of physical duress because you have threatened me second i prefer to tape this conversation and the terms under which it took place is that fair its already being taped bonson i saw your setup you dont miss much youd make a good field man i can tell get to the fucking story fenn big handsome kid good marine from utah was it arizona yes arizona too bad he got hit but a lot of people got hit over there tell me about it said bob bonson took a drink of his bourbon sat back almost relaxing a little smile came across his face fenn was nothing we were after someone much bigger if fenn had played his part we might have gotten him too but fenn was a hero i never counted on that it didnt seem there were any heroes left at that time it seemed it was a time where every man looked after his own ass but not fenn god he was a stubborn bastard he really ripped me a new asshole i could have had him up on charges for insubordination he might have spent the next ten years in portsmouth instead ofwell instead bob leaned forward you dont say nothing about donny i wont listen to any lip on donny oh i see we cant tell the truth we just worship the dead you wont learn anything that way sergeant go on goddammit you are pissing me off fenn yes i used fenn how we had a bad apple named crowe crowe we knew had contacts within the peace movement through a young man named trig carter a kind of mick jagger type very popular connected highly thought of the name sounded familiar trig was bisexual he had sex with boys not always not frequently but occasionally late at night after drinks or drugs the fbi had a good workup on him i needed someone who fit the pattern he liked the strong farmboy type the football hero blond western thats why i picked fenn jesus christ it worked too fenn started hanging out with crowe and in a few nights carter had glommed onto him he was an artist by the way carter bob remembered a faroff moment when donny showed him a drawing of himself and julie on heavy paper it was just after they got solaratov or so they thought but maybe not it all ran together but he remembered how the picture thrummed with life there was some lust in it as bonson suggested it was so long ago carter had a very brilliant mind one of those fancy wellborn boys who sees through everything bonson continued but he was just another runofthemill amateur revolutionary if i recall until and when he burned out on the protests and took a year in england oxford thats where we think it happened why not classical spyhunting ground what are you talking about we believed that the peace movement had been penetrated by soviet intelligence we had a code intercept that suggested they were active at oxford we even knew he was an irishman except he wasnt an irishman he only played one on tv he smiled at his little joke we think this guy was sent to oxford to recruit trig carter not recruit it wasnt done that crudely no it would have been subtler whoever he was he was straight soviet professional one of their very best smart tough funny a natural gift for languages the nerves of a burglar he was the lawrence of arabia of the soviet union man he would have been a prize oh lord he would have been a prize you never got him no no he got away we never got a name on him or anything we dont know what his objective was we dont know what the operation was all about it was my call i fucked up we had him somewhere in the dc area but we never quite got him fenn was supposed to give us crowe whod give us carter whod give us the russian classic domino theory a soviet agent working the peace movement beat god what a thing that would have been that would have been the god damed white buffalo how did he get away we lost time with fenn the case against crowe wouldnt stand we lost a day we never nabbed trig we almost had him at a farm in germantown but by the time we found it there was nobody there we missed him at his mothers outside baltimore she wouldnt tell us a thing he was gone disappeared the next thing trig was killed i remember donny mentioning it he was killed in a bomb blast under the math lab at the university of wisconsin yes he was and we never found hide nor hair of anybody else whoever he was he got away clean if he existed i still believe he existed what a waste yes and some poor graduate student working late on algorhythms got wasted too two dead three dead donny donny i didnt send him to nam to die swagger i sent him to nam because it was my duty we were fighting a clever subtle brilliant enemy we had to enforce discipline in our troops you were an nco you know the responsibility my war was much subtler much harder much more stressful you dont look like you done so bad well it ruined my navy career i was passed over i read the writing on the wall went to law school i was a corporate lawyer on my way to a partnership and high six figures but the agency took an interest in me and decided it had to have me and so in i took an offer i havent looked back since im still fighting the war swagger ive lost a few more donny fenns along the way but thats the price you pay youre out of it im still in it all right bonson what is this all about we always heard the man who made the shot on meon uswas a russian so they had advisers over there in all the branches nothing remarkable it was said this guy flew in special your own people were involved because they wanted the rifle he had an svd dragunov we didnt have one until then i suppose thats not my area i can check records what does this have to do with today okay so four days ago someone makes a great shot on an old cowboy in idaho blows him so far out of the saddle hardly nothing left seven hundredodd meters crosswind he wings a woman with him so so bob said the woman was my wife the old man should have been me luckily it wasnt but he was trying for me i examined the shooting site i dont know much but i know shooting and ill tell you this johnny was worldclass and he employed soviet shooting doctrine which i recognize maybe its not but it sure seems like the same guy is on my track now as was on it then bonson listened carefully his eyes narrowing what do you make of this he said donny knew something or they thought he did same difference so they have to take him out they think the war will do it but hes a good marine and it looks like hes going to come out all right so they have to take him they send in this special man mount this special operation werent you some kind of hero werent you especially targeted i can only think what i done in kham due alerted them to donnys whereabouts it made good cover too the russians wouldnt care a shit about how many nva some hillbilly dusted in a war that was already won we always thought they requested the sniper no now i think the russians insisted on the sniper hmmm said bonson thats very interesting then a little while ago i got famous yes i know i thought you might go on i get famous and they get to worrying whatever it was he knew maybe he would have told me so they have to get me its that simple hmmm said bonson again his face seemed to reassemble itself into a different configuration his eyes narrowed and focused on something far away as behind them his mind whirred through possibilities then he looked back to swagger and you dont know what it is no idea nothing hmmmmm said bonson again but what i dont getthere is no more soviet union there is no more kgb theyre gone theyre finished so what the fuck does it matter now i mean the regime that tried to kill me and did kill donny its gone bonson nodded well he finally said the truth is we really dont know whats going on in russia but dont think the old soviet kgb apparatus has just gone away its still there calling itself russian now instead of soviet and still representing a state with twentythousand nuclear weapons and the delivery systems to blow the world to hell and gone what is going on is a political tussle over who makes the decisionsthe oldline soviets the secret communists or a new nationalist party called pamyat run by a guy named evgeny pashin theres an election coming by the way so i heard that election will have a lot to do with whose russia it will be in the next twentyfive years and what happens to those twentythousand nukesand to us its very complicated rather dangerous and its not at all improbable that theres some kind of russian interest in this business youve spoken of bobs eyes narrowed as he considered this youre thinking i can tell what do you intend to do that is if i dont swear out charges for breaking and entering you wont said bob well to find out what happened to donny i guess i have to find out what happened to trig i guess ill follow that trail i have to solve this if i have any chance of nailing this guy whos hunting me if i keep moving keep him away from my family it may work out this is very interesting to me swagger i want to follow up on this i can get you people a team backup shooters security people the best no i work alone im the sniper look swagger im going to give you a phone number if you get in trouble if you learn something if you get in a jam with the law if anything happens you call that phone and the person will say duty officer and you say ah think up a code word sierrabravofour sierrabravofour you say sierrabravofour and you will get my attention immediately and you will be stunned at what i can do for you and how fast all right fair enough swagger its too bad about fenn the game can be rough bob didnt say anything now go on get out of here i should beat the shit out of you for what you did to donny he was too good to use that way i did my job i was a professional thats all there is to it and if you ever do strike me i will use the full authority of the law to punish you you dont have the right to go around hitting people but if you do swagger remember not the face never the face i have meetings chapter thirtyseven bob wondered what it would be like to be born in a house like this one it was not really in baltimore but north of baltimore out in what they called the valley good horse country full of rolling hills well packed with lush green vegetation and marked with fine old houses that spoke not merely of wealth but of generations of wealth but no houses as fine as this house it was at the end of a road which was at the end of another road which was at the end of still another road it had a dark roof and many complexities and was red brick swaddled in vine with all the trim white freshly painted beyond it lay acres of rolling paradise mostly apple orchards but the house itself tall and dignified and a century old could have been another form of paradise the oak trees surrounding it threw down a network of shadows a culdesac announced a final destination outside it and off to the right were formal gardens now somewhat overgrown bob parked the rented chevy adjusted the knot on his tie and walked to the door he knocked after a while the door opened and a black face ancient as slavery peeked out yes sir sir i am here to talk to mrs carter i spoke to her on the phone she invited me out mr stagger swagger yes come in he stepped into the last century hushed now threadbare it smelled of mildew and old tapestries a museum without a sign in front of it or a guidebook he was escorted through silent corridors and empty rooms with elegant dusty furniture and under the haunted gaze of illustrious predecessors until he reached the sunroom where the old lady sat in a wicker chair looking out fiercely on her estate beyond from this vantage the windows displayed a view of a formal garden and a long sloping path down through the apple trees mrs carter maam the old woman looked up and gave him a quick bright onceover then gestured him to the wicker sofa she was about seventy her skin very dark with too much florida tan her eyes very penetrating her hair was a duck tail of iron gray she wore slacks and a sweater and had a drink in her hand mr swagger now you wish to talk about my son i have invited you here your explanation of why you wanted this discussion was frankly rather vaporous but you sounded determined do you care about my son well maam yes i do about what happened to him are you a writer mr swagger he has been mentioned in several dreadful books and even got a whole chapter in one of them awful stuff i hope you are not a writer no maam im not i have read those books you look like a police officer are you a police officer or a private detective is this some paternity suit some snotty twentyfiveyearold now says trig was his father and he wants the bucks well let me tell you those bucks arent going to anybody except the american heart association mr swagger so you can forget that idea right now no maam im not here about money youre a soldier then i can see it in your bearing i was a marine for many years yes maam we would never say soldier we were marines my husbandtrigs fatherfought with merrill in burma the marauders they called them it was very rigorous his health broke he saw and did terrible things it was very unpleasant wars are unpleasant things maam yes i know i take it you fought in the one my only son gave up his idiotic life to end yes maam i was there were you in the actual fighting yes maam were you a hero no maam im sure youre merely being modest so why are you here if youre not writing a book your sons death is somehow tied up with something that hasnt yet been answered its also tied up i think with the death of that young man i mentioned earlier another marine i just have a glimmer of it i dont get it yet i was hoping you could tell me what you knew that maybe in that way there could be some understanding you said on the phone you didnt think my son killed himself you think he was murdered yes why i dont yet know do you have any evidence circumstantial there seems to be some level of intelligence involvement in this situation he may have seen something or someone but it seems clear to me that there were spooks involved so my son wasnt a moron who blew himself up for nothing except the piety of the left and the sniggering contempt of the right that would be my theory yes maam what would be more of your theory where is this heading possibly he was used as a dupe possibly he was murdered his body left in the ruins to make it look like it was a protest thing his body would make that almost certain she looked hard at him youre not a crank are you you look sensible but youre not some awful man with a radio show or a newsletter or a conspiracy theory no maam and if you do come to understand this what would you do with that understanding use it to stay alive a man is trying to kill me i think hes also a spock if im to stop him i have to figure out why hes after me it sounds very dangerous and romantic its a pretty crappy way to live well if you went into most houses in america and laid out that story youd be dismissed in a second but my husband spent twentyeight years in the diplomatic corps and i knew spooks mr swagger they were malicious little people who were capable of anything to advance their own ends theirs ours anyones so i know what spooks do and if the spooks of the world killed my son then the world should know that yes maam said bob michael she called tell amanda mr swagger is staying for lunch i will show him around the house and then afterwards he and i will have a long talk if anybody comes looking to kill him please tell the gentleman we are not to be disturbed yes maam said the butler it is exactly as it was she said on that last day he looked around the studio had been built out back in what had once been servants quarters the house was small but its walls had been ripped out leaving one huge raw room with red brick walls a gigantic window that looked down across the orchards it still smelled of oil paint and turpentine dirty brushes stood in old paint cans on a bench the floor was spotted with paint drops and dust three or four canvases lay against the wall evidently finished one more was still on the easel the fbi went through this i guess bob asked they did rather offhandedly i mean after all he was dead by that time yes maam come look at this one its his last its very interesting she took bob to a painting clamped rigidly on an easel rather trite she said yet i suppose it was the correct project for him to express his anxieties it was unbelievably a bald eagle with the classic white head brown majestic body stout with power anchored to a tree limb by clenching talons bob looked at it trying to see what was so different so alive so painful then he had it this wasnt a symbol at all but a bird a living creature it had obviously just survived some ordeal and the gleam in its eyes wasnt the predators gleam the winners smug beam of superiority but the survivors dazed traumatic shock it was called the thousandyard stare in the corps the look that stole into the eyes after the last frontal had been repulsed with bayonets and entrenching tools bob saw that the talons which gripped this tree branch were dark with blood and that the birds feathers low on its stout body were spotted with blood he bent closer looked more carefully it was amazing how subtly trig got all the components the slight sense of the blood spots being heavier moist against the fluff of the other feathers he looked at the birds single visible eye it seemed haunted by horrors unforgotten its iris an incredibly detailed mix of smaller color pigments that were different in color yet formed a whole a living whole bob could sense the muscles twitching under its netting of feathers and the breath coming heavily to it after much exertion that boy was in one hell of a fight he said yes he was did he work from models it aint like no eagle i ever saw youd have to be out in the wild and just seen the bird after it got out of a mixup to get that look or possibly see it in a mans face and project it onto a birds but hed been out west hed been all over doing his paintings hed been all over the world to harvard in a war in every major peace demonstration on committees and the illustrator of a bestselling book by the time he was twentyfive is he using the eagle as his country i dont know possibly i suspect that such a bird would be less alive more rigid this bird is too alive to be symbolic maybe its his own revulsion for bloodshed hes displaying i dont see much heroic about that bird i see a shaken survivor but i dont think you can know too much from it yes maam said bob for some reason he had to finish this painting or finish the bird he showed up late in a pickup truck he was dirty and sweaty i asked him what he was doing he said mother dont worry i can handle it i asked him what he was doing here he said he had to finish the bird then he came out here and he painted for seven straight hours i had seen the preliminary sketches it was different conventional good but nothing inspired on that last night this is the one place he had to go the one thing he had to do can you tell me about him was he different after he got back from england what was going on with him maam did something happen to him is that what youre asking yes maam the intelligence officer i spoke to about all this said that the security services monitoring him believed hed changed in england they kept a watch on all the bad boys didnt they they sure tried they walked outside where a few more rustic pieces of furniture languished she sat he was burnt out by seventy hed been marching since sixtyfive i think like all the young people then it was more of a party than a crusade sex drugs all that what young people do what we would have done in the forties if we hadnt had a war to win but by seventy i had never seen him so low all the marching the jail sentences the times he was beaten up the people hed seen used up it seemed to do no good there was still a war boys were still getting killed they were still using napalm he was traveling also painting he had a place in washington he was everywhere he spent four months in jail in and was indicted two more times he was very heroic in his way and if you believed in his cause but it wore him out and there was the problem with jack that is his father who was forced by circumstance and perhaps inclination to accept the governments view of the war his father was still in the state department and was i suppose actively engaged in planning some aspect of the war jack and trig had been so close once but by the end of the sixties they werent even talking he once said to me i never thought that decent kind man who raised me would turn out to be evil by every value i hold dear but thats what has happened rather a cruel judgment i thought for jack had always loved and supported trig and i think he felt trigs alienation more painfully than anyone i do know that trigs death ultimately killed jack too he died three years later he never really recovered he was a casualty of that war too i suppose it was such a cruel war wasnt it yes maam you were telling me about trig goes to england yes i was wasnt i i need to get out of here he said i have to get away from it he took a year at the ruskin school of fine art at oxford do you know oxford mr swagger no maam said bob he really was a wonderful artist i think it had more to do with his decision just to get out though than with any particular artistic need yes maam well somehow for some reason it worked he came back more excited more dedicated more passionate and more compassionate than id seen him since this was the early winter of he had evidently made some personal discoveries of a profound nature over there he met some kind of mentor i believe the name was fitzpatrick some charismatic irishman the two of them were going to end the war somehow it was so uncharacteristic of trig who was so cautious so harvard but whatever this fitzpatrick had sold him on it somehow transfigured trig he came back obsessed with ending the war but also obsessed with pacifism he had never formally been a pacifist before though he was never an aggressive or a brutal young man but now he formally believed in pacifism i felt he was on the verge of something possibly something great possibly something tragic i felt he was capable of dousing himself with gasoline on the pentagon steps and setting himself aflame he was dangerously close to martyrdom we were very worried yet he was planning something else he obviously was planning the bombing mr swagger let me tell you what has haunted me all these years my son was incapable of taking a human life he simply would not do it how he ended up dynamiting a building with a man inside it is beyond my capacity to understand i understand that it was meant to be a symbolic act of defiance against property and not against flesh yet another man was killed ralph goldstein a young mathematics teaching assistant a name largely lost to history im afraid you see it in none of the books about my sons martyrdom but i got a wretched note from his wife and so i know it i know it by heart he was another wonderful young man im sorry to report but trig would not have killed anyone not even by accident the accounts that portray him as a naive idiot are simply wrong trig was an extremely capable young man he would not have blown himself up and he would not have blown up the building without checking the building he was very thorough very harvard in that way he was competent completely competent not one of those dreamy idiots bob nodded fitzpatrick he said then over again fitzpatrick theres not a record a photo of fitzpatrick anything solid no not even in the sketchbook i see said bob it took several seconds before he made the next connection which sketchbook he asked why trig was an artist mr swagger he had a sketchbook with him always it was a kind of visual diary he kept one everywhere he kept one at oxford he kept one here during his last days i still have it bob nodded has anybody seen it no mrs carter could of course the old lady said ive been waiting all these years for someone to look at it chapter thirtyeight the thing was dirty thick and motheaten it had the softness of old parchment but also of filth the lead of pencil and the dust of charcoal lay thick on every page to touch it was to come away with stained fingertips that gave it an air of tremendous intimacy the last will and testament or worse a reliquary of saint trig the martyr bob felt somehow blasphemed as he peered into it pausing to mark the dates on the upper right hand of the cover oxford t c carter iii but it had this other thing it was familiar why was it familiar he looked at the creamy stock and realized that it was in this book trig had drawn his picture of donny and julie then ripped it out to give to donny bob had seen it in vietnam the strange sense of a ghost chilled him he turned the first pages birds the boy had drawn birds originally the first several pages were lovely lively with english sparrows rooks small undistinguished flyers nothing with plumage or glory to it but you could tell he had the gift he could make a single spidery line sing he could capture the blur of flight or the patience of a tiny instinctdriven brain sedate in its fragile skull as the creature merely perched conceiving no yesterday or tomorrow he caught the ordinariness of birds quite extraordinarily but soon his horizons expanded as if he were awaking from a long sleep he began to notice things the drawings became extremely casual little blots of density where out of nothing trig would suddenly decide to record view from the loo and do an exquisite little picture of the alley out back of his digs the dilapidated brickiness of it the far lofty towers of the university in the distance or mr jenson seen in a pub and mr jenson would throb to life with veins and carbuncles and a hairy forest in his nose or thames at the point the boat houses and there it would be the broad river green in suggestion the smaller river branching off the incredible greenness of it all the willows weeping into the water the high bright english sun suffusing the whole scene although it was a miniature in black pencil dashed off in a second still bob could feel it taste it whatever even if he didnt quite know what it was trig was losing himself in the legendary beauty of oxford in the spring who could blame him he drew lanes parks buildings that looked like old castles pubs rivers english fields as if he were tasting the world for the first time but then it all went away the vacation was over at first bob squinted he could not understand as he turned to the new page the images had a near abstraction to them but then they gradually emerged from the fury of the passionsmeared charcoal it was the girl the child reduced to shape running out of the flames of her village which had just been splashed in american fire bob remembered seeing it the wars most famous most searing image the child naked and exposed to the fierce world her face a mask of shock and numbness yet achingly alive she was shamelessly naked but modesty meant nothing for one could see the cottagecheesey streaks where the napalm had burned her as it had incinerated her family behind her even a man whose life has been saved by napalm had a sickening response to that image why he wondered now all the years later why she was just a child we didnt fight it right that was our goddamn problem he put the book down looked off into the long darkness the black dogs were outside now ready to pounce he needed a drink his head hurt his throat was dry around him in the empty studio the birds danced and perched the eagle fixed him with its panicked glare when will this shit be over he wondered and went back to the sketchbook trig too had had some kind of powerful emotional reaction hed given himself over to flesh the next few pages were husky boys workingclass studs their muscles taut their butts prominent their fingers naturally curled inward by the density of their forearms there was even one drawing of a large uncircumsized penis bob felt humiliated intrusive awkward he couldnt concentrate on the drawings and rushed forward skipping several pages at last the season of sex was over the images changed to something more noble trig seemed stricken with admiration for a certain heroic figure a lone man sculling on the river he drew him obsessively for a period of weeks an older man herculean in his passions his muscles agleam but in a nonsexual way just an older athlete a charisma merchant was this fitzpatrick or some other lost love who would know who could tell there wasnt even a portrait of the face by which the man could be recognized but the pictures had somehow lost their originality become standard the hero had arrived from a western or out of the knights of the round table or something bob could feel the force of trigs belief in this man the drawings went on as the weeks passed and as trigs excitement mounted he was actually happy now happier than hed been the explosion became a new motif in his doodling it took him but a few tries and suddenly he got quite good at capturing the violence the sheer liberation of anarchistic energy a blast unleashed and its beauty the way the clouds unfurled from the detonations center like the opening of a flower but that was all there was no horror in his work no fear that any man whos been around an explosion feels it was all theory and beauty to trig the final drawing was of a shiny new tr bob closed the book and held it up to the light and saw a kind of gap running along the spine of the book suggesting that something was missing he reopened it and looked carefully and saw that very carefully the last few pages had been sliced out he left the studio and walked back to the big house where the old lady nursed a scotch in the study would you care for a drink mr swagger a soda nothing else oh i see she poured him the soda well sergeant swagger what do you think he was a wonderful artist bob said cant ask for more can you no you cant i made a mistake just then didnt i yes maam i called you sergeant you never told me your rank no maam i still know a fool or two in state after you called me i called a man just before you arrived he called back you were a hero you were a great warrior you were everything that my son could never understand i did my job somehow no you did more than your job i heard about it you stopped a battalion one man they say it may never have been done in history what you did amazing there was another marine there everybody forgets that i couldnt have done it without him it was his fight as much as mine still it was your aggressiveness your bravery your willingness to kill to take on the mantel of the killer for your country is it difficult to live with i killed a boy that day with a knife now and then i think of that with sorrow im so sorry your heroism aside nothing good came of that war did it my heroism included nothing good came of that war so tell me why did my son die you of all men might know im no expert in these matters it aint my department but it looks to me like he was picked up by a pro someone who knew his weaknesses had studied him who knew of his troubles with his father and played on them hes in the drawings as a heroic rower i can feel trigs love for him he may be this fitzpatrick trig was different you said when he came back yes excited committed energetic troubled he had to finish that painting yes is there a message in the painting i dont know i dont understand it either but you think he was innocent of murder that would be so important to me innocent of firstdegree murder yes i do the death of that man may have been unintended if so it would have been seconddegree murder or some form of manslaughter i wont lie to you he may be guilty of that i appreciate the honesty trig will have to face his own consequences but at least someone believes he wasnt a murderer and an idiot i dont know what was really going on yet i cant figure what it was about why it happened what the point was it seemed to have no point not then not now and whats happening to me would then have no point maybe im completely wrong about all this and am just off on a wild goose chase because im under a lot of pressure but tell me are you aware that the last few pages in the sketchbook are missing the american pages no i had no idea do you have any idea where they might be no is it possible theyre here youre free to look but if they were here i think i would have found them possibly did he have a place a favorite spot around here he loved to birdwatch at a spot in harford county out near havre de grace overlooking the susquehanna i could show you on a map for some reason that was a spot especially alive with birds even the occasional baltimore oriole could you show me on the map yes do you think the pages are there i think id better look thats all i know bob drove through the failing light across baltimore county then north up until he passed into harford county and turned off on a road that led him to havre de grace a little town on the great river that eventually formed the chesapeake bay he didnt know what he was looking for but there was always a chance if trig ripped those sketches out he probably wanted to destroy them but there was just a shred of the other possibility that he learned something that scared him that he saw something he didnt understand that he had begun to see through robert fitzpatrick he was frightened he didnt know what to do he came here to paint because of some passionate psychological stressinduced oddness or other he had to finish the painting of a bird he did then he decided to remove the late sketches and hide them he could have hid them anywhere surebut his mind worked a certain way it was organized pure concise it dealt front ally with problems and came up with frontal solutions so hide the sketches hide them in a place away from the house for surely investigators will come to the house hide them where i will never forget and where someone tracking me sympathetically could find them yes my spot my place where i go to relax to chill to cool down to watch the birds gliding in and out across the flat silent water it made a species of sense he could have driven to this upcoming spot wrapped the sketches in plastic or screwed them into a jar hid them somehow buried them planted them under a rock in a cave trig after all had traveled the wilderness on his birding quests hed been to south america to africa all across the remote parts of the united states its deserts its mountains so he knew field craft he was adroit in the outofdoors not some helpless idiot his mother even said so he was competent he got things done he handled them so what am i looking for a mark a possible triangulation of marks something bob tried to think it through and reminded himself that such a sign if it had been cut into the bark of a tree say would have been distorted horizontally in twentyodd years growth it would be wide not high as trees grow from the top he drove for a time along the rivers edge it was a huge flat pan of water here though back beyond the town the land rose to form bluffs and he could see huge bridges spanning them a train crossed one an orange bullet headed toward new york beyond that was a superhighway at last he came to the site trigs mother had designated on the map and he knew immediately he would have no luck he saw not geese and ducks but golden arches and where a glade by the river had once been uniquely attractive to birds the region over now a mcdonalds stood a clown waved at him from behind the bright bands of glass that marked the restaurant he was hungry he parked walked around a few minutes and realized it was hopeless that site was forever gone and whatever secrets it may or may not have concealed they had been plowed under in the process of making the world safe for beef he went in had a couple of burgers and an order of fries and a coke then went back to his car to begin the long drive to his motel room near the airport during which time he hoped to settle the puzzlement of his next move it was here that he noticed the same black pathfinder that had preceded him up but it peeled off to be replaced by a chevy nova teal and rusty and then three exits down when it disappeared by a fedex truck he was being followed fullpress by a damned good team chapter thirtynine bonson financed the operation out of a black fund he and three other senior executives had access to because he didnt want it going through regular departmental vetting procedures not until he knew where it was leading and what it might uncover he operated this way frequently it was always better to begin lowprofile and let the thing develop slowly undistorted by the pressures of expectation he picked his team with great care too drawing on a tempo manpower pool of extremely experienced people who were kept on retainer for just such ad hoc high deniability missions he ended up with three exfbi agents two former state policemen a former baltimore policewoman and a surprisingly good surveillance expert cashiered by the internal revenue service okay he told them in the safe house in rosslyn virginia the agency maintained as a staging area for emergency ops dont kid yourself this guy is very very experienced he has been in gunfights and battles his whole life he operated as a recon team leader for sog for a long year up near and inside cambodia in sixty seven he was an immensely heroic sniper who may be the only man in history to have stopped a battalion by himself in seventytwo if you look at the dossier ive distributed you see that hes been involved in dust ups ever since then some business in new orleans in ninetytwo and then two years ago he spent some time in his hometown in arkansas and the state deathbyshooting rate skyrocketed this is a very very salty competent individual he is strictly at the top of the pyramid so let me repeat your job is to monitor him to report his activities to tap into his discoveries but that is all i want this understood this is not an apprehension its no kind of wet work is that clear the team nodded but there were questions commander do you want his lines tapped bonson hesitated that would be helpful but it was illegal without a court order and you never knew how these things would end up playing out his career was his most important possession no nothing illegal this isnt the old days we might be able to make a nice acoustic penetration on him in the old ladys place if you can get that fine if not thats okay too if he burns us do we disengage no you go to backups thats why i want six cars not the usual four you stay in radio contact ill be monitoring in the control van each hour im going to broadcast a frequency change to cut down on the possibility of him counter monitoring us the team understood immediately how unusual this was under normal circumstances no executive at bonsons level would serve as case officer on an operation it was like a brigadier general taking over a platoon are we armed no you are not armed if you should unexpectedly encounter him if he should make you and turn you out you go into immediate deniability you deny everything you all have fake ids if you have to you go to jail without compromising operational security i do not want him knowing hes being watched notes were taken procedures written down bonson discussed call signs probable routes hed take to the old womans house north of baltimore that sort of thing but thenone last thing this man claims he is also being hunted by a former russian sniper i tend to believe him though his record would incline him toward paranoia but we have to take the sniper as a real not an imaginary threat so lets assume that sniper has no idea where he is and thinks hes still in idaho but hes an enormously resourceful man if the russian is farther ahead of the game than i have even begun to suspect and you encounter him you fall back and contact me immediately and if no other option exists you may have to move aggressively you may have to risk your lives to save swagger in that eventuality jesus christ swagger knows something or he has the power to figure it out hes a key somehow to something very deep and troubling he cannot be lost he still has work to do for his country he doesnt know it yet but hes still got a mission commander could you tell us what this is about the past old mens dreams young mens deaths the spy that never was but is again ladies and gentlemen were on a mole hunt were after the one that got away in boise solaratovs first move was to call the hospital asking to speak to mrs swagger mrs swagger had checked out of the hospital two days earlier where had she gone and in whose care had she been left the hospital operator wasnt permitted to release such information what was her doctors name again no answer late that afternoon solaratov parked his rented car in a national park that provided access to the sawtooth national forest and outfitted as any hiker began the seventeenmile trek along the ridgeline that ultimately left national property and deposited him nine hundred yards above swaggers ranch house he set up a good spotting position well hidden from casual hikers of whom there were likely to be none and equally invisible from the meadows and pastures that stretched beneath him he settled in to wait he waited two full days the house was absolutely empty even the livestock had been sent elsewhere in the middle of the second night he came down off the ridge and penetrated using a lock pick to spring the locks then making certain the shades were drawn he explored the house using a powerful flashlight for six hours a thorough professional examination as he sought some clue as to where the swagger family had gone to cover but on the first pass the house yielded nothing the swaggers had vanished the home was orderly jammed with books on the subject of war very clean the little girls room was the messiest but only by a small margin the living room was messy too but it was a superficial mess a oneday job not the accrual of weeks of untidiness and he could see where someone had spent a long night on the sofa he found an empty bottle of bourbon in the garbage under the sink one ordinary hunting rifle a model in more a useful tool in this part of the country a lightly customized colt commander no precision rifles swagger had seemed to leave that behind him there was a study where someone had done a lot of reading but that was about all he looked for family account books or financial files in hopes that such would yield another possibility but again he found nothing it appeared to be hopeless he was wondering what to do next he went outdoors carefully locking the door behind him and went over to the garbage cans by the side of the house still in the cart by which they would be hauled to the road twice a week he opened one can and found it empty but the second produced a last green plastic bag knotted with yellow plastic ribbon at the top it hadnt been picked up or even set out perhaps the garbage contract had been cancelled when the family decamped he took the bag to the barn sliced it open with his spyderco and went through the materials very carefully not much old yogurt cups the bones of steaks and chops and chickens eaten carefully used paper towels tin cans an ice cream package very sticky coffee grounds the usual detritus but then something crinkled a yellow postit tab very carefully he unrolled it and saw what it revealed sally m it said american am chapter forty bob took his time driving back from the mcdonalds letting his babysitters enjoy their presumed advantage over him he went back to his motel room just outside the airport called mrs carter and told her that he hadnt found anything at the site but that he had some other ideas to pursue and he would certainly keep her informed he went out got some dinner and caught a movie at a suburban mall a stupid thing about commandos who fired and never missed and who took fire and never got hit just to eat up the time when he got out of the film it was which meant in london it was tomorrow that was fine instead of returning immediately to his car he walked around the strip mall until he found a pay phone well aware that at least two cars of watchers were in the lot eyeballing him using his phone card he placed an overseas call to the american embassy in london getting a nightshift receptionist he asked to be transferred to the embassy marine guard detachment was passed on to the duty nco and asked for the ncoic master sergeant mallory who should be up and about and in a few seconds mallory came to the line mallory sir jack you remember your old platoon sarge bob lee swagger jesus christ bob lee swagger you son of a bitch i aint spoke to you in thirty years since i medevaced out of the nam how the hell are you gunny you done some great things in your third tour well i am okay still kicking around on a pension no bad problems now what in hell is this all about you bringing a missus to london and want a place to stay i got an apartment and you can camp there all you want no jack it aint that its an s thing you name it and its yours its not a big thing a little favor fire when ready gunny now im thinking that with your embassy security responsibilities you have probably made contact with folks in the british security apparatus i deal with scotland yard and the two mis all the goddamn time we got two officers over here but shit you know officers do i ever so anyhow you got a good ncotype in six or five you know jim bryant used to be a color sergeant in sas he now handles embassy coordination in security for mi meet with him all the goddamn time especially when we have people coming in that present security problems good counted on that now heres the thing in a guy named fitzpatrick operated in great britain but i think he was a russian agent or a russianhired agent i dont know who the hell he was or what he did or what became of him but it would be goddamned helpful for me to find out could you run that by your pal and see what shakes out their intel people would have the shit on him if anybody did gunny whats this all about old business very old business thats come around and is biting me in the ass okay ill give it a run if its in there and it aint real topsecret or whatever jim bryant can nose it out for me ill get back to you soonest whats your time frame well im about to sack out now its getting close to midnight over here ill give jim a call and get to him as soon as possible you got a number let me call you whats a good time call me at hours my time that would be what yours thats it get me direct at right to my office dont go through the embassy switchboard good man you got me on that chopper gunny wouldnt be here if you hadnt i owe you this one now were even jack out here out said bob he went back to his car and drove to the motel his room had been expertly tossed and everything replaced neatly including the cap on his toothpaste tube but theyd been here he could tell they were watching him he undressed showered and turned the lights out it would be more comfortable in here than out there he went to breakfast at a dennys the next morning went for a little walk watching the campers struggle to stay unseen and precisely at put his longdistance call through to london mallory here jack howdy gunny any luck well yes and no shoot this fitzpatrick is more rumor or innuendo than actual operator the brits know he operated here around that time but that info came late from decoded radio intercepts after hed gone on to his next duty station wherever the hell that was but there was no way of covering him through their regular ways of watching which means he didnt operate out of an embassy or a known cell is that strange as in very strange ummmm said bob so they have no photos nobody knows what he looks like nobody really knows who he was whether he was a recruited irishman or a nativeborn russian citizen they do say that when the russians go abroad they tend more than not to impersonate irishmen because theres a correspondence between the accents in other words a russian cant play an englishman in england or an american in america but theyve got a good record of playing an irishman in england or america the russian phonetic ah sound is very similar in tongue placement to the ac of the classic irish accent so they think hes russian ah they cant say for sure that seems to be the best possible interpretation the file has been dead for nearly fifteen years poor jim had to drive all the way out to a records depository to even find the goddamn thing i see they only have some radio transmissions and some defector debriefings what would they be ah a guy came over in seventyeight and then another came over in eightyone both lowlevel kgb operatives in political trouble afraid they were going to get an allexpensespaid tdy to the gulags they gave up everything they had a funny thing you know the russians are all worried about confusing issues so they register work names code names the like they got so many agencies they want to make sure nobody uses the name and things get all fouled up the work name robert fitzpatrick was one item in the registry that both these guys gave up but heres the odd part okay according to these guys to both of em he wasnt in the first directorate thats the kgb section that specializes in foreign operations recruitments penetrations that sort of thing the straightup spies yeah you know hiring informants getting pictures running networks working out of embassies that sort of thing the usual kgb deal so what was he according to these clerks the work name robert fitzpatrick was the property of gru and what was that gruis russian military intelligence hmmm said bob again unsure what this information could possibly mean he was army he finally asked well yes and no i asked jim too it seems gru was uniquely tasked with penetration of strategic targets that is missiles nuke delivery systems satellite shit that whole shebang all the big atomic spies like the rosenbergs like klaus fuchs all them guysthey were gru this guy fitzpatrick would be interestedi mean if he existed if he was russian if this if thathed be doing something that was global not local hed be trying to get inside our missile complexes bomb plants research facilities the satellite program antimissile research shit said bob seeing the thing just twist out of his control man i dont know crap about that and im much too old to learn plus you got your other problem the soviet union broke up all these guys went whoknowswhere some are still working for russian gru some are working for kgb or other competing organizations with different agendas some for the russian mafia some for all these little republics if it was hard to understand then it dont make no sense now yeah anything else gunny thats it it aint much a possible name a suggestion of possible affiliation man thats all they got christ said bob he searched his memory for anything that he had learned about trig that touched on any issue of strategic warfare but came up blank it was all vietnam the war that sort of thing sorry i wasnt any help jack you were great im much obliged talk to you out here out bob put the phone down more confused than ever he felt everything was now hopelessly twisted out of his slender ability to grasp it the strategic business had him buffaloed where the hell did that come from what did it mean he called trigs mother and got her right away have you learned anything sergeant swagger well maybe it turns out the fellows name is robert fitzpatrick the rower yes the irishman yeah him the british think he was a russian agent but not the sort that would be interested in the peace movement or anything like that they think his mission would have been nuclear warfare missiles that sort of thing is there anything in trigs life that would touch on that good heavens no i mean i assume the conventional peace movement wisdom on strategic warfare was simply lets ban the bomb and everything will be peachy but it wasnt an issue not at all they were fighting to stop the war that was going on the war they saw on television the war that threatened them your husband was in the state department did he have any connection with any of this not at all he was in the counselor service we served in a number of embassies abroad representing american interests but never had a thing to do with the missiles or that sort of thing he finished up his career managing an economic research project a brother a sister my brother is the famous yale ornithologist two of jacks are dead one a doctor the other a lawyer in new york the third a survivor manages the family money my sister is three times divorced and lives in new york spending money and trying to look younger all right youll get it eventually sergeant swagger youll figure it out i think im out of my league this time maam i will keep working on it though good luck thanks he hung up stumped he opened the phone book found a commercial shooting range called on target over near the airport there he rented a stock and spent an hour shooting holes in a target at twentyfive yards while his campers cooled their heels outside in the parking lot when he emerged the food choices werent great popeyes fried chicken a pizza hut a subway and down the road a bit a hardees he decided on subway and was walking toward it when he realized what it had to be and where he had to go next jbonson was flagged down after the pm meeting by his secretary who said there was an urgent call from team cowboy he took it in his office he burned us shit he knew we were there all along where did he go he slipped us so easily it was pathetic went into a subway bathroom never came out subway where in dc or baltimore no the sandwich shop on route near fort meade went in never came out we waited and finally checked it out he was long gone his rental car was still there in the parking lot but he was long gone shit said bonson where has the cowboy gone what does he know chapter fortyone solaratov knew the one sound rule that held true the world over to catch a professional hire a professional this meant that in his time he had worked with criminals of all stripe and shape including mujahideen skyjackers parisian strongarm men angolese poachers and russian mafioso but never a seventeenyearold boy with dreadlocks a baseball cap backward on his head and a pair of trousers so baggy they could contain three or four editions of his thin wiry body he wore a tshirt that said just do it they met in an alley in the dockside section of new orleans and why new orleans because the origin of sally ms flight on the postit slip was that city the boy sashayed toward him with an abundance of style in his bopping walk that was astounding he pulsed with rhythm and attitude contrapuntal and primary his eyes blank behind a pair of mirrorfinish glasses yo man you got the change yes said solaratov you can do this like fly jack said the boy taking the envelope which contained you come this way my man they walked down sweltering alleys where the garbage uncollected stank they passed sleeping men wrapped around bottles and now and then other crews of toughlooking youths dressed almost identically to solaratovs host but with this young gangster in command nobody assaulted them then they turned into a backyard and made their way into a decrepit slum dwelling went up dark urinesoaked stairs and reached a door it was locked the boys quick hands flew to his pockets and came out with a key the lock was sprung solaratov followed him into a decrepit room then through another door to an inner office where possibly a million dollars worth of computer equipment blinked and hummed yo jimmy said another boy who was watching a bank of tv monitors that commanded all approaches to the computer room he had a shorty car with a thirtyround mag and a suppressor yo responded jimmy and the sentry moved aside making room for the master jimmy seated himself at a keyboard okay he said m you said m from new orleans receiving phone calls from idaho is that it yes thats it cool now what we do see we got to get into the phone companys billing computer all that takes is a code i have no code not a problem not a problem said jimmy he called up a directory and learned the code how do you know my peoples regularly be going dumpster diving man we hit the dumpsters behind the phone company three times a week a week dont go by we dont git their code memos yeah here it is a simple dialin the computer produced the mechanized tones of dialing then announced linked and produced what solaratov took to be the index of its billing system with a blinking cursor requesting an order this is the fac said the boy southern bells facilities computer gitting into this one is easy no problem kiddie shit he asked the computer to search for calls received in the greater new orleans area from idahos area code and the machine obediently rifled its files and presented a list of several hundred possibilities over the past week memphis said solaratov our information says the husband once had a friendship with a new orleansarea federal agent named memphis my guess is sally m is this agents wife come up to idaho to take care of the woman she would call home from wherever shes hiding that is my thinking she dont tell me too much man dont want to know too much just want to find you your buddy okay memphis memphis said solaratov but by that time the boy had it up a nicholas c memphis terry drive metarie louisiana telephone now we cooking said the boy ill just ask mr facs to locate and he did so a new set of numbers popped onto the screen theres your billing address and service records now lets see he looked yes yes yes your friend mr memphis he got calls from outside boise beginning late afternoon may fourth solaratov knew this as the date of the shooting three four calls from that number is not important that is the ranch house number hey man i done told you i dont want to know nothing go on go on then nothing then the last three days one call a night from can you locate the source of that call well lets see we can git the f which is the primary distribution point and that turns out to be he typed and waited that turns out to be the bell substation at custer county in central idaho near a town called mackay mackay said solaratov custer county central idaho is there an address no but theres an f whats that thats the secondary distribution point the pole the pole yeah the pole nearest wherever they are that be the pole that the phone wire is directly wired to it cant be more than one hundred feet away from the house probably closer than that they got all the poles labeled man thats how ma bell do it can i get an address on that not here i dont have access to their computer from here what you got to do is go to that little phone substation and break in somehow you got to get into their computer or their files and get an address for f thatll put you there no problem i cant do computers you come with me you do it much money yeah me in idaho with the dreads and the tude thatd be rich man them white boy fiveos arrest me for how i be looking no man you got to do it yourself you want that address you break in it aint no big deal you may even get it out of the dumpster but you break in you check the files you find the f listings you might even find a map with the fs designated you dig aint no big thing brother i aint shitting you you could call no bluff them into giving you information here no sweat in any big city in america no sweat you can social engineer the shit out of these boys but out there they hear a brother in a place where there aint no brothers i think you got problems i dont want to risk blowing your caper man what im telling you its the best way it really is youll see you be chilling in no time solaratov nodded grimly you can do it man it aint a problem no problem solaratov said chapter fortytwo in the graduate degree ceremony at the massachusetts institute of technology men and women were awarded their phds in assorted academic and scientific specialties but only one received the ball prize as the institute scholar for only one was the ranking member of the class he was a tall young man prematurely bald of surprising gravity and focus he took his degreecertain theories of solar generation as applied to celestial navigation was his dissertationin quantum physics from the clean and was asked to speak some words and when he assumed the podium his remarks were short i want to thank you he said for the chance you have given me i have been a scholarship student since my undergraduate years and even before that i came from a poor family my mother worked hard but there was never enough but institutions such as this oneand yale university and harvard university and madison high schoolwere kind to me and doors were opened without your generosity i could not be here and i am honored by that and by your faith in me i only wish my parents could be here to share this moment they were good people both of them thank you very much he stepped down to polite applause and went back to his place in line as the ceremonyinterminable to an uninvested outsiderwent on hour after hour it was a hot day and cloudless in boston the charles river was smooth as blackened ancient ivory a thin veil of clouds filtered the sun but did nothing to help the heat the orioles were in town to play the red sox in a four game series the president had just announced a new attempt to curb welfare growth the international news was gravethe russian election had the pundits worried with everybodys favorite bad guy leading by a seemingly unassailable marginand the stock market was up four points none of this meant anything to the tall man in the khaki suit who sat in the last row of the graduation ceremony he waited impassively as the minutes churned by until at last the crowd broke up and families rejoined old friends embraced the whole litany of human joy was reenacted he walked through the milling people toward the podium and at last he spotted his quarry the young man who was the ball prize winner he watched him the young man accepted the attentions he had earned somewhat passively and seemed not to respond to them with a great deal of enthusiasm he accepted the embraces of colleagues and professors and administrators but after a whilesurprisingly quickly as a matter of facthe was alone he took off his cap and hung his gown over his arm to reveal a nondescript almost shabby suit and began to leave he had in fact the look of a loner the boy whos ever so rarely at the center but prefers to blur through the margins of any situation is uncomfortable with eye contact or attempts at intimacy and will lose himself readily enough in the arcane be it quantum physics dungeons dragons or sniper warfare it was a quality of melancholy bob intercepted him say there he said just wanted to tell you that was a damned nice little talk you gave there the boy was not so mature that he didnt appreciate a compliment so an unguarded smile crossed his face thanks he said whats next for you oh the prize thing is an automatic year at oxford as a research fellow i leave for england tomorrow very exciting they have a good department lots of provocative people im looking forward to it sayexcuse me i didnt catch your name swagger bob said oh well its nice to talk to you mr swagger ive uh got to be going now thanks again i actually its not just coincidence me running into you it took some digging to find you the young mans eyes narrowed with hostility i dont give interviews if this is some press thing i have nothing to say well see the funny thing is i aint here about you im here about your dad the boy nodded swallowed involuntarily my fathers been dead since i know that said bob what is this are you a cop or anything not at all a writer listen im sorry the last two times i gave interviews to writers they didnt even use the stuff so why should i waste my no i aint a writer fact is i pretty much hate writers they always get it wrong i never encountered a profession that got more wrong than being a writer anyhow im just a former marine and your dads death is mixed up in some business that just wont go away more on the great trig carter eh the great trig carter hero of the left who sacrificed his life to stop the war in vietnam everybody remembers him therell probably be a movie one of these days this fucking country how can they worship a prick like him he was a killer he blew my father to little pieces and crushed him under a hundred tons of rubble and nobody gives a fuck they think trig is the big hero the victim the martyr because he came from a long line of protestant swine and sold out to anybody that would have him but then his bitterness vanished look this isnt doing any good i never knew my father i was less than a year old when he was killed what difference does it make well said swagger maybe it still makes a little see i was struck by the same thing as i looked into this there aint nothing about your father nowhere excuse my grammar i never had a fancy education overrated believe me i do believe you on that one anyhow hes the mystery man in this affair nobody wants to know nobodys interested why is this of interest to you who cares i care maybe your father wasnt the poor guy in the wrong place at the wrong time like everybody says maybe he was more important than people think thats a possibility im looking at and maybe the folks who pulled the strings are still around and maybe im interested in looking into this and maybe im the only man who cares about your dad my mother was a saint by the way she taught tutored worked like hell to give me the chances i had she died my freshman year at harvard im very sorry you were a lucky young man though who had parents who cared and sacrificed yes i was so you thinkyou have some conspiracy theory about my father do you have a radio show or something no sir im not in this for the money im just a marine trying to get some old business straightened out believe it or not it connects with the death of still another member of that generation a boy who died in vietnam that was another great loss for his family and our country who are you i was with that boy when he died may seventh he bled out in my arms this is something i been working on a long time urn said the boy look i know youre busy you must be but i was hoping youd have a cup of coffee with me id like to talk about your dad i want to know about him he was quite a guy the boy said or so i hear he looked at his watch hell why not i have nothing else to do chapter fortythree bonson was debriefing the team in the rossyin safe house it was not a happy time i warned you he was good you people were supposed to be the best what the hell went on he was good he was professional he read us burned us and turned us when it suited him came the answer sometimes people are just too good and they can do that to you thats all all right lets go through it again very carefully for what seemed the tenth time the team narrated their one day of adventures with bob lee swagger where hed been what theyd learned how indifferent to them he seemed how swiftly and effectively he had slipped them bonson listened carefully usually theres a moment one of the exfbi agents said when you can tell youve been burned there was nothing like that this time he just disappeared i figure he made it out back cut through the neighborhood behind us and called a cab from another little shopping center about a mile away or maybe he went up to the roof and waited until nightfall and slipped away you didnt see him interact with anybody nobody he had no contacts he made those phone calls we did get that sir the agents had written down the numbers of the phone booths and through them tracked the destinations of the calls which turned out to be the american embassy in london first the general number and the next day the office of the marine ncoic of the embassy guard we could have inquiries made no no i know what he was asking about hes very smart this guy he looks like clint eastwood and talks like gomer pyle and yet hes got a natural gift for this sort of thing hes very it was at this time an earnest young man entered the room commander bonson he said sierrabravofour is on the phone bonson looked about himself stunned then took the phone and waited for the switchboard to route it to him bonson sierrabravofour here he heard swaggers voice where the hell are you you didnt tell me about the babysitters its for your own good i work alone i made that clear bonson we dont do it that way anymore you have to come in you have to come under control its the only way i can help you i need some questions answered where are you i can have you picked up in an hour there was a pause im outside asshole what i said im outside with a cellular i picked up at the kmart a few minutes ago how did there was a clang as something hit the window i just threw a rock at your window asshole good thing it wasnt an rpg you wouldnt last long in a war asshole i rented another car and followed the babysitters you had staking out my car back to your place now let me in and lets start talking swagger came in past the team whom he had so adroitly out managed all right people get out of here ill talk to him do you need security commander said an exstate cop correctly reading the anger in bobs body no hell see reason he knows this isnt a pissing contest between him and this team right swagger you just answer my questions and well see whats what the men and women he had vanquished slid out of the room and then bonson took him into another one neatly set up as an operational hq with computer terminals and phone banks a few technicians worked the consoles okay everybody on break bonson called they too left bob and bonson sat down on a beatup sofa i got the name of your russian all right said bonson his name was robert fitzpatrick he was affiliated with gru according to the brits but they dont have nothing on him what he was up to swagger good damn you are an operator im impressed so what did you do with this where did you go youll find out when i put it all together which i aint done yet but i have some ideas what have yall got on this guy i need to find out who he was or is what became of him what this is all about he had the brits buffaloed they only found out he was operating in their country after he was long gone fitzpatrick said bonson fitzpatrick was a recruiter that was his specialty he was one of those seductive smooth presences who just gulled people into doing what he wanted and they never ever knew he was persuading them you see thats whats interesting about him i dont think trig was his only project i think he may have recruited others and whatever his business with trig was it wasnt the main reason he came to the united states what was he doing he was recruiting a mole man said bob this shit is getting fucked up secretagent crap like some paperback novel i do not want to be a part of this shit my mind dont work that way nevertheless that was his great gift his special talent we know a little more about him than the britsand the timing works out right what do you mean for the past twenty years the agency has been in a curious down cycle it seems to have had an enormous fund of bad luck every once in a while we smoke somebody out in the early eighties there was a guy named yost ver steeg a little later there was robert howard early in the nineties we finally caught onto aldrich ames and we think well thats it were clean at last but somehow it never quite pans out that way it never does were always a little behind a little slow a little off theyre always a little ahead of us even after the breakup theyve stayed strangely ahead of us im convinced hes here i can feel him i can smell him hes someone youd never believe someone totally secure hes not in it for the money hes not so active hes obvious but hes here i know it goddammit and i will catch him and i know this goddamn fitzpatrick recruited him in the year when he was in this country and goddammit i just missed him that year i was a couple of hours slow because your pal fenn wouldnt roll over for me so what happened to fitzpatrick disappeared gone we have no idea he was never serviced out of an embassy never had a cutout any of the classic ploys of the craft we never cut into his phone network he was entirely a singleton we dont know who serviced him we dont even know what he looks like we never got a photo but it is provocative that suddenly all this is active again why would that be your picture goes in the paper and suddenly theyre out to kill you but my picture has been in the paper before its been on the cover of time and newsweek they couldnt miss that so whats different this time thats a great question sergeant i cant answer it i even have a team of analysts working on it back at langley and so far they have come up with nothing it makes no sense and to make it more complicated fitzpatrick may not even be working for the russians or for the old soviet communist regime which is still there believe me he may be working against it now its a tough call ill tell you but i guarantee its simple underneath mole penetration of the agency the notification of your existence something coming active over there your elimination to preventwhat i dont know something didnt quite add up there was some little thing here that didnt connect you look puzzled said bonson i cant figure it out said bob im getting a little alarm dont know what it is something you said photograph you dont know what fitzpatrick looks like no no photos thats how good he was what is wrong why arent there any photos we never got close enough we were never there we were always behind him it took too long i told you i was trying to set up a photograph there is a photograph i dont the fbi has a photograph the fbi was there were not on the same page the fbi was where at the farm the farm in germantown in trig had told donny where it was my wife went out there with donny the night he was trying to decide whether or not to give up crowe he was looking for trig for guidance she saw fitzpatrick she said the fbi was there and when she and donny left they got their picture they were on the hill above the farm they were about to bust trig the fbi was not there the fbi was back in washington with lieutenant commander bonson trying to figure out where the hell everybody had gone to there were agents there they got a picture of donny and julie leaving the farm she told me that less than a week ago it wasnt the fbi could it have been some other security agency moving in on trig unaware of the no it didnt work that way we were together who was there call your wife find out he pushed the phone toward bob who took out the small piece of paper on which he had written the number of the ranch house in custer county he dialed listened as the phone rang it was midafternoon out there after three rings he heard hello sally oh the husband the missing husband where the hell have you been she is in great discomfort and you have not called in days im sorry ive been involved in some stuff bob this is your family dont you understand that i understand that im just about to come home and spell you and everything will be happy she did separate from me you remember you still have responsibilities she said you are not on vacation i am trying to take care of things hows nikki shes fine its snowing they say theres going to be a bad snowfall one of those late spring things its june for gods sake they do things by their own rules in idaho i guess so is julie able to come to the phone its important ill see if shes awake he waited and the minutes passed at last another extension clicked on and his wife said bob yes how are you im all right im still in a cast but at least im out of that awful traction traction sucks where are you im in washington right now working on this thing god bob no wonder my lawyer couldnt find you ill be home soon i just have this thing to deal with she was silent i had to ask you something what you told me that when you and donny left that farm you were photographed right some guys were in the hills monitoring the situation and they got a photo yes youre sure of course im sure why would i make something like that up well you might have it mixed up with something else it was very straightforward donny knew where the farm was we drove out there we found trig and some big blond guy he said was irish we left after donny talked to trig we got to our car got in and this guy came out of nowhere and took our picture thats it hmmm he said he put the phone down she says yes definitely there was a picture taken what did the guy look like bob asked her guy in a suit heavyset blunt i guess i didnt get a good look it was dark remember cops fbi agents just cops bob said dont you see said bonson some kind of soviet security team covering for fitzpatrick yes bob thought that made sense and that was everybody that was out there he asked well peter peter farris peter bob asked peter something rang in his head from far away i dont know that he was there who was peter he asked struggling to remember he thought he could recall donny mentioning a peter somewhere some time or other and had a bad feeling he was one of my friends in the movement he thought he was in love with me he may have followed us out there you dont know he disappeared that night his body was found several months later i wrote donny about it okay said bob ill call you as soon as i get back and we can work this out however you want youre safe in all this snow we may be snowed in for a few days its so isolated but thats okay we have plenty of food and fuel sallys here its not a problem i feel very safe okay he said goodbye she said that was a dead end he said after hanging up peter he thought peter is dead peter disappeared that night yet something taunted him he remembered other words spoken directly to him its not about you this time well its another good bit of circumstantial that the russians had committed to a major operation and they were running highlevel security on it then a thought just sort of fluttered through bobs mind it is odd he noted that of all the people that went to that farmtrig a kid named peter farris donnytheyre all dead in fact they all died within a few months of that night everybody except your wife yeah and except my wife he thought except my wife bob stopped caught up suddenly something snapped into perfect focus it wasnt there then it was there was no coming into being no sense of emergence it was just indisputably there big as life you know started bonson shut up said bob he was silent another second i get it he said the picture the timing the target what are you talking about they killed everyone except julie they didnt know who julie was but they had a picture of her the picture they got that night but donny never officially recorded his marriage with the marine corps so there were no records of who she was she was a mystery to them then when my picture was on times cover over that business in new orleans it didnt matter it meant nothing i didnt even know julie yet but two months ago my picture runs again in time and the national star when im famous again for a weekend it was snapped by a tabloid photographer as we were coming out of church julie and i its not my picture theyre interested in or even me that story told how i had married the widow of my spotter in vietnam he turned to bonson its julie theyre trying to kill julie they have to kill everyone who was at that farm and saw fitzpatrick with trig loading that truck this whole thing isnt about killing me its about killing julie he fired at what he thought was me first in the mountains because i was armed he had to take the armed man first but she was the target bonson nodded bob picked up the phone dialed quickly but the line was out chapter fortyfour the snow didnt scare solaratov he had seen snow before he had lived and hunted in snow he had trekked the mountains of afghanistan above the snowline with a spetsnaz team hunting for mujahideen leadership cadres the snow was the snipers ally it drove security forces under cover it grounded air cover and best of all it covered tracks the sniper loved snow it fell in huge lofty feathers a wet lush snow from a dark mountain sky it adhered and quickly covered the earth and drove most people to shelter the weatherman said it would snow all night a last blast of winter unusual but not unheard of twelve maybe twenty inches of it endless and silent he drove through already thinning traffic and had no trouble finding the idaho bell outstation that had been the fprimary distribution pointfor the phone calls from remote rural custer county to nick memphiss new orleans address it was a low bleak building built to modern american standards without windows the happy bell sign stood outside inside it was dark presumably working entirely by robotics to one side stood a phalanx of transformers fenced off and marked with fierce danger signs which produced a nexus of wires that rose to poles to shunt the miracle of communication around custer county a small parking lot was empty out back a cyclone fence sealed off what appeared to be a sort of motor pool where six vans with idaho bell emblazoned on them were parked next to what looked like a sheetmetal maintenance garage but it was dark too even better the building was far from downtown such as downtown was along a country road that would now not be much traveled still he did not dare park in the lot for that lone car on a dark night could attract some attention he drove several hundred yards into a small development of houses where some cars were parked along the street and pulled in turning the engine off he waited in darkness as the snow fell silently on the hood of the car soon veiling the windshield he opened the door got out slipped it shut without a slam for the noise would have seemed even louder in the quiet it was an easy walk between two dark houses across a field and then next to the cyclone fence he looked for sign of an alarm or electrification or notice of a dog there was none taking a pair of wire cutters from the pocket of his parka he used the massive strength in his forearms to cut the cyclone and bend back an entrance to the wire he slithered through he slipped between vans around the garage and felt his way along the back of the phone building until he found a metal door he looked about for signs of an alarm and finding none took from his pocket a leather envelope of lock picks the lock was a simple but solid pin tumbler he took the two tools he would need the tension tool and the feeler pick and set to work he inserted the tension tool it was a matter of delicate feel the tension tool holding the pins down the feeler tool locating them one by one along the shear line of the cylinder and pushing them back until he felt a slight thump signifying that hed gotten all the pins aligned the cylinder turned the door sprang open he stepped inside pulled out a pair of glasses with a small powerful flashlight mounted to them and began to explore the building it didnt take long he found a map on the wall in what appeared to be the bullpen for the bell linemen and took it down it seemed to be custer county as broken down into phone zones indeed as he searched it in the illumination of the flashlight he quickly noted small circles denoted along the roads that were numbered in integer sequences similar to the one hed uncovered in new orleans these would be the secondary distribution points for the calls the fs he had a powerful impulse just to flee with the map but it was stiff and large and carrying it across the field back to the car would be very difficult instead he began a patient search zone by zone of the chart searching for the magic numbers again it took some time but at last along a mountain road high in the lost river range he found the pole it stood in a valley near a rectangle that clearly denoted a ranch house from the crush of elevation contours close by he understood that it stood under the mountains giving him a perfect angle for a killing shot he carefully copied the map onto a sheet of paper which he would later compare with the exhaustive maps he had already acquired as he set up his approach to the target area he had the map hung on the wall again when he heard sounds he fought the urge to panic and slipped down the wall until he found a desk behind which he could hide he switched off his light and took a glock out of his shoulder holster under the heavy parka the lights came on at that moment and he heard the sound of a man walking to a desk sitting down and fiddling with papers sighing with the approach of a nights duty the man picked up the phone and dialed a number bobby yeah i want the guys in grace is already on the way the state cops told me they got downed lines near sunbeam dam and i want somebody to check the meadow there at arco those suckers always go down ill start calling the aline you start calling the bs yeah i know im pissed too this late oh well buddy you wanted to be in management that means long nights and no overtime but free coffee bobby the man hung up solaratov faced reality in minutes the room would fill up with linemen come in to work the unexpected weather emergency he was in a tenuous situation as it was only undiscovered because the supervisor was so focused on his labors when the others arrived he would soon be discovered even if he could hide hed be pinned for hours as the long nights repair effort was coordinated and executed mrs bellamy this is walter fish at work is gene there yes maam were recalling the workforce please wake him thats right maam thanks very much walter fish bent over his phones and was making another call when the shadow of solaratov fell across him he looked up a bafflement fell across his features that transfigured almost instantaneously into a reflexive western smile and then became a mask of panic solaratov shot him in the face below the left eye with a grain federal hydrashock the gun popped in his hand cycled spitting a shell across the room fish jerked backward as if in a different a faster time sequence his brain tissue sprayed the wall behind him and a small gouge of plaster blew out where the bullet exited the skull and plunked into the wall solaratov turned and looked for the ejected shell he spied it across the room under a desk and went quickly to pick it up when he arose he faced a woman in the doorway with a thermos in one hand still wrapped up babushka like against the weather her features became unglued at the horror she saw and her eyes opened like quarters solaratov shot her in the chest but missed the heart she staggered backward spun and began to stagger down the hall screaming no no no no no no he stepped into the hall locked the glock in both hands acquired the nightlit front sight and shot her in the base of the spine she went down her hand reaching convulsively back to touch the wound itself why did they do that they always did that he walked to her she still moved he bent put the muzzle to the back of her head and fired again the muzzle flash ignited her hair it blazed with an acrid chemical stench then extinguished itself producing a vapor of smoke and solaratov realized shed been wearing a wig of some artificial substance now there was no time to pick up shells he walked swiftly down the corridor found the door and slipped out the back thank god it was still snowing heavily in seconds minutes at the most his tracks would be gone he went across the field the pistol still hot in his hand he had no sense of shame or doubt or pain he was the professional and he did what was necessary the hard thing always and kept going but it shook him nevertheless the look on the poor mans face in the second before the bullet blew through his cheekbone and the woman who could only scream no no no no as she rushed along the corridor it seemed to put a curse on his enterprise he was not superstitious and he was too experienced by far to consider such nontechnical elements as having any meaning still it didnt feel right chapter fortyfive bonson had promised bob that he could surprise him with how much he could do and how quickly and now he made good on that statement he picked up the phone and dialed a certain number and said very calmly duty officer this is deputy director bonson authenticating code alphaactualtwofivenine do you acknowledge when the man on the other end did so bonson said i am hereby declaring a code blue critical incident please notify the fifth floor and set up a domestic crisis team i want two senior analystswigler and marbella i want my senior analysts from team cowboy i want some people from computer division i want to lay on air asap im at arlington avenue in rosslyn we will make our way to the usa today building for pickup id like that in the next five minutes he waited got the reply he wanted i also want an fbi hrt unit put on alert and ready to coordinate with our liaison asap this may involve a shooting situation and i want the best guys do you copy getting his last acknowledgment he hung up okay he said turning to bob we have to get a ride to the newspaper building and the chopper will pick us up well be in langley inside fifteen minutes and put our best people to work in twenty i can have a security team onsite in four hours not if its snowing said bob what she said it was snowing thats going to close the whole thing down shit said bonson it wont shut him down said bob not this boy hes been in the mountains he hunted the mountains for years it may be premature to worry said bonson no hell go as soon as he can he wont wait or goof around or take a break hes got a job to do its the way his mind works hes very thorough very committed very gifted very patient but when he sees it hell go for it instantly hes been hunting her as ive been hunting him and hes much closer shit said bonson again call them back and get them working the area were going to need maps weather satellite tracking maybe its custer county about five miles outside of mackay idaho in the center of the state in the lost river range its north of mackay off route ninetythree in the foothills of the lost river as i understand it thats good said bonson and turned to make the call a half hour later they got the bad news sir said a staff assistant with the grave face of a junior officer carrying the news no one wanted to hear we got some real problems out there go ahead said bonson trailing along in bobs wake into a room that could have been any meeting room in any office building in america but just happened to be in the headquarters of the central intelligence agency in langley virginia theres a freak front moving in from canada across central idaho the weather service people say itll dump sixteen eighteen inches on the place nothings moving there the roads will be closed until they can be plowed and they cant be plowed until morning nothings flying either that area is totally sealed off nobodys going anywhere shit said bonson notify fbi tell them to stand down yes sir but theres more go ahead we have been in contact with idaho state police authorities just to make things worse theres been a double homicide at the phone company a supervisor and his secretary coming on to run the snow emergency shift were shot and killed whoever did it got completely away nothing was stolen nothing taken maybe it was domestic but they say it looked like a professional hit its him said bob hes there he probably had to get the final location out of the phone company files or something he got surprised by these two people and he did what he had to do cold said bonson very cold ill tell you what we need real fast said swagger we need an extremely good workup on the terrain there lets figure out given the time of the shootings if hed have a chance at making it on foot to a shooting position where would he dump his car how far would he have to go what kind of speed could an experienced mountain operator be expected to make then double that and youll know what this guy is doing what time will he make it there where would he likely set up hed want the sun behind him that i know get cracking said bonson nikki watched the snow its pretty she said but i never knew it could snow in june thats the mountains said aunt sally it snows when it wants to when we get back to arizona said her mother from the sofa youll never see snow again i promise i think i like snow said nikki even if you cant ride in it she watched in the fading light as the world whitened outside she could see a corral and beyond that the barn there were no animals way up here so there was nothing to worry about the highway was about a half mile away and it was her job to follow the long dirt road each day and check the solitary mailbox that stood where upper cedar road that high lonely ribbon of dirt which connected them to route passed by but the mountains dominated what she could see the house was in a high meadow surrounded by them mount mccaleb was the closest a huge brute of a mountain it loomed above them now unseen in the driving snow farther to the north was leatherman peak farther to the south invisible mountain these were the peaks of the lost river range dominated farther toward challis by mount borah the highest in idaho there was the sense of their presence even though they were invisible on an evening like this it was much darker you could feel them through your bones dark and solid just beyond the veil of the seen brrrr nikki said it looks so cold out this snowll be gone by the end of the week aunt sally said thats what they said on the radio unseasonable cold front from canada but itll be in the seventies by monday itll melt away maybe itll cause some flooding it does feel like midwinter doesnt it it does said nikkis mommy who was at least ambulatory now her left arm and collarbone were secured in a halfbody cast but the abrasions and cuts had healed enough so that she could move about she wore a bathrobe over jeans she looked thin nikki thought you know what said aunt sally who with her spunky personality and southern accent had quickly become nikkis favorite person in the whole wide world i think its a soup night dont you girls i mean snow soup what else goes together better well do up some nice campbells tomato with crackers and then well settle down and watch a video not born free though i cannot sit through that again i love born free said nikki nikki honey lets let aunt sally pick the movie tonight shes a little tired of born free so am i welllllll nikki considered what about singin in the rain thats a good one what is it said nikki a musical about these people who worked in old time movies and how much fun they had theres a lot of great singing and dancing a man dances in the rain said sally ew said nikki why would he do that its stupid solaratov worked the maps by comparing his crude drawing with the us geologic survey maps he had back in his motel room just north of mackay he tried to work quickly because he knew it would be a matter of time before the police began checking motels for strangers and who knew if anybody had seen him come in half an hour after the murders but at the same time too much haste was no help at all he tried to find the zone that smooth place in his mind where his reflexes were at their best his brain most efficient his nerves calmest he pushed his brain against the whirling topographic patterns of the map located route and traced the path from his drawing to the map he saw that the ranch house site was farther out at the mackay reservoir but there you turned right drove across the flats and began to climb up fran unimproved road by the map symbol which mounted the lost rivers and penetrated them following upper cedar creek there was a natural fold in the rise of the mountains as the road went deeper and at the end of that stood the ranch surrounded on three sides by mount mccaleb massacre mountain and leatherman peak the mountains were represented on the map by dizzying twirls of elevation lines and the denser they were the more sheer the rise he saw that the fast way in would be along route but that would not work for the road was now officially closed barely passable and probably being monitored by the police who else would be driving through such a storm on such a night except a murderer fleeing the scene of his crime but he was a mere few miles from the south slope of mount mccaleb and the way was well marked as it followed lower cedar creek the creek protected from drifting snow by the furrow it had cut in the earth would not be frozen this quickly but it might be low and no snow would adhere to it therefore it might be surprisingly easy walking even in the dark when he got to mccaleb hed climb about two thousand feetthe slope didnt turn sheer for another five thousand feetand could then just follow the ridge around and site himself above the ranch house again the drifting snow could make it difficult but he knew that on promontories the snow doesnt drift or collect in fact that way might be easy too he calculated the trip would take about six or seven hours plenty of time to set up lase the range and get to his soft target in the morning when the sun was due to break through then he could fall back continue around mccaleb toward massacre mountain deeper into the lost river range call in his helicopter and be in another state by noon leaving nothing but an empty motel room and a truck rented under a pseudonym he picked up his cellular and called yes hello came the answer yes ive located the target he said and gave them the position i am moving out tonight to set up isnt it snowing old man thats good the snow doesnt mean a thing to me ive seen snow before all right what then ill be completing the deal sometime tomorrow morning whenever the client becomes visible the husband isnt around shell be the one whose arm is in the cast ill execute cleanly then fall back through the mountains about two miles and scale a foothill between mccaleb and massacre you have the map you are following me yes we have it your helicopter pilot can navigate to that point of course if the sun is out hell have no problem ill call when the deal is closed hell be flying from you dont need to know old man hes relocated close to your area were in contact with him yes ill call when i reach the area of the pickup when i see him ill pop smoke i have smoke he can come in and take me outand then its done and then its done yes the working party met at with the best available intelligence it felt so familiar like a battalion operations meeting stern men with dim but focused personalities a sense of hierarchy and urgency the maps on the wall too many styrofoam cups of coffee on the table it reminded bob of a similar meeting twentysix years earlier where the cia and air force and s brophy and co feamster had met with him and donny as they mapped their plans to nail solaratov then all right said the map expert assuming hes located somewhere in the greater mackay area and the roads are closed and hes going to go in overland its actually well within an experienced mans range if he knows where hes going he has good harshweather gear and hes determined what time oh he can make it well before light if he finds an exposed ridge he wont have much snow accumulation given a fair amount of wind if he gets a tailwind it could actually help him though we dont have the wind tendency dope in yet hed almost certainly make it before light he could set himself up without much difficulty i dont know where hell be to the east swagger said hell want the sun behind him he wont want any chance of the light hitting his lens and reflecting down into the target area how soon can idaho state police or park rangers make it in asked bonson who was running this show with glaring ferocity he was apparently something of a legend in these precincts bob could tell all the others deferred to him and at the same time were subtly eager for his attention and his approval bob had seen it in staff briefings a thousand times probably not till midmorning they cant helicopter in they cant navigate with snow mobiles or tracked vehicles at night cant they walk in said bonson i mean if solaratov can walk why cant they well sir said the analyst dont forget they have a civil emergency on their hands theyre going to have people stuck along highways in snowdrifts for fifty miles each way theyre going to have accidents frostbite wires down messedup communications hypothermia the whole shebang of a public safety emergency sir you could call the governor and get him to divert some people that might work but i dont know how it would play in it doesnt matter said bob if he runs into cops or rangers hell just kill them too and go on about his business its not a problem for him these guys have no idea what theyre up against he can take them out take out my wife then escape and evade for weeks until pickup thats how good he is thats what his whole life has been about sir with all due respect said the young analyst id like to make a point which id be more comfortable making in private but i have to make it here and now so i hope sergeant swagger will understand that its not about personalities its about responsibilities go ahead said swagger speak freely say what has to be said well sir said the young analyst i have to think that it might be wise to concede the russian his mission we ought to be thinking about contingency plans for taking him down on the out route hes an incredible asset the information he has our first priority ought to be to take him alive and absorb the casualties no boomed bonson like odin throwing thunderbolts sergeant swaggers wife is obviously in possession of valuable knowledge youd let that go they think shes important enough to run this highrisk maximumeffort mission and youre going to let them get her and youre saying to sergeant swagger here were just going to let your wife die its more important that we get some information on old ops well just let him do his little thing then well pick him up in the afternoon sir im trying to be realistic im sorry sergeant swagger i get paid to call them as i see them i understand said bob it aint a problem how fast could we get fbi hrt in there or idaho state police swat asked bonson again its a nogo for stopping the shot said the analyst it just cant happen we cant get people in there fast enough man this guys really caught some breaks bonson turned to him i am not willing to concede him his mission i absolutely am not will one of you bright young geniuses solve this problem that also is what youre paid for im just thinking out loud but you could target the snipers likely location with cruise missiles someone said theyre very accurate youd have a pretty good chance of no no someone else said the cruises are low altitude slowmovers with not a lot of wing to give them much maneuverability theyd never get through the inclement weather plus they have to read land forms to navigate and we dont have time to program them finally the nearest cruises are on a nuclear missile frigate in san diego theres no mission sustain ability in the time frame could we smart bomb the infrared could see through the clouds but the land forms in the mountains are so goddamned confusing that i dont see how he could pinpoint the target area no but thats promising said bonson all right wigler i want you to run a feasibility study and i mean instantaneously wigler nodded grabbed his coffee and raced out it was quiet bob looked at his watch midnight solaratov was well on his way six maybe seven hours till daylight out there hed take his shot julie would join donny and trig and peter farris and whatever secret she had would be gone forever maybe they could take solaratov alive but that was an illusion too hed have an lpill he was a professional there was no way to stop him or take him he was going to win again then bob said there is one way the banks of the creek shielded the shallow lick of water and solaratov built a good rhythm as he plunged along as if on a sidewalk that led to the mountains he wore nightvision goggles which lit the way for him as he walked through greentinted whiteness following the course of the creek bed as it wound along the flats the wind howled the snow cut down diagonally gathering quickly or swirling but he felt good he wore a goretex parka over a down vest mountain boots mountain pants long underwear a black wool knit cap the boots expensive american ones by danner were as comfortable as any hed ever worn much nicer than the old soviet military issue he had a canteen a compass forty rounds of hand loaded ammunition the mm remington the leica range finding binoculars his nightvision goggles and the glock in its shoulder holster with a reloaded fifteenround magazine and two other fifteenrounders hanging under his other shoulder hed improvised a snow cape from the motel room sheets after two hours of steady pumping he reached the place where the creek bed petered out as it went underground above him soared the lower heights of mount mccaleb barren and swept with snow and light vegetation the mountains were too new too arid to hold much life he looked upward at the hard scrabble escarpment then he looked back across the flats into the center of the valley it was if the world had ended in snow there was a foot of it everywhere and it had closed down everything no lights no sign of civilization or even human habitation stood against the whiteness of the landscape and its hugeness and emptiness even in the green wash of the ambient light solaratov had a brief moment of melancholy this was the snipers life was it not this always loneliness some mission that someone says is important the worst weather elements the presence of fear the persistence of discomfort the rush always of time he began to climb the wind howled the snow slashed he climbed through the emptiness ill bet this is good said bonson halo said bob halo asked bonson hed never make it said the military analyst hed have no idea what the winds would do the terrain is impossible the drop would probably kill him i didnt say he said bob i wouldnt ask another man to do it but id do it what the hell is halo asked bonson high altitude low opening its an airborne insertion technique said the young man highly trained airborne operators have tried it with mixed success you go out very high you fall very far its sort of like bungee jumping without the bungee you fall like hell and in the last six hundred feet or so the chute deploys you land hard the point is to fall through radar youre falling so fast you dont make a parachute signature on radar most third world radars cant even pick up a falling man but ive never heard of anyone doing it in the mountains in a blizzard at night the winds will play havoc all the way down you have no idea where the hell youd wind up you could be blown sideways into a face sog tried it in nam but it never worked there i was in sog said bob it didnt work there because the problem was the linkup after the drop we never could figure out how to reassemble the team but here there aint a team theres only me sergeant theres real low survivability on that one i dont think this dog hunts im airborne qualified said bob i did the jump course at benning in sixtysix when i was back from my first tour that was thirty years ago someone pointed out ive made twentyfive jumps now you guys have terrific avionics for night navigation you got terrific computers you can pinpoint the drop location and you can get there easily enough by flying above the storm you can plot a drop point where the odds of my landing in the appropriate area are very high right the silence meant assent then someone said instead of a smart bomb we send a smart guy heres the deal you get me there over the storm ill fall through the blizzard i cant chute through it but i can cannonball through it and my deviation wont be that bad i can open way low to minimize wind drift maybe as low as three hundred feet if you liaise up an air force jet and a good crew you can have me there in six hours i cant think of another way to get a counter sniper on the ground in that circumstance when im on the ground you can triangulate me with a satellite and i can get an accurate position and i can move overland and get there in time jesus said bonson you owe me bonson i suppose i do said bonson sergeant swagger theres not one man in a hundred who could survive that i been there before sonny said swagger get air force said bonson get this thing set up swagger had one more thing to say i need a rifle i need a good rifle chapter fortysix go down and shoot her he thought go down now kick in the door kill her and be out of here before the sun is up its all over then no risk no difficulty but he could not he stood on a ridge about five hundred yards from the ranch house which was dark and hardly visible through the whirling snow its lights were out and it stood in the middle of a blank drifted field of white it was a classical old cowboy place from the westerns solaratov had seen in the ukraine and bengal and smolensk and budapest twostoried manygabled clap boarded with a victorian look to it a wisp of smoke rose from the chimney evidence of a dying fire he hunched looked at his brietling it was the light would rise in another few minutes and it would probably be light enough to shoot by if the storm abated but what would bring them out why wouldnt they stay in there cozy and warm drinking cocoa and waiting for time to pass what would bring them out the child would the girl shed have to frolic in the snow the two women would come onto the porch and watch her if she was as bold and restless as he knew her to behed seen her ride after allshed be up early and shed have the whole house up yet still a voice spoke to him go down now kill the woman escape deeper into the mountains and get out go home but if he went down hed have to kill them all there was no other way hed have to shoot the child and the other woman do it he thought you have killed so many what difference does it make do it and be gone but he could not force himself to that was not how his mind worked that was not how he had worked in the past that somehow would bring him unhappiness in the retirement that was so close and the escape from his life do it the smart part of himself said nyet he answered in russian i cannot he was tseini which is a very russian term for a certain kind of personality it is a personality that is bold and aggressive and fearless of pain or risk but it is in some way one piece or seamless it has no other parts no flexibility no other textures he was committed to a certain life and as stubborn in the mastering of it as a man could be he could not change now it was impossible i cannot do it he thought instead as he moved along the ridge he at last located the spot he wanted where he could see onto the porch yet was still far enough to the east that the sun would be behind him and would not pick up on his lens he squatted took off the leica ranging binoculars and bounced a laser shot off the house to read the range it was meters using a mm remington magnum at a velocity of feet per second and a grain sierra spitzer boattail bullet developing muzzle energy of over two thousand footpounds would drop about fortyfive inches at that range a fantastic loadvelocity combination untouchable by any in the world but he knew that to compensate hed still have to hold high that is to aim not with the cross hair but the second mildot beneath it in the reticle that would put him nearly dead on though he might have to correct laterally for windage but it was usually calm after a blizzard the wind spent and gone remember he cautioned himself account for the downward angle in your hold he visualized a helpful exercise for shooters see the woman see her standing there see the second mildot covering her chest how rock steady it is how perfect is the range how easy the shooting platform feel the trigger with the tip of your finger but dont think about it dont think about anything your breathing has stopped youve willed your body to neardeath stillness theres no wind you put your whole being into that mildot on the chest you dont even feel the rifle recoil the bullet will reach her before the sound of it itll take her in the chest a massive totally destructive shotstill over eighteen hundred pounds of energythat explodes her heart and lungs breaks her spine shorts out her central nervous system shell feel nothing the secrets locked into her brain will be locked there forever and thats it its so easy then you fall back about four miles and you call in the helicopter on the cellular hell be on you in twenty minutes for evacuation no police or civil authority will reach this place until midafternoon at the earliest and youll be far gone by that time he slipped down behind a rock to take himself out of the gusting wind he settled in to nurse himself through the coldness that lay ahead but it would not be a problem he knew he had beaten that one a long time ago the dark of the plane was serene cocoon like swagger was geared up he wore jump boots some kind of super tight jumpsuit and was struggling to get his chute straps tightened he was quite calm it was bonson who was nervous were getting close bonson said altitude is thirtysix thousand feet the computers have pinpointed a dropping point that should put you down in the flat just northwest of the mackay reservoir about a mile or so from the location of the house if you carry farther youll go into the lost river mountains see here he pointed to the map which clearly showed the thousand springs valley that ran northwest by southeast through central idaho cut by the big lost river between the lost river range and the white knob mountains the chute will deploy at five hundred feet and you should land softly enough youll just have to make it across the flatlands under the cover of dark get into the house warn the targets and if you have to engage him if i get the shot ill take it thats fine our priority here is your wife shes the target of this mission so thwarting him is what counts as soon as its flyable ive got a squad of air policemen heloing in from mountain home to set up a defensive perimeter and park rangers and idaho state policemen ready to go into the mountains after this guy if you get the shot take it but man if we could get him alive and her alive wed have forget it swagger said hes a professional he killed two people already he wont be taken alive the rest of his life in a federal prison is no life for this guy hed take the lpill laughing at you as he checked out maybe so said bonson swagger finished with the parachute it seemed okay with the preset altitudesensitive deployment device that was the tricky part the altitude sensor read altitude from a predetermined height above sea level so that it was set to pop the chute five hundred feet over the flatland if he drifted into the mountains the chute might not pop at all before he hit some gigantic vertical chunk of planet the air force people had explained this to him and told him that more than anything was why this was so foolhardy the computers could read the wind tendencies compute his weight the math of his acceleration add in the cs airspeed and determine a spot where the trajectory would be right navigate the bird to that spot and tell him when it was time to go but the jump wouldnt be in a computer it would be in the real world unpredictable and unknowable a gust of tailwind some tiny imperfection and hed be dead and what good would that do the plane was making about miles an hour after a government lear jet had zoomed them from andrews to mountain home in less than five hours during which time he and bonson had been on the radio with various experts trying to work out the details they landed at mountain home and were airborne again in ten minutes bob checked his electronics and other gear all secured in a jump bag that was tethered to his ankle in it a cold weather arcticpattern camouflaged goretex parka and leggings had been folded he also had a new motorola radio mtx dual mode portable with microprocessor and digitized a tenth the weight of the old prc and with three times the range which would keep him in contact with a network it was linked to his belt and secured to his head by a throat mike soundsensitive so all he had to do was talk and he was on the net he also had a magellan uplink device to read the global positioning system satellites which orbited overhead broadcasting a mesh of ultraaccurate signals similarly digitized and microprocessordriven which could enable him to chart his position in milliseconds if he should wander off track he had nightvision gear the latest things ma nightvision goggles from litton with two mm gen ii plus imageintensifier assemblies which provided three times the system gain of the standard anpvsa he had a beretta in a shoulder holster under his left arm a mm mouse gun shooting a lot sixteen of little cartridges not worth a damn but nobody had s anymore goddamn their souls and he had a rifle taken from the agencys sterile weapons inventory it appeared to be some third world assassination kit of which the rifle was but one part the rifle lay encased in a foamlined aluminum case the remington ma marineissue in with its fiberglass stock its free floated barrel its unerti x scope it would shoot an inch at one hundred yards no problem and two boxes of federal premium grain match king boat tailed hollowpoints hed examined it closely and saw that the proprietary shooter had taped a legend to the butt stock zeroed at yards it said and under that yards klicks up yards klicks up yards klicks up yards klicks up okay said bonson leaning close lets check commo just a goddamn second said bob trying to guess the range hed be shooting at what the fuck he thought and started clicking fifty three times come on lets check commo said bonson again clearly the tools of the trade at this basic level did not much interest bonson they may even have frightened him but there were other devices cut into the padded foam of the case one was an sog knife in a kydex sheath a dark and deadly thing another was leather encased sap just the thing for thumping sentries as you got to your hide and still another so discreet in its green canvas m bandoleer and therefore complete with firing device and wiring was the ma antipersonnel mine known as the claymore so familiar from vietnam and just the thing for flank security on some kind of assassination mission outside djakarta he had a moment when he wondered if he should have junked all this shit but as it was all going into the para pack and would be tethered to his leg he decided not to worry about it he locked the case up come on said bonson for a third time lets check commo we just checked commo yeah im nervous you okay im fine commander okay im going to run up to the cockpit and check with the pilots got you he turned and walked up the big ships dark bay to the cabin cracked a door and leaned in back here it was dark with a few red safety lamps lit and the subtle roar of the big engines chewing through air on the other side of the fuselage it felt very world war ii very wejumptonight strangely melodramatic here i am again he thought here i go face some other motherfucker with a rifle been here before but he did not feel lucky tonight he felt scared tense rattled keeping it hidden only because poor bonson was so much more rattled he looked at the end of the bay where the big ramp was cranked up in a few minutes it would yawn open into a platform and he would get a signal and he would step out and gravity would take him hed fall for two minutes maybe the chute would work and maybe it wouldnt he wouldnt know until it happened he tried to exile his feelings if you get mad you get excited you get careless you get dead dont think about all that shit you just do what has to be done calmly professionally with a commitment to mission and survival dont think about the other man its what has to be done its the only thing that makes sense he tried not to think of julie or of the man whod come across time and space to kill her for what she didnt even know she knew he tried not to think of his ancient enemy and all the things that had been taken from him by the man he tried not to think of larger meanings of the geopolitics of it all of the systems opposed to each other and himself and the other as mere surrogates he exiled all that sarge he turned it was a young air crewman a tech sarge who looked about fifteen yeah you got your parachute on upside down oh christ said bob you havent been to jump school have you saw a guy parachute in a movie once aint it the same thing the kid smiled not quite here let me help you it took just a few seconds for the young nco to have him geared up correctly yeah that made sense it felt much better now it fit right it was okay you need oxygen too you know theres no air to breathe this high yeah they told me the kid had a helmet for him a jet pilot thing with a plastic face shield an oxygen mask and a small green tank the tank was yet another weight on the belt over his jumpsuit and the tube ran up to the helmet which fit close around his skull and supported it in plastic webbing i feel like a goddamned astronaut swagger said it was nearly time bonson came back behind them with a shriek of frigid wind the ramp door of the hercules opened it settled downward with an electrical grind and outside the dark sky swirled by bonson hooked himself up to a guy wire so he wouldnt be sucked out the tech sarge gave bob a last goround pronounced him fit and wished him well with the ramp down there was no oxygen and so they were all on oxygen he felt the gush of air into his lungs from the clammy rubber mask around his mouth under the face plate he tasted rubber bob and bonson edged down the walkway to the yawning rear of the aircraft the wind rose howled and buffeted them the temperature dropped bob felt the straps of the chute the weight of the jump bag tethered to his ankle the warmth of the jump helmet outside he could see nothingness with a sense of commotion you cool said bonson over the radio bob nodded he was too old for this he felt weighed down with the rifle the optics gear the boots the helmet the parachute all of it too much all of it pulling on him you got it you just cannonball when you go out you fall you fall you fall then the thing opens up automatically you can stabilize with the risers on the left or the right of the chute i dont need to tell you youve done it before again bob nodded as bonson went ahead nervously into his own microphone no problem you get there you save the women youll be all right and we get solaratov no problem weve got it all set up as soon as the weather breaks another team goes in its all taken care of another nod okay theyre saying thirty seconds now lets go bob moved slowly toward the gap in the rear of the plane there was no sense of anything just blackness beyond the ramp okay get ready said bonson bob paused in the buffeting torrent of black air he was scared go said bonson and bob stepped forward and off into nothingness nikki awoke early before first light it was a habit she could not break partially because of her own pulsating energies but also because she had for so long awakened then to feed the horses today there were no horses to feed but there was a whole new world of snow to explore she threw a bathrobe on over her pajamas and stepped into her moccasins and went downstairs the fire was sleepy so she threw a log onto it and amid a spray of sparks it began to stir to life then she went to the doorway cracked it open a wintry blast howled through and yes it was still snowing but not as hard she got the door open and crept out on the porch pulling her bathrobe tight the world was lost in snow its natural shapes were blurred and softened it was everywhere on the fences drifting over them in strange hills that had been bushes mounded on the roof of the barn and on the woodpile she had never seen so much snow in her life the children who had once lived here had a sled shed seen it in the barn she knew where shed go too off to the left not too far there was a slope not a steep one but just enough to get up some good momentum she looked through the darkness to the mountains of the east invisible in the slanting falling snow but she could feel a change coming somehow she couldnt wait for daylight she couldnt wait solaratov watched the child through his nightvision goggles a faroff figure in a field of green in the bottom of the aquarium that was the world of electronically amplified ambient light excited by the temptations of snow shed come early and stood outside on the porch a little green blob then she reached down and cupped a clutch of snow into a neat little ball and threw it out into the yard the waiting was at last over he pushed up the nv goggles and took up the leica range finder he put the ranging dot on her and pressed the button sending an invisible spurt of laser out to bounce off her and back trailing its logo of data five hundred fiftyseven it said in the display superimposed on the right of the image five hundred fiftyseven meters he thought for a second computing drift and drop and then lifted the rifle to place the mildot beneath the crosshairs on her it felt obscene to target a child like this but he had to familiarize himself with the sensations the dot blotted out her heroic little chest his muscles though stiff remained hard and he locked the rifle under a bridge of bone to the earth and held the dot there with the professional shooters discipline no wobble no tremble nothing to betray fear or doubt his finger touched the trigger were he to will it four and a half pounds of pressure and she would leave the earth forever he put the rifle down glad that he still had energy clearly now it was just a matter of time he knew something was wrong immediately instead of curling his body into a cannonball he flailed feeling panic and fear he had never fallen before and the sense of no control completely stunned him it was no question of courage just his limbic system he was suddenly unmanned by the sense of utter helplessness the wind hammered at him like fists his body planed and fluttered and he tried to bring his ankles up to his wrists but he could get nothing to work against the power of the air rushing up at him at hundreds of miles an hour he screamed but there was no sound because he screamed into an oxygen mask but it was a scream nevertheless mad and ripped from his lungs like a physical thing like an animal he heard it rattling around in his helmet he had never screamed before in a hundred or a thousand fights he had never screamed at parris island or any of the places where hed had to kill or die he had never screamed on the nights before action in contemplation of what might happen on the next day and he never screamed the day after in contemplation of the horrors that he had seen or caused or had just missed him hed never screamed in grief or rage he screamed the scream was pure fury boiling out of his soul unstoppable but lost in the hugeness of the air pressure he fell through darkness feeling lost and powerless and above all vulnerable dont let me die he thought all commitment to mission all dedication to justice all sense of fatherhood gone he fell screaming in complete treason to everything he thought he believed in his arms clawing at the air his legs pumping the sense of weightlessness almost rendering him useless dont let me die he thought feeling tears on his face under the plexiglas of the helmet gasping for breath please dont letthe parachute shuddered open with a bang he could simply sense it mutating strangely on his back and the next split second he was slammed into something that felt like a wall but was only air as the chute filled and grabbed him from doom he could see nothing in the blackness but he knew the ground was close and then far before it should have happened he whacked into it and felt his head fill with stars and concussion and confusion as his body went hard against the ground he staggered to his feet trying to find the release lever for the chute in case it filled with air and pulled him away he could not it puffed and began to drag him and the plexiglas before him splintered his face began to sting and bleed his arm was numb the equipment bag banged over the rocks as he slid along and seemed to rack his leg a couple of extra inches he clawed at the harness and then it popped open and the harness somehow rid itself of him as if he were unwanted baggage and deposited him in the snow as it went its merry way oh christ he thought blinking feeling pain everywhere he looked around and saw nothing at all recognizable he struggled to pop off his helmet and felt just a seconds worth of air until the air turned frozen he pulled a white watch cap from his pocket and yanked a snow mask down from its folds he pulled the equipment bag over opened it and got the parka and the leggings on the warmth comforted him then he yanked out the nightvision goggles fiddled for the switch and looked around oh christ he thought nothing was as it seemed he was on a slope not a flat there was no ranch house ahead because in the most obvious possible way there was no ahead there was only down barren and remote he was way up he was lost in the mountains chapter fortyseven julie was dreaming in the dream she and bob and donny were at a picnic somewhere in the green mountains by a lake it felt very real but was still clearly a dream everybody was so happy much happier than theyd ever been in their conscious lives bob and donny were drinking beer and laughing her father was there too and bobs father earl whod been killed way back in and she was cooking hamburgers on a grill and all the men were drinking beer and laughing and tossing a ball around and flirting with nikki maybe it wasnt a dream maybe it had begun as a dream something spun out of her subconscious but now she was aware that she was controlling it and somehow trying to keep it alive to make it last longer as she hung in a gray zone just between wakefulness and sleep peter was there too earnest decent dedicated peter farris whod loved her so his ardency poignant he looked strange because bob and donny were so marinestraight with their short neat hair and peter was the complete hippie with a splotchy purple tiedyed tshirt a headband his hair a mess a sad little jesus beard peters feelings got very hurt because he felt so powerless next to the two stronger men and that somehow made him more poignant he loved her so donny apologized because it wasnt in him to hurt anybodys feelings bob was just watching them mr southern cracker alpha male amused by their silly youthfulness and his dad and her dad were having a good laugh though what a state trooper and a heart surgeon one dead in the other in would have had to talk about was anybodys guess and there was someone else he was by himself a graceful young man also amused by the manhood convention here on the shores of the gitche gumee or wherever it was and it took her a while to figure out who he was and then at last she knew it was trig shed seen him twice no three times shed seen him that night when peter had dragged her to that party in georgetown and he lived in that funny little place with all the bird paintings and shed seen him when hed driven donny out in the red triumph to find her at west potomac park just before the last big may day demonstration and she saw him again three nights later at the farm in germantown where he and that irishman were loading bags of fertilizer into the truck trig another of the lost boys of the vietnam war all of them were linked in some terrible chain forever changed forever mutilated nobody ever came back from that one no one got home free donny dead on deros peter smashed somehow and found with a broken spine months later trig blown to pieces in madison wisconsin and bob the only survivor but maybe the most hurting of them all with his blackdog moods and his lost years and his selfhatred and his need to test himself against gunfire again and again and again as if to finally earn the death he yearned for so intently and join his friends death or deros which would come to bob lee swagger first mommy her daughter asked her oh honey she said but it was not in the dream it was here in the dark warm bedroom julie blinked and came out of it no it wasnt a dream it couldnt have been a dream it was too real to be a dream mommy please i want to go ride the sled oh lord honey its please mommy she turned and looked at the clock it was close to seven outside just the faintest hint of light pressed through the margins of the shade oh baby she said its so early the snows going to be around for a long long time the deep ache in her body was there and the awkwardness conferred by the arm cast she hadnt taken a painkiller since last night halfway through singin in the rain when her baby girl had fallen asleep on her lap please mommy ill go get aunt sally dont you dare wake aunt sally god bless her shes earned her escape from the swaggers and all their problems ill get up baby just give me a moment or two yes mommy ill go get dressed the child ran out so early thought julie so damned early he tried the gps receiver nothing happened eventually it lit up but the lcd produced a rattle of red digitized gibberish evidently it had banged too hard when the bag hit the ground and was out of whack he turned on the radio and heard through his earphones bob one bob one where are you we have lost contact goddammit swagger where are you he spoke bob control this is bob one do you copy bob one bob one we have lost contact bob one where are you do you copy bob control do you copy i am sending does anybody hear me bob one bob one please notify control we have lost contact shit he ripped the thing off and threw it in the snow the next thing to check was the rifle he opened the case gave it a onceover saw that it seemed okay but he doubted it the same harsh impact that had screwed the electronics might have knocked the scope out of zero there was no way to know except in the shooting he couldnt shoot now so there wasnt a thing to do except hope that unerti built the scope real nice and tight and that it would stand up where the other stuff didnt he stood pain rocked him and he had a flash where he thought he might lose it faint and die under the snow theyd find him next year it would be in all the newspapers fuck me if i cant take a joke he thought he looked about in one direction lay only an endless sea of snowy mountains that couldnt be the way and by god yes beyond the mountains at the horizon was just the faintest smear of light signifying the east he appeared to be on the highest one he knew the overflight went on a northwestsoutheast access aiming to put him into the flats below the mountains and the ranch if he had overshot his mark the deviation was longitudinal not latitudinal that would put him on mount me caleb theoretically on its northwest slope down below say six thousand feet that would be where the ranch was he couldnt see the valley in that direction was lost in a strata of cloud which closed it off like a lost world he could see only peaks across a gap that he took to be a valley he slung the rifle over his shoulder checked his compass and set off down the slope the land was barren without vegetation as if in some recent time a nuclear bomb had cleaned out all the life the snow lay in undulating forms sometimes thick and difficult other times surprisingly light twice he tripped on rocks unseen under the smooth white crust flakes still fell stinging his eyes but the fierce wind had died and no snow devils whirled up to defy him he couldnt even hear the wind he went downhill at an angle almost galloping feeling the boots bite into the stuff trying to find a rhythm a balance between speed and care he was breathing hard and inside his parka began to sweat he came to a rock outcropping and detoured around it occasionally hed stop flip down the nightvision goggles and seenothing ahead and below the clouds lingered like a solid wall impenetrable the goggles resolved the cloud mass as green only partially distinct from the green of the snow up here and amplified the light so much that distinctions could hardly be made and no valley could yet be seen through them only an infinity of green cut now and then by a black scut of rock it occurred to him that he might have completely mis figured he could be anywhere just heading foolishly down to some empty remote valley where there would be no highway no ranch no julie no sally no nikki just empty western space as jeremiah johnson had found it then what then nothing then its over hed wander maybe hunting a little hed live certainly but in three days or a week under a growth of beard hed emerge to find a different world without a wife with a bitter orphaned daughter with everything hed worked for gone all his achievements gone solaratov gone back to moscow for blintz and borscht with a nice reward in his pocket just go he thought just push it out think it through and do it he looked over his shoulder and got more bad news it was getting lighter he raced the day downhill a light came on upstairs solaratov stirred he was not cold at all he rolled over cracking fingers and joints fighting the general numbness that his body had picked up in its long stay on the ground a shawl of snow cracked on his back as he moved splitting and falling from him hed picked up the last inch that was all right he knew a man can actually last in snow much longer than a rifle can the rifle was more problematical lubrication can solidify in the cold turn to gum destroy the trigger pull catch in the next cycle of the bolt the gasses dont burn as hot so the bullet flies to a new point of impact unpredictable the scope stiffens somehow comes out of zero his breath could fog on it obscuring his vision nothing works quite as well there were a hundred reasons why a good shot could go bad he opened the remingtons bolt slid it backward no impediment marked the smoothness of the glide no the oil had not gummed in any way he pushed it ever so slowly forward until it would go no farther then pushed the bolt handle downward two inches feeling the bolt lock in place without assuming the position to shoot he put his hand around the pistol grip of the rifle threaded a finger through the trigger guard felt the curvature of the trigger his finger caressed it through the glove without consciously willing it his trigger finger squeezed ever so slightly feeling a dry twig of resistance for an instant and then the trigger broke with the precision of a bonechina teacup handle snapping off perfect four and a half pounds not an ounce more not an ounce less he pulled the rifle to him and examined the muzzle where the browning optimizing system was screwed to a precise setting to control barrel vibration the setting was perfect and tight next he slipped his glove off unzipped his parka reached inside the many layers until he reached his shirt where hed stored twenty rounds in a plastic case close to his heart close to the warmest part of him he opened the box and removed four then he carefully returned the box to the pocket to preserve the warmer environment he opened the bolt and slid the cartridges one by one into the magazine this somehow always pleased him it was the heart of the issue of the rifle the careful fit of round to chamber the slow orchestration of the bolt syncopating this union then vouchsafing it with the final cam ming lockdown that felt solid as a bank vault no safety never used safeties didnt believe in them if you used safeties it meant you didnt trust yourself if you gave yourself up to the whim of mechanics you begged trouble you just kept your finger off the trigger until you were on target thats how it worked solaratov blew on his hand pulled the glove on then shifted his vision downhill to the house in the slightly intensified light of the rising dawn the house was more distinct the upstairs light remained on but now one downstairs had been added its orange glow suffused the night because of the angle he could see one of the windows but the others were shielded by the rake of the porch roof behind that visible window now and then a figure moved it would be the woman would it not preparing breakfast making coffee scrambling eggs pouring milk for cereal for the child but which woman the fbi agents wife or the snipers wife thats why he couldnt send a shot into the shadow and be gone suppose it was the wrong woman he could not afford another failure and worse he would never ever again come upon conditions so totally in his favor do not rush he told himself do not move until you are sure the light rose eventually though second by second one could detect no difference now the day had gone from black edging to pewter to pewter edging to gray the clouds were still low though no snow was falling no sun today it would be hours before anyone could helicopter in hours beyond that before they could come overland except by snowmobile and what point was there to that by that time hed be far far away from the scene of the crime telephone of course that last detail the one you forgot the one that could get you killed he fires kills the woman and retreats but the other woman sees her dead in the snow and quickly picks up the phone and calls the sheriffs office deputies nearby on snowmobiles are reached by radio they could get here in minutes theyd zoom up the slope and quickly find his tracks theyd call in his location other deputies would be dispatched hed end up in some halfbaked last stand in this godforsaken chunk of america brought low by a hayseed with a deer rifle who was a parttime deputy sheriff or forest ranger his eyes went back to the house explored it carefully until at last he found the junction of the phone wires where they left the pole that ran along the road and descended to the house his eyes met an astonishment the line was already down the snow had taken the line down now there was an omen it was as if the god he had been taught not to believe in had come to his aid not merely by bringing in the storm to cover his tracks but by breaking the phone line was god a communist he smiled just the littlest bit he looked back a sudden slash of orange light flicked across the snow as the front door opened he watched as a little girl ran off the porch and dived into a pile of snow he could hear her laughter all the way up here there was no other sound then standing on the edge of the porch he saw the woman he was in the soup now the cloud was everywhere visibility sunk to nothing he was in the cloud and felt its penetrating moisture wetness gathered on his parka glazing the white arctic warfare pattern his eyelashes filled with dampness it gleamed off the pewtercolored rifle barrel the nightvision goggles were worthless now engaged they simply produced green blankness throw them he thought dump them complete shit but instead he pushed them up on his head what would happen if he came out of it and needed them to negotiate rocks or something instead he groped onward the rifle hanging on his shoulder trying desperately to keep up speed but now the ground was rockier and he couldnt see far enough to choose the right paths through the descending gullies the twisty snowclogged passage between rocks the increasing tufts of vegetation bent into nightmare forms by the thick wet snow his own breath blossomed before him foamy and betraying he fell the snow jammed into his throat got down inside the parka his leg hurt like hell a shiver ran down his body get up goddammit he climbed back to his feet remembering another dark day of fog and wet that was so long ago it seemed to have happened in some other lifetime that day hed been so electric so animal so tiger his reflexes were alive and in a secret way he now realized he loved it all now he felt old and slow his limbs were working out of coordination the cold and the wet fought him his leg hurt particularly his hip a slow sting had begun inside his thigh and he realized that his impact had reopened the incision above his knee where solaratovs bullet had nestled all these years in its capsule of scar tissue the rage came again a hot red tide a frenzy of mutilating hatred god help me he prayed god help the sniper he raced downward coming across a clear spot and thought for just a moment he might be out of it but saw in the next second it was only an illusion now in the gray light of dawn the snow was like a giant mound of softness she thought of ice cream vanilla in big white piles everywhere thick enough to grab her body and support her when she threw herself into it she tasted it and received only messages of coldness and texture which in the next fraction of a second became cold water amazingly she giggled in delight mommy its fun honey dont go far i cant get you yet the sun will be up in a few minutes wheeeeeeee i want to sled no baby not yet wait till aunt sally is up if you get hurt i cant reach you she struggled through the snow which reached her knees not listening a bit the sled was in the barn she knew where exactly the barn was empty but the sled leaned against the wall beyond the eight stalls in a feeding pen it was an old sledshe could see it exactly in her mindwith rusty red runners and a battered wooden flatbed she should have gotten it last night when they said it would snow nikki her mother called nikki turned back and saw her mother standing on the edge of the porch wrapped in a great parka over her immobilizing cast her hand shielding her eyes from the snippets of snow the wind occasionally caught and flung nikki come back her mother stood there is it her goddammit is it her the woman stood rooted to the front of the porch against his finger the trigger was a tease the mildot had her centered perfectly and no tremor came to his arm his position was superb adductor magnus was firm anchoring him to the earth he was four pounds away from the end of the war no cold no fear no tremor no doubt no hesitation but is it her he had only seen her through his scope at meters for one second he couldnt tell she was wrapped in a coat and one hand held it secured possibly that meant the other hand was immobilized in a cast possibly it meant nothing thats how you wore a coat if you didnt want to put it on and button it any person would wear it that way the woman ducked back she was gone he exhaled wheeeeeeeeeeee came the faroff sound of the child wheeeeeeeeeeee it was so far away light dry just the smallest of things maybe a freak twist of wind blew it up to him or the kindness of god but there it was my child hed know it anywherethe throaty timbre the vitality the heroism spirit goddamn did that girl have some spunk got it from her granddad now there was a man with spunk she was to the left somewhere very far away in that direction he could see nothing except rougher ground fuck it he thought he unslung the rifle and with a swift openandshut cocked it jacking one of federals primo s into the spout he ran he ran he ran he dashed through the rocks building momentum his legs fighting the splash of snow that each ones energy unleashed it ate at his heart and lungs all the work and his breath came in dry spurts wrapped in a sheath of pain still he pressed he ran and when he came out of the rocks the slope dropped off closer to vertical and he had to slow up to keep from falling almost leaping down through the snow his momentum again building right on the tippy edge of control then suddenly he was out of it the day lightened as the cloud disappeared and before him stretched a valley filled with snow like a vast bowl of offcolor vanilla ice cream still only gray in the rising illumination he saw a house telephone poles signaling a road a corral with only the tips of the posts visible in the blanket of white a barn itself laden with the stuff all pretty as a greeting cardand his child she was a few yards in front of the porch dancing wheeeeeeeeeee she screamed again her voice powerful and ringing bob saw that he was on a ridge to the far side of the horseshoe of elevation that surrounded the place on three sides he saw lights in the house a warm slash of brilliance from an open door and on the porch now something else moved and came out he saw her standing on the steps a parka wrapped about her his wife nikki threw a snowball at her and she ducked and there was just a moment when her coat fell open and slipped and he could see the cast on her left arm he turned and flopped to the ground finding prone building the position trying to slow the pounding of his heart the sniper find the sniper it was her she ducked the coat came open then she shuddered it back onto her shoulders but her left arm was immobilized in plaster yes now he squirmed making minute corrections he didnt rush what was the point of rushing there was nothing in the world except the woman standing there in her coat five hundred fiftyseven meters hold two dots below the reticle that is two dots high to account for the bullets drop over the long flight and the subtle effects of gravity over the downward trajectory concentrate its just another soft target he thought in a world full of soft targets he expelled a half breath held the rest in his lungs his body was a monument adductor magnus tight the mildots didnt move they were on her like death itself the rifle was a chastised lover so still and obedient his mind emptied only the trigger stood between himself and the end of the war it was a fourandahalfpound trigger and four pounds were already gone bob scanned the ridge as it curved away from him knowing his man would set up to the east to keep the sun to his back the scope was x which was big enough to give him a little width of vision god why didnt he have binoculars binoculars wouldthere he was not him not the man but the rifle barrel black against the white snow sheltered near a boulder the rifle was still braced on one hand in a steady perfect prone in the lee of the rock bob knew solaratov was making his lastsecond corrections nursing his concentration to the highest point long shot oh such a long shot he steadied prayed for he knew the man was ready to fire it was close to a thousand meters with a rifle hed never zeroed whose trigger was unknown to him but only a second remained and his crosshairs found the rifle barrel then rose above it based on his instinctive guesstimate of the range is it right is this it oh shit he thought time to hunt he thought and fired chapter fortyeight bonson felt a huge blast of utter scalding frustration shudder through him agh ugh umf this is where your major strokes came from some little fritz in the brain and in the blink of an eye youre fried his blood pressure felt dangerously high he wished he had somebody to smack or kill his muscles tightened into brick redness flashed in his mind his teeth ground against one another he spoke again into the microphone bob one bob one this is bob control come in come in goddammit come in he isnt there sir said the tech sergeant who was in the radio bay with him weve lost him or the fucking cowboys on his own bonson thought okay switch me through to the larger net the sergeant dialed the new frequency on the console of the radio ah hill this is bonson are you there yes sir spoke his second in command from mountain home air force base the whole team is in were in good shape youve liaised with the state police yes sir i have a major hendrikson on standby okay heres the deal weve lost contact with our asset tell this major to get state police helicopters in there as soon as possible sooner if possible yes sir but the word im getting is that nobodys flying into those mountains until at least ten am theres still real bad weather and these guys are spread pretty thin shit i did talk to air force we can get some lowlevel radars set up on three surrounding mountains by assuming they can move in by and we can get good position on any incoming helos if this russian plans to exit by helo well nab him this guys the best in the world at escape and evasion hes worked mountains before swagger knew that if swagger doesnt get him hes gone its that simple the man on the other end was silent goddamn i hate to be beat by him i hate it said bonson to nobody in particular he ripped off his earphones and threw them against the fuselage of the plane the plastic on one of them cracked and a piece spun off and landed at his feet he stomped it into the floor grunting mightily the sergeant happened to look away at precisely that moment as the navigator came back to get some coffee from the thermos in the radio bay and the two aviators locked eyes the sergeant rolled his eyes pointed his finger at his head and rotated it quickly communicating in the universal language of human gesture a single idea screwball the navigator nodded julie knew at once it was a shot the supersonic crack was sharp and trailed a wake of echo as it bounced off the sheltering hills nikki get in here now she screamed the little girl turned paused in confusion and then there was another one like the snap of a whip and nikki ran toward her both recognized it from the time theyd been shot at so recently come on come on yelled julie and she grabbed her daughter pulled her into the house locked the door she heard another shot from a different location an answering shot men were trying to kill each other nearby get downstairs she said to her daughter now and dont come up no matter what until you hear the police the girl ran into the cellar julie grabbed a phone and found at once there was no dial tone it was dead she looked outside and could see nothing except the hugeness of the snow now lightening as full dawn approached she heard no more shots she ran upstairs and found sally groggily wandering down the hall did you someones shooting julie yelled jesus sally said did you call the police the lines down or dead or something who i dont know theres two of them come on we have to get into the basement the two women ran down the stairs found the door into the cellar and descended into near darkness the cellar windows had been snowed in and only diffuse light showed through them it was cold mommy said nikki im scared im scared too said julie i wish daddy was here i do too said julie now you get in the corner said sally ill figure out some way to block the door just in case im sure its just hunters or something no said julie they were shooting at each other theyre not hunters theyre snipers i wish daddy were here said nikki again snow showered across solaratov and his mind came out of its deep pool of concentration to recognize the familiar cloud of debris a highvelocity round delivers when it strikes and the next split second the whip song of the rifle crack reached him as it shattered the sound barrier under fire the left the left another detonation spewed snow into the sky under fire he tore himself from the scope looked to the left to see nothing because of the shielding rock but he knew from the sound that the man had to be on the rim of the ridge he looked back into the valley to just catch the little girl as she dipped under the porch roof and in another split second heard the door slam damn they were gone who was shooting at him he realized now he was invisible to the shooter else hed be dead the shooter could not see him behind his rock he knew too the man now had the rock zeroed knowing full well that solaratov would have to come around it to return fire he felt no fear he felt no curiosity he felt no disappointment he felt no surprise his mind did not work that way only problem process and solution instead of rising to come around the rock he backed low as a lizard through the snow trusting that the mans scope would be so powerful that its field of view would be narrow and that the whiteness of his camouflage would also shield him from recognition he squirmed backward as low in the snow as a man could be sliding through the stuff as if he were some kind of arctic snake he canted his head as he backed and as he slid out from behind the rock he saw his antagonist a disturbance ever so slight along the line of the ridge that could only be a man hunched over a rifle desperately looking for a target he studied and was sure he saw it move or squirm or something what was the distance he pivoted on the ground finding a good angle to the target splaying his legs coming into that good solid prone adductor magnus in the scope yes a man possibly in white another sniper low on the ridge he watched his crosshairs settle telling himself not to hurry not to rush not to jerk he couldnt get a clear sight picture and he didnt have time to shoot a laser at the target to get its distance he pivoted slightly found a bush coned in snow which he took to be of three feet girth by covering it in the scope with mildots and racking through the maththe black mass covered two dots multiply the assumed one meter in height by one thousand and divide by two to get the approximation of a thousand yards say less than a thousand but more than nine hundred yards he held four dots high with greater concentration and less art he steadied himself pivoted to find the disturbance that had to be the man but was not really clear felt his finger on the trigger but did not think about it and let it decide itself as if it had a brain what to do next and then it fired a geyser of snow erupted seven feet to the right of bob followed by the whipcrack of sound windage the russian had the range but there was some crosswind and the mm hadnt quite the weight to stand up to it it had drifted ever so slightly but how could solaratov have read wind if he were shooting across the raw space of the valley he wouldnt make that mistake again but quickly hed understand that cock again and shoot bob squirmed back feeling himself sliding a little off the edge of the ridge and in the next split second another eruption blew a hole in the surface of the planet a big spout of flung snow and rock frags it hit exactly where hed been but just barely was no longer oh this motherfucker is so good this motherfucker wont make another mistake bob slid back farther no shots had gone toward the house for a little while at least his wife was safe he knew shed have the sense to head to the cellar with nikki and sally and lock up and wait meanwhile he had but one choice that was to low crawl along the ridge and hope that its tiny incline was enough to shield him from solaratovs vision solaratov would realize he couldnt go up or down hed never go toward him he could only fall back around the mountain until he disappeared around it and could then get up and move to cover and set up an ambush solaratov would go up elevation was power in this engagement whoever reigned on high reigned because hed have the angle into a target where the other man would have nothing that was the plan to get out of this area of dangerous vulnerability move like hell when safe and find a good hide solaratov would have to come around the mountain to get him but hed come around high bob knew hed get a good shot maybe only one but he knew he could make it he tried to calculate the differences between his grain round and the russians mm remington magnum the magnum flew four hundred feet per second faster with almost a thousand pounds more muzzle energy it shot so much flatter the russian if he were under five hundred yards could hold just a bit over him and pull the trigger not worrying about drop so hed have to stay at least five hundred yards ahead because the slight drop plus the windage would be his best defense he turned back squirmed to the lip of the ridge but could see nothing except the quiet house far below and the ridgeline running around the base of the mountain but he was coming the russian was coming the russian was hunting him solaratov studied the situation he looked across the horseshoe through his leica binoculars at the ridge where hed spotted the other shooter and understood the man couldnt go up or down for both would expose him and hed be dead in a second he could only crawl desperately away round the flank of the mountain and try and set up in the mountains next cove waiting for a shot he shot a laser over and the readout told him the range was about meters he calculated the drop to be about fortytwo inches from his five hundredyard zero which was four dots high on the mildot reticle now that hed solved the distance he felt confident but there was one other thing left to do he pulled the rifle down and quickly unscrewed the boss nozzle which controlled barrel vibrations he reached inside his jacket and removed an awc suppressor it was a long black tube of anodized aluminum packed with baffles soundabsorbent material like steel wool and washers called wipes it would reduce the db level of the gas exploding out of his muzzle by trapping it and bleeding it off down to under a hundred dbs approximately the sound of a bb gun from long distance in the cone of the suppressors pattern that sound would be not merely significantly quieter but also more diffuse thered be no signature to reveal his position anyone on the receiving end would hear only the crack of the bullet as it broke the sound barrier but nothing from the rifles muzzle that could pinpoint a location that meant he could shoot at his antagonist but his antagonist could not locate him by sound to shoot back the downside it changed his zero somewhat how much hed have to reckon visually and make adjustments as he fired he still felt that with the range finder the suppressor gave him significant tactical advantage he carefully screwed the suppressor tight to the muzzle he knew one other thing because he had studied the topographical maps that once his antagonist got around the mountain he would be in for a surprise the elevation was much steeper there were no ridges as there were here fronting the valley hed have no place to hide hed be in the open solaratov knew the wise move would be to scamper upward to gain further advantage of height as he had the initiative at this point he probably had a good four or fiveminute window of time where he could ascend slide over one of the lesser hills of mount mccaleb and then shoot down upon his antagonist but he also knew that is exactly how the mans mind would work thats how hed figure it and he himself once under shelter would ascend quickly to try and prevent the russian from gaining the height advantage but none of this mattered the objective was the woman the higher solaratov got the farther from the woman he got it wasnt about some manonman thing some sniper duel some engagement of vanity that was his advantage the other manit had to be swaggermeant nothing to him solaratovs ego was uninvested what had happened all those years back in vietnam was totally disconnected from today and that itself was a significant advantage thus solaratov made his plan he would drop back a few yards behind the shield of an enfilade and then descend in freedom to the valley floor hed have a dangerous period of vulnerability as he went across the valley floor but with his snow skills and his understanding of the other mans fear he knew the other man would be busy setting up a hide in the next fold for a man he thought would ascend to fight instead the russian would work from the ground and shoot uphill hed find cover in a treeline or behind rocks hed scope the distance and hed put his silent shots onto the antagonist precise and perfect swagger would not even know where the shots came from hed hear nothing hed be driven back until he was out of cover and then hed die then thought solaratov ill backtrack get into the house and do the women witnesses ill have to kill them all bob squirmed in a last desperate burst of energy and came around the mountain there is no lower or more degrading mode of transportation than the low crawl and he had crawled enough in his time his elbows and knees ached from the endless banging against the rock snow had gotten into his mouth and down his neck now at last some kind of safety he paused breathing hard feeling wet with sweat at least solaratov had not gotten above him to fire down on him as he crawled his mouth was dry his body heaved for oxygen that he could not replenish fast enough his heart hammered like a drum beaten by a madman his focus rolled in and out but with a surge of will he settled down he pulled himself up the mountain and peeked back over some rocks at the valley hed left behind nothing no sign of solaratov the house lay undisturbed far below in a huge field of undisturbed snow the rock along the ridgeline where the russian had set up now appeared deserted bob picked up the rifle and used its scope to scan the mountain above if he were solaratov thats what he would have done climbed worked around always trying to get the elevation but he saw nothing there was no snow in the air no sign of disturbance putting the scope down he tried to will himself into a kind of blankness by which his subconscious peripheral vision might note something his front on focused eyes might not and send him a signal of warning but he saw nothing no movement registered on the slopes before him or the flatness beneath he drew back had solaratov gone low tried to get to the house and finish the job doubtful hed be exposed too long and at any moment a shot could take him he rethought it yes he has to come after me his first priority is to eliminate the threat because he is not on a kamikaze mission hes no zealot hes a professional it only makes sense for him if he can escape that means hes got an escape route a fallback route everything he will come he will hunt me bob looked up the slope of the mountain increased until it disappeared into fog which was really cloud solaratov would get up there come down by some magic and shoot down upon him he backed around looking for a place to set up a hide the news was not good the ridge on which he perched like a shelf that traced the jagged contours of the mountain gave out yards ahead or rather it ran into a ravine where a gash had been cut in the mountain a long ragged scar left by some ancient natural cataclysm now it was full of vegetation and rocks all pristine with snow but beyond the gap there was nothing the mountain slope was smooth and bare offering no protection at all he looked up it was too steep to climb at this point though maybe beyond the gap he could engineer some elevation he looked down into a sector of valley the floor was covered with snowhumped trees and brush all bent into extravagant postures and made smooth under the weight of their white burden it was a sculpture garden a winter wonderland a theme park beautiful and grotesque and delicate at once the frail tracery of the lesser branches all bearing their inch of white stuff it looked quite poetic from six hundred yards up but if you got caught down there youd never be able to move out there was really no choice he had to get to the gash and take up a position in the rocks hed get one good shot at solaratov who would probably work his way down from above solaratov would have the advantage of elevation but he wouldnt know where to look hed have to scout and hed have to expose himself when he looked thats when i get him bob thought wishing he believed it then he noticed it had begun to snow flakes cascaded down again fluting and canting in the wind a screen of them dense and unyielding visibility closed in bob didnt like this a bit it was snowing solaratov breathing hard found a trail inside the scruffy vegetation that edged the mountain where the overhanging leaves had cut down on snow accumulation he almost ran skirting the flat of the valley staying off its exposure staying away from the house for now he knew that bob could not see him from any elevation through the snowbearing branches he probably wouldnt even look in the right direction solaratov came around a curve of the valley edged to the treeline and went hunched behind a fallen log that was somehow suspended by its branches the snow fell gently around him out of the gray light there was no sound at all in the world he read the land looking for natural hides where an experienced man would go to ground it was not a difficult problem for the mountainside was largely featureless there with only sparse vegetation to distract the eye in fact the whole little war between them had been distilled to its most nearly abstract two men in white in a white cold world in white mountains of extreme elevation hunting each other going for whatever little edge of experience and luck they could find whoever read the problem better would win it had nothing to do with courage or really even marksmanship it would come down to this one thing who was the better practitioner of the snipers skills he could see a kind of gash in the mountainside ahead of him and realized that his quarry coming around the edge would have no choice but to seek refuge at its top he picked up his binoculars and scanned he could see nothing but the rocks under their packing of snow visibility was not bad though blurred by the falling snow hes up there hes got to be he triggered a laser to the top of the gash bounced it off a rock and read the range in the readout meters known distance upward he did the math quickly and knew where to hold computing in the uphill angle hed shoot from the center of the third mildot that would put him there crudely but close enough and he felt his nearness to the mountain would shield the bullet from the predations of the wind it wouldnt drift laterally he hunted patiently looking for target indicators for some implication that his prey was alive and hiding and had not circled behind him the rocks were everywhere a kind of garden of stone humped in snow he looked for disturbances in the snow for sign of a man whod crawled upending the crust of white but he could not see that for the angle what is his sign what is the sign then he knew the mans breath it will rise like fog maybe just a vapor but it will show it has to show he has to breathe it was the slightest thing was it really there or an optical illusion but no there it was a slight curl through the snow the suggestion of atmospheric density it could be a mans breath leaking out as he huddled motionlessly in the rocks awaiting his prey as he scanned upward yes my friend there you are he thought slowly picking out the pattern of the arctic warfare camouflage snow dappled with a little dead brown vegetation the man was on his belly nestled behind rocks in a little collection of them at the very top of the gash he lay with the snipers professional patience totally engaged totally calm solaratov could not see the rifle but he saw the man there you are he thought there you are he again fired a laser at him exactly meters he had the target he fixed markers in his minds eyea stand of snow laden pinesput the binoculars down raised the rifle and went to the scope of course it was not nearly so powerful as the binocs and its field of vision was much smaller but he found the pines tracked down waited and yes found the little trail of vapor that marked his prey he settled in looking for the target he could see just a half an inch of camouflaged parka above the rock probably the upper surface of the prone back he settled on this target centering it on the third dot should i fire i may not quite have enough of him visible to drive into the bloodbearing inner organs i might just wound him my zero might be way off but then so what i have a suppressor he will not know where i am shooting from he will have to move as i bring him under fire he wont know if im above him or below him hell have to move i can chase him across the ravine hell run out of rocks ill have him he exhaled his breath commanded his senses felt the slow tick and twitch of his body as he made minute corrections waited until the total rightness of it all fell across him the trigger broke and with its odd tiny sound the rifle fired bob lay quietly in the rocks above him a screen of snowy pines shielded him somewhat but left him with a good view of the direction hed come with the most discipline his body could invent he scanned three zones the first was the ridge right where it came around the mountain the next was a crop of rocks perhaps sixty meters above that and the next was a notch in the mountain perhaps two hundred meters up that swam into and out of visibility as the cloud permitted solaratov would appear at one of those places as he came high around the mountain with the idea of shooting downward methodically he moved his eyes between them the first the second the third waiting well i did it he tried to tell himself i got him away from my wife in a little while theyll be here hell come ill get my shot itll be over then but he did not feel particularly good about it all there was no sense of anything except unfinished business and that now all these years later it was his time i die today came the message insistent and powerful this is the day i die hed finally run up against a man who was smarter a better shot had more guts couldnt be many in the world but by god this was one the snow was falling more heavily now it pirouetted downward from the low gray sky and as he looked back to the house still barely visible he could hardly see it it looked like it would snow for hours that was not good the longer it snowed the longer it would take for help to arrive he was on his own he and his ancient enemy where is he it was making him nuts where isa tremendous pain came across his back as though someone had stood over him and whacked him hard with a fireplace poker bob curled in the pain and knew instantly that hed been hit but no shock poured through him and took him out of his brain as it had when hed been hit before instead a powerful spasm of fury kicked through him and he knew in a second that he wasnt hit seriously he drew his legs up and at that moment the odd beowwwwww of a bullet singing off a rock exploded just to his right an inch above his skull hes got me he thought listening as the crack of the bullet snapping the sound barrier arrived but where was the muzzle blast there was no muzzle blast suppressor he thought the motherfucker has a suppressor the sniper could be anywhere bob lay behind his rack of stones waiting no other shot came clearly he was completely zeroed but not quite visible enough for a good body or head shot bob was almost paralyzed no place to run zeroed completely outfoxed completely faked out he tried to run through the possibilities clearly solaratov was not at one of the three places that bob had determined hed gotten around somehow and bob believed him to be below given the one shot that had ricocheted off the stone that shielded his head the round had struck from downslope if solaratov were above him it would be all over the russian had out thought him by descending into the valley and was now shooting upward bob tried to remember what was down there and recalled a little patch of snowpacked forest somewhere the sniper was down there but without a sound signature to locate him he was effectively invisible do something sure but what move crawl he has you if you move he kills you checkmate no moves possible caught in the rocks trapped then he realized that the russian was but a few hundred yards from the house where the undefended women hid after he killed bob it would take him five minutes to finish the job since it would be closerange work he could leave no witnesses it was almost over now the russian could see the man cowering behind the rocks and could sense his fear and rage and the closing in of his possibilities he filled with confidence he had not fired twice but three times the first shot landed about four feet above his target that was the new zero swagger had not even noticed it quickly he dialed in the correction fired again he hit him the next shot barely missed him but he knew he had him it occurred to him to move ever so slightly find a better shooting position and try and drive the killing shot home but he had such an advantage now why worry about it why move not be able to shoot just when the man is so helpless has already been hit is presumably leaking blood and in great pain the rifle rested on the tree trunk he was comfortable behind it sure that he was invisible from the ridge the reticle was steady he knew the range it was merely a matter of time of so little time what can he do he can do nothing bob tried to clear the rattle from his head in the field what would i do call in artillery call in smoke no artillery no smoke throw a grenade no grenade fire the claymore no claymore the claymore was in the case three thousand feet up the mountain he wished he had it now call in a chopper no chopper call in tactical air no tactical air but a word caught somewhere in his mind smoke no smoke it would not go away smoke you move under smoke under smoke he cannot see you there is no smoke why would the word not leave his head why would it not go away smoke what is smoke gaseous chemicals producing a blur of atmospheric disturbance there is no smoke smoke there is nobut there was snow snow agitated could hang in the air like smoke plenty of snow snow all around he turned to his right to face a wall of snow above him on a precipice more snow the snow that had fallen silently through the night and even now glided down from the heavens solaratov loves snow he knows snow but bob saw now that above him several hundred pounds of the stuff rested on the branches of a pine which had turned it into some kind of upsidedown vanilla cone in fact several of the trees were above him the snow fell and caught on them in the gray mountain light he could almost feel them groaning yearning for some kind of freedom he reached out with his rifle barrel but could touch none of it but then the plan formed in his mind he edged to his side making certain to keep his body profile low behind the rocks so that solaratov would not get the last shot free his right hand crept across the parka unzipped it and he reached inside and removed the beretta he steeled himself it was instinct shooting unaimed fire but his reflexes at this arcane pistol skill had always been quite good he threaded his other wrist through the sling of the remington m to secure it for his move he thumbed back the hammer he looked at each of his targets he took a deep breath so do it he thought so do it something was happening a series of dry popping cracks reached solaratovs ears far away but definitely coming off the mountain what he looked hard through the scope not daring to take it from the trapped man he thought he saw a flash the flight of something small through the air a disturbance in the snow and quickly came up with the idea of an automatic pistol but what was he doing trying to signal men in the area who could be in the area but in the next second his question was answered he was shooting into the snowladen pines above him striking their trunks and driving the impact vibrations out their limbs shooting fast so that the vibrations accumulated in their effect and almost astonishingly the snow loads of four pines yielded and slid down the mountain toward the supine man where they hit and exploded into a fine blast of powder a sheet of density that momentarily took his sight picture away from him where is he he put the scope down because he could never find the man in the narrow width of vision and saw him rolling down the mountain a good fifty feet from the commotion hed stirred solaratov brought the rifle up fast but couldnt find the man he was moving so quickly at last he located him and saw that he had gotten a full fifty meters down the hill he picked up the good moving sight picture fired quickly remembering to lead on the moving target but the bullet impacted behind the target kicking up a huge geyser of snow of course the range had changed subtly he was still holding for meters and the range was probably down to six hundred or so by the time he figured this out the man had come to rest in the rocks below and was now much better situated behind them having picked up some maneuverability and the position to shoot back goddamn him he thought with a thud he caught on something taking his breath away he had come to rest in a new nest of rocks fifty meters downslope the snow still hung in the air and in his desperate fallrun it had gotten into his parka and down his neck but in the complete un coordination of the moment he made certain he was behind cover he breathed hard he hurt everywhere but felt warmth pouring down the side of his face and reached up to touch blood had he been hit no the fucking nightvision goggles totally worthless but forgotten in the crisis had slipped down his head crookedly and one strap cut a wicked gash in his ear the cut stung he grabbed the things and had an impulse to toss them away what was the point now but maybe solaratov wasnt sure where he was now nestled behind a slightly wider screen of rocks he looked and saw he had a little more room to move from rock to rock maybe he could even get a shot off but at what and then he saw that the slope dropped off intensely and worse the rocks had run out this is it he thought this is as far as i go what did i get out of it nothing his ear stung theyve moved sally said now theyre behind the house you can hear the shots are over there are we going to be all right asked nikki yes baby julie said holding her daughter close the three were in the cellar of the house and sally had spent the past few minutes jamming old chairs trunks and boxes against the door at the head of the steps just in case someone came looking for them with bad intentions the cellar smelled of mold and faded material and spring floods that had soaked everything some years back it was dirty and dark only meager light coming through snowcovered windows there was one other door to the outside one of those slanted wood things that led down three steps to them sally had piled up more impediments to that passageway but there was no way of really locking the doors they could only forestall things i wish we had a gun said nikki i wish we did too said sally i wish daddy was here said nikki bob had a rare moment of visual freedom a long clean look into the stunted snowcovered trees at the base of the mountain but he could see nothing no movement no hint of disturbance then a bullet sang off the rock an inch beyond his face kicking a puff of granite spray into his eye he fell back stifling a yell and felt the telltale numbness that indicated some kind of trauma but only for a second then it lit into raw harsh but meaningless pain and he winced driving more pain into the eye goddamn him solaratov had seen just the faintest portion of head exposed and he was on it that fast putting a bullet an inch shy of the target an inch at six hundredodd meters could that son of a bitch shoot or what swagger felt his eye puff his lid flare and he closed it sensing the throb of pain he touched the wounded sector of his face blood lots of it from the stone spray but nothing quite serious he blinked opened the eye and saw hazily out of it not blind trapped but not blind not yet the guy was so good no ranging shots he got the range right every single time had bob pinned and eyeballed no goddamn ranging shots solaratov had an odd gift a perfect gift for estimating distance it made the package complete some men had it some didnt some could learn it with experience some couldnt it was in fact the weakest part of swaggers own game his ability to estimate range it had cost him a few shots over the years because he lacked the natural inclination to read distances while possessing in spades all the shooters other natural gifts donny had a gift for it donny could look and tell you automatically but bob was so lame at it hed once spent a fortune on an old barr stroud naval gunfire range finder a complex ancient optical instrument that with its many lenses and calibration gizmos could eventually work the farthest unknown distance into a recognizable quantity some day theyll make em real small he remembered telling donny at one lost moment or other then you wont need a gofer like me donny had said with a laugh and i can sit the next war out yes you can bob had said one war is enough an idea flirted with him from where from donny well from somewhere over the long years but it wasnt solid yet he just felt it beyond the screen of his consciousness unformed like a little bit of asyetunrecognizable melody this guy is so good how can he be so good donny had the answer donny wanted to tell him donny knew up in heaven or wherever he was and donny yearned somehow to tell him tell me he demanded but donny was silent and down below solaratov waited scoping the rocks waiting for just a bit of a sliver of a body part to show so he could nail it and then get on with business he is so good he made great shots he hit dade fellows dead on he hit julie riding at an oblique angle flat out at over eight hundred meters he was just thethat scene replayed in his mind what was odd about it he now saw was how featureless it had been a ridge on a mountain with a wall of rock behind it very little vegetation it had been almost plain almost abstract so so how did he range it there were no guidelines no visual data no known objects visible to make a range estimate only the woman on the horse getting smaller as she got farther away on the oblique how did he know where to hold when her range changed so radically after the first shot he must be a genius he must just have the gift the ability to somehow by the freakish mechanics of the brain to just know donny had that maybe its not so rare but then he knew or rather donny told him reaching across the years you idiot donny whispered hoarsely in his ear dont you see it yet why hes so good its so obvious bob knew then why the man had shot at him as he fell but missed the range had changed he estimated the lead and got it slightly wrong and just missed but once his target was still he knew exactly the range and thats how he could hit julie he knew exactly he solved the distance equation and knew how far she was and where to hold to take her down he has a range finder bob thought the son of a bitch has a range finder solaratov looked at his watch it was just past the light was now gray approaching white a kind of sealedoff pewter kind of weather the snow was falling harder and a little breeze had kicked up tossing and twisting the flakes pummeling as they rotated down the wind got under the crack of his hood where his flesh was sweaty and cut him like a scythe a little chill ran up his spine how long can i wait he wondered nobody was flying in for yet another few hours but maybe they could get in with snowmobiles or plow the highway and get in that way a sudden uncharacteristic uneasiness settled over him he made a list kill the sniper kill the woman kill the witnesses escape into the mountains contact the helo rendezvous an hours worth of work he thought possibly two he kept on the scope the rifle cocked his finger riding the curve of the trigger his mind clear his concentration intense how long can i stay at this level when do i have to blink look away yawn piss think of warmth food a woman he pivoted on the fulcrum of the log running the scope along the ridge of rocks looking for target indicators more breath a shadow out of place some disturbed snow a regular line a trace of movement it would happen it had to for swagger wouldnt be content to wait his nature would compel action and then compel doom he cant see me he doesnt know where i am its just a matter of time he tried to figure out a range finder how do the goddamn things work his old barr stroud was mechanical like a surveyors piece of equipment with gears and lenses thats why it was so heavy it was a combination binocular and adding machine completely impractical but no modern shooter would have such a device too old too heavy too delicate laser it has to work off a laser it has to shoot a laser to an object measure the time and make a sure swift calculation off of that lasers were everywhere they used them to guide bombs aim guns operate on the eye remove tattoos imitate fireworks but what kind of laser was this one off the visible spectrum since it projected no beam no red dot ultraviolet infrared how could it be brought into the visible spectrum its a kind of light how do i see it one idea light being heat if he could get solaratov to project it through an ice mist its heat would burn tracks in the snow then he could shoot back down the tracks and but that was absurd besides involving setting up some complex linkage of actions any one of which could catch him a mm magnum through the lungs he didnt even know if it would work idea two get solaratov to shoot the laser through a piece of ice it would bend and send back some faulty reading he would over or under compensate miss and insane unworkable think think goddammit how do i see it and then it occurred to him would i see it on night vision would i see it in my goggles would they register it he picked them up where they lay half in half out of the snow slid the harness over his skull pulled the goggles down and snapped them on they yielded a green dense landscape as if the world had ended in water the seas had risen green was everywhere nothing else was clear how can i get him to lase me again he knew he had to move one more time change the range solaratov would go to his laser range finder if it works itll be like a neon sign in the green saying i am the sniper now something was happening he saw puffs of breath rising above a certain accumulation of boulders signifying some kind of physical exertion he watched and one of the rocks seemed somehow to tremble is he moving the rock why would he move the rock but in the same second as he steadied himself as the rock wobbled truly erratically seemed to pause and then tumbled ever so majestically forward pulling a score of smaller rocks with it uncurling a shroud of snow as it fell he knew hes trying to bury me solaratov thought hes trying to start an avalanche to send tons of snow down the mountain and bury me but it wasnt going to work avalanche snow solaratov knew was old snow its structure eroded by melt its moisture mostly evaporated so that it was dry and treacherous a network of unsafe stresses and fault lines then and only then could a single fracture cut out its underpinnings and send it crashing down this avalanche would never go anywhere the snow was too wet and new it might fly a bit but it wouldnt build it would peter out a few hundred yards down on top of that clearly the man didnt even know where he was even now as the rocks and their screen of snow tumbled abortively down the hill not picking up energy but losing it they were on no course toward himself but more or less to the right about one hundred yards the falling snow simply could not reach him he almost chuckled at the futility of it remembering that his quarry was a jungle fighter not a man of the mountains the rocks tumbled trailing snow but down the slope where the angle flattened they lost their energy and rolled to a halt solaratov watched them tumble then brought the rifle back to bear on the original line of rocks as he was shifting it upward he thought he made out a white shape sloshing desperately through the snow he rose above it came back could not quite find it and then did track it quickly but never quite got the fraction of line between third and fourth mildots precisely on it he saw that swagger had moved literally floundering his way downhill to this new position so he was a few dozen meters closer now he had less maneuverability what possible difference did it make he had made his last mistake the game solaratov thought is almost over he put down his rifle picked up the binoculars and prepared to shoot a laser just to verify the distance to the new position bob came to the halted rocks and hit them with a whack but couldnt stop to acknowledge the pain instead he pulled himself up put his head and shoulders over the top flicked the nightvision goggles down as he snapped them on and peered desperately into the void he knew he was violating every rule in us marine corps sniping fmfmb which tells snipers never ever to look over an obstacle for that makes you too obvious to counterfire no you drop to your haunches and look around it but he didnt have the time there was no definition in the green murk no shape no depth nothing but flat vaguely phosphorescent green he scanned registered this nothingness but was too intense to feel much in the way of despair even if he knew he was hung out over the lip of the rock and that solaratov could take him in an instant he waited a second then another finally a third yanked by like trains slowed by the sludgy blood his heart pumped nothing maybe the laser wasnt visible in the spectrum of the goggles who knew of such stuff maybe the laser ranging device was part of some advanced scope he knew nothing about and it would announce itself but be followed in another nanosecond by close to footpounds of remington mm magnum arriving to erase him from the earth maybe hes not there maybe hes moved hes working his way up another slope hes flanked me and now hes just taking his time two more seconds dribbled by each encapsulating a lifetime until bob knew he could wait no longer and as he began to duck back into a world of zero possibility here it came at last the yellow streak was like a crack in the wall of the universe it pinged right at him from nothingness and lasted but an instant but there it was a straight line as the shooter below measured the distance to the shooter above bob locked the source of the brief beam into his muscle memory and his sense of time and space he could not move a muscle an atom he could not disturb the rigidity of his body for it all depended on holding that invisible point before himself in the infinity of his mind as he brought the rifle up in one smooth whipping motion and in to his shoulder and did not move his head to find the scope but moved the scope to that precise lock of his vision the scope flew before him and he saw nothing even as his hands locked around the pistol grip and his finger found the curve of the trigger caressed its delicacy felt and loved its tension and sought to be one with it he felt no tension not now here was the rest of his life here was everything and as he flung away the goggles with a toss of his head here was his ancient enemy bob saw the sniper swaddled behind a horizontal trunk his shape barely recognizable in the swirl of pewtertowhite dappling of the snow and his arctic warfare camouflaging only the line of the rifle rising as it came toward bob hard and regular so many years he thought as he closed his focus down until he saw only the harsh cruciform of the reticle made a slight correction to shoot lower to compensate for the downward angle and then without willing it as the reticle became such a statement of clarity it seemed to fill the whole universe the trigger went and he fired you never hear the one that gets you solaratov was on his target racing through the excitement of knowing that at long last he had him but he hesitated for just a second to compute the new range and then he realized that the man above was aimedincrediblyat him he felt no pain only shock he seemed to be in the center of an explosion then time stopped he was briefly removed from the universe and when he was reinserted into it he was not an armed man with a rifle boring in on a target but a supine man in the cold snow amid a splatter of blood his own breath spurted out raggedly white cloud and red spray sending broken signals upward someone was drunkenly playing a broken accordion or a damaged pipe organ nearby the music had no melody was only a whine with a slight edge or buzz to it sucking chest wound left side left lung gone blood pouring out both exit and entrance wounds blood everywhere internal damage total death near death coming death at last his old friend come to pick him up he blinked disbelieving and wondered at the alchemy by which such a result could have been engineered his life flashed and fled dissolved in a blur went away and came back he thought im gone he wondered if he had the strength to gather the rifle find a position and wait for the man until he bled to death but the man would not be foolish he thought next of how the mission had redefined itself to kill the man who had killed him meant nothing there was no escape the only option left was failure or success he pulled himself up saw the house five hundred yards away through the snowy trees and felt he could make it he could make it for the shooter would now lay low unsure as to whether or not the sniper was dead he could make it to the house get in and with that little glock pistol finish the job that had killed him that would be his legacy in the world he finished the last job he did it he was successful finding the strength somewhere amazed at how clear it all seemed he headed off bleeding in a winter wonderland swagger lay close to the rock for a minute or so recalling the sight picture the reticle swollen in the intensity of his focus so that it was big and bold as a fist held low on the covering tree because you hold low when shooting downward so that the bullet would hit center chest a nice big target but its tricky the rifle was zeroed for five hundred yards according to his shooters instructions but maybe the man who zeroed it held it slightly differently than he did maybe there was a twig a branch slightly unresolved in the x power of the scope maybe there was a wind he didnt feel a sierra blowing around the contour of the mountain but the sight picture was as perfect as it could be it was held where it should be held and if he had to call the shot hed call it a hit he edged around the right squinting out he tried to find the shooting site of his enemy but it was much harder to see from this angle instead he scanned back and forth in what he determined was the proper sector and saw nothing no movement no anything he finally found the fallen tree he was convinced had supported his enemy but there was no sign of him there was no sign of disturbance in the snow a spot a little farther back could have been blood but it was impossible to tell it could also have been a black stone a broken limb he lowered the rifle slipped down the nightscope lenses and watched in the murk for a while it stayed green uncut by the flick of a laser did i hit him is he dead how much time should i give him a dozen scenarios instantly occurred to him maybe solaratov had moved to a fallback position maybe he had moved laterally maybe he was even advancing on him he might even be headed now toward the house certain he had bob trapped that last seemed the most logical after all the job was to hit the woman not swagger swaggers death had no real meaning julies had all the meaning and if he were seen hed kill witnesses too bob took a deep breath then he pushed himself up scuttled down a few yards turned angles obliquely dodged jumped found cover he tried to make himself difficult to hit knowing he could not make himself impossible to hit but no shot came from his new cover his angle was lower so his view of the valley was less distinct he could only see a bit of the flatland through the snowy trees and could see nothing moving on it approaching the house but his target would be camouflaged moving at angles dropping easily evading him his heart was beating rapidly there was no breath left in his lungs the planet seemed scorched dry of oxygen he pulled himself out and moved at the assault again he fell twice in the snow and almost blacked out the second time and when he looked up the house seemed no closer his mind raced it would not stay where he put it he thought of sight pictures of men going limp against reticles of long stalks in mountains and jungles and cities he had hunted in them all and been victorious in them all he thought of the crawl with the sandbag the long slow crawl outside the american fort and the earlier moment when they had him and then the large black plane like a vulture hung in the air for just a split second before its guns pulverized the universe he thought of the times hed been hit over the years it amounted to no less than twentytwo wounds though two were blade wounds one inflicted by an angolan one by a mujahideen woman he thought of thirst fear hunger discomfort he thought of rifles he thought of the past and the future which was running out quickly he rose the last time and stumbled through the snow which fought him it was not cold the snow still fell harder now in swirls and pinwheels dancing in the wind the heavy damp flakes of eastern european cities where am i what has happened why has it happened but then he was at the house all was silent he bent to the storm cellar door pulled hard even as he reached inside his coat and drew out the glock pistol a nail seemed to hold him back he felt the door want to yield but hang up he pulled harder finding strength somewhere in the backwash of his mind and with a crack the nail gave and he pulled the door open it revealed three cement steps down into a dark entrance that looked jammed with clutter he slid by the door and stepped down into the darkness aware only marginally that he had made it he felt cleareyed suddenly recommitted to his purpose certain of what he must do he kicked his way through the impediments a sawhorse a bicycle bed springs boxes of old newspapers and as he got through he felt the door slam shut behind him sealing him off in the darkness he took another step kicking things aside looking and waiting for his vision to clear he smelled moisture mildew rot old leather and paper decaying material ancient wood then he could see them they were over against the far wall huddled under the steps two women and a girl clutching each other crying swagger made it into the treeline this is where he needed a pistol a short handy fastfiring weapon with a lot of firepower but the beretta was somewhere up the mountain buried under a ton of snow he carried the rifle like a submachine gun in the low assault position poking through the woods as he closed from the flank on the snipers hide he paused waiting listening there was no sound no sense of life at all in the haunted place branches and bushes distended by heavy moist fresh snow stood out in extravagant shapes like a display of modern art through the gray the snow fell swirling bobs breath rose above him then parted he advanced slowly if the sniper was here he was well hidden completely disciplined he could see the fallen tree and then made out the disturbance in the snow where the man had supported himself while shooting upward bob slid as silently as he could on the oblique through the heavy trees trying to shake no snow loose and at last came to the site paused a second then stepped behind the cover to put his rifle muzzle on the man but nobody was there he heard only his own harsh breath heaving in the cold the blood told the story solaratov had been hit bad his rifle lay in the snow the ranging binoculars were there too a raspberry sherbet marked where hed bled most profusely driven to the ground by the impact of the got him bob thought but the moment of exultation never fully developed for in the next seconds he read the tracks and the blood trail and saw that the man seriously wounded but nothing like dead had moved back through the trees toward the house at that moment he heard a bang which could have been a shot but it wasnt he turned and saw through the trees the house and a little puff of flung snow that helped identify the sound it had been the sound of a heavy cellar door closing and when it had slammed shut it had vibrated free a cloud of snow hes in there with my family bob thought he had a rooted moment of terror it felt like ice sliding down through his body smooth and unbearably cold numbing all the organs it brushed as it rushed through him but some part of his brain refused to panic and he saw what he must do he raced to pick up the remington magnum for the three hundred extra feet of velocity and the five hundred extra pounds of energy and throwing aside his parka ran ran like a fool on fire or in love not toward the house which was too far but for a good straightin angle on the door they heard the door creak as someone tried to pull on it oh god said sally over here instructed julie she grabbed her daughter and with the younger woman they fled to the back of the cellar but only as far as the brick wall there was no escape for the stairwell up was jammed with junk to keep the same man out they fell back and cowered when the door cracked open then was yanked wide filling the dark space with light destroying their adjusted vision he lumbered wheezily down the steps kicking the junk aside like an enraged drunken father home late from a night with the boys come home to beat his wife it stirred something deep in julie a memory of dread long buried never examined the cellar door slammed behind him and he kicked more stuff aside until he came into the center of the room he blinked waiting for his eyes to adjust but he was everything they could possibly fear a muscular gray savage dressed in white except that a profuse smear of blood had irrigated a raggedy delta from a source on his chest leaking down to his trousers and his boots he had a gray blunt face a crew cut and wintry little eyes he smiled madly and blood showed on his teeth he coughed and it erupted from his mouth he seemed barely conscious seemed almost to fall but he stopped caught himself and looked at them fiercely he was insane with pain his eyes lit weirdly his whole body trembling the gun muzzle played across them all she stepped out the killer laughed for some strange reason and another spurt of blood came from his mouth down to splash on his chest his lungs were full of blood he was drowning in it why wouldnt he fall he lifted the pistol until it pointed into her face julie heard her baby crying heard the intake of sallys breath and thought of her husband and the man shed loved before the only two men she could ever love she closed her eyes but he did not fire she opened them he had fallen halfway but then he pulled himself up and thrust the gun at her his eyes filling with mad determination bob ran until he had a good angle into the door hell stop he has to wait for his eyes to adjust he saw it the man would step into the darkness and pause as his eyes adjusted hed be there just beyond the door for the length of time it took his pupils to adjust with solaratov that interval would be a second or so he dropped to one knee braced the rifle on his leg found the good shooting position it was five hundred yards if it was an inch but that had to be the zero on the rifle for solaratov had come so close to him so often without thinking he wrapped the sling tight about his left supporting arm as he slipped into a good marine corps position feeling a bite of pain from the opened wound but leaning through it he took three breaths building up his oxygen and looked for his natural point of aim as something in him screamed faster faster and another part cooed slower slower he laid the crosshairs deadcenter on the door just a patch of gray wood smeared with snow and prayed for the extra oomph of the mm to do its thing he had one moment of clarity and at the subliminal level willed all he knew of shooting into the effort the relaxation of the finger trained over the hard years the discipline of the respiratory cycle and the rhythm of deeper and shallower exhalation the cooperation of rods and cones in the back wall of the eye the orchestration of pupil eye and lens and the overall guidance and wisdom of the retina but most of all that deep willed plunge into stillness where the world is gray and almost gone yet at the same time sharp and clear nothing matters the man coached himself when things mattered most and then it was gone as the rifle fired kicked against him blowing the sight picture to nothing but blur and when he came back on target he saw a mushroom of snow mist floating from the vibes where the bullet had blasted through the wood the pistol settled down she saw the hugeness of its bore just feet away from her and then feltsplatter in her face a sense of mist or fog suddenly filling the air a meaty vapor mixed into this sensation was a sound which was that of wood splitting in it too was a grunt almost involuntary as if lungs gurgled somehow human she found herself wet with droplets that proved to be warm and heavy blood the sniper transfigured before her what had been the upper quadrant of his face had somehow been pulped ripped open revealing a terrible wound of splintered bone and spurting blood one eye looked dead as a nickle the other was gone in the mess even as these details were fixing themselves in her memory he fell sideways with a thump his head banging on the cement floor exposing the ragged entry wound in the corresponding rear quadrant of the skull where the bones now seemed broken and frail a single light beam came through the cellar door where the bullet had passed she looked down saw the stumpy little man fallen like a white angel into a red pool as his satiny blood spread ever wider from his ruined face she turned to her daughter and her friend who regarded her with mouths agape and horror more than relief registering in both their eyes then she spoke with perfect deliberation daddys home chapter fortynine he had not fired a second time because he had no more ammunition but in another second the cellar door had been flung open and he recognized sally leaping to signal him that it was over by the time bob got to the house three air force hueys and a state police helicopter had landed and more were on their way then another air force job a big blackhawk arrived and disgorged still more staff it almost looked like an advanced firebase when the war was at its hottest the way the choppers kept ferrying people in he got the news immediately everybody was all right though medics were attending them the sniper was dead his own wounds were tended an emergency technician re sewed with anesthetic the gash in his thigh that had opened up under the pressure of all the moving and jumping and then picked stone and bullet fragments out of his face and eye for half an hour before disinfecting then covering the raw cuts with gauze nothing appeared to have hit the eye proper more shooters luck there was little to be done about the back wound it had penetrated his camouflage and grazed the flesh of his back scoring both burn and bruise but other than disinfectant only time and painkillers would make it go away a cop wanted to take a statement but bonson pulled rank and declared the ranch a federal crime site until corroborating fbi agents could chopper in within the hour from boise in the cellar a state police crime team worked the body of the dead sniper hit twice once through the left lung once in the back of the head great shooting said a cop you want to take a look at your handiwork but swagger had no desire to see the fallen man what good would it do he felt nothing except that hed seen enough corpses id rather see my daughter and my wife he said well your wife is being treated by our medical people weve got to debrief her as soon as possible mrs memphis is with nikki can i go theyre in the kitchen he walked through a strange house full of strangers people talked on radios and computers had been set up a squad of uninteresting young people hung about talking shop clearly agitated at the prospect of a big treat he remembered when agency people were all exfbi men beefy cop types who carried swedish ks and liked to talk about pegging gooks these boys and girls looked like they belonged in prep school but they sure made themselves at home with the instant insouciance of the young he walked through them and they parted and he could feel their wonder what would they make of him his kind of war was so far from their kind it probably made no sense he found sally in the kitchen and next to her there was his baby girl these were the moments worth living for now he knew why he bothered to survive vietnam hi baby oh daddy she said her eyes widening with deep pleasure he felt a warmth in his heart so intense he might melt his child through it all after it all his own flesh blood brains she flew to him and he absorbed her tininess felt her vitality as he picked her up and hugged her passionately oh you sweet thing he sang you are the sweetest thing there is oh daddy they say you shot the bad man he laughed you never mind that how are you hows mommy im fine im fine it was scary he came into the basement with a gun well he wont bother you no nevermore all right she clung to him sally fixed him with her usual gimlet eye bob swagger she said you are a mean and ornery piece of work and you arent much of a husband or a father but by god you do have a gift for the heroic i can see youre still my biggest fan sally he said well anyhow thanks for hanging around it sure was interesting how are you my back hurts he said so does my leg and my eye i am plenty hungry and therere too goddamned many young people out there i hate young people how is she shes fine were all fine nobody was hurt but only just barely another tenth of a second and he would have pulled that trigger well to hell with him if he cant take a joke ill leave you two alone see if you can get one of these harvard kids to fix some coffee they probably dont do coffee and there isnt a starbucks around but ill see what i can manage and so he sat with his baby daughter in the kitchen and caught up on the news and told her about the superficiality of his wounds and made a promise he hoped hed now be able to keep to return with her and her mother to arizona and resume the good life they had together in half an hour a young man came to him mr swagger yes were going to have to debrief your wife now shes asked that you be present all right shes very insistent she wont talk unless youre there sure shes spooked this way sir sally came back to take care of nikki sweetie he said to his daughter im going to go with these people to talk to mommy you stay here with aunt sally daddy she gave him a last hug and he now saw how deeply shed been traumatized the war had come to her shed seen what few americans ever saw anymorecombat death the power of the bullet on flesh sweetie ill be back then thisll be over itll be fine youll see they took him upstairs the agency team had set up in a bedroom pushing aside the bed and dresser and installing a sofa from the living room and a group of chairs cleverly they werent arranged before the sofa as if to seat an audience but rather in a semicircle as if in a group counseling session taperecording equipment had been installed and computer terminals the room was crowded and hushed but finally he saw her he walked through the milling analysts and agents and found her sitting alone on the sofa she looked composed now though her arm was still locked in its cast shed insisted on dressing and wore some jeans and a sweatshirt and her boots she had a can of diet coke well hello there he said well hello yourself she said with a smile youre okay they say well its a little bothersome when a russian comes into your house and points a gun at you and then your husband blows half his head away im damn lucky to have a husband who could do such a thing oh im such a big hero sweetie i just pulled a trigger oh baby he held her tight and it was fine his wife hed slept next to her for years now the same strong tough beautifull woman about as good as they made them her smell was achingly familiar strawberries she smelled of strawberries always he first saw her in a picture wrapped in cellophane that came from a young marines boonie hat the rain was falling there was a war he fell in love with her then and never came close to falling out in all the years since where did you come from she said how did you get here so fast they didnt tell you damn idiot me i got me a new hobby i parachuted through the storm pretty exciting oh bob i never been so scared in my life if id had clean underwear id have pissed in the ones i was wearing only i didnt have no clean underwear oh bob well talk about all that stuff thats up ahead what in hell is this all about she finally asked he came for met thats what these people say yeah it has to do with something that happened a long time ago i have it half figured these geniuses think they know all the answers or they can figure them you up to this yes i just want it over then well get it all straightened out i swear to you i know bonson bonson came over shes ready thats terrific mrs swagger well try and make this as easy as possible are you comfortable do you want anything another coke no im fine i want my husband here thats all thats fine okay people bonson said in a louder voice were all set the debriefing can begin he turned back to her i have two lead analysts wholl run this theyre both psychologists just relax take your time youre under no pressure of any sort this is not adversarial and it has no legal standing its not an interrogation in fact well probably share things with you that you are not security cleared to hear but thats all right we want this to be easy for you and for you not to sense reluctance or authority or power or discretion on our part if you can try and think of us as your friends not your government should i salute she said bonson laughed no nor will we be playing the national anthem or waving any flags its just a chat between friends now let us set up things for you so you have some idea of a context in which this inquiry is taking place and why your information is so vital sure it began the crowd settled the kids obediently found chairs and julie sat relaxed on the couch there were no harsh lights one of the questioners cleared his throat and began to speak mrs swagger for reasons as yet unclear to us factions within russia have sent an extremely competent professional assassin to this country to kill you thats extraordinarily venturesome even for them you probably wonder why and so do we so in the past seventytwo hours weve been poring through old records trying to find something that you might know that would make your death important to someone over there may i begin by assuming you have no idea nothing ive never talked knowingly to a russian in my life yes maam but weve put this into a larger pattern it seems that three other people in your circle in the year were also killed under circumstances that suggest possible soviet or russian involvement one is your first husband julie gasped involuntarily this may be painful bonson said bob touched her shoulder its all right she said the young man continued your husband donny fenn killed in the republic of south vietnam may another was a young man who was active with you in the peace movement named peter farris discovered dead with a broken neck october dead for several months at the time and the third was another peace demonstrator of some renown named thomas charles trig carter iii killed in a bomb blast at the university of wisconsin may i knew peter he was so harmless i only met trig once twice actually hmmmm can you think of a specific circumstance that united the four of you marine peace demonstrators we were all involved in one of the last big demonstrations may day of that year the three of us as demonstrators donny as a marine julie said bonson were thinking less of an ideological unification here and more of a specific geographic one a time a place not an idea and a private place too the farm she finally said there was no sound finally bonson prompted her the farm he said donny was distraught over an assignment hed been asked to do bob looked at bonson and saw nothing just the face of a smooth professional actor in the role of concerned intelligence executive no flicker of emotion grief doubt regrets nothing bonson didnt even blink and julie remembering nothing of him and his role in what had happened went on he believed this trig of whom he thought so highly might have some idea what he should do with his ethical dilemma we went to trigs house in dc but he wasnt there donny remembered that he was going out to a farm near germantown i think peter may have followed us peter thought he was in love with me what did you see on that farm asked the young analyst she laughed nothing nothing at all what can have been so important about it wed like to know there was a man an irishman named fitzpatrick he and trig were loading fertilizer into a van it was very late at night how clearly did you see him very i was just out of the light maybe fifteen twentyfive feet away i dont think he ever saw me donny for some reason wanted me to stay back so he and trig and this fitzpatrick talked for a few minutes then fitzpatrick left then donny and trig talked some more and finally hugged then we left there was some kind of agent in the hills he got our picturedonnys and mineas we drove away donnys mostly i was ducking and thats it thats it do you remember fitzpatrick i suppose do you think youd be able to describe no said bonson go straight to the pictures mrs swagger wed like to have you look at some pictures theyre pictures of a variety of politicians espionage agents lawyers scientists military mostly in the old eastern bloc but some are genuinely irish some english some french theyre all in their forties or fifties so youll have to imagine them as theyd have been in yes she said just take your time one of the kids walked across the room and handed her a sheaf of photographs she flipped through them slowly stopping now and then to sip on her coke can could i have another coke she asked at one time somebody raced out bob watched as the gray firm faces slid by men possibly his own age or older most of them dynamic in appearance with square ruddy faces lots of hair the unmistakable imprint of success they were hunting for a mole he realized they thought that somehowwas this bonsons madnessthis fitzpatrick had implanted someone in the fabric of the west prosperous and powerful but that his heart still belonged to the east or what remained of it if they could solve the mystery of fitzpatrick they could solve the mystery of the mole bob felt an odd twist of bitterness that war the cold one it really had nothing to do with the little hot dirty one that had consumed so many men he had known and so wantonly destroyed his generation wholl stop the rain it wasnt even about the rain no she said hes not here im sorry okay lets go to the citizens another file of photos was provided take your time said one of the de briefers remember hell be heavier balder he may have facial hair he mel i think julie understands that said bonson julie was quiet she nipped through the pictures now and then pausing but another pile disappeared without a moment of recognition another pile was brought this time designated security nationals she had a possible but paused and then it too went to the discards though into a separate category of almosts but then finally there were no more pictures im sorry she said the disappointment in the room was palpable okay bonson finally said lets knock off for a while julie why dont you take a break maybe a walk stretch your legs well have to do it the hard way what does that mean she asked drugs torture no well get you together with a forensic artist hell draft a drawing from your instructions well get our computers to run a much wider comparison on a much wider database mel be sure to get the almosts too have mr jefferson factor those in too thatll get us another bunch of candidates weve got food would you care for some lunch or a nap or something im fine i think id like to check on my daughter she and bob walked downstairs and found nikkiasleep she was stretched across sallys lap snoozing gently pinning sally with her fragile weight i cant even get up said sally ill take her no thats okay these child geniuses got the cable running the remote even works now it didnt see she held up the little device and punched a few buttons and the picture flicked across the channels lifetime cnn idaho public tv hbo the discovery channel espn cnn headline newsmy god said julie oh my god what bob said and from around the house others looked in came to check thats him said julie my god yes fatter now healthier yes thats him thats fitzpatrick she was pointing at the television where a powerful dynamic man was giving an impromptu news conference in a european city jesus said one of the kids thats evgeny pashin the next president of russia the second meeting was smaller more informal it was after lunch prepared in an air force mess tent set up outside the house surprisingly good nourishing food too more to the point someone had come up with a nice batch of disney videos for nikki that is when she got back from a sledding diversion with three state troopers now julie and bob sat upstairs with a much smaller contingent the inner circle as it were julie said bonson were going to discuss the meaning of this right here before you and your husband thats because i want you on the inside now not on the outside im drawing the two of you in youre not civilians i want you to feel like youre part of the team you will in fact both be paid as agency consultants we pay well youll see fine she said we could use the money now im not even going to ask you if youre sure i know youre sure but i have to say this guy has been on tv a lot lately can you explain why its only now that you recognize him mr bonson have you ever been a mother there was some laughter no he admitted have you ever been the wife to a somewhat melancholy yet incredibly heroic man particularly as hes feeling his life has been taken from him by some unnecessary publicity and we had to move from one location to another no no i havent said bonson well i was both simultaneously does that suggest to you why i wasnt watching much tv yes it does now today you take me back you force me to think about faces i pick several faces that are somewhat similar in structure to his im working on recreating that face in my own mind do you see yes the points are all well made bonson said well then lets throw it open for general discussion can someone tell me what possible meaning this has sir i think i can explain the sequencing go ahead said bonson in four people saw pashin operating undercover in this country as this fitzpatrick that is really interfaced with him in commission of his duties three were eliminated quickly but they had no id on the fourth and as i recollect according to official marine corps records mrs swaggers first marriage to donny fenn was unrecorded thats right said julie i received no benefits it didnt matter to me i didnt want anything to do with the marine corps although i ended up marrying it but continued the analyst they have a bad picture of her the one they got at the farm they cant id it it haunts them over the years the decades pass sovun breaks up pashin is no longer gru hes part of pamyat the nationalist party he begins his political career hes handsome heroic the brother of a martyred nationalist hero has lots of mafia backing hes scaring the oldline commies hes within a few weeks of winning an election and control of twenty thousand nukes then two months ago a picture of bob lee swagger appears in the national star and subsequently in time and newsweek who call him americas most violent man if you recall it was a picture snapped by a star photographer of bob coming out of church in arizona with his wife her picture appears in the national media and it contains the information that bob is married to his spotters widow donnys widow the woman who got away whos been haunting them all these years the last survivor of that night on the farm suddenly it becomes clear to pamyat and all the interests betting on pashin that one witness from his undercover days still exists and can still put him on that farm all right so from that point on they have to take her out and her husbands gaudy past certainly provides a kind of pretext thats sequencing said bonson fine good it makes sense its a theory that fits but still why ah he was involved with a famous peace demonstrator in blowing up a building so well bonson argued savagely trying to compel the young man to a next leap its widely known he had an intelligence background its known in some circumstances that the peace movement had some east bloc involvement actually that might help his candidacy in todays russia i dont understand why the same security mandates would be operational twentyseven years later they were protecting assets then what can they be protecting now ideas anybody none of the senior people had any well then were sort of stuck arent we said bonson its very interesting but we still dont should i explain it to you now or do you want to yammer on a bit asked bob you aint got it yet bonson said bob you still bought into the cover story you still look at the cover story and you dont see the real story and all your smart boys too well sergeant said bonson evenly then go ahead you explain the real story i will you missed the big news there was a bomb explosion at the university of wisconsin may all right a kid named trig carter blew himself up protesting the war in vietnam maybe most of you are too young to remember it but i do he gave his life to peace he was a rich kid could have had anything but he gave his life up for his ideals they even wrote books about him he may have been brave too i dont know but the one name you wont find in that book or in any other books about the peace movement or the history of our country in is the name ralph goldstein anybody here recognize it there was silence in the room thats the big story ralph goldstein was the doctoral student who was killed that night in the university of wisconsin math center jewish boy twentyseven married from skokie illinois went to the university of illinois chicago circle campus not a very impressive school compared to the fancy schools where trig carter went he didnt know nobody he just did his work and tried to get his degree and do his research smart as a whip but very obscure never went to no demonstrations smoked no dope got no free love or nothing i did something nobody has yet done i went and talked to his son now himself a very bright kid i hope nobody dont blow him up he could feel their eyes on him he cracked a little smile all the pointy heads listening to him but ralph goldstein had published a paper in duke higher mathematics quarterly which he called certain higher algorhythmic functions of topographical form reading in orbital applications dont mean a thing to me but guess what we now got about satellites in orbit watching the world because ralph goldstein figured out the math of it he was only a grad student and he himself didnt even know it but hed been picked to join the staff at the satellite committee at the johns hopkins advanced physics lab in maryland where they did all the highpower number crunching that made the satellite program possible okay so what his death meant practically was it took us three extra years to get terrainrecognition birds in the air if it matters thats three years where the sovs upgraded their own satellite program and closed a gap in the cold war thats three more years that kept them in the race which one of you geniuses or experts can tell me which part of soviet staff was responsible for strategic warfare gru came the reply thats right and what was pashin gru thats right so guess what his job wasnt to stop the war in vietnam he didnt give a shit about the war in vietnam or about trig carter or about nothing it was to kill a little jewish guy in an office in madison wisconsin who was just about to put the americans way ahead in the cold war kill him in such a way that no one would ever in a hundred years think it had to do with the russians kill him in such a way that no one would even think about his death but only about the death of the man who killed him to make him an extra in his own murder that was pashins mission it was straight gru wet work a murder job trig carter and the peace movement were just part of the props he could hear them breathing heavily in the room but no one spoke and dont you see the cynicism in it the goddamned motherfucking brilliance they knew this country so goddamn well they just knew that when any of you ivy league heroes looked at that data you couldnt see past trig because no matter which side he was on he was one of you that would be the tragedy and the fog it would release in your little pea fucking brains would keep you from ever figuring it out it takes an outsider someone who aint been to no college and doesnt think the word harvard or yale means shit in this world it takes gutter trash rednecks who you all pay to do the dirty work with the rifles so you can sit in your clubs and make ironic little jokes or plan your little wars that the swaggers and the fenns and the goldsteins have to go fight the silence lasted for a long moment then finally bonson spoke class anger aside does this make any sense to you skull and bones boys it took a while but finally someone said almost laconically yeah it makes perfect sense it even explains why its happening now it puts them in a desperate situation theythats pamyat the old gru security bunch hiding behind nationalism and financed by mob moneyhave to keep this information quiet they couldnt take a chance that just as hes closing in on the presidency their man is revealed as a murderer of american nationals on american soil that would make it impossible for him to work with any american president or with big american corporations that information has to be buried at all costs their lives their futures their party depend on it they had to eliminate the last witness particularly as pashins fame is getting bigger and bigger sir said someone else i think we could game out some very interesting tactical deployment for this information we might have a hand ourselves in determining who their next president is okay said bonson you game it out but i want it going in one direction i want to kill this motherfucker part iv back to the world the present chapter fifty the snow didnt last it melted on the third day after it had fallen causing floods in the lowlands closing roads wrecking bridges creating mud slides but on upper cedar creek it was a serene day with blue skies eastern zephyrs and creeks full of sparkling water the pines shed their cloak of snow the grass began to emerge green and lush and seemingly undamaged by the ordeal by now the excitement was over bonson had departed with a handshake the previous morning after ensuring that a quickly convened custer county grand jury found no culpability in the death by misadventure of one frank vborny of cleveland ohio as the fake identification documents read in the dead snipers pocket ballistics confirmed that indeed mr vbomy had shot and killed two innocent people in the custer county idaho bell substation in mackay obviously a berserker he next attacked a house that was luckily rented out by a gun owner who was able to defend himself the gun owners name was never published but that was all right and in idaho most people took satisfaction from the moral purity of the episode and its subtle endorsement of the great old second amendment a lesson most westerners felt had been forgotten in the east up in the mountains the state police had pulled out the helicopters and all the young men and women had gone back to wherever it was they came from and there was little sign that theyd been there bob and julie had a check in the odd sum of and had no idea how that exact figure had been selected it was from the department of the treasury and the invoice banally read consultancy with the proper dates listed and his social security number the last of the security team left the rifle and recovered beretta were returned the foam case with its cargo marked officially as operational loss and sally had taken nikki for a walk down to the mailbox on route when he at last had an opportunity to talk to his wife well howdy he said hi she said doctors had examined her after her ordeal she was in fine shape her collarbone knitting properly she seemed much stronger now and was able to get about better sally would soon be leaving well i have some things to say care to have a listen yes you know we have some money now id like to git on back to arizona and restart the business joe lopez says they seem to miss me down there it was a good business and a good life it was a good life i went a little crazy there i put everybody through a lot i wasnt very grownup about my troubles thats all in the past now and what i learned was how important my family was i want my family back thats the only thing i want no more adventures no more screwing around thats all finished it wasnt your fault she said it had nothing to do with you it was all about me how could i blame you for anything you saved all now now he said no need for that i thought all this out i just want the old life back i want you to be my wife i want my baby girl to be fine i want to work with the horses and take care of yall thats the best life there is the only life ive ever wanted i get these bad moods or i used to i hope im over that if i had some ghosts they aint walking out of the cemetery no more so well what do you say will you let me come back i already called the lawyer he recalled the separation request thats great itll be good she said i think we should use some of that money and go on a nice vacation we should close up the house here the house outside of boise but then go to some warm island for two weeks then we can go back to arizona rr god does that sound like a plan to me he said with a smile theres only one last little thing trigs mother she was very helpful and she told me that if i ever learned anything about the way her son died i should tell her tell her the truth i still feel that obligation so in a couple of months or so when all this dies down when were back i may take a bit of time and head back there to baltimore do you want us to come with you oh it aint worth it ill just fly in rent a car fly back itll be over quicker n you can believe no sense putting no trouble to it or taking nikki away from her riding hell i may drive instead of flying save some money that way he smiled for just a second she thought there might be something in his eyes some vagrant thought some evidence of another idea another agenda but no not a thing could be seen they were depthless and gray and revealed nothing except the love he felt for her little by little life for the swagger family reassembled itself toward some model of normality even the big news of a spectacular murder in russia failed to make much of a stir bob just watched a little of it on cnn saw the burning jeep cherokee and the dead man in the back and when the hysterical analysts came on to explain it all he changed channels sally stayed until they moved back to boise and then bob drove her to the airport once again she said at the gate the great bob lee swagger triumphs you killed your enemies you got your wife and family back cant keep a good man down sally i got em all fooled but you dont i you see clean through me bob seriously pay attention to them this time i know its easy to say but you have to let the past go youre married you have a wonderful brave strong wife and a beautiful little girl thats your focus i know it will be theres no more old business is that a question or a statement both if theres one little thing left let it go it doesnt matter it cant matter theres nothing left he said you are one ornery sumbitch she said i swear i dont know what that woman sees in you well i dont neither but shes pretty smart so maybe she knows something you and i dont sally smiled and then turned to leave good friend and soldier to the very end she winked at him as if to say you are hopeless and he knew he was when the cast came off a little later and julie was back among the supple the family flew to st john in the us virgins for two glorious weeks they rented a villa just outside cruz bay on the little island and each morning took a taxi to the beautiful trunk bay beach where they snorkeled and lay in the sand and watched the time pass ever so slowly as they turned browner and browner they were a handsome family the natural aristocrats of nature the tall grave man with gray eyes and abundant hair and his wife every bit as handsome her hair a mesh of honey and brown her cheekbones strong her lips thin her eyes powerful she had been a cheerleader years ago but she was if anything more beautiful now than ever and the daughter a total ball of fire a complete kamikaze who always had to be called in who pushed the snorkeling to its maximum who begged her father to let her scuba or go water or paraskiing you got plenty of time to break your neck when youre older he told her your old mommy and i cant keep up with such a thing you have to give us a break this is our vacation too oh daddy she scolded youre such a chicken and when she said that he did an imitation of a chicken that was clearly based on a little real time in the barnyard and they all laughed first at how funny it was but second at the idea that a man of such reserve could at last find some way to let himself go to be silly an astonishment at night they went into town and ate at the restaurants there bob never had a drink didnt seem to want one it was idyllic really too good it reminded julie just a bit of an rr shed had with donny in hawaii just before well just before and bob seemed to relax totally too shed never seen him so calm so at ease the wariness that usually marked his passage in societya feeling for terrain and threat a tendency to mark escape routes to look too carefully at strangersdisappeared and he never had nightmares not once did he awake screaming drenched in cold sweat or with the shakes or with that hurt hunted look that sometimes came into his eyes his scars almost seemed to disappear as he grew tanner and tanner but they were always there the puckers of piebald flesh that could only be bullet wounds so many of them one of the virgin islanders stared at them once then turned to say something to one of his colleagues in that musical impenetrable english of theirs so fast and full of strange rhythms but julie heard the word bombom mon which she took to mean boomboom man which she in turn took to be gunman but bob appeared not to notice he was almost friendly his natural reserve blurred into something far more open and pleasant to the world shed never quite seen him like this there was only one night when she awoke and realized he wasnt in bed with her she rose walked through the dark living room until she found him on the deck under a tropic night sitting quietly before them was a slope of trees a hill and then the sea a serene sheet of glass throwing off tints of moonlight he sat with utter stillness staring at a book as if it had some secret meaning to it what is that she asked this oh its called birds of north america by roger prentiss fuller she came over and saw that he was gazing at a section on eagles what are you thinking about she asked oh nothing this book has some pretty pictures kid who painted them really knew his birds bob its so unlike you i was just curious thats all eagles eagles he said they returned to arizona and with the money bob was able to upgrade the barn hire two mexican assistants buy a new pickup and reintroduce himself to the pima county horsey set in just a little bit of time they had patientsseven eight then ten horses in various states of healing all ministered to with tender care his layup barn became a thriving concern after a while mostly on the basis of his own sweat but also because people trusted him nikki went back to school but she rode every day english style and would start showing on the circuits junior level the next spring her coach insisted julie resumed working three days a week at the navajo reservation clinic helping the strong young braves mend after fights or drinking bouts helping the rickety children doing a surprising amount of good in a small compass no reporters ever showed no german tv crews set up in the barnyard no young men came by to request interviews for their books no gun show entrepreneurs offered him money to stand at a booth and sell autographs no writers from the survivalist press wanted to write admiring profiles he and the war he represented seemed once again to have disappeared no part of it remained its wounds healed or at least scarred over one night bob sat down and wrote a letter to trig carters mother he told her he was planning a trip east some time in weeks to come and as he said hed like to stop by and share with her what he had learned about the death of her son she wrote back immediately pleased to hear from him she suggested a time and he called her and said that was fine thats when she should look for him he loaded his new pickup with gear and began the long trip back he drove up to tucson to the veterans cemetery there and walked the ranks of stones white in the desert sun until at last he came to donny m fenn lance corporal usmc nothing set it apart there were dozens of other stones from that and other wars the last years always signifying some violent eddy in american history a wind whistled out of the mountains the day was so bright it hurt his eyes he had no flowers nothing to offer the square of dry earth and the stone tablet hed been in so many other cemeteries this one felt no different at all he had nothing to say for so much had been said he just soaked up the loss of donny donny jumping over the berm the vibration as the bullet went through him lifting the dust from his chest donny falling his eyes going blank and sightless his hand grasping bobs arm the blood in his mouth and foaming obscenely down his nose after a whilehe had no idea how longhe left got back in the truck and settled in for a long pull across arizona new mexico texas oklahoma and on to the east the last part of the trip took him to the virginia suburbs of washington dc where once again he bunked with an old friend who had become the command sergeant major of the united states marine corps as a few months before he fell in with cronies both still on active duty or recently retired men of his own generation and stamp leathery sinewy men who bore the career imprint of the corps there were a few loud nights at the csms house in the suburbs the whole thing slightly more celebrative it was the next day that he called mrs carter and told her hed be up the next night she said she couldnt wait he hung up and waited on the line for the telltale click of a wiretap he didnt hear it but he knew that meant nothing there were other methods of penetration now he thought only this last thing chapter fiftyone bob drove carefully through the far reaches of baltimore county at sunset it was as he remembered the beautiful houses of the rich and propertied of old families of the original owners of americapeople who rode english at last he turned down a lane and drove under the overhanging elms until he found trigs ancestral home he pulled in once again momentarily humbled by the immensity of the place its suggestion of stability and propriety and what endured in the world at last he got out adjusted his tie and went to the door it was september now turning coolish at night here in the east the leaves hadnt yet begun to redden but there was nevertheless a definite edge in the air things would change soon that was the message he knocked the old black butler answered as before he was led through the same halls of antiques paintings of patriots exotic plants dense oriental rugs damask curtains lighting fixtures configured to represent the flicker of candles since it was darker there wasnt quite the sense of the threadbare that had been so evident his first time out here the old man led him into the study where the woman waited she stood erect as the mast of a shipthe family had owned shipping once of course as well as railroads oil coal and more she was still stern still rigid still had that irongray uplift to her hair she was demurely dressed in a conservative suit and he could see even more now that at one time she must have been a great beauty now an air of tragic futility attended her or maybe it was his imagination but shed lost a son and a husband to a war that the husband said was worth fighting and the son said wasnt it had broken her family apart as it had broken apart so many families no family was immune that was the lesson not even this one so protected by its wealth and property well sergeant swagger you look as if youve become a movie star ive been working outdoors maam no i dont mean the tan i have sources still i believe i told you theres some news afoot about your heroics in idaho how you disconnected some terrible conspiracy im sure i dont understand it but the information has even reached the society of doddering state department widows they say we were able to get some good work done yes maam are you congenitally modest sergeant for a man so powerful you are so unassuming you seem hardly to be there at all fm just a polite southern boy maam please sit down i wont offer you a drink since i know you no longer drink a club soda a cup of coffee or tea a soft drink something like that no maam im fine they sat across from each other in the study one of trigs birds observed them it was a blue mallard well then i know you came here to tell me something i suppose im ready to hear it will i need a drink sergeant swagger a great shot of vodka perhaps no maam i dont believe so well then go ahead maam i have satisfied myself on this one issue i dont believe no way your son would have killed another human being and i dont believe he killed himself i think he was duped by a professional soviet agentrather soviet in those days your son was sort of charmed into what a quaint euphemism but i have to tell you im aware of my sons homosexual leanings you believe it was a homosexual thing i dont know maam thats not my department i only know the result that somehow he was snookered into assisting in what was represented as an act of symbolic violence as a way of re energizing the peace movement but the russian operator he didnt give a tinkers dam about the peace movement he was only interested in your boys fame and reputation as a masking device for the missions real target ralph goldstein who was working on satellite topographyreading technologies and seemed on the verge of a breakthrough the russians felt would put them way behind in the cold war it was only about murder in the end and some other boy was the target yes maam so my poor trig wasnt even the star of his own murder no maam well hed been the star of so many other things i dont suppose it matters my guess is he had begun to have doubts perhaps he even tried to back out or go to the fbi or something possibly theres some record of his doubts in his missing sketches but it appears i wont never see them he was killed probably with a judo chop to the back of the neck that was their specialty in those days in fact everybody who saw this agent was killed at some effort including another peace demonstrator named peter fan is a marine named donny fenn and later attempts were made on my wife who had seen the agent with trig she was married to donny fenn at the time i believe ralph goldstein was killed in the same way their bodies were put in the building and it was detonated it goes down into the books as a violent fool and a math geek but the books are always wrong it was something entirely kids used by older smarter far more ruthless men then thrown away for a momentary strategic advantage it was a war but the cold one not the hot one the one we won i suppose we did what happened to the russian well our intelligence people found out a way to turn the information against him i dont know much about it but hes dead they had it on cnn you could see the burned bodies in the back of the jeep that nasty boy that one and the man who was trying to kill you well he wasnt trying to kill me he was trying to kill my wife he was stopped bob said and he aint never coming back were you responsible bob just nodded do you know what you are sergeant youre a sacred killer all societies need them all civilizations need them it is to the eternal shame and the current damnation of this country that it refuses anymore to acknowledge them and thinks it can get by without respecting them so let an old bat speak a truth you are the necessary man without you it all goes away bob said nothing speculation on his place in the nature of things was not his style the old lady sensed this and asked for an accounting of the politics of the affair the details of history he gave it succinctly enough odd isnt it as youve explained it after its all counted up and all the accounts are settled the one party to it all that could be said to benefit is the old russian communist apparatus its kept them from going under another few years and who can tell what thatll mean the cruel irony of history i suppose i wouldnt know about that maam they were very happy the intelligence people that they were able to stop this fellow pashin he was their real target my wife was his but he was ours and we got him first well anyway youve provided a measure of serenity to my life my son wasnt a fool he was overmatched by professionals whove been punished justice isnt much but it helps the nights go easier yes maam i agree sometimes you dont even get that so one must be very grateful for what one does get yes maam now i know you werent working for me you were never my employee but the one power i still have in the world is to satisfy myself through my checkbook i would very much enjoy getting it out now and writing a nice big fat one thank you he said thats not necessary are you sure i am soon therell be college expenses not for a while were doing fine oh i hope i havent spoiled things by bringing up money no maam well then there is one thing though name it the painting the painting the eagle after the fight i dont know a thing about art and i dont know a thing about birds but id be honored to have that it has some meaning to me you felt your breast stir when you saw it well something like that then you shall have it come with me sergeant swagger she led him forthrightly out of the room commanded the old butler to get a torcha flashlightand led bob in the butlers uncertain illumination to the studio their breaths plumed in the frosty air she opened the door found a switch and the birds flashed to life still and majestic these are worth quite a lot of money to connoisseurs of the macabre i expect she said but the eagle its so atypical and also unsigned would you want a certificate of authenticity it might seem pointless now but when your daughter goes to school it could mean the difference between buying one year at radcliffe or four years no maam he said walking to the painting i just want it for what it is he stood before it and felt its pain its distraught logy mind its survivors despair i wonder how he got so much into it she said he unscrewed the painting from the easel where it had been clamped since may of it was unframed but the canvas was tacked stoutly to a wood backing i hope youll let me pay for the framing said the old woman that at least i can do ill send you the bill he said he wrapped the painting carefully in some rags making certain not to disturb the elegant depth of the crusted pigment and put the whole package delicately under an arm all set he said sergeant swagger again i cant thank you enough youve made my dotage appreciably better to no real gain of your own oh i gained mrs carter i gained the team watched him from far off through nightvision binoculars it had been a long stakeout until he showed longer still since he was in there where had he been all afternoon still it didnt matter now it was going to happen swagger turned his truck around pulled out drove down the lane and by the time he got back to falls road the numberone van had moved into position not behind his turn as amateurs will do but before it letting him overtake them and falling into position from behind that way without attracting notice swagger pulled around the van scooted ahead and settled into an unhurried pace blue one this is blue two said the observer into his microphone ah we have him picked up very nicely no problems i have blue three behind me you want to run this by management blue two management just got here you stay on him blue two but dont rush it came the impatient voice any of them knew as bonsons play in the other van if you think youre in danger of being burned dont be too aggressive give me an updatewhoa isnt this interesting blue one he didnt do the beltway he just stayed on falls road on the way into baltimore doesnt that become eightythree asked bonson yes sir it does goes straight downtown but his motel is out at bw thats the credit card data he had something with him some kind of package maybe hes going to do something with it got you blue two you just stay on him they watched as bob drove unconsciously into downtown baltimore on the limited access highway that plunges into that citys heart he passed television hill with its giant antennae and the train station then the sun and finally the road drifted off its abutments to street level and became a lesser boulevard called president street just east of downtown hes turning left said blue two its uh fleet street the map says hes headed towards fells point what the hell is he doing there is he starring in a john waters movie cut the joking on the net said bonson you stay with him im coming in be in town very shortly the men knew bonson and his radio team were in a hangar at bw airport less than twenty minutes south of town this time of night assuming there was no backup at the tunnel bob turned up fleet and the traffic grew a bit thicker he did not look around he did not notice either the white or the black vans that had been on him since the country he passed through fells point jammed with cars kids scum and bars presumably the shady night town of the city and kept on driving another mile or two and he turned on the diagonal down a beatup street called boston blue one this is blue two the traffic is thinning out hes headed out boston toward the docks im going to stay on reet run a parallel and let blue three close on him just to be safe read you two said the observer in the second van there was no way swagger could tell now that the van which had been closest to him sped away down another road and the unseen secondary vehicle closed the gap that he was under surveillance more important he exhibited nothing in his driving that demonstrated the signature of a surveil lee whod burned his trackers he didnt dart in and out of traffic he didnt signal right then turn left he didnt turn without signaling he just drove blandly ahead intent on his destination but once he passed two large apartment buildings on the right at the harbors edge he began to slow down as if he were looking for something it was a kind of postindustrial zone with ruined deserted factories everywhere oilholding facilities for offloading by tankers huge weedy fields that served no apparent purpose at all but were nevertheless cyclonefenced there was little traffic and almost no pedestrian activity it was a blasted zone where humans may have worked during the day but deserted almost totally at night the numbertwo van was a good three hundred feet behind him when he turned right down another streetit was called south clinton streetthat seemed to veer closer to the docks the van didnt turn it went straight after its observer notified the first vehicle which had run parallel down boston and itself turned right on the street bob had turned down two i have him said the observer cool ill roam a bit then take up a tail position thats good work said bonson over the net were going to lose you now were going through the tunnel ill stay on him blue one catch you when we get out of the tunnel the first van maintained about a four hundredfoot gap between itself and swaggers truck which now coursed down desolate south clinton street off to the right a giant naval vessel under construction suddenly loomed gray and arclit for drama and security bob passed it passed a bank a few small working mens restaurants then stopped by the side of the road goddammit said two burned goddammit his own driver started to slow but he was exceedingly professional no just keep driving just drive by him dont eyeball him as you pass him dont even think about it hell feel you paying attention im dropping out of sight the driver continued at the same speed while the observer dropped into the seat well knowing that a single driver was much less of a giveaway signature for a tail job and he hit the send button blue three do you read yeah im past the bostonsouth clinton street exchange just pulled over okay hes stopped were going to pass him you come on by and pull off a long way down hes on the right dont use your lights go to night vision and monitor his moves the lead vehicle sped around the curve passed several mountains of coal ready for loading on the right he pulled off when he was out of sight of the parked man two this is three im in position and ive got him in my night lenses hes just sitting there waiting i think hes turned off his engine no no hes turned off his lights now hes pulling ahead hes turning innow ive lost him okay hes gone to ground sitrep people came the voice of bonson who had just cleared the tunnel and was now on this side of the harbor sir he just pulled into a yard or something in the warehouse district down by the docks just off boston we have him under observation im right at boston street here do we go east or west off of ninetyfive you go west go about a mile and turn left again on south clinton street im off by the side of the road just around that turn lights off left side of the road two is on the other side around the curve were both about a half mile away from where hes gone to rest okay lets meet one at a time in twominute intervals two hundred yards this side my side of the location you go first three then you two from the other side then ill join you keep your lights on in case hes looking out if he saw unlit vehicles he could go ballistic sir i honestly dont think hes seen a damned thing he was off in his own world he wasnt even looking around when he stopped hes just looking for some deserted place well know in a few minutes said bonson just as his car turned left and pulled in behind one of the vans bob parked to the left of the silent corrugatedmetal building as far back and out of sight as he could he paused waiting he heard no sounds there was no night watchman the place was some kind of grain storage facility again for loading cargo ships but no ship floated in the water he could see the shimmering lights on the flat calm water and beyond that the skyline of the city spangled in illumination but here there was nothing except the rush of cars from the tunnel exit nearby a separate world sealed off by concrete abutments he got out taking the wrapped painting a powerful flashlight and a heavy pair of wire cutters with him and headed to the warehouse it was padlocked but where the lock was strong the metal fastener that secured door to wall was not and the wire cutters made quick work of it the lock fell still secure to the ground wearing a little necklace of sheared steel he pulled the door open stepped into a space that in the darkness appeared to be cut by bins now mostly empty the dust of grainswheat mostly though he smelled soya beans toofilled the air he walked his shoes echoing on the bricks until at last he came to the center of the room he stopped by a pillar and a drain then turned on the light the beam skipped across the empty building finding nothing of interest but more emptiness dramatic shadows fire extinguishers light switches closets crates he went and got a crate pulled it into the center and set it down finally he set the light on the floor aimed back toward where he had left the package it cast a cold white eye on the painting he walked over and leaned into the circle of light slowly he peeled the rags away until at last the painting stood exposed he examined it carefully saw how the tacks held the canvas to the backing he took out his case pocketknife and very slowly used its blade to scrape at the paint it was thick and cracked easily falling to the ground in chunks and strips he scraped destroying the image of the eagle pulling at the paint watching it flake in colored chunks downward in a minute or so he came to a ridge under the paint and ran the knife blade along it until he reached a corner it was the top of a heavy piece of paper and it had been literally buried under the heavy oil pigmentation of the image with the blade he pried the corner loose enough to get a grip on set the knife down and very carefully pulled the sheet of paper free it cracked off the canvas as he finally freed it there was a kind of soft slipping sound paper sliding loose fluting down to land with a rattle on the dirty floor he set the backing down and bent there in the harsh light to see what secrets he had unlocked it was the last few sketches from trigs book bob began to shuffle through them finding images of a campus building in madison wisconsin portraits of people at parties in washington crowd scenes of big demonstrations there was a portrait of donny it must have been made about the time he did the scene of donny and julie which bob had seen in vietnam he brought those days vividly to life and bob began to feel his passionand his pain chapter fiftytwo one man had gone ahead and returned with a report hes in there with a flashlight reading some pages or something i cant figure it out okay said bonson i think i know what hes got lets finish this once and for all the guns came out the team consisted now of five men besides bonson they were large men in crew cuts in their late forties they were toughlooking exuding that alphamale confidence that suggested no difficulty in doing violence if necessary they looked like large policemen soldiers firemen extremely well developed extremely competent they drew the guns from under their jackets and there was a little ceremony of clicks and snaps as safeties came off and slides were eased back to check chambers just in case then the suppressors were screwed on bonson led them along the road into the lot and up to the old grain warehouse above stars pinwheeled and blinked water sounds filled the night the lapping of the tides against ancient docks from somewhere came a low steady roar of automobiles he reached the metal door and through the gap between it and the building proper he could see bob in the center of the room sitting on a crate hed gotten from somewhere reading by the light of a flashlight the painting was on the floor somehow standing straight as if on display and bob was leaning against a thick pillar that supported the low ceiling bonson could see that the image had somehow been destroyed yielding a large white square in its center what is wrong with this picture he asked himself he studied it for a second no nothing the man is unaware the man is lost the man is unprepared the man is defenseless the man is the ultimate soft target he nodded okay he whispered one of the men opened the door and he walked in bob looked up to see them as their lights flashed on him howdy he said lights said bonson one of the men walked away found an electrical junction and the place leaped into light which showed the rawness of industrial space a gravel floor the air filled with dust and agricultural vapors hello swagger said bonson my my whats that its the last sketches from trig carters book real damn interesting said bob loudly howd you find it what what was wrong with his ears i said how did you find it when i thought about his last painting i figured it pretty close the reason the painting was so different was his clue his way of saying to those who came after him look this over but no one ever came not until me nice work said bonson whats in it what what was wrong with his ears i said whats in it oh just what youd expect said bob still a bit loud people places things he ran into as he began to prepare his symbolic explosion of the math building a couple of nice drawings of donny trig carter was a traitor said bonson yeah said bob mildly do tell give it over here said bonson you dont want to see the drawings bonson theyre pretty damned interesting well look at them thats enough oh it gits better theres a nice drawing of this fitzpatrick damn that boy could draw its pashin everybody will be able to tell thats quite a find eh thats proof cold solid deadon proof the peace movement was infiltrated by elements of soviet intelligence so what said bonson thats all gone and forgotten it doesnt matter oh no said bob see theres someone else in the drawing poor trig must have grown extremely suspicious so one day late right after the big may day mess he followed fitzpatrick he watched him meet somebody he did he watched them deep in conversation and he recorded it bob held it up a folded piece of paper the lines that were pashin brilliantly clear bob unfolded the rest of the drawing see bonson heres the funny part said bob loudly theres someone else here its you there was a moment of silence bonsons eyes narrowed tightly and then he relaxed turned to his team and smiled he almost had to laugh who are you bonson swagger asked more quietly now really id like to know i had some ideas i just couldnt make no sense of them but just tell me who are you what are you are you a traitor are you a professional soviet agent masquerading as an american are you some kind of cynic playing the sides against each other are you in it for the money who are you bonson kill him asked one of the men on the team holding up a suppressed beretta no said bonson no not yet i want to see how far hes gotten finally it makes sense bob said the great cia mole the big one theyve been hunting all these years who makes a better mole than the head mole hunter pretty goddamned smart but whats the deal why did no one ever suspect you he could sense that bonson wanted to tell him he had probably never told anyone had repressed his reality so deep and imposed such discipline on himself that it was almost not real to him except when it needed to be but now at last he had a chance to explain the reason i was never suspected he said finally was because they recruited me i never went to them they offered me a job when i left the navy but i said no i went to law school i spent three years on wall street they came after me three more times and i always said no finallygod it took some disciplinefinally i said yes why did they want you so much because of the nis prosecutions that was the plan i sent fiftyseven young men to vietnam marines naval seaman even a couple of junior officers i reported on dozens more that i turned up in the other services and many of them went too there was never a better secret policeman anywhere one with less mercy and more ambition they could see how fierce i was i was so good i was astonishing they wanted me so bad it almost killed them and i played so hard to get it still amazes me but that was our plan from the beginning his face gleamed with vanity and pride this was his great triumph the core of his life what made him better than other men his work of art who are you bonson who the fuck are you the only time i ever came out on a wet operation was that one night when that idiot pashin showed up without a drivers license you needed a drivers license to buy that much ammonium nitrate even in virginia that idiot gru begged the committee for help and i had the best identity running so i drove down to leesburg and bought it i met him in the restaurant to tell him where it was secured he was a brilliant operator but in little practical things like that he was stupid and you were unlucky trig the human camera had followed him i always worried about that that was my one moment of vulnerability but now youve taken care of that for me who are you said bob you have to tell me that i dont have to tell you anything i can kill you and im forever secure in seventyone you were the source of deployment intelligence werent you you bet i was said bonson i invented chaos it was the best professional penetration in history the way i orchestrated it you killed the little girl on the bridge right amy rosenzweig seventeen i looked it up i saw how much trouble it caused oh swagger goddamn you are smart we picked her up shot her up and dropped her into the crowd it was a massive dose of lsd she never knew what hit her my friend bill herehe indicated a man on his teamdid it she freaked and went over god what a stink it caused it almost wrecked the credibility of the us government in that one thing the pressure it caused those are your boys arent they your security team which of em killed poor peter fanis the five men in suits arrayed around bonson glowered at him they had hard eyes glittering with pure aggression and taut professional faces their pistols were in their hands that was nick who got the picture of donny and my wife that was michael youd like them swagger theyre all exncos in the black sea marines and spetsnaz theyve been with me for a long time who blew the building in wisconsin that was a team job and when you were running the mission against solaratov you were really running it against pamyat against pashin who was now a nationalist and if he wins the presidency it sets you guys back even farther you always knew pashin was fitzpatrick but you had to find a way to get that information to us without compromising your position you turned everything inside out so that in the end the american government was working in the interests of the communist party the cold war never ended for you right it never will history runs in cycles were in retreat now largely underground but weve been underground before we started underground we have to eliminate our enemies in russia first russia then the world as the great stalin understood well be back this great rich fat country of yours is about to explode at the seams itll destroy itself and ill help it i should get the directorship shortly from there politics the very interesting part of my plan is just about to start happening who are you boomed bob why was he talking so loud ill tell you but first you satisfy me when did you know i began to suspect at the meeting when the kid wanted to let solaratov take out julie and nab him on the way out that was the smart move even i knew that but you said no you couldnt do that to me fuck you that was never you you could send anybody down i knew that about you from what you done to donny so when you say you could never do that i knew you was lying you had to stop solaratov that was your first mission smart said bonson smart smart smart it gets me thinking in seventytwo you guys must have been shitting because you let the most important witness to pashin and trig get away you couldnt track him because a good officer gave him liberty and then he was on his way back to vietnam he has to be killed not only to protect pashin but to protect you so how do the goddamn russians know where he is and what hes doing in vietnam how can they target him thats a very tough piece of info to come by and their whole plan turns on it they had to have someone inside someone had to get into naval personnel and figure out where the boy was somebody had to target him solaratov was only the technician you was the shooter bonson stared at him funny how when you make the breakthrough it all kind of swings into shape bob said it all makes some kind of sense your last mistake haw fast the information got to moscow got to higher parties in pamyat to destroy pashins presidential thing man that was fast work youre telling me the agency is that fast no way had to be some inside thing someone who just had to make a phone call damn and everybody keeps saying aint it funny the communist party really benefits from all this yeah the real joke is through you the communist party is running all this who are you you are smart said bonson you just werent quick enough were you who are you repeated bob youd never believe this but im history im the future im mankind im hope im the messiah of what must be he smiled again a pure pilgrim of his own craziness not even solaratov believed that shit said bob all right ill tell you said bonson and then ill kill you this is a great privilege for you who are you youd know the original family name or you could dig it up its in some books my parents were workingclass americans and fervent members of the american communist party in the year i was born they were asked to drop out and go underground for the committee of course they agreed it was the greatest honor theyd ever been paid so they renounced the party turned on all their friends and spent the next fifteen years working as couriers cutouts bag men for the atom bomb spies they serviced the rosenbergs alger hiss klaus fuchs the whole brilliant thing we ran in this country they were heroes my father was a great man he was greater than your father swagger he was greater braver stronger tougher more resilient than your father he was the best and my mother was a saint bonsons eyes shown with tears as he recalled the beauty of his mother you know the rest nsa de crypts finally gave them away my father hung himself in a holding tank on rikers island my mother got me out and then poisoned herself as the agents were coming up the stairs to arrest her they were heroes of the soviet union they gave it all to the revolution someone in the network got me out of the country and by the following tuesday i was in moscow i was fourteen years old and totally american a yankees and giants fan with an iq of and an absolute commitment to bringing down the system that murdered my parents i was trained for six years when i reinfiltrated i was already a major in the kgb im now a threestar general i have more decorations than youll ever dream about i am a hero of the soviet union youre a psychopath and there aint no soviet union said bob too bad you wont be around to see how wrong you are the two ancient enemies faced each other in silence finally bonson said all right thats enough kill him the team raised their pistols the suppressed mm bores looked at bob there was complete silence any last words asked bonson any message for the family last words said bob yeah three of em front toward enemy he turned his hand over to show them what it held and bonson realized in an instant why he had been speaking so loudly because he was wearing earplugs he held the m electrical firing device the green plastic clapper with a wire running down to the painting behind which stood on its silly little set of tripods an ma antipersonnel mine better known as a claymore one or two the faster may have tried to fire but bobs reflexes were faster still as he triggered the demolition the one and a half pounds of plastic explosive encased in the mine detonated instantly and a nanosecond later the seven hundred ball bearings a blizzard of steel arrived upon them at close to four thousand feet per second the mine did what the mine was supposed to do it took them out it literally dissolved them their upper bodies were fragmented in one instant of maximum total butchery they exploded as if theyd swallowed grenades and become part of the atmosphere as for bob he saw none of this the pillar as planned saved his life by blocking the force of the concussion the earplugs saved his eardrums but a pound and a half of plastic explosive is no small thing he felt himself pulled out of his body and his soul went sailing through the air until it struck something hard and his mind filled with a bright fog an incandescent emptiness he blacked out for a minute or two no police arrived the waterfront is a place of odd noises from unspecified localities freighters horns the rumble of trucks backfires and an almost total night emptiness of human life the sound of the blast was just another unexplained aural phenomenon in a city full of unexplained aural phenomenon when bob pulled himself out of his fog he tasted blood he smelled it too the blood he tasted was his own his nose bled and both his ears rang like fire bells despite the plugs he felt pain he thought hed broken his arm but he hadnt although hed bruised it deeply he picked himself up saw flashbulbs prance through the air as his shortcircuited optic nerves sputtered ineffectively he blinked staggered sat pulled himself up blinked again and then beheld the horror the blood he smelled was theirs and much of it atomized still floated in waves in the air lit by flickering lights there had been six of them now there were three legs left standing though no two belonged to any one of the men what remained of ward bonson deputy director of the cia for counterintelligence wall street lawyer three star general in the kgb and a hero of the soviet union was applied to the punctured metal of the wall behind him mixed completely with the remains of the men whod served him so ably over the long years no one would have the heartor the stomachto separate them it was a pure hose job small fires burned everywhere in the smoky space the sketches had been scattered about slowly bob gathered them up then went to the largest of the fires he knelt and one by one fed them into the hungry fire it gobbled them and he watched them seized then curl to delicacy as they were blackened and devoured then transfigure again into crispy ash which fragmented and floated away in the hot current in the way his mind worked he thought he saw the souls of those three lost boys his friend donny and donnys friend trig and trigs victim ralph somehow released to rise and float free deros at last he picked up the fingerprinted m and dropped it into his pocket for later disposal his last physical connection to the fate of bonson and his team then he rose and walked out turning for one last glimpse at the slaughterhouse he had created and the end of all complications of his violent life he thought sierrabravofour last transmission out he walked into the night air sucked in its freshness headed to his truck and though he ached and bled knew it would be best to start the long drive west it was time to rotate back to the world acknowledgments the author would like to begin by making certain readers understand that the foregoing in no way advances a claim for his own heroism which is of course nonexistent he was not a marine sniper nor even a marine he never went to vietnam but served as the least efficient ceremonial soldier in the st battalion reinf third infantry in washington dc his own war story he was present at the occupation of the treasury building it was very boring and once he cut his lip on some barb wire at camp ap hill in virginia readers will also recognize that ive seized events from vietnam fictionalized them and reinserted them in a bogus time frame for my own dramatic purposes that includes inventing an extra year of marine ground combat most marine units left rsvn in i was stuck with because i chose that year without doing a lick of research when i was writing point of impact the first of the bob lee swagger books many years back in earlier books i also set the action near an loc which turns out to be close to saigon and nowhere near i corps where the marines served so in a belated attempt at the illusion of accuracy ive deemphasized an loc and moved the location of bob and donnys fight in the rain up to i corps near the special forces camp at kham due ive also simplified the complicated events in washington over the first four days of may into a single night put the massacre of firebase mary annmy dodge cityin a different year and ascribed it to a different service and invented my own nam jargon under the license of telling stories not writing history in fact one of the few things recounted in this book that actually happened was the great catch that donny remembered making against oilman high school it was made against oilman a prep school not in arizona but baltimore by my son jake hunter in boys latins victory over oilman in i should add that ive made a goodfaith effort to reconcile events of this book with events previously referred to in point of impact and black light alas far too many times events were irreconcilable so youll simply have to trust my assertion that in other books things happened that way but in this book they happen this way but where ive made up much ive also talked with many people who had firsthand knowledge of the kind of events i describe theyre all good men and deserve no blame for my inaccuracies or the ends to which ive put information that they earned the hard way ed de carlo retired army csgt and alvin guyton retired gy sgt usmc both good buddies from on target shooting range where i spend vast amounts of time and money shared vietnam memories and data with me ed was a radio operator and briefed me on the intricacies of the prc and map reading alvin a recon marine lent me tons of reference material and even loaned me copies of his orders to vietnam on which to base my version of donnys and tried to make me feel marine culture well enough to imagine it two of the usual suspects weyman swagger and john feamster offered their usual supplies of endless labor commentary and suggestion each reading the manuscript with a great deal of precision lenne miller another vietnam vet and an old college friend was equally generous with time and observation my brother tim hunter sent me a terrific letter of constructive criticism jeff weber not only lent me his name for one of the characters but also read the manuscript and offered good advice bob lopez came up with a crucial idea at a crucial moment j d considine the popmusic critic of the baltimore sun my old paper drew up a compilation tape of hits to whose accompaniment this book was written mike hill was very helpful bill phillips an exmarine officer vietnam vet and author of the night of silver stars read the manuscript carefully and helped me sort out army jargon and replace it with marine but if ive called it a latrine somewhere instead of a head its my fault not bills tim carpenter of bushnells explained the subtleties of infrared ranging devices to me dave lauck of dl sports in gillette wyoming and author of the tactical marksman ran his fine professional eye over the manuscript to my great benefit kathy lally and will england the suns moscow correspondents gave me tips and data on that city for a chapter that was ultimately cut warrant officer joe boyer of the marine barracks took me on a prowl through that installation and patiently answered my questions jean marbella of my old paper and my new life was her usual fabulous self and listened to me prattle on about titles and narrative issues late into the night john pancake arts editor of my new paper the washington post just smiled every time i told him i was leaving early to work on the book david von drehle editor of the posts style section was equally generous in letting me disappear when i deemed it necessary steve proctor of the sun had instituted a similar policy in my many years there and he too should be recognized and thanked former green beret don pugsley wrote to me at great length about communications procedures from a camps charles h hap hazard a sun artist and former army intelligence enlisted man translated a lot of stuff into vietnamese for me very helpfully dr jim fisher introduced me to dr charlie partjens an orthopedic surgeon who discussed the physical realities of an old bullet with me bill ochs former army sergeant discussed something of far more intensity the trauma of his own hip wound acquired in action in rsvn i really appreciate his willingness to let a stranger invade his privacy like that i should also thank authors who have come before me peter r senich the thucydides of sniper warfare came out with the oneshot war a history of marine sniper operations in vietnam just as i was beginning then michael lee lanning and dan cragg published inside the vc and the nva which was very helpful for tough little huu co senior colonel of course ive drawn from charles hendersons marine sniper and joseph t wards dear mom a snipers vietnam as well as the standard history texts i never spoke to any marine snipers however because i needed to be free to envision bob lee swagger as i wanted him to be warts and all last in the professional realm i must thank my brilliant wonderful agent esther newberg of icm and my great editor bill thomas of doubleday and something finally for the books dedicatee john burke who was the great carlos hathcocks spotter in vietnam and didnt make it to deros i never knew him but his story so moved me that i had to find a way to cast it into a book and he became my donny fenn so in a way this whole thingthis book and the three that proceeded itall came from his sacrifice thanks marine
