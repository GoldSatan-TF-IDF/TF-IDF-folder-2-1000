here is the story which fought zelaznys he who shapes to a standstill for the novella award it is set not in the far future or even in the familiar present but in that curiously bright and timeless latevictorian world glimpsed as if through the wrong end of a telescope in which the wonderful events of h wells stories take place the author of this brilliant pastiche was born in the mid twenties into the east anglia depicted as background to the saliva tree where many farms still had their own little electricity generators he has been literary editor of the oxford mail for eight years he made a happy second marriage in now lives in a beautiful old sixteenthcentury thatched house in oxfordshire seeing slightly crazy visions nebula award best novella the saliva tree brian w aldiss there is neither speech nor language but their voices are heard among them psalm xix you know im really much exercised about the fourth dimension said the fairhaired young man with a suitable earnestness in his voice um said his companion staring up at the night sky it seems very much in evidence these days do you not think you catch a glimpse of it in the drawings of aubrey beardsley um said his companion they stood together on a low rise to the east of the sleepy east anglian town of cottersall watching the stars shivering a little in the chill february air they are both young men in their early twenties the one who is occupied with the fourth dimension is called bruce fox be is tall and fair and works as junior clerk in the norwich firm of lawyers prendergast and tout the other who has so far vouchsafed us only an urn or two although he is to figure largely as the hero of our account is by name gregory rolles he is tall and dark with gray eyes set in his handsome and intelligent face he and fox have sworn to think large thus distinguishing themselves at least in their own minds from all the rest of the occupants of cottersall in these last years of the nineteenth century theres another exclaimed gregory breaking at last from the realm of monosyllables he pointed a gloved finger up at the constellation of auriga the charioteer a meteor streaked across the sky like a runaway flake of the milky way and died in midair beautiful they said together its funny fox said prefacing his words with an oftused phrase the stars and mens minds are so linked together and always have been even in the centuries of ignorance before charles darwin they always seem to play an illdefined role in mans affairs they help me think large too dont they you greg you know what i think think that some of those stars may be occupied by people i mean he breathed heavily overcome by what he was saying people whoperhaps they are better than us live in a just society wonderful people i know socialists to a man fox exclaimed this was one point on which he did not share his friends advanced thinking he had listened to mr tout talking in the office and thought he knew better than his rich friend how these socialists of which one heard so much these days were undermining society stars full of socialists better than stars full of christians why if the stars were full of christians no doubt they would already have sent missionaries down here to preach their gospel i wonder if there ever will be planetary journeys as predicted by nunsowe greene and monsieur jules verne fox said when the appearance of a fresh meteor stopped him in midsentence like the last this meteor seemed to come from the general direction of auriga it traveled slowly and it glowed red and it sailed grandly towards them they both exclaimed at once arid gripped each other by the arm the magnificent spark burned in the sky larger now so that its red aura appeared to encase a brighter orange glow it passed overhead afterwards they argued whether it had not made a slight noise as it passed and disappeared below a clump of willow they knew it had been near for an instant the land had shone with its light gregory was the first to speak bruce bruce did you see that that was no ordinary fireball it was so big what was it perhaps our heavenly visitor has come at last hey greg it must have landed by your friends farmthe grendon placemustnt it youre right i must pay old mr grendon a visit tomorrow and see if he or his family saw anything of this they talked excitedly stamping their feet as they exercised their lungs their conversation was the conversation of optimistic young men and included much speculative matter that began wouldnt it be wonderful if or just supposing then they stopped and laughed at their own absurd beliefs fox said slyly so youll be seeing all the grendon family tomorrow it seems probable unless that redhot planetary ship has already borne them off to a better world tell us true gregyou really go to see that pretty nancy grendon dont you gregory struck his friend playfully on the shoulder no need for your jealousy bruce i go to see the father not the daughter though the one is female the other is progressive and that must interest me more just yet nancy has beauty true but her fatherah her father has electricity laughing they cheerfully shook hands and parted for the night on grendons farm things were a deal less tranquil as gregory was to discover gregory rolles rose before seven next morning as was his custom it was while he was lighting his gas mantle and wishing mr fenn would install electricity that a swift train of thought led him to reflect again on the phenomenal thing in the previous nights sky he let his mind wander luxuriously over all the possibilities that the meteor illuminated he decided that he would ride out to see mr grendon within the hour he was lucky in being able at this stage in his life to please himself largely as to how his days were spent for his father was a person of some substance edward rolles had had the fortune at the time of the crimean war to meet escoffier and with some help from the great chef had brought onto the market a baking powder eugenol that being slightly more palatable and less deleterious to the human system than its rivals had achieved great commercial success as a result gregory had attended one of the cambridge colleges now having gained a degree he was poised on the verge of a career but which career he had acquiredmore as a result of his intercourse with other students than with those officially deputed to instruct himsome understanding of the sciences his essays had been praised and some of his poetry published so that he inclined toward literature and an uneasy sense that life for everyone outside the privileged classes contained too large a proportion of misery led him to think seriously of a political career in divinity too he was wellgrounded but at least the idea of holy orders did not tempt him while he wrestled with his future he undertook to live away from home since his relations with his father were never smooth by rusticating himself in the heart of east anglia he hoped to gather material for a volume tentatively entitled wanderings with a socialist naturalist which would assuage all sides of his ambitions nancy grendon who had a pretty hand with a pencil might even execute a little emblem for the title page perhaps he might be permitted to dedicate it to his author friend mr herbert george wells he dressed himself warmly for the morning was cold as well as dull and went down to the bakers stables when he had saddled his mare daisy he swung himself up and set out along a road that the horse knew well the land rose slightly towards the farm the area about the house forming something of a little island amid marshy ground and irregular stretches of water that gave back to the sky its own dun tone the gate over the little bridge was as always open wide daisy picked her way through the mud to the stables where gregory left her to champ oats contentedly cuff and her pup lardie barked loudly about gregorys heels as usual and he patted their heads on his way over to the house nancy came hurrying out to meet him before he got to the front door we had some excitement last night gregory she said he noted with pleasure she had at last brought herself to usehis first name something bright and glaring she said i was retiring when this noise come and then this light and i rush to look out through the curtains and theres this here great thing like an egg sinking into our pond in her speech and particularly when she was excited she carried the lilting accent of norfolk the meteor gregory exclaimed bruce fox and i were out last night as we were the night before watching for the lovely aurigids that arrive every february when we saw an extra big one i said then it was coming over very near here why it almost landed on our house nancy said she looked very pleasing this morning with her lips red her cheeks shining and her chestnut curls all astray as she spoke her mother appeared in apron and cap with a wrap hurriedly thrown over her shoulders nancy you come in standing freezing like that you ent daft girl are you hello gregory how be going on i didnt reckon as wed see you today come in and warm yourself goodday to you mrs grendon im hearing about your wonderful meteor of last night it was a falling star according to bert neckland i ent sure what it was but it certainly stirred up the animals that i do know can you see anything of it in the pond gregory asked let me show you nancy said mrs grendon returned indoors she went slowly and grandly her back straight and an unaccustomed load before her nancy was her only daughter there was a younger son archie a stubborn lad who had fallen at oddswith his father and now was apprenticed to a blacksmith in norwich and no other children living three infants had not survived the mixture of fogs alternating with bitter east winds that comprised the typical cottersall winter but now the farmers wife was unexpectedly gravid again and would bear her husband another baby when the spring came in as nancy led gregory over to the pond he saw grendon with his two laborers working in the west field but they did not wave was your father not excited by the arrival last night that he waswhen it happened he went out with his shotgun and bert neckland with him but there was nothing to see but bubbles in the pond and steam over it and this morning he wouldnt discuss it and said that work must go on whatever happen they stood beside the pond a dark and extensive slab of water with rushes on the farther bank and open country beyond as they looked at its ruffled surface they stood with the windmill black and bulky on their left hand it was to this that nancy now pointed mud had been splashed across the boards high up the sides of the mill some was to be seen even on the top of the nearest white sail gregory surveyed it all with interest nancy however was still pursuing her own line of thought dont you reckon father works too hard gregory when hes not outside doing jobs hes in reading his pamphlets and his electricity manuals he never rests but when he sleeps um whatever went into the pond went in with a great smack theres no sign of anything there now is there not that you can see an inch below the surface you being a friend of his mum thought perhaps as youd say something to him he dont go to bed till ever so latesometimes its near midnight and then hes up again at three and a half oclock would you speak to him you know mother dassent nancy we ought to see whatever it was that went in the pond it cant have dissolved how deep is the water is it very deep oh you arent listening gregory rolles bother the old meteor this is a matter of science nancy dont you see oh rotten old science is it then i dont want to hear im cold standing out here you can have a good look if you like but im going in before i gets froze it was only an old stone out of the sky because i heard father and bert neckland agree to it fat lot bert neckland knows about such things he called to her departing back he looked down at the dark water whatever it was that had arrived last night it was here only a few feet from him he longed to discover what remained of it vivid pictures entered his mind his name in headlines in the morning post the royal society making him an honorary member his father embracing him and pressing him to return home thoughtfully he walked over to the barn hens ran clucking out of his way as he entered and stood looking up waiting for his eyes to adjust to the dim light there as he remembered it was a little rowing boat perhaps in his courting days old mr grendoii had taken his prospective wife out for excursions on the oast in it surely it had not been used in years he dragged the boat from the barn and launched it in the shallows of the pond it floated the boards had dried and water leaked through a couple of seams but not nearly enough to deter him climbing delicately in among the straw and filth he pushed off when he was over the approximate center of the pond he shipped his oars and peered over the side there was an agitation in the water and nothing could be seen although he imagined much as he stared over the one side the boat unexpectedly tipped to the other gregory swung round the boat listed heavily to the left so that the oars rolled over that way he could see nothing yethe heard something it was a sound much like a hound slowly panting and whatever made it was about to capsize the boat what is it he said as all the skin prickled up his back and skull the boat lurched for all the world as if someone invisible were trying to get into it frightened he grasped the oar and without thinking swept it over that side of the rowing boat it struck something solid where there was only air dropping the oar in surprise he put out his hand it touched something yielding at the same time his arm was violently struck his actions were then entirely governed by instinct thought did not enter the matter he picked up the oar again and smote the thin air with it it hit something there was a splash and the boat righted itself so suddenly he was almost pitched into the water even while it still rocked he was rowing frantically for the shallows dragging the boat from the water and running for the safety of the farmhouse only at the door did he pause his reason returned his heart began gradually to stop stammering its fright he stood looking at the seamed wood of the porch trying to evaluate what he had seen and what had actually happened but what had happened forcing himself to go back to the pond he stood by the boat and looked across the sullen face of the water it lay undisturbed except by surface ripples he looked at the boat a quantity of water lay in the bottom of it he thought all that happened was that i nearly capsized and i let my idiot fears run away with me shaking his head he pulled the boat back to the barn gregory as he often did stayed to eat lunch at the farm but he saw nothing of the farmer till milking time joseph grendon was in his late forties and a few years older than his wife he bad a gaunt solemn face and a heavy beard that made him look older than he was for all his seriousness he greeted gregory civilly enough they stood together in the gathering dusk as the cows swung behind them into their regular stalls together they walked into the machine house next door and grendon lit the oil burners that started the steam engine into motion that would turn the generator that would supply the vital spark i smell the future in here gregory said smiling by now he had forgotten the shock of the morning the future will have to get on without me i shall be dead by then the farmer spoke as he walked putting each word reliably before the next that is what you always say youre wrongthe future is rushing upon us you ent far wrong there master gregory but i wont have no part of it i reckon im an old man now here she come the last exclamation was directed at a flicker of light in the pilot bulb overhead they stood there contemplating with satisfaction the wonderful machinery as steam pressure rose the great leather belt turned faster and faster and the flicker in the pilot bulb grew stronger although gregory was used to a home lit by both gas and electricity he never felt the excitement of it as he did here out in the wilds where the nearest incandescent bulb was probably in norwich a great part of a days journey away now a pale flickering radiance illuminated the room by contrast everything outside looked black grendon nodded in satisfaction made some adjustments to the burners and they went outside free from the bustle of the steam engine they could hear the noise the cows were making at milking time the animals were usually quiet something had upset them the farmer ran quickly into the milking shed with gregory on his heels the new light radiating from a bulb hanging above the stalls showed the beasts of restless demeanor and rolling eye bert neckland stood as far away from the door as possible grasping his stick and letting his mouth hang open what in blazes are you staring at bor grendon asked neckland slowly shut his mouth we had a scare he said something come in here did you see what it was gregory asked no there werent nothing to see it was a ghost thats what it was it came right in here and touched the cows it touched me too it was a ghost the farmer snorted a tramp more like you couldnt see because the light wasnt on his man shook his head emphatically light werent that bad i tell you whatever it was it come right up to me and touched me he stopped and pointed to the edge of the stall look there see i werent telling you no lie master it was a ghost and theres its wet handprint they crowded round and examined the worn and chewed timber at the corner of the partition between two stalls an indefinite patch of moisture darkened the wood gregorys thoughts went back to his experience on the pond and again he felt the prickle of unease along his spine but the farmer said stoutly nonsense its a bit of cowslime now you get on with the milking bert and lets have no more hossing about because i want my tea wheres cuff bert looked defiant if you dont believe me maybe youll believe the bitch she saw whatever it was and went for it it kicked her over but she ran it out of here ill see if i can see her gregory said he ran outside and began calling the bitch by now it was almost entirely dark he could see nothing moving in the wide space of the front yard and so set off in the other direction down the path towards the pig sties and the fields calling cuff as he went he paused low and savage growls sounded ahead under the elm trees it was cuff he went slowly forward at this moment he cursed that electric light meant lack of lanterns and wished too that he had a weapon whos there he called the farmer came up by his side lets charge em they ran forward the trunks of the four great elms were clear against the western sky with water glinting leadenly be hind them the dog became visible as gregory saw cuff she sailed into the air whirled round and flew at the farmer he flung up his arms and warded off the body at the same time gregory felt a rush of air as if someone unseen had run past him and a stale muddy smell filled his nostrils staggering he looked behind him the wan light from the cowsheds spread across the path between the outhouses and the farmhouse beyond the light more distantly was the silent countryside behind the grain store nothing untoward could be seen they killed my old cuff said the farmer gregory knelt down beside him to look at the bitch there was no mark of injury on her but she was dead her fine head lying limp she knew there was something there gregory said she went to attack whatever it was and it got her first what was it whatever in the world was it they killed my old cuff said the farmer again unhearing he picked the body up in his arms turned and carried it towards the house gregory stood where he was mind and heart equally uneasy he jumped violently when a step sounded nearby it was bert neckland what did that there ghost kill the old bitch he asked it killed the bitch certainly but it was something more terrible than a ghost thats one of them ghosts bor i seen plenty in my time i ent afraid of ghosts are you you looked fairly sick in the cowshed a minute ago the farmhand put his fists on his hips he was no more than a couple of years older than gregory a stocky young man with a spotty complexion and a snub nose that gave him at once an air of comedy and menace is that so master gregory well you looks pretty funky standing there now i am scared i dont mind admitting it but only because we have something here a lot nastier than any specter neckland came a little closer then if you are so tilooming windy perhaps youll be staying away from the farm in the future certainly not he tried to edge back into the light but the laborer got in his way if i was you i should stay away he emphasized his point by digging an elbow into gregorys coat and just remember that nancy was interested in me long afore you comealong bor oh thats it is iti i think nancy can decide for herself in whom she is interested dont you im telling you who shes interested in see and mind you dont forget see he emphasized the words with another nudge gregory pushed his arm away angrily neckland shrugged his shoulders and walked off as he went he said youre going to get worse than ghosts if you keep hanging round here gregory was shaken the suppressed violence in the mans voice suggested that he had been harboring malice for some time unsuspectingly gregory had always gone out of his way to be cordial had regarded the sullenness as mere slow wittedness and done his socialist best to overcome the barrier between them he thought of following neckland and trying to make it up with him but that would look too feeble instead he followed the way the farmer had gone with his dead bitch and made for the house gregory rolles was too late back to cottersall that night to meet his friend fox the next night the weather became exceedingly chill and gabriel woodcock the oldest inhabitant was prophesying snow before the winter was out a not very venturesome prophecy to be fulfilled within fortyeight hours thus impressing most of the inhabitants of the village for they took pleasure in being impressed and exclaiming and saying well i never to each other the two friends met in the wayfarer where the fires were bigger though the ale was weaker than in the three poachers at the other end of the village seeing to it that nothing dramatic was missed from his account gregory related the affairs of the previous day omitting any reference to necklands pugnacity fox listened fascinated neglecting both his pipe and his ale so you see how it is bruce gregory concluded in that deep pond by the mill lurks a vehicle of some sort the very one we saw in the sky and in it lives an invisible being of evil intent you see how i fear for my friends there should i tell the police about it do you think im sure it would not help the grendons to have old farrish bumping out there on his pennyfarthing fox said referring to the local representative of the law he took a long draw first on the pipe and then on the glass but im not sure you have your conclusions quite right greg understand i dont doubt the facts amazing though they are i mean we were more or less expecting celestial visitants the worlds recent blossoming with gas and electric lighting in its cities at night must have been a signal to half the nations of space that we are now civ ilized down here but have our visitants done any deliberate harm to anyone they nearly drowned me and they killed poor cuff i dont see what youre getting at they havent begun in a very friendly fashion have they now think what the situation must seem like to them suppose they come from mars or the moonwe know their world must be absolutely different from earth they may be terrified and it can hardly be called an unfriendly act to try and get into your rowing boat the first unfriendly act was yours when you struck out with the oar gregory bit his lip his friend had a point i was scared it may have been because they were scared that they killed cuff the dog attacked them after all didnt she i feel sorry for these creatures alone in an unfriendly world you keep saying these as far as we know there is only one of them my point is this greg you have completely gone back on your previous enlightened attitude you are all for killing these poor things instead of trying to speak to them remember what you were saying about other worlds being full of socialists try thinking of these chaps as invisible socialists and see if that doesnt make them easier to deal with gregory fell to stroking his chin inwardly he acknowledged that bruce foxs words made a great impression on him he had allowed panic to prejudice his judgment as a result he had behaved as immoderately as a savage in some remote corner of the empire confronted by his first steam locomotive id better get back to the farm and sort things out as soon as possible he said if these things really do need help ill help them thats it but try not to think of them as things think of them asas know as the aurigans aurigans it is but dont be so smug bruce if youd been in that boat i know old friend id have died of fright to this monument of tact fox added do as you say go back and sort things out as soon as possible im longing for the nert install ment of this mystery its quite the jouiest thing since sheriock holmes gregory rolles went back to the farm but the sorting out of which bruce had spoken took longer than he expected this was chiefly because the aurigans seemed to have settled quietly into their new home after the initial days troubles they came forth no more from the pond as far as he could discover at least they caused no more disturbance the young graduate particularly regretted this since he had taken his friends words much to heart and wanted to prove how enlightened and benevolent he was towards this strange form of life after some days he came to believe the aurigans must have left as unexpectedly as they arrived then a minor incident convinced him otherwise and that same night in his snug room over the bakers shop he described it to his correspondent in worcester park surrey dear mr wells i must apologize for my failure to write earlier owing to lack of news concerning the grendon farm affair only today the aurigans showed themselves againif in deed showed is the right word for invisible creatures nancy grendon and i were in the orchard feeding the hens there is still much snow lying about and everywhere is very white as the poultry came running to nancys tub i saw a disturbance further down the orchardmerely some snow dropping from an apple bough but the movement caught my eye and then i saw a procession of falling snow proceed towards us from tree to tree the grass is long there and i soon noted the stalks being thrust aside by an unknown agency i directed nancys attention to the phenomenon the motion in the grass stopped only a few yards from us nancy was startled but i determined to acquit myself more like a briton than i had previously accordingly i advanced and said who are you what do you want we are your friends if you are friendly no answer came i stepped forward again and now the grass again fell back and i could see by the way it was pressed down that the creature must have large feet by the movement of the grasses i could see he was running i cried to him and ran too he went round the side of the house and then over the frozen mud in the farmyard i could see no further trace of him but instinct led me forward past the barn to the pond surely enough i then saw the cold muddy water rise and heave as if engulfing a body that slid quietly in shards of broken ice were thrust aside and by an outward motion i could see where the strange being went in a flurry and a small whirlpool he was gone and i have no doubt dived down to the mysterious star vehicle these thingspeople know not what to call themmust be aquatic perhaps they live in the canals of the red planet but imagine siran invisible mankind the idea is almost as wonderful and fantastic as something from your novel the time machine pray give me your comment and trust in my sanity and accuracy as a reporter yours in friendship gregory rolles what he did not tell was the way nancy had clung to him after in the warmth of the parlor and confessed her fear and he had scorned the idea that these beings could be hostile and had seen the admiration in her eyes and had thought that she was after all a dashed pretty girl and perhaps worth braving the wrath of those two very different people for edward rolles his father and bert neckland the farm laborer it was at lunch a week later when gregory was again at the farm taking with him an article on electricity as a pretext for his visit that the subject of the stinking dew was first discussed grubby was the first to mention it in gregorys hearing grubby with bert neckland formed the whole strength of joseph grendons labor force but whereas neckland was considered couth enough to board in the farmhouse he had a gaunt room in the attic grubby was fit only to sleep in a little flintandchalk hut well away from the farm buildings his house as he dignified the miserable hut stood below the orchard and near the sties the occupants of which lulled grubby to sleep with their snorts reckon we ent ever had a dew like that before mr grendon he said his manner suggesting to gregory that he had made this observation already this morning grubby never ventured to say anything original heavy as an autumn dew said the farmer firmly as if there had been an argument on the point silence fell broken only by a general munching and from grubby a particular guzzling as they all made their way through huge platefuls of stewed rabbit and dumplings it werent no ordinary dew that i do know grubby said after a while it stank of toadstools neckland said or rotten pond water more munching it may be something to do with the pond gregory said some sort of freak of evaporation neckland snorted from his position at the top of the table the farmer halted his shovelling operations to point a fork at gregory you may well be right there because i tell you what that there dew only come down on our land and property a yard the other side of the gate the road was dry bone dry it was right you are there master neckland agreed and while the west field was dripping with the stuff i saw for myself that the bracken over the hedge werent wet at all ah its a rum go say what you like we ent ever had dew like it grubby said he appeared to be summing up the feeling of the company the strange dew did not fall again as a topic of conversa tion it was limited and even on the farm where there was little new to talk about it was forgotten in a few days the feb ruary passed being neither much worse nor much better than most februaries and ended in heavy rainstorms march came letting in a chilly spring over the land the animals on the farm began to bring forth their young they brought them forth in amazing numbers as if to over turn all the farmers beliefs in the unproductiveness of his land i never seen anything like it grendon said to gregory nor had gregory seen the taciturn farmer so excited he took the young man by the arm and marched him into the barn there lay trix the nannie goat against her flank huddled three little brown and white kids while a fourth stood nearby wobbling on its spindly legs four on em have you ever heard of a goat throwing off four kids you better write to the papers in london about this gregory but just you come down to the pig sties the squealing from the sties was louder than usual as they marched down the path towards them gregory looked up at the great elms their outlines dusted in green and thought he detected something sinister in the noises something hysterical that was perhaps matched by an element in grendons own bearing the grendon pigs were mixed breeds with a preponderance of large blacks they usually gave litters of something like ten piglets now there was not a litter without fourteen in it and one enormous black sow had eighteen small pigs swarming about her the noise was tremendous and standing looking down on this swarming life gregory told himself that he was foolish to imagine anything uncanny in it he knew so little about farm life after he had eaten with grendon and the men mrs grendon and nancy had driven to town in the trap gregory went by himself to look about the farm still with a deep and unreasoning sense of disturbance inside him a pale sunshine filled the afternoon it could not penetrate far down into the water of the pond but as gregory stood by the horse trough staring at the expanse of water he saw that it teemed with young tadpoles and frogs he went closer what he had regarded as a sheet of rather stagnant water was alive with small swimming things as he looked a great beetle surged out of the depths and seized a tadpole the tadpoles were also providing food for two ducks that with their young were swimming by the reeds on the far side of the pond and how many young did the ducks have an armada of chicks was there parading in and out of the rushes for a minute he stood uncertainly then began to walk slowly back the way he had come crossing the yard gregory went over to the stable and saddled daisy he swung himself up and rode away without bidding goodbye to anyone riding into cottersall he went straight to the market place he saw the grendon trap with nancys little pony hetty between the shafts standing outside the grocers shop mrs grendon and nancy were just coming out jumping to the ground gregory led daisy over to them and bid them good day we are going to call on my friend mrs edwards and her daughters mrs grendon said if you would be so kind mrs grendon i would be very obliged if i might speak privately with nancy my landlady mrs fenn has a little downstairs parlor at the back of the shop and i know she would let us speak there it would be quite respectable drat respectable let people think what they will i say all the same she stood for some time in meditation nancy remained by her mother with her eyes on the ground gregory looked at her and seemed to see her anew under her blue coat furtrimmed she wore her orangeandbrown squared gingham dress she had a bonnet on her head her complexion was pure and blemishless her skin as firm and delicate as a plum and her dark eyes were hidden under long lashes her lips were steady pale and clearly defined with appealing tucks at each corner he felt almost like a thief stealing a sight of her beauty while she was not regarding him im going on to mrs edwards marjorie grendon declared at last i dont care what you two do so long as you behavebut i shall mind if you arent with me in a halfhour nancy do you hear yes mother the bakers shop was in the next street gregory and nancy walked there in silence gregory shut daisy in the stable and they went together into the parlor through the back door at this time of day mr fenn was resting upstairs and his wife looking after the shop so the little room was empty nancy sat upright in a chair and said well gregory whats all this about fancy dragging me off from my mother like that in the middle of town nancy dont be cross i had to see you she pouted you come out to the old farm often enough and dont show any particular wish to see me there thats nonsense i always come to see youlately in particular besides youre more interested in bert neckland arent you bert neckland indeed why should i be interested in him not that its any of your business if i am it is my business nancy i love you nancy he had not meant to blurt it out in quite that fashion but now it was out it was out and he pressed home bis disadvantage by crossing the room kneeling at her feet and taking her hands in his nancy darling nancy say that you like me just a little encourage me somewhat you are a very fine gentleman gregory and i feel very kind towards you to be sure but but she gave him the benefit of her downcast eyes again your station in life is very different from mine and besideswell you dont do anything he was shocked into silence with the natural egotism of youth he had not seriously thought that she could have any firm objection to him but in her words he suddenly saw the truth of his position at least as it was revealed to her nancywell its true i do not seem to you to be working at present but i do a lot of reading and studying here and i write to several important people in the world and all the time i am coming to a great decision about what my career will be i do assure you i am no loafer if thats what you think no i dont think that but bert says you often spend a convivial evening in that there wayfarer oh he does does he and what business is it of his if i door of yours come to that what damned cheek she stood up if you have nothing left to say but a lot of swearing ill be off to join my mother if you dont mind oh by jove im making a mess of this he caught her wrist listen my sweet thing i ask you only this that you try and look on me favorably and also that you let me say a word about the farm some strange things are happening there and i seriously dont like to think of you being there at night all these young things being born all these little pigsits uncanny i dont see whats uncanny no more than my father does i know how hard he works and hes done a good job rearing his animals thats all hes the best farmer round cottersall by a long chalk oh certainly hes a wonderful man but he didnt put seven or eight eggs into a hedge sparrows nest did he he didnt fill the pond with tadpoles and newts till it looks like a broth did he something strange is happening on your farm this year nancy and i want to protect you if i can the earnestness with which he spoke coupled perhaps with his proximity and the ardent way he pressed her hand went a good way towards mollifying nancy dear gregory you dont know anything about farm life i dont reckon for all your books but youre very sweet to be concerned i shall always be concerned about you nancy you beautiful creature youll make me blush please do for then you look even lovelier than usual he put an arm around her when she looked up at him he caught her up close to his chest and kissed her fervently she gasped and broke away but not with too great haste oh gregory oh gregory i must go to mother now another kiss first i cant let you go until i get another he took it and stood by the door trembling with excitement as she left come and see us again soon she whispered with dearest pleasure he said but the next visit held more dread than pleasure the big cart was standing in the yard full of squealing piglets when gregory arrived the farmer and neckland were bustling about it the former greeted gregory cheerfully ive a chance to make a good quick profit on these little chaps old sows cant feed them but sucking pig fetches its price in norwich so bert and me are going to drive over to heigham and put them on the train theyve grown since i last saw them ah they put on over two pounds a day bert wed better get a net and spread over this lot or theyll be diving out theyre that lively the two men made their way over to the barn clomping through the mud mud squelched behind gregory he turned in the muck between the stables and the cart footprints ap peared two parallel tracks they seemed to imprint themselves with no agency but their own a cold flow of acute super natural terror overcame gregory so that he could not move the scene seemed to go gray and palsied as he watched the tracks come towards him the carthorse neighed uneasily the prints reached the cart the cart creaked as if something had climbed aboard the piglets squealed with terror one dived clear over the wooden sides then aterrible silence fell gregory still could not move he heard an unaccountable sucking noise in the cart but his eyes remained rooted on the muddy tracks those impressions were of something other than a man something with dragging feet that were in outline something like a seals flippers suddenly he found his voice mr grendon he cried only as the farmer and bert came running from the barn with the net did gregory dare look into the cart one last piglet even as he looked seemed to be deflating rapidly like a rubber balloon collapsing it went limp and lay silent among the other little empty bags of pig skin the cart creaked something splashed heavily off across the farmyard in the direction of the pond grendon did not see he had run to the cart and was staring like gregory in dismay at the deflated corpses neckland stared too and was the first to find his voice some sort of disease got em all just like that must be one of them there new diseases from the continent of europe its no disease gregory said he could hardly speak for his mind had just registered the fact that there were no bones left in or amid the deflated pig bodies its no diseaselook the pig that got away is still alive he pointed to the animal that had jumped from the cart it had injured its leg in the process and now lay in the ditch some feet away panting the farmer went over to it and lifted it out it escaped the disease by jumping out neckland said master we better go and see how the rest of them is down in the sties ah that we had grendon said he handed the pig over to gregory his face set no good taking one alone to market get grubby to unharness the horse meanwhile perhaps youd be good enough to take this little chap in to marjorie at least we can all eat a bit of roast pig for dinner tomorrow mr grendon this is no disease have the veterinarian over from heigham and let him examine these bodies dont you tell me how to run my farm young man ive got trouble enough despite this rebuff gregory could not keep away he had to see nancy and he had to see what occurred at the farm the morning after the horrible thing happened to the pigs he received a letter from his most admired correspondent mr h g wells one paragraph of which read at bottom i think i am neither optimist nor pessimist i tend to believe both that we stand on the threshold of an epoch of magnificent progresscertainly such an epoch is within our graspand that we may have reached the fin du globe prophesied by our gloomier fin de siecle prophets i am not at all surprised to hear that such a vast issue may be resolving itself on a remote farm near cottersall norfolkall unknown to anyone but the two of us do not think that i am in other than a state of terror even when i cannot help exclaiming what a lark too preoccupied to be as excited over such a letter as he would ordinarily have been gregory tucked it away in his jacket pocket and went to saddle up daisy before lunch he stole a kiss from nancy and planted another on her overheated left cheek as she stood by the vast range in the kitchen apart from that there was little pleasure in the day grendon was reassured to find that none of the other piglets had fallen ill of the strange shrinking disease but he remained alert against the possibility of it striking again meanwhile another miracle had occurred in the lower pasture in a tumbledown shed he had a cow that had given birth to four calves during the night he did not expect the animal to live but the calves were well enough and being fed from a bottle by nancy the farmers face was dull for he had been up all night with the laboring cow and he sat down thankfully at the head of the table as the roast pig arrived on its platter it proved uneatable in no time they were all flinging down their implements in disgust the flesh had a bitter taste for which neckland was the first to account its diseased he growled this here animal had the dis ease all the time we didnt ought to eat this here meat or we may all be dead ourselves inside of a week they were forced to make a snack on cold salted beef and cheese and pickled onions none of which mrs grendon could face in her condition she retreated upstairs in tears at the thought of the failure of her carefully prepared dish and nancy ran after her to comfort her after the dismal meal gregory spoke to grendon i have decided i must go to norwich tomorrow for a few days mr grendon he said you are in trouble here i believe is there anything any business i can transact for you in the city can i find you a veterinary surgeon there grendon clapped his shoulder i know you mean well and i thank ee for it but you dont seem to realize that vetinaries cost a load of money and arent always too helpful when they do come then let me do something for you joseph in return for all your kindness to me let me bring a vet back from norwich at my own expense just to have a look round nothing more blow me if you arent stubborn as they come im telling you same as my dad used to say if i finds any person on my land i didnt ask here im getting that there shotgun of mine down and im peppering him with buckshot same as i did with them two old tramps last year fair enough i suppose so then i must go and see to the cow and stop worrying about what you dont understand the visit to norwich took up the better part of gregorys next week consequently apprehension stirred in him when he again approached the grendon farm along the rough road from cottersall he was surprised to see how the countryside had altered since he was last this way new foliage gleamed everywhere and even the heath looked a happier place but as he came up to the farm he saw how overgrown it was great ragged elder and towering cow parsley had shol up so that at first they hid all the buildings he fancied the farm had been spirited away until spurring daisy on he saw the black mill emerge from behind a clump of nearby growth the south meadows were deep in rank grass even the elms seemed much shaggier than before and loomed threateningly over the house as he clattered over the flat wooden bridge and through the open gate into the yard gregory noted huge hairy nettles craning out of the adjoining ditches birds fluttered every where yet the impression he received was one of death rather than of life a great quiet lay over the place as if it were under a curse that eliminated noise and hope he realized this effect was partly because lardie the young bitch collie who had taken the place of cuff was not running up barking as she generally did with visitors the yard was deserted even the customary fowls had gone as he led daisy into the stables he saw a heavy piebald in the first stall and recognized it as dr crouchorns his anxieties took more definite shape since the stable was now full he led his mare across to the stone trough by the pond and hitched her there before walking over to the house the front door was open great ragged dandelions grew against the porch the creeper hitherto somewhat sparse pressed into the lower windows a movement in the rank grass caught his eye and he looked down drawing back his riding boot an enormous toad crouched under weed the head of a still writhing grass snake in its mouth the toad seemed to eye gregory fixidly as if trying to determine whether the man envied it its gluttony shuddering in disgust he hurried into the house muffled sounds came from upstairs the stairs curled round the massive chimneypiece and were shut from the lower rooms by a latched door gregory had never been invited upstairs but he didnot hesitate throwing the door open he started up the stairwell and almost at once ran into a body its softness told him that this was nancy she stood in the dark weeping even as he caught her and breathed her name she broke from his grasp and ran from him up the stairs he could bear noises more clearly now and the sound of cryingthough at the moment he was not listening nancy ran to a door on the landing nearest to the top of the stairs burst into the room beyond and closed it when gregory tried the latch he heard the bolt slide to on the other side nancy he called dont hide from me what is it whats happening she made no answer as he stood there baffled against the door the next door along the passage opened and doctor crouchorn emerged clutching his little black bag he was a tall somber man with deep lines on his face that inspired such fear into his patients that a remarkable percentage of them did as he bid and recovered even here he wore the top hat that simply by remaining constantly in position contributed to the doctors fame in the neighborhood whats the trouble doctor crouchorn gregory asked as the medical man shut the door behind him and started down the stairs has the plague struck this house or something equally terrible plague young man plague no it is something much more unnatural than that he stared at gregory unsmilingly as if promising himself inwardly not to move a muscle again until gregory asked the obvious what did you call for doctor the hour of mrs grendons confinement struck during the night he said a wave of relief swept over gregory he had forgotten nancys mother she had her baby was it a boy the doctor nodded in slow motion she bore two boys young man he hesitated and then a muscle in his face twitched and he said in a rush she also bore seven daughters nine children and they allthey all live gregory found grendon round the corner of the house the farmer had a pitchfork full of hay which he was carrying over his shoulder into the cowsheds gregory stood in his way but he pushed past i want to speak to you joseph theres work to be done pity you cant see that i want to speak about your wife grendon made no reply he worked like a demon tossing the hay down turning for more in any case it was difficult to talk the cows and calves closely confined seemed to set up a per petual uneasy noise of lowing and uncowlike grunts gregory followed the farmer round to the hayrick but the man walked like one possessed his eyes seemed sunk into his head his mouth was puckered until his lips were invisible when gregory laid a hand on his arm he shook it off stabbing up another great load of hay he swung back towards the sheds so violently that gregory had to jump out of his way gregory lost his temper following grendon back into the cowshed he swung the bottom of the twopart door shut and bolted it on the outside when grendon came back he did not budge joseph whats got into you why are you suddenly so heartless surely your wife needs you by her his eyes had a curious blind look as he turned them at gregory he held the pitchfork before him in both hands almost like a weapon as he said i been with her all night bor while she brought forth her increase but now she got a nursing woman from dereham cottages with her now i been with her all night now i got to see to the farm things keep growing you know theyre growing too much joseph stop and think ive no time for talking dropping the pitchfork he elbowed gregory out of the way unbolted the door and flung it open grasping gregory firmly by the biceps of one arm he began to propel him along to the vegetable beds down by the south meadows the early lettuce were gigantic here everything bristled out of the ground recklessly grendon ran among the lines of new green pulling up fistfuls of young radishes carrots spring onions scattering them over his shoulder as fast as he plucked them from the ground see gregoryall bigger than you ever seen cm and weeks early the harvest is going to be a bumper look at the fields look at the orchard with wide gesture he swept a hand towards the lines of trees buried in the mounds of snowand pink of their blossom whatever happens we got to take advantage of it it may not happen another year whyits like a fairy story he said no more turning he seemed already to have forgotten gregory eyes down at the ground that had suddenly achieved such abundance he marched back towards the sheds nancy was in the kitchen neckland had brought her in a stoup of fresh milk and she was supping it wearily from a ladle oh greg im sorry i ran from you i was so upset she came to him still holding the ladle but dangling her arms over his shoulders in a familiar way she had not used before poor mother i fear her mind is unhinged withwith bearing so many children shes talking such strange stuff as i never heard before and i do believe she fancies as shes a child again is it to be wondered at he said smoothing her hair with his hand shell be better once shes recovered from the shock they kissed each other and after a minute she passed him a ladleful of milk he drank and then spat it out in disgust ugh whats got into the milk is neckland trying to poison you or something have you tasted it its as bitter as sloes she pulled a puzzled face i thought it tasted rather strange but not unpleasant here let me try again no its too horrible some sloanes liniment must have got mixed in it despite his warning she put her lips to the metal spoon and sipped then shook her head youre imagining things greg it does taste a bit different tis true but theres nothing wrong with it youll stay to take a bite with us i hope no nancy im off now i have a letter awaiting me that i must answer it arrived when i was in norwich listen my lovely nancy this letter is from dr hudsonward an old aquaintance of my fathers he is headmaster of a school in gloucester and he wishes me to join the staff there as a teacher on most favorable terms so you see i may not be idle much longer laughing she clung to him thats wonderful my darling what a handsome schoolmaster you will make but gloucester thats over the other side of the country i suppose we shant be seeing you again once you get there nothings settled yet nancy youll be gone in a week and we shant never see you again once you get to that there old school you will never think of your nancy no more he cupped her face in his hands are you my nancy do you care for me her eyelashes came over her dark eyes greg things are so muddled here meanyes i do care i dread to think id not see you again recalling her saying that he rode away a quarter of an hour later very content at heartand entirely neglectful of the dangers to which he left her exposed rain fell lightly as gregory rolles made his way that evening to the wayfarer inn his friend bruce fox was already there ensconced in one of the snug seats of the inglenook on this occasion fox was more interested in purveying details of his sisters forthcoming wedding than in listening to what gregory had to tell and since some of his future brother inlaws friends soon arrived and had to buy and be bought libations the evening became a merry and thoughtless one and in a short while the ale having its good effect gregory also forgot what he wanted to say and began wholeheartedly to enjoy the company next morning he awoke with a heavy head and in a dismal state of mind the day was too wet for him to go out and take exercise he sat moodily in a chair by the window delaying an answer to dr hudsonward the headmaster lethargically he returned to a small leatherbound volume on serpents that he had acquired in norwich a few days earlier after a while a passage caught his particular attention most serpents of the venomous variety with the exception of the opisthoglyphs release their victims from their fangs after striking the victims die in some cases in but a few seconds while in other cases the onset of moribundity may be delayed by hours or days the saliva of some of the serpents contains not only venom but a special digestive virtue the deadly coral snake of brazil though attaining no more than a foot in length has this virtue in abundance accordingly when it bites an animal or a human being the victim not only dies in profound agony in a matter of seconds but his interiors parts are then dissolved so that even the bones become no more than jelly then may the little serpent suck all of the victim out as a kind of soup or broth from the original wound in its skin which latter alone remains intact for a long while gregory sat where he was in the window with the book open in his lap thinking about the grendon farm and about nancy he reproached himself for having done so little for his friends there and gradually resolved on a plan of action the next time he rode out but his visit was to be delayed for some days the wet weather had set in with more determination than the end of april and the beginning of may generally allowed gregory tried to concentrate on a letter to the worthy dr hudsonward in the county of gloucestershire he knew he should take the job indeed he felt inclined to do so but first he knew he had to see nancy safe the indecisions he felt caused him to delay answering the doctor until the next day when he feebly wrote that he would be glad to accept the post offered at the price offered but begged to have a week to think about it when he took the letter down to the postwoman in the three poachers the rain still fell one morning the rains were suddenly vanished the blue and wide east anglian skies were back and gregory saddled up daisy and rodeout along the mirey track he had so often taken as he arrived at the farm grubby and neckland were at work in the ditch unblocking it with shovels he saluted them and rode in as he was about to put the mare into the stables he saw grendon and nancy standing on the patch of waste ground under the windowless east side of the house he went slowly to join them noting as he walked how dry the ground was here as if no rain had fallen in a fortnight but this observation was drowned in shock as he saw the nine little crosses grendon was sticking into nine freshly turned mounds of earth nancy stood weeping they both looked up as gregory approached but grendon went stubbornly on with his task oh nancy joseph im so sorry about this gregory exclaimed to think that theyve allbut wheres the parson wheres the parson joseph why are you burying them with out a proper service or anything i told father but he took no heedl nancy exclaimed grendon had reached the last grave he seized the last crude wooden cross lifted it above his head and stabbed it down into the ground as if he would pierce the heart of what lay under it only then did he straighten and speak we dont need a parson here ive got no time to waste with parsons i have work to do if you ent but these are your children joseph what has got into you they are part of the farm now as they always was he turned rolling his shirt sleeves further up his brawny arms and strode off in the direction of the ditching activities gregory took nancy in his arms and looked at her tear stained face what a time you must have been having these last few days i thought youd gone to gloucester greg why didnt you come every day i waited for you to cornel it was so wet and flooded its been lovely weather since you were last here look how everything has grown it poured with rain every single day in cottersall well i never that explains why there is so much water flowing in the oast and in the ditches but weve had only a few light showers nancy tell me how did these poor little mites die id rather not say if you dont mind why didnt your father get in parson landon how could he be so lacking in feeling because he didnt want anyone from the outside world to know you seeoh i must tell you my dearits mother she has gone completely off her head completely it was the evening before last when she took her first turn outside the back door you dont mean to say she ow greg youre hurting my arms sheshe crept upstairs when we werent noticing and sheshe stifled each of the babies in turn greg under the best goose feather pillow he could feel the color leaving his cheeks solicitously she led him to the back of the house they sat together on the orchard railings while he digested the words in silence how is your mother now nancy shes silent father had to bar her in her room for safety last night she screamed a lot but this morning shes quiet he looked dazedly about him the appearance of everything was speckled as if the return of his blood to his head somehow infected it with a rash the blossom had gone almost entirely from the fruit trees in the orchard and already the embryo apples showed signs of swelling nearby broad beafas bowed under enormous pods seeing his glance nancy dipped into her apron pocket and produced a bunch of shining crimson radishes as big as tangerines have one of these theyre crisp and wet and hot just as they should be indifferently he accepted and bit the tempting globe at once he had to spit the portion out there again was that vile bitter flavor oh but theyre lovely nancy protested not even rather strange nowsimply lovely nancy dont you see something uncanny and awful is taking place here im sorry but i cant see otherwise you and your father should leave here at once leave here greg just because you dont like the taste of these lovely radishes how can we leave here where should we go see this here house my granddad died here and his father before him its our place we cant just up and off not even after this bit of trouble try another radish for heavens sake nancy they taste as if the flavor was intended for creatures with a palate completely different from ours oh he stared at her and perhaps they are nancy i tell you he broke off sliding from the railing neckland had come up from one side still plastered in mud from his work in the ditch his collariess shirt flapping open in his hand he grasped an ancient and militarylooking pistol ill fire this if you come nearer he said it goes okay never worry and its loaded master gregory now youre a going to listen to me bert put that thing away nancy exclaimed she moved forward to him but gregory pulled her back and stood before her dont be a bloody idiot neckland put it away ill shoot you bor ill shoot you i swear if you mucks about his eyes were glaring and the look on his dark face left no doubt that he meant what he said youre going to swear to me that youre going to clear off of this farm on that nag of yours and never come back again im going straight to tell my father bert nancy warned the pistol twitched if you move nancy i warn you ill shoot this fine chap of yours in the leg besides your father dont care about master gregory anymorehes got better things to worry him like finding out whats happening here gregory said listen neckland were all in trouble this farm is being run by a group of nasty little monsters you cant see them because theyre invisible the gun exploded as he spoke nancy had attempted to run off without hesitating neckland fired down at gregorys knees gregory felt the shot pluck his trouser leg and knew himself unharmed with knowledge came rage he flung himself at neckland and hit him hard over the heart falling back neckland dropped the pistol and swung his fist wildly gregory struck him again as he did so the other grabbed him and they began furiously hitting each other when gregory broke free neckland grappled with him again there was more pummeling of ribs let me go you swine gregory shouted he hooked his foot behind necklands ankle and they both rolled over onto the grass at this point a sort of flood bank had been raised long ago between the house and lowlying orchard down this the two men rolled fetching up sharply against the stone wall of the kitchen neckland got the worst of it catching his head on the corner and lay there stunned gregory found himself looking at two feet encased in ludicrous stockings slowly he rose to his feet and confronted mrs grendon at less than a yards distance she was smiling he stood there and gradually straightened his back looking at her anxiously so there you are jackie my jackalums she said the smile was wider now and less like a smile i wanted to talk to you you are the one who knows about the things that walk on the lines arent you i dont understand mrs grendon dont call me that there daft old name sonnie you know all about the little gray things that arent supposed to be there dont you oh those suppose i said i did know the other naughty children will pretend they dont know what i mean but you know dont you you know about the little gray things the sweat stood out on his brow she had moved nearer she stood close staring into his eyes not touching him but he was acutely conscious that she could touch him at any moment from the corner of his eye he saw neckland stir and crawl away from the house but there were other things to occupy him these little gray things he said did you save the nine babies from them the gray things wanted to kiss them you see but i couldnt let them i was clever i hid them under the good feather pillow and now even cant find them she began to laugh making a horrible low whirring sound in her throat theyre small and gray and wet arent they gregory said sharply theyve got big feet webbed like frogs but theyre heavy and short arent they and they have fangs like a snake havent they she looked doubtful then her eye seemed to catch a move ment she looked fixedly to one side here comes one now the female one she said gregory turned to look where she did nothing was visible his mouth was dry how many are there mrs grendon then he saw the short grass stir flatten and raise near at hand and let out a cry of alarm wrenching off his riding boot he swung it in an arc low above the ground it struck something concealed in thin air almost at once he received a terrific kick in the thigh and fell backwards despite the hurt fear made him jump up almost at once mrs grendon was changing her mouth collapsed as if it would run off one corner of her face her head sagged to one side her shoulders fell a deep crimson blush momentarily suffused her features then drained and as it drained she dwindled like a deflating rubber balloon gregory sank to his knees whimpering buried his face in his hands and pressed his hands to the grass darkness overcame him his senses must have left him only for a moment when he pulled himself up again the almost empty bag of womens clothes was still settling slowly to the ground joseph joseph he yelled nancy had fled in a distracted mixture of panic and fury he dragged his boot on again and rushed round the house towards the cowsheds neckland stood halfway between barn and mill rubbing his skull in his rattled state the sight of gregory apparently in full pursuit made him run away neckland gregory shouted he ran like mad for the other neckland bolted for the mill jumped inside tried to pull the door to lost his nerve and ran up the wooden stairs gregory bellowed after him the pursuit took them right to the top of the mill neckland had lost enough wit even to kick over the bolt of the trapdoor gregory burst it up and climbed out panting throughly cowed neckland backed towards the opening until he was almost out on the little platform above the sails youll fall out you idiot gregory warned listen neckland you have no reason to fear me i want no enmity between us theres a bigger enemy we must fight look he came towards the low door and looked down at the dark surface of the pond neckland grabbed the overhead pulley for security and said nothing look down at the pond gregory said thats where the aurigans live my godbert look there one goes the urgency in his voice made the farmhand look down where he pointed together the two men watched as a depression slid over the black water an overlapping chain of ripples swung back from it at approximately the middle of the pond the depression became a commotion a small whirlpool formed and died and the ripples began to settle theres your ghost bert gregory gasped that must have been the one that got poor mrs grendon now do you be lieve i never heard of a ghost as lived under water neckland gasped a ghost never harmed anyoneweve already had a sample of what these terrifying things can do come on bert shake hands understand i bear you no hard feelings oh come on man i know how you feel about nancy but she must be free to make her own choice in life they shook hands and grinned rather foolishly at each other we better go and tell the farmer what we seen neckland said i reckon that thing done what happened to lardie last evening lardie whats happened to her i thought i hadnt seen her today same as happened to the little pigs i found her just inside the barn just her coat was left thats all no insides like shed been sucked dry it took gregory twenty minutes to summon the council of war on which he had set his mind the party gathered in the farmhouse in the parlor by this time nancy had somewhat recovered from the shock of her mothers death and sat in an armchair with a shawl about her shoulders her father stood nearby with his arms folded looking impatient while bert neckland lounged by the door only grubby was not present he had been told to get on with the ditching im going to have another attempt to convince you all that you are in very grave danger gregory said you wont see it for yourselves the situation is that were all animals together at present do you remember that strange meteor that fell out of the sky last winter joseph and do you remember that ill smelling dew early in the spring they were not unconnected and they are connected with all thats happening now that meteor was a space machine of some sort i firmly believe and it brought in it a kind of life thatthat is not so much hostile to terrestrial life as indifferent to its quality the creatures from that machine call them aurigansspread the dew over the farm it was a growth accelerator a manure or fertilizer that speeds growth in plants and animals so much better for us grendon said but its not better the things grow wildly yes but the taste is altered to suit the palates of those things out there youve seen what happened you cant sell anything people wont touch your eggs or milk or meatthey taste too foul but thats a lot of nonsense well sell in norwich our produce is better than it ever was we eat it dont we yes joseph you eat it but anyone who eats at your table is doomed dont you understandyou are all fertilized just as surely as the pigs and chickens your place has been turned into a superfarm and you are all meat to the aurigans that set a silence in the room until nancy said in a small voice you dont believe such a terrible thing i suppose these unseen creatures told you all this grendon said truculently judge by the evidence as i do your wife must be brutal josephyour wife was eaten like the dog and the pigs as everything else will be in time the aurigans arent even cannibals they arent like us they dont care whether we have souls or intelligences any more than we really care whether bullocks have no ones going to eat me neckland said looking decidedly white about the gills how can you stop them theyre invisible and i think they can strike like snakes theyre aquatic and i think they may be oftly two feet tall how can you protectyourself he turned to the farmer joseph the danger is very great and not only to us here at first they may have offered us no harm while they got the measure of usotherwise id have died in your rowing boat now theres no longer doubt of their hostile intent i beg you to let me go to heigham and telephone to the chief of police in norwich or at least to the local militia to get them to come and help us the farmer shook his head slowly and pointed a finger at gregory you soon forgot them talks we had bor all about the coming age of socialism and how the powers of the state was going to wither away directly we get a bit of trouble you want to call in the authorities theres no harm here a few savage dogs like my old cuff cant handle and i dont say as i ent going to get a couple of dogs but youm a fule if you reckon im getting the authorities down here fine old socialist you turn out to be you have no room to talk about that gregory exclaimed why didnt you let grubby come here if you were a socialist youd treat the men as you treat yourself instead you leave him out in the ditch i wanted him to hear this discussion the farmer leant threateningly across the table at him oh you did did you since when was this your farm and grubby can come and go as he likes when its his so put that in your pipe and smoke it bor who do you just think you are he moved closer to gregory apparently happy to work off his fears as anger youre trying to scare us all off this here little old bit of ground ent you well the grendons ent a scaring sort see now ill tell you something see that shotgun there on the wall that be loaded and if you ent off this farm by midday that shotgun ont be on that wall no more itll be here bor right here in my two hands and ill be letting you have it right where youll feel it most you cant do that father nancy said you know greg ory is a friend of ours for gods sake joseph gregory said see where your enemy lies bert tell mr grendon what we saw on the pond go on neckland was far from keen to be dragged into this argument he scratched his head drew a redandwhite spotted kerchief from round his neck to wipe his face and muttered we saw a sort of ripple on the water but i didnt see nothing really master gregory i mean it could have been the wind couldnt it now you be warned gregory the farmer repeated you be off my land by noon by the sun and that mare of yours or i ont answer for it he marched out into the pale sunshine and neckland followed nancy and gregory stood staring at each other he took her hands and they were cold you believe what i was saying nancy is that why the food did at one point taste bad to us and then soon tasted well enough again it can only have been that at that time your systems were not fully adjusted to the poison now they are youre being fed up nancy just like the livestockim sure of it i fear for you darling love i fear so much what are we to do come back to cottersall with me mrs fenn has another fine little drawing room upstairs that im sure she would rent now youre talking nonsense greg how can i what would people say no you go away for now and let the tempest of fathers wrath abate and if you could come back tomorrow you will find he will be milder for sure because i plan to wait on him tonight and talk to him about you why hes half daft with grief and doesnt know what he says all right my darling but stay inside as much as you can the aurigans have not come indoors yet as far as we know and it may be safer here and lock all the doors and put the shutters over the windows before you go to bed and get your father to take that shotgun of his upstairs with him the evenings were lengthening with confidence towards summer now and bruce fox arrived home before sunset as he jumped from his bicycle this evening he found his friend gregory impatiently awaiting him they went indoors together and while fox ate a large tea gregory told him what had been happening at the farm that day youre in trouble fox said look tomorrows sunday ill skip church and come out with you you need help joseph may shoot me hell be certain to if i bring along a stranger you can help me tonight by telling me where i can purchase a young dog straightaway to protect nancy nonsense im coming with you i cant bear hearing all this at secondhand anyhow well pick up a pup in any eventthe blacksmith has a litter to be rid of have you got any plan of action plan no not really you must have a plan grendon doesnt scare too easily does he i imagine hes scared well enough nancy says hes scared he just isnt imaginative enough to see what he can do but carry on working as hard as possible look i know these farmers they wont believe anything till you rub their noses in it what we must do is show him an aurigan oh splendid bruce and how do you catch one you trap one dont forget theyre invisiblehey bruce yes by jove youre right ive the very idea look weve nothing more to worry about if we can trap one we can trap the lot however many there are and we can kill the little horrors when we have trapped them fox grinned over the top of a chunk of cherry cake were agreed i suppose that these aurigans arent socialist utopians any longer it helped a great deal gregory thought to be able to visualize roughly what the alien life form looked like the volume on serpents had been a happy find for not only did it give an idea of how the aurigans must be able to digest their prey so rapidlya kind of soup or brothbut presumably it gave a clue to their appearance to live in a space machine they would probably be fairly small and they seemed to be semiaquatic it all went to make up a picture of a strange being skin perhaps scaled like a fish great flipper feet like a frog barrellike diminutive stature and a tiny head with two great fangs in the jaw there was no doubt but that the invisibility cloaked a really uglylooking dwarf as the macabre image passed through his head gregory and bruce fox were preparing their trap fortunately grendon had offered no resistance to their entering the farm nancy had evidently spoken to good effect and he had suffered another shock five fowls had been reduced to little but feathers and skin that morning almost before his eyes and he was as a result sullen and indifferent of what went on now he was out in a distant field working and the two young men were allowed to carry out their plans unmolestedthough not without anoc casional anxious glance at the pondwhile a worried nancy looked on from the farmhouse window she had with her a sturdy young mongrel dog of eight months which gregory and bruce had brought along called gyp grendon had obtained two ferocious hounds from a distant neighbor these widemouthed brutes were secured on long running chains that enabled them to patrol from the horse trough by the pond down the west side of the house almost to the elms and the bridge leading over to west field they barked stridently most of the time and seemed to cause a general unease among the other animals all of which gave voice restlessly this forenoon the dogs would be a difficulty nancy had said for they refused to touch any of the food the farm could provide it was hoped they would take it when they became hungry enough grendon had planted a great board by the farm gate and on the board had painted a notice telling everyone to keep away armed with pitchforks the two young men carried flour sacks out from the mill and placed them at strategic positions across the yard as far as the gate gregory went to the cowsheds and led out one of the calves there on a length of binder twine under the very teeth of the barking dogshe only hoped they would prove as hostile to the aurigans as they seemed to be to human life as he was pulling the calf across the yard grubby appeared youd better stay away from us grubby were trying to trap one of the ghosts master if i catch one i shall strangle him straight i will a pitchfork is a better weapon these ghosts are dangerous little beasts at close quarters im strong bor i tell ee id strangle un to prove his point grubby rolled his striped and tattered sleeve even further up his arm and exposed to gregory and fox his enormous biceps at the same time he wagged his great heavy head and lolled his tongue out of his mouth perhaps to demonstrate some of the effects of strangulation its a very fine arm gregory agreed but look grubby we have a better idea we are going to do this ghost to death with pitchforks if you want to join in youd better get a spare one from the stable grubby looked at him with a slyshy expression and stroked his throat id be better at strangling bor ive always wanted to strangle someone why should you want to do that grubby the laborer lowered his voice i always wanted to see how difficult it would be im strong you see i got my strength up as a lad by doing some of this here stranglingbut never men you know just cattle backing away a pace gregory said this time grubby its pitchforks for us to settle the issue he went into the stables got a pitchfork and returned to thrust it into grubbys hand lets get on with it fox said they were all ready to start fox and grubby crouched down in the ditch on either side of the gate weapons at the ready gregory emptied one of the bags of flour over the yard in a patch just before the gate so that anyone leaving the farm would have to walk through it then he led the calf towards the pond the young animal set up an uneasy mooing and most of the beasts nearby seemed to answer the chickens and hens scattered about the yard in the pale sunshine as if demented gregory felt the sweat trickle down his back although his skin was cold with the chemistries of suspense with a slap on its rump he forced the calf into the water of the pond it stood there unhappily until he led it out again and slowly back across the yard past the mill and the grain store on his right past mrs grendons neglected flowerbed on his left towards the gate where his allies waited and for all his determination not to do so he could not stop himself looking backwards at the leaden surface of the pond to see if anything followed him he led the calf through the gate and stopped no tracks but his and the calfs showed in the strewn flour try it again fox advised perhaps they are taking a nap down there gregory went through the routine again and a third and fourth time on each occasion smoothing the flour after he had been through it each time he saw nancy watching helplessly from the house each time he felt a little more sick with tension yet when it happened it took him by surprise he had got the calf to the gate for a fifth time when foxs shout joined the chorus of animal noises the pond had shown no special ripple so the aurigan had come from some darkpurposed prowl of the farmsuddenly its finned footsteps were marking the flour veiling with excitement gregory dropped the rope that led the calf and ducked to one side seizing up an opened bag of flour by the gatepost he flung its contents before the advancing figure the bomb of flour exploded all over the aurigan now it was revealed in chalky outline despite himself gregory found himself screaming in sheer fright as the ghastliness was revealed in whirling white it was especially the size that frightened this dread thing remote from human form was too big for earthly natureten feet high perhaps twelve invincible and horribly quick it came rushing at him with unnumbered arms striking out towards him next morning dr crouchorn and his silk hat appeared at gregorys bedside thanked mrs fenn for some hot water and dressed gregorys leg wound you got off lightly considering the old man said but if you will take a piece of advice from me mr rolles you will cease to visit the grendon farm its an evil place and youll come to no good there gregory nodded he had told the doctor nothing except that grendon had run up and shot him in the leg which was true enough but that it omitted most of the story when will i be up again doctor oh young flesh heals soon enough or undertakers would be rich men and doctors paupers a few days should see you right as rain but ill be visiting you again tomorrow until then you are to stay flat on your back and keep that leg motionless i suppose i may write a letter doctor i suppose you may young man directly dr crouchorn had gone gregory took pen and paper and addressed some urgent lines to nancy they told her that he loved her very much and could not bear to think of her remaining on the farm that he could not get to see her for a few days because of his leg wound and that she must immediately come away on hetty with a bag full of her things and stay at the wayfarer where there was a capital room for which he would pay that if she thought anything of him she must put the simple plan into action this very day and send him word round from the inn when she was established there with somesatisfaction gregory read this through twice signed it and added kisses and summoned mrs fenn with the aid of a small bell she had provided for that purpose he told her that the delivery of the letter was a matter of extreme urgency he would entrust it to tommy the bakers boy to deliver when his morning round was over and would give him a shilling for his efforts mrs fenn was not enthusiastic about this but with a little flattery was persuaded to speak to tommy she left the bedroom clutching both letter and shilling at once gregory began another letter this one to mr h g wells it was some while since he had last addressed his correspondent and so he had to make a somewhat lengthy report but eventually he came to the events of the previous day so horrified was i by the sight of the aurigan that i stood where i was unable to move while the flour blew about us and how can i now convey to youwho are perhaps the most interested person in this vital subject in all the british isleswhat the monster looked like outlined in white my impressions were of course both brief and indefinite but the main handicap is that there is nothing on earth to liken this weird being to it appeared i suppose most like some horrendous goose but the neck must be imagined as almost as thick as the bodyindeed it was almost all body or all neck whichever way you look at it and on top of this neck was no head but a terrible array of various sorts of arms a nest of writhing cilia antennae and whips for all the world as if an octopus were entangled with a portuguese manowar as big as itself with a few shrimp and starfish legs thrown in does this sound ludicrous i can only swear to you that as it bore down on me perhaps twice my own height or more i found it something almost too terrifying for human eyes to look onand yet i did not see it but merely the flour that adhered to it that repulsive sight would have been the last my eyes ever dwelt on had it not been for grubby the simple farmhand i have had occasion to mention before as i threw the flour grubby gave a great cry and rushed forward dropping the pitchfork he jumped at the creature as it turned on me this put out our plan which was that he and bruce fox should pitchfork the creature to death instead he grasped it as high as he possibly might and commenced to squeeze with full force of his mighty muscles what a tetrifying contest what a fearfraught combat collecting his wits bruce charged forward and attacked with his pitchfork it was his battle cry that brought me back from my paralysis into action i ran and seized grubbys pitchfork and also charged that thing had arms for us all it struck out and i have no doubt that several arms held poisoned needle teeth for i saw one come towards me gaping like a snakes mouth need i stress the dangerparticularly when you recall that the effect of the flour cloud was only partial and there were still invisible arms flailing around us our saving was that the aurigan was cowardly i saw bruce jab it hard and a second later i rammed my pitchfork right through its foot at once it had had enough grubby fell to the ground as it retreated it moved at amazing speed back to wards the pool we were in pursuit and all the beasts of the barnyard uttered their cries to it as it launched itself into the water we both flung our pitchforks at its form but it swam out strongly and then dived below the surface leaving only ripples and a scummy trail of flour we stood staring at the water for an instant and then with common accord ran back to grubby he was dead he lay face up and was no longer recognizable the aurigan must have struck him with its poisoned fangs as soon as he attacked grubbys skin was stretched tight and glistened oddly he had turned a dull crimson no longer was he more than a caricature of human shape all his internal substance had been transformed to liquid by the rapidworking venoms of the aurigan he was like a sort of giant manshaped rotten haggis there were wound marks across his neck and throat and what had been his face and from these wounds his substance drained so that he slowly deflated into his trampled bed of flour and dust perhaps the sight of fabled medusas head that turned men to stone was no worse than this for we stood there utterly paralyzed it was a blast from farmer grendons shot gun that brought us back to life he had threatened to shoot me now seeing us despoiling his flour sacks and apparently about to make off with a calf he fired at us we had no choice but to run for it grendon was in no explaining mood good nancy came running out to stop him but neckland was charging up too with the pair of savage dogs growling at the ends of their chains bruce and i had ridden up on my daisy i had left her saddled bringing her out of the stable at a trot i heaved bruce up into the saddle and was about to climb on myself when the gun went off again and i felt a burning pain in my leg bruce dragged me into the saddle and we were off half unconscious here i lie now in bed and should be about again in a couple of days fortunately the shot did not harm any bones so you see how the farm is now a place of the damned once i thought it might even become a new eden growing the food of the gods for men like gods insteadalas the first meeting between humanity and beings from another world has proved disastrous and the eden is become a battleground for a war of worlds how can our anticipations for the future be anything other than gloomy before i close this overlong account i must answer a query in your letter and pose another to you more personal than yours to me first you question if the aurigans are entirely invisible and sayif i may quote your letterany alteration in the refrac tive index of the eye lenses would make vision impossible but without such alteration the eyes would be visible as glassy globules and for vision it is also necessary that there should be visual purple behind the retina and an opaque cornea how then do your aurigans manage for vision the answer must be that they do without eyesight as we know it for i think they naturally maintain a complete invisibility how they see i know not but whatever sense they use it is effective how they communicate i know notour fellow made not the slightest sound when i speared his footyet it is apparent they must communicate effectively perhaps they tried originally to communicate with us through a mysterious sense we do not possess and on receiving no answer assumed us to be as dumb as our dumb animals if so what a tragedy now to my personal inquiry i know sir that you must grow more busy as you grow more famous but i feel that what transpires here in this remote corner of east anglia is of momentous import to the world and the future could you not take it upon yourself to pay us a visit here you would be comfortable at one of our two inns and the journey here by railway is efficient if tediousyou can easily get a regular wagon from heigham station here a distance of only eight miles you could then view grendons farm for yourself and perhaps one of these interstellar beings too i feel you are as much amused as concerned by the accounts you receive from the undersigned but i swear not one detail is exaggerated say you can come if you need persuasion reflect on how much delight it will give to your sincere admirer gregory rolles reading this long letter through scratching out two superfluous adjectives gregory lay back in some satisfaction he had the feeling he was still involved in the struggle although temporarily out of action but the later afternoon brought him disquieting news tommy the bakers boy had gone out as far as the grendon farm then the ugly legends circulating in the village about the place had risen in his mind and he had stood wondering whether he should go on an unnatural babble of animal noise came from the farm mixed with hammering and when tommy crept forward and saw the farmer himself looking as black as a puddle and building a great thing like a gibbet in the yard he had lost his nerve and rushed back the way he came the letter to nancy undelivered gregory lay on the bed worrying about nancy until mrs fenn brought up supper on a tray at least it was clear now why the aurigans had not entered the farmhouse they were far too large to do so she was safe as long as she kept indoorsas far as anyone on that doomed plot was safe he fell asleep early that night in the early hours of the morning nightmare visited him he was in a strange city where all the buildings were new and the people wore shining clothes in one square grew a tree the gregory in the dream stood in a special relationship to the tree he fed it it was a job to push people who were passing by the tree against its surface the tree was a saliva tree down its smooth bark ran quantities of saliva from red lips like leaves up in the boughs it grew enor mous on the people on which it fed as they were thrown against it they passed into the substance of the tree some of the saliva splashed on to gregory but instead of dissolving him it caused everything he touched to be dissolved he put his arms about the girl he loved and as his mouth went towards hers ter skin peeled away from her face he woke weeping desperately and fumbling blindly for the ring of the gas mantle dr crouchom came late next morning and told gregory he should have at least three more days complete rest for the recovery of the muscles of his leg gregory lay there in a state of acute dissatisfaction with himself recalling the vile dream he thought how negligent he had been towards nancy the girl he loved his letter to her still lay undelivered by his bedside after mrs fenn had brought up his dinner he determined that he must see nancy for himself leaving the food he pulled himself out of bed and dressed slowly the leg was more painful than he had expected but he got himself downstairs and out to the stable without too much trouble daisy seemed pleased to see him he rubbed her nose and rested his head against her long cheek in sheer pleasure at being with her again this may be the last time you have to undertake this particular journey my girl he said saddling her was comparatively easy getting into the saddle involved much bodily anguish but eventually he was comfortable and they turned along the familiar and desolate road to the domain of the aurigans his leg was worse than he had bargained for more than once he had to get the mare to stop while he let the throbbing subside he saw he was losing blood plentifully as he approached the farm he observed what the bakers boy had meant by saying grendon was building a gibbet a pole had been set up in the middle of the yard a cable ran to the top of it and a light was rigged there so that the expanse of the yard could be illuminated by night another change had taken place a wooden fence had been built behind the horse trough cutting off the pond from the farm but at one point ominously a section of it had been broken down and splintered and crushed as if some monstrous thing had walked through the barrier unheeding a ferocious dog was chained just inside the gate and barking its head off to the consternation of the poultry gregory dared not enter as he stood wondering the best way to tackle this fresh problem the door of the farmhouse opened fractionally and nancy peeped out he called and signalled frantically to her timidly she ran across and let him in dragging the dog back gregory kissed her cheek soothed by the feel of her sturdy body in his arms wheres your father my dearest your leg your poor leg its bleeding yet never mind my leg wheres your father hes down in south meadow i think good im going to speak with him nancy i want you to go indoors and pack some belongings im taking you away with me i cant leave father you must im going to tell him now as he limped across the yard she called fearfully he has that there gun of hisn with him all the timedo be careful the two dogs on a running chain followed him all the way down to the side of the house nearly choking in their efforts to get at him their teeth flashing uncomfortably close to his ankles he noticed neckland below grubbys little hut busy sawing wood the farmer was not with him on impulse gregory turned into the sties it was gloomy there in the gloom grendon worked he dropped his bucket when he saw gregory there and came forward threateningly you came back why dont you stay away cant you see the notice by the gate i dont want you here no more bor i know you mean well and i intend you no harm but ill kill ee understand kill ee if you ever come here again ive plenty of worries without you to add to them now then get you going gregory stood his ground mr grendon are you as mad as your wife was before she died do you understand that you may meet grubbys fate at any moment do you realize what you are harboring in your pond i ent a fule but suppose them there things do eat everything humans included suppose this is now their farm they still got to have someone to tend it so i reckon they ent going to harm me so long as they sees me work hard they ent going to harm me youre being fattened do you understand for all the hard work you do you must have put on a stone this last month doesnt that scare you something of the farmers pose broke for a moment he cast a wild look round i ent saying i ent scaredim saying im doing what i have to do we dont own our lives now do me a favor and get out of here instinctively gregorys glance had followed grendons for the first time he saw in the dimness the size of the pigs their great broad black backs were visible over the top of the sties they were the size of young oxen this is a farm of death he said deaths always the end of all of us pig or cow or man alike rightho mr grendon you can think like that if you like its not my way of thinking nor am i going to see your dependents suffer from your madness mr grendon sir i wish to ask for your daughters hand in marriage for the first three days that she was away from her home nancy grendon lay in her room in the wayfarer near to death it seemed as if all ordinary food poisoned her but gradually under doctor crouchorns ministrationterrified perhaps by the rage she suspected he would vent upon her should she fail to get bettershe recovered her strength you look so much better today gregory said clasping her hand youll soon be up and about again once your system is free of all the evil nourishment of the farm greg dearest promise me you will not go to the farm again you have no need to go now im not there he cast his eyes down and said then you dont have to get me to promise do you i just want to be sure we neither of us go there again father i feel sure bears a charmed life its as if i was now coming to my senses againbut i dont want it to be as if you was losing yours supposing those things followed us here to cottersall those aurigans you know nancy ive wondered several times why they remain on the farm as they do you would think that once they found they could so easily defeat human beings they would attack everyone or send for more of their own kind and try to invade us yet they seem perfectly content to remain in that one small space she smiled i may not be very clever compared with you but i can tell ee the answer to that one they ent interested in going anywhere i think theres just two of them and they come to our little old world for a holiday in their space machine same as we might go to great yarmouth for a couple of days for our honeymoon perhaps theyre on their honeymoon on honeymoon what a ghastly idea well on holiday then that was fathers ideahe says as theres just two of them treating earth as a quiet place to stay people like to eat well when theyre on holiday dont they he stared at nancy aghast but thats horrible youre trying to make the aurigans out to be pleasant of course i ent you silly haporth but i expect they seem pleasant to each other well i prefer to think of them as menaces all the more reason for you to keep away from them but to be out of sight was not to be out of minds reach gregory received another letter from dr hudsonward a kind and encouraging one but he made no attempt to answer it he felt he could not bear to take up any work that would remove him from the neighborhood although the need to work in view of his matrimonial plans was now pressing the modest allowance his father made him would not support two in any comfort yet he could not bring his thoughts to grapple with such practical problems it was another letter he looked for and the horrors of the farm that obsessed him and the next night he dreamed of the saliva tree again in the evening he plucked up enough courage to tell fox and nancy about it they met in the little snug at the back of the wayfarers public bar a discreet and private place with red plush on the seats nancy was her usual self again and had been out for a brief walk in the afternoon sunshine people wanted to give themselves to the saliva tree and although i didnt see this for myself i had the distinct feeling that perhaps they werent actually killed so much as changed into something elsesomething less human maybe and this time i saw the tree was made of metal of some kind and was growing bigger and bigger by pumpsyou could see through the saliva to big armatures and pistons and out of the branches steam was pouring fox laughed a little unsympathetically sounds to me like the shape of things to come when even plants are grown by machinery events are preying on your mind greg listen my sister is going to norwich tomorrow driving in her uncles trap why dont the two of you go with her shes going to buy some adornments for her bridal gown so that should interest you nancythen you could stay with gregs uncle for a couple of days i assure you i will let you know immediately the aurigans invade cottersall so you wont miss anything nancy seized gregorys arm can we please gregory can we i ent been to norwich for long enough and its a fine city it would be a good idea he said doubtfully both of them pressed him until he was forced to yield he broke up the little party as soon as he decently could kissed nancy goodnight and walked hurriedly back down the street to the bakers of one thing he was certain if he must leave the district even for a short while he had to have a look to see what was happening at the farm before he went the farm looked in the summers dusk as it had never done before massive wooden screens nine feet high had been erected and hastily creosoted they stood about in forlorn fashion intended to keep the public gaze from the farm but lending it unmeaning they stood not only in the yard but at irregular intervals along the boundaries of the land inappro priately among fruit trees desolately amid bracken irrelevantly in swamp a sound of furious hammering punctuated by the unwearying animal noises indicated that more screens were still being built but what lent the place its unearthly look was the lighting the solitary pole supporting the electric light now had five companions one by the gate one by the pond one behind the house one outside the engine house one down by the pig sties their hideous yellow glare reduced the scene to the sort of unlikely picture that might be found and puzzled over in the eternal midnight of an egyptian tomb gregory was too wise to try and enter by the gate he hitched daisy to the low branches of a thorn tree and set off over waste land entering grendons property by the south meadow as he walked stealthily towards the distant out houses he could see how the farm land differed from the territory about it the corn was already so high it seemed in the dark almost to threaten by its ceaseless whisper of movement the fruits had ripened fast in the strawberry beds were great strawberries like pears the marrows lay on their dunghill like bloated bolsters gleaming from a distant shaft of light in the orchard the trees creaked weighed down by distorted footballs that passed for apples with a heavy autumnal thud one fell overripe to the ground everywhere on the farm there seemed to be slight movement and noise so much so that gregory stopped to listen a wind was rising the sails of the old mill shrieked like a gulls cry as they began to turn in the engine house the steam engine pumped out its double unfaltering note as it gen erated power the dogs still raged the animals added their un easy chorus he recalled the saliva tree here as in the dream it was as if agriculture had become industry and the impulses of nature swallowed by the new god of science in the bark of the trees rose the dark steam of novel and unknown forces he talked himself into pressing forward again he moved carefully through the baffling slices of shadow and illumination created by the screens and lights and arrived near the back door of the farmhouse a lantern burnt in the kitchen window as gregory hesitated the crunch of broken glass came from within cautiously he edged himself past the window and peered in through the doorway from the parlor he heard the voice of grendon it held a curious muffled tone as if the man spoke to himself lie there youre no use to me this is a trial of strength oh god preserve me to let me prove myself thou has made my land barren till nownow let me harvest it i dont know what youre doing i didnt mean to presume but this here farm is my life curse em curse em all theyre all enemies there was more of it the man was muttering like one drunk with horrid fascination gregory was drawn forward till he had crossed the kitchen flags and stood on the verge of the larger room he peered round the half open door until he could see the farmer standing obscurely in the middle of the room a candle stood in the neglected hearth its flickering flame glassily reflected in the cases of maladroit animals evidently the house electricity had been cut off to give additional power to the new lights outside grendons back was to gregory one gaunt and unshaven cheek was lit by candlelight his back seemed a little bent by the weight of what he imagined his duties yet looking at that leatherclad back now gregory experienced a sort of reverence for the independence of the man and for the mystery that lay under his plainness he watched as grendon moved out through the front door leaving it hanging wide and passed into the yard still muttering to himself he walked round the side of the house and was hidden from view as the sound of his tread was lost amid the renewed barking of dogs the tumult did not drown a groan from near at hand peering into the shadows gregory saw a body lying under the table itrolled over crunching broken glass as it did so and exclaimed in a dazed way without being able to see clearly gregory knew it was neckland he climbed over to the man and propped his head up kicking away a stuffed fish as he did so dont kill me bor i only want to get away from here bert its greg here bert are you badly hurt he could see some wounds the fellows shirt had been practically torn from his back and the flesh on his side and back was cut from where he had rolled in the glass more serious was a great weal over one shoulder changing to a deeper color as gregory looked at it wiping his face and speaking in a more rational voice neckland said gregory i thought as you was down cotter sail what you doing here hell kill you proper if he finds you here what happened to you bert can you get up the laborer was again in possession of his faculties he grabbed gregorys forearm and said imploringly keep your voice down for christs sake or hell hear us and come back and settle my hash for once for all hes gone clean off his head says as these pond things are having a holiday here he nearly knocked my head off my shoulder with that stick of his lucky i got a thick head what was the quarrel about i tell you straight bor i have got the wind up proper about this here farm they things as live in the pond will eat me and suck me up like they done grubby if i stay here any more so i run off when joe grendon werent looking and i come in here to gather up my traps and my bits and leave here at once this whole place i evil a bed of evil and it ought to be destroyed hell cant be worse than this here farm as he spoke he pulled himself to his feet and stood keeping his balance with gregorys aid grunting he made his way over to the staircase bert gregory said supposing we rush grendon and lay him out we can then get him in the cart and all leave together neckland turned to stare at him his face hidden in shadows nursing his shoulder with one hand you try it he said and then he turned and went steadily up the stairs gregory stood where he was keeping one eye on the window he had come to the farm without any clear notion in his head but now that the idea had been formulated he saw that it was up to him to try and remove grendon from his farm he felt obliged to do it for although he had lost his former regard for grendon a sort of fascination for the man held him and he was incapable of leaving any human being however perverse to face alone the alien horrors of the farm it occurred to him that he might get help from the distant houses dereham cottages if only the farmer were rendered in one way or another unable to pepper the intruders with shot the machine house possessed only one high window and that was barred it was built of brick and had a stout door which could be barred and locked from the outside perhaps it would be possible to lure grendon into there outside aid could then be obtained not without apprehension gregory went to the open door and peered out into the confused dark he stared anxiously at the ground for sight of a footstep more sinister than the farmers but there was no indication that the aurigans were active he stepped into the yard he had not gone two yards before a womans screams rang out the sound seemed to clamp an icy grip about gregorys ribs and into his mind came a picture of poor mad mrs grendon then he recognized the voice in its few shouted words as nancys even before the sound cut off he began to pelt down the dark side of the house as fast as he could run only later did he realize how he seemed to be running against a great army of animal cries loudest was the babel of the pigs every swine seemed to have some message deep and nervous and indecipherable to deliver to an unknown source and it was to the sties that gregory ran swerving past the giant screens under the high and sickly light the noise in the sties was deafening every animal was attacking its pen with its sharp hooves one light swung over the middle pen with its help gregory saw immediately how terrible was the change that had come over the farm since his last visit the sows had swollen enormously and their great ears clattered against their cheeks like boards their hirsute backs curved almost to the rafters of their prison grendon was at the far entrance in his arms he held the unconscious form of his daughter a sack of pig feed lay scattered by his feet he had one pen gate half open and was trying to thrust his way in against the flank of a pig whose mighty shoulder came almost level with his he turned and stared at gregory with a face whose blankness was more terrifying than any expression of rage there was another presence in the place a pen gate near gregory swung open the two sows wedged in the narrow sty gave out a terrible falsetto squealing clearly scenting the presence of an unappeasable hunger they kicked out blindly and all the other animals plunged with a sympathetic fear struggle was useless an aurigan was there the figure of death itself with its unwearying scythe and unaltering smile of bone was as easily avoided as this poisoned and unseen presence a rosy flush spread over the back of one of the sows almost at once her great bulk began to collapse in a moment her substance had been ingested gregory did not stay to watch the sickening action he was running forward for the farmer was again on the move and now it was clear what he was going to do he pushed into the end sty and dropped his daughter down into the metal food trough at once the sows turned with smacking jaws to deal with this new fodder his hands free grendon moved to a bracket set in the wall there lay his gun now the uproar in the sties had reached its loudest the sow whose companion had been so rapidly ingested broke free and burst into the central aisle for a moment she stoodmercifully for otherwise gregory would have been trampledas if dazed by the possibility of liberty the place shook and the other swine fought to get to her brick crumbled pen gates buckled gregory jumped aside as the second pig lumbered free and next moment the place was full of grotesque fighting bodies fighting their way to liberty he had reached grendon but the stampede caught them even as they confronted each other a hoof stabbed down on grendons instep groaning he bent forward and was at once swept underfoot by his creatures gregory barely had time to vault into the nearest pen before they thundered by nancy was trying pitifully to climb out of the trough as the two beasts to which she had been offered fought to kick their way free with a ferocious strengthwithout reasonalmost without con sciousnessgregory hauled her up jumped until he swung up on one of the overhead beams wrapped a leg round the beam hung down till he grasped nancy pulled her up with him they were safe but the safety was not permanent through the din and dust they could see that the gigantic beasts were wedged tightly in both entrances in the middle was a sort of battlefield where the animals fought to reach the opposite end of the building they were gradually tearing each other to piecesbut the sties too were threatened with demolition i had to follow you nancy gasped but father dont think he even recognized me at least gregory thought she had not seen her father trampled underfoot involuntarily glancing in that direction he saw the shotgun that grendon had never managed to reach still lying across a bracket on the wall by crawling along a traverse beam he could reach it easily bidding nancy sit where she was he wriggled along the beam only a foot or two above the heaving backs of the swine at least the gun should afford them some protection the aurigan despite all its ghastly differences from humanity would hardly be immune to lead as he grasped the oldfashioned weapon and pulled it up gregory was suddenly filled with an intense desire to kill one of the invisible monsters in that instant he recalled an earlier hope he had had of them that they might be superior beings beings of wisdom and enlightened power coming from a better society where higher moral codes directed the activities of its citizens he had thought that only to such a civilization would the divine gift of traveling through interplanetary space be granted but perhaps the opposite held true per haps such a great objective could be gained only by species ruthless enough to disregard more humane ends as soon as he thought it his mind was overpowered with a vast diseased vision of the universe where such races as dealt in love and kindness and intellect cowered forever on their little globes while all about them went the slayers of the universe sailing where they would to satisfy their cruelties and their endless appetites he heaved his way back to nancy above the bloody porcine fray she pointed mutely at the far end the entrance had crumbled away and the sows were bursting forth into the night but one sow fell and turned crimson as it fell sagging over the floor like a shapeless bag another passing the same spot suffered the same fate was the aurigan moved by anger had the pigs in their blind charging injured it gregory raised the gun and aimed as he did so he saw a giant hallucinatory column in the air enough dirt and mud and blood had been thrown up to spot the aurigan and render him partly visible gregory fired the recoil nearly knocked him off his perch he shut his eyes dazed by the noise and was dimly aware of nancy clinging to him shouting oh you marvellous man you marvellous man you hit that old bor right smack on target he opened his eyes and peered through the smoke and dust the shade that represented the aurigan was tottering it fell it fell among the distorted shapes of the two sows it had killed and corrupt fluids splattered over the paving then it rose again they saw its progress to the broken door and then it had gone for a minute they sat there staring at each other triumph and speculation mingling on both their faces apart from one badly injured beast the building was clear of pigs now gregory climbed to the floor and helped nancy down beside him they skirted the loathsome messes as best they could and staggered into the fresh air up beyond the orchard strange lights showed in the rear windows of the farmhouse its on fire oh greg our poor home is afire quick we must gather what we can all fathers lovely cases he held her fiercely bent so that he spoke straight into her face bert neckland did this he did it he told me the place ought to be destroyed and thats what he did lets go then no no nancy we must let it burn listen theres a wounded aurigan loose here somewhere we didnt kill him if those things feel rage anger spite theyll be set to kill us now dont forget theres more than one of em we arent going that way if we want to live daisys just across the meadow here and shell bear us both safe home greg dearest this is my home she cried in her despair the flames were leaping higher the kitchen windows broke in a shower of glass he was running with her in the opposite direction shouting wildly im your home now im your home now now she was running with him no longer protesting and they plunged together through the high rank grass when they gained the track and the restive mare they paused to take breath and look back the house was well ablaze now clearly nothing could save it sparks had carried to the windmill and one of the sails was ablaze about the scene the electric lights shone spectral and pale on the tops of their poles an occasional running figure of a gigantic animal dived about its own purposes suddenly there was a flash of lightning and all the electric lights went out one of the stampeding animals had knocked down a pole crashing into the pond it shortcircuited the system lets get away gregory said and he helped nancy on to the mare as he climbed up behind her a roaring sound developed grew in volume and altered in pitch abruptly it died again a thick cloud of steam billowed above the pond from it rose the space machine rising rising rising suddenly a sight to take the heart in awe it moved up into the soft night sky was lost for a moment began dully to glow was seen to be already tremendously far away desperately gregory looked for it but it had gone already beyond the frail confines of the terrestrial atmosphere an awful desolation settled on him the more awful for being irrational and then he thought and cried his thought aloud perhaps they were only holidaymakers here perhaps they enjoyed themselves here and will tell their friends of this little globe perhaps earth has a future only as a resort for millions of the aurigan kind the church clock was striking midnight as they passed the first cottages of cottersall well go first to the inn gregory said i cant well disturb mrs fenn at this late hour but your landlord will fetch us food and hot water and see that your cuts are bandaged im right as rain love but id be glad of your company i warn you you shall have too much of it from now on the door of the inn was locked but a light burned inside and in a moment the landlord himself opened to them all eager to hear a bit of gossip he could pass on to his custom so happens as theres a gentleman up in number three wishes to speak with you in the morning he told gregory very nice gentleman come on the night train only got in here an hour past off the wagon gregory made a wry face my father no doubt oh no sir his name is a mr wills or wells or wallshis signature was a mite difficult to make out wells mr wells so hes come he caught nancys hands shaking them in his excitement nancy one of the greatest men in england is here theres no one more profitable for such a tale as ours im going up to speak with him right away kissing her lightly on the cheek he hurried up the stairs and knocked on the door of number three
