vladimir ilych lenin founder of the soviet state and was educated in moscow and speaks fluent russian in caracas a spokesman for the venezuelan communist party said ilich is the son of a yearold marxist lawyer living miles west of caracas but neither father nor son belong to our party he told reporters he did not know where ilich was now book i the trawler plunged into the angry swells of the dark furious sea like an awkward animal trying desperately to break out of an impenetrable swamp the waves rose to goliathan heights crashing into the hull with the power of raw tonnage the white sprays caught in the night sky cascaded downward over the deck under the force of the night wind everywhere there were the sounds of inanimate pain wood straining against wood ropes twisting stretched to the breaking point the animal was dying two abrupt explosions pierced the sounds of the sea and the wind and the vessels pain they came from the dimly lit cabin that rose and fell with its host body a man lunged out of the door grasping the railing with one hand holding his stomach with the other a second man followed the pursuit cautious his intent violent he stood bracing himself in the cabin door he raised a gun and fired again and again the man at the railing whipped both his hands up to his head arching backward under the impact of the fourth bullet the trawlers bow dipped suddenly into the valley of two giant waves lifting the wounded man off his feet he twisted to his left unable to take his hands away from his head the boat surged upward bow and midships more out of the water than in it sweeping the figure in the doorway back into the cabin a fifth gunshot fired wildly the wounded man screamed his hands now lashing out at anything he could grasp his eyes blinded by blood and the unceasing spray of the sea there was nothing he could grab so he grabbed at nothing his legs buckled as his body lurched forward the boat rolled violently leeward and the man whose skull was ripped open plunged over the side into the madness of the darkness below he felt rushing cold water envelop him swallowing him sucking him under and twisting him in circles then propelling him up to the surfaceonly to gasp a single breath of air a gasp and he was under again and there was heat a strange moist heat at his temple that seared through the freezing water that kept swallowing him a fire where no fire should burn there was ice too an icelike throbbing in his stomach and his legs and his chest oddly warmed by the cold sea around him he felt these things acknowledging his own panic as he felt them he could see his own body turning and twisting arms and feet working frantically against the pressures of the whirlpool he could feel think see perceive panic and struggleyet strangely there was peace it was the calm of the observer the uninvolved observer separated from the events knowing of them but not essentially involved then another form of panic spread through him surging through the heat and the ice and the uninvolved recognition he could not submit to peace not yet it would happen any second now he was not sure what it was but it would happen he had to bethere he kicked furiously clawing at the heavy walls of water above his chest burning he broke surface thrashing to stay on top of the black swells climb up climb up a monstrous rolling wave accommodated he was on the crest surrounded by pockets of foam and darkness nothing turn turn it happened the explosion was massive he could hear it through the clashing waters and the wind the sight and the sound somehow his doorway to peace the sky lit up like a fiery diadem and within that crown of fire objects of all shapes and sizes were blown through the light into the outer shadows he had won whatever it was he had won suddenly he was plummeting downward again into an abyss again he could feel the rushing waters crash over his shoulders cooling the whitehot heat at his temple warming the icecold incisions in his stomach and his legs and his chest his chest was in agony he had been struckthe blow crushing the impact sudden and intolerable it happened again let me alone give me peace and again and he clawed again and kicked again until he felt it a thick oily object that moved only with the movements of the sea he could not tell what it was but it was there and he could feel it hold it hold it it will ride you to peace to the silence of darkness and peace the rays of the early sun broke through the mists of the eastern sky lending glitter to the calm waters of the mediterranean the skipper of the small fishing boat his eyes bloodshot his hands marked with rope burns sat on the stern gunnel smoking a gauloise grateful for the sight of the smooth sea he glanced over at the open wheelhouse his younger brother was easing the throttle forward to make better time the single other crewman checking a net several feet away they were laughing at something and that was good there had been nothing to laugh about last night where had the storm come from the weather reports from marseilles had indicated nothing if they had he would have stayed in the shelter of the coastline he wanted to reach the fishing grounds eighty kilometers south of la seynesurmer by daybreak but not at the expense of costly repairs and what repairs were not costly these days or at the expense of his life and there were moments last night when that was a distinct consideration tu es fatigué hein mon frèrehis brother shouted grinning at him va te coucher maintenant laissemoi faire daccordthe brother answered throwing his cigarette over the side and sliding down to the deck on top of a net a little sleep wont hurt it was good to have a brother at the wheel a member of the family should always be the pilot on a family boat the eyes were sharper even a brother who spoke with the smooth tongue of a literate man as opposed to his own coarse words crazy one year at the university and his brother wished to start a compagnie with a single boat that had seen better days many years ago crazy what good did his books do last night when his compagniewas about to capsize he closed his eyes letting his hands soak in the rolling water on the deck the salt of the sea would be good for the rope burns burns received while lashing equipment that did not care to stay put in the storm look over there it was his brother apparently sleep was to be denied by sharp family eyes what is it he yelled port bow theres a man in the water hes holding on to something a piece of debris a plank of some sort the skipper took the wheel angling the boat to the right of the figure in the water cutting the engines to reduce the wake the man looked as though the slightest motion would send him sliding off the fragment of wood he clung to his hands were white gripped around the edge like claws but the rest of his body was limpas limp as a man fully drowned passed from this world loop the ropes yelled the skipper to his brother and the crewman submerge them around his legs easy now move them up to his waist pull gently his hands wont let go of the plank reach down pry them up it may be the death lock no hes alive but barely i think his lips move but theres no sound his eyes also though i doubt he sees us the hands are free lift him up grab his shoulders and pull him over easy now mother of god look at his head yelled the crewman its split open he must have crashed it against the plank in the storm said the brother no disagreed the skipper staring at the wound its a clean slice razorlike caused by a bullet he was shot you cant be sure of that in more than one place added the skipper his eyes roving over the body well head for ile de port noir its the nearest island theres a doctor on the waterfront the englishman he practices when he can said the skippers brother when the wine lets him he has more success with his patients animals than with his patients it wont matter this will be a corpse by the time we get there if by chance he lives ill bill him for the extra petrol and whatever catch we miss get the kit well bind his head for all the good it will do look cried the crewman look at his eyes what about them asked the brother a moment ago they were grayas gray as steel cables now theyre blue the suns brighter said the skipper shrugging or its playing tricks with your own eyes no matter theres no color in the grave intermittent whistles of fishing boats clashed with the incessant screeching of the gulls together they formed the universal sounds of the waterfront it was late afternoon the sun a fireball in the west the air still and too damp too hot above the piers and facing the harbor was a cobblestone street and several blemished white houses separated by overgrown grass shooting up from dried earth and sand what remained of the verandas were patched latticework and crumbling stucco supported by hastily implanted pilings the residences had seen better days a number of decades ago when the residents mistakenly believed ile de port noir might become another mediterranean playground it never did all the houses had paths to the street but the last house in the row had a path obviously more trampled than the others it belonged to an englishman who had come to port noir eight years before under circumstances no one understood or cared to he was a doctor and the waterfront had need of a doctor hooks needles and knives were at once means of livelihood as well as instruments of incapacitation if one saw le docteuron a good day the sutures were not too bad on the other hand if the stench of wine or whiskey was too pronounced one took ones chances tant pishe was better than no one but not today no one used the path today it was sunday and it was common knowledge that on any saturday night the doctor was roaring drunk in the village ending the evening with whatever whore was available of course it was also granted that during the past few saturdays the doctors routine had altered he had not been seen in the village but nothing ever changed that much bottles of scotch were sent to the doctor on a regular basis he was simply staying in his house he had been doing so since the fishing boat from la ciotat had brought in the unknown man who was more corpse than man dr geoffrey washburn awoke with a start his chin settled into his collarbone causing the odor of his mouth to invade his nostrils it was not pleasant he blinked orienting himself and glanced at the open bedroom door had his nap been interrupted by another incoherent monologue from his patient no there was no sound even the gulls outside were mercifully quiet it was ile de port noirs holy day no boats coming in to taunt the birds with their catches washburn looked at the empty glass and the halfempty bottle of whiskey on the table beside his chair it was an improvement on a normal sunday both would be empty by now the pain of the previous night having been spiraled out by the scotch he smiled to himself once again blessing an older sister in coventry who made the scotch possible with her monthly stipend she was a good girl bess was and god knew she could afford a hell of a lot more than she sent him but he was grateful she did what she did and one day she would stop the money would stop and then the oblivions would be achieved with the cheapest wine until there was no pain at all ever he had come to accept that eventuality until three weeks and five days ago when the halfdead stranger had been dragged from the sea and brought to his door by fishermen who did not care to identify themselves their errand was one of mercy not involvement god would understand the man had been shot what the fishermen had not known was that far more than bullets had invaded the mans body and mind the doctor pushed his gaunt frame out of the chair and walked unsteadily to the window overlooking the harbor he lowered the blind closing his eyes to block out the sun then squinted between the slats to observe the activity in the street below specifically the reason for the clatter it was a horsedrawn cart a fishermans family out for a sunday drive where the hell else could one see such a sight and then he remembered the carriages and the finely groomed geldings that threaded through londons regent park with tourists during the summer months he laughed out loud at the comparison but his laughter was shortlived replaced by something unthinkable three weeks ago he had given up all hope of seeing england again it was possible that might be changed now the stranger could change it unless his prognosis was wrong it would happen any day any hour or minute the wounds to the legs stomach and chest were deep and severe quite possibly fatal were it not for the fact the bullets had remained where they had lodged selfcauterized and continuously cleansed by the sea extracting them was nowhere near as dangerous as it might have been the tissue primed softened sterilized ready for an immediate knife the cranial wound was the real problem not only was the penetration subcutaneous but it appeared to have bruised the thalamus and hippocampus fibrous regions had the bullet entered millimeters away on either side the vital functions would have ceased they had not been impeded and washburn had made a decision he went dry for thirtysix hours eating as much starch and drinking as much water as was humanly possible then he performed the most delicate piece of work he had attempted since his dismissal from macleans hospital in london millimeter by agonizing millimeter he had brushwashed the fibrous areas then stretched and sutured the skin over the cranial wound knowing that the slightest error with brush needle or clamp would cause the patients death he had not wanted this unknown patient to die for any number of reasons but especially one when it was over and the vital signs had remained constant dr geoffrey washburn went back to his chemical and psychological appendage his bottle he had gotten drunk and he had remained drunk but he had not gone over the edge he knew exactly where he was and what he was doing at all times definitely an improvement any day now any hour perhaps the stranger would focus his eyes and intelligible words would emerge from his lips even any moment the words came first they floated in the air as the early morning breeze off the sea cooled the room whos there whos in this room washburn sat up in the cot moved his legs quietly over the side and rose slowly to his feet it was important to make no jarring note no sudden noise or physical movement that might frighten the patient into a psychological regression the next few minutes would be as delicate as the surgical procedures he had performed the doctor in him was prepared for the moment a friend he said softly friend you speak english i thought you would american or canadian is what i suspected your dental work didnt come from the uk or paris how do you feel im not sure it will take awhile do you need to relieve your bowels what take a crapper old man thats what the pans for beside you the white one on your left when we make it in time of course im sorry dont be perfectly normal function im a doctor your doctor my name is geoffrey washburn whats yours what i asked you what your name was the stranger moved his head and stared at the white wall streaked with shafts of morning light then he turned back his blue eyes leveled at the doctor i dont know oh my god ive told you over and over again it will take time the more you fight it the more you crucify yourself the worse it will be youre drunk generally its not pertinent but i can give you clues if youll listen ive listened no you dont you turn away you lie in your cocoon and pull the cover over your mind hear me again im listening in your comayour prolonged comayou spoke in three different languages english french and some goddamned twangy thing i presume is oriental that means youre multilingual youre at home in various parts of the world think geographically whats most comfortable for you obviously english weve agreed to that so whats most uncomfortable i dont know your eyes are round not sloped id say obviously the oriental obviously then why do you speak it now think in terms of association ive written down words listen to them ill say them phonetically makwa tamkwon keesahsay the first thing that comes to mind nothing good show what the hell do you want something anything youre drunk weve agreed to that consistently i also saved your bloody life drunk or not i am a doctor i was once a very good one what happened the patient questions the doctor why not washburn paused looking out the window at the waterfront i was drunk he said they said i killed two patients on the operating table because i was drunk i could have gotten away with one not two they see a pattern very quickly god bless them dont ever give a man like me a knife and cloak it in respectability was it necessary was what necessary the bottle yes damn you said washburn softly turning from the window it was and it is and the patient is not permitted to make judgments where the physician is concerned sorry you also have an annoying habit of apologizing its an overworked protestation and not at all natural i dont for a minute believe youre an apologetic person then you know something i dont know about you yes a great deal and very little of it makes sense the man sat forward in the chair his open shirt fell away from his taut frame exposing the bandages on his chest and stomach he folded his hands in front of him the veins in his slender muscular arms pronounced other than the things weve talked about yes things i said while in coma no not really weve discussed most of that gibberish the languages your knowledge of geographycities ive never or barely heard ofyour obsession for avoiding the use of names names you want to say but wont your propensity for confrontationattack recoil hide runall rather violent i might add i frequently strapped your arms down to protect the wounds but weve covered all that there are other things what do you mean what are they why havent you told me because theyre physical the outer shell as it were i wasnt sure you were ready to hear im not sure now the man leaned back in the chair dark eyebrows below the dark brown hair joined in irritation now its the physicians judgment that isnt called for im ready what are you talking about shall we begin with that rather acceptable looking head of yours the face in particular what about it its not the one you were born with what do you mean under a thick glass surgery always leaves its mark youve been altered old man altered you have a pronounced chin i daresay there was a cleft in it its been removed your upper left cheekboneyour cheekbones are also pronounced conceivably slavic generations agohas minute traces of a surgical scar i would venture to say a mole was eliminated your nose is an english nose at one time slightly more prominent than it is now it was thinned ever so subtly your very sharp features have been softened the character submerged do you understand what im saying no youre a reasonably attractive man but your face is more distinguished by the category it falls into than by the face itself category yes youre the prototype of the white anglosaxon people see every day on the better cricket fields or the tennis court or the bar at mirabels those faces become almost indistinguishable from one another dont they the features properly in place the teeth straight the ears flat against the headnothing out of balance everything in position and just a little bit soft soft well spoiled is perhaps a better word definitely selfassured even arrogant used to having your own way im still not sure what youre trying to say try this then change the color of your hair you change the face yes there are traces of discoloration brittleness dye wear glasses and a mustache youre a different man id guess you were in your middle to late thirties but you could be ten years older or five younger washburn paused watching the mans reactions as if wondering whether or not to proceed and speaking of glasses do you remember those exercises the tests we ran a week ago of course your eyesights perfectly normal you have no need of glasses i didnt think i did then why is there evidence of prolonged use of contact lenses about your retinas and lids i dont know it doesnt make sense may i suggest a possible explanation id like to hear it you may not the doctor returned to the window and peered absently outside certain types of contact lenses are designed to change the color of the eyes and certain types of eyes lend themselves more readily than others to the device usually those that have a gray or bluish hue yours are a cross hazelgray in one light blue in another nature favored you in this regard no altering was either possible or required required for what for changing your appearance very professionally id say visas passport drivers licenses switched at will hair brown blond auburn eyescant tamper with the eyesgreen gray blue the possibilities are farranging wouldnt you say all within that recognizable category in which the faces are blurred with repetition the man got out of the chair with difficulty pushing himself up with his arms holding his breath as he rose its also possible that youre reaching you could be way out of line the traces are there the markings thats evidence interpreted by you with a heavy dose of cynicism thrown in suppose i had an accident and was patched up that would explain the surgery not the kind you had dyed hair and the removal of clefts and moles arent part of a restoration process you dont knowthat said the unknown man angrily there are different kinds of accidents different procedures you werent there you cant be certain good get furious with me you dont do it half often enough and while youre mad think what wereyou what areyou a salesman an executive with an international company specializing in the far east that could be it or a teacher of languages in a university somewhere thats possible too fine choose one now i i cant the mans eyes were on the edge of helplessness because you dont believe either one the man shook his head no do you no said washburn for a specific reason those occupations are relatively sedentary and you have the body of a man whos been subjected to physical stress oh i dont mean a trained athlete or anything like that youre no jock as they say but your muscle tones firm your arms and hands used to strain and quite strong under other circumstances i might judge you to be a laborer accustomed to carrying heavy objects or a fisherman conditioned by hauling in nets all day long but your range of knowledge i daresay your intellect rules out such things why do i get the idea that youre leading up to something something else because weve worked together closely and under pressure for several weeks now you spot a pattern im right then yes i had to see how youd accept what ive just told you the previous surgery the hair the contact lenses did i pass with infuriating equilibrium its time now theres no point in putting it off any longer frankly i havent the patience come with me washburn preceded the man through the living room to the door in the rear wall that led to the dispensary inside he went to the corner and picked up an antiquated projector the shell of its thick round lens rusted and cracked i had this brought in with the supplies from marseilles he said placing it on the small desk and inserting the plug into the wall socket its hardly the best equipment but it serves the purpose pull the blinds will you the man with no name or memory went to the window and lowered the blind the room was dark washburn snapped on the projectors light a bright square appeared on the white wall he then inserted a small piece of celluloid behind the lens the square was abruptly filled with magnified letters gemeinschaft bank bahnhofstrasse zurich zerosevenseventeentwelvezero fourteentwentysixzero what is it asked the nameless man look at it study it think its a bank account of some kind exactly the printed letterhead and address is the bank the handwritten numbers take the place of a name but insofar as they arewritten out they constitute the signature of the account holder standard procedure where did you get it from you this is a very small negative my guess would be half the size of a thirtyfive millimeter film it was implantedsurgically implantedbeneath the skin above your right hip the numbers are in your handwriting its your signature with it you can open a vault in zurich they chose the name jeanpierre it neither startled nor offended anyone a name as common to port noir as any other and books came from marseilles six of them in varying sizes and thicknesses four in english two in french they were medical texts volumes that dealt with injuries to the head and mind there were crosssections of the brain hundreds of unfamiliar words to absorb and try to understand lobus occipitalesand temporalis the cortexand the connecting fibers of the corpus callosum the limbic systemspecifically the hippocampusand mammillary bodiesthat together with the fornexwere indispensable to memory and recall damaged there was amnesia there were psychological studies of emotional stress that produced stagnate hysteriaand mental aphasia conditions which also resulted in partial or total loss of memory amnesia amnesia there are no rules said the darkhaired man rubbing his eyes in the inadequate light of the table lamp its a geometric puzzle it can happen in any combination of ways physically or psychologicallyor a little of both it can be permanent or temporary all or part no rules agreed said washburn sipping his whiskey in a chair across the room but i think were getting closer to what happened what i think happened which was asked the man apprehensively you just said it a little of both although the word little should be changed to massive massive shocks massive shocks to what the physical and the psychological they were related interwoventwo strands of experience or stimulae that became knotted how much sauce ha ve you had less than you think its irrelevant the doctor picked up a clipboard filled with pages this is your historyyour new historybegun the day you were brought here let me summarize the physical wounds tell us that the situation in which you found yourself was packed with psychological stress the subsequent hysteria brought on by at least nine hours in the water which served to solidify the psychological damage the darkness the violent movement the lungs barely getting air these were the instruments of hysteria everything that preceded itthe hysteriahad to be erased so you could cope survive are you with me i think so the head was protecting itself not the head the mind make the distinction its important well get back to the head but well give it a label the brain all right mind not head which is really the brain good washburn flipped his thumb through the pages on the clipboard these are filled with several hundred observations there are the normal medicinal insertsdosage time reaction that sort of thingbut in the main they deal with you the man himself the words you use the words you react to the phrases you employwhen i can write them downboth rationally and when you talk in your sleep and when you were in coma even the way you walk the way you talk or tense your body when startled or seeing something that interests you you appear to be a mass of contradictions theres a subsurface violence almost always in control but very much alive theres also a pensiveness that seems painful for you yet you rarely give vent to the anger that pain must provoke youre provoking it now interrupted the man weve gone over the words and the phrases time and time again and well continue to do so broke in washburn as long as theres progress i wasnt aware any progress had been made not in terms of an identity or an occupation but we are finding out whats most comfortable for you what you deal with best its a little frightening in what way let me give you an example the doctor put the clipboard down and got out of the chair he walked to a primitive cupboard against the wall opened a drawer and took out a large automatic handgun the man with no memory tensed in his chair washburn was aware of the reaction ive never used this not sure id know how to but i do live on the waterfront he smiled then suddenly without warning threw it to the man the weapon was caught in midair the catch clean swift and confident break it down i believe thats the phrase what break it down now the man looked at the gun and then in silence his hands and fingers moved expertly over the weapon in less than thirty seconds it was completely dismantled he looked up at the doctor see what i mean said washburn among your skills is an extraordinary knowledge of firearms army asked the man his voice intense once more apprehensive extremely unlikely replied the doctor when you first came out of coma i mentioned your dental work i assure you its not military and of course the surgery id say would totally rule out any military association then what lets not dwell on it now lets go back to what happened we were dealing with the mind remember the psychological stress the hysteria not the physical brain but the mental pressures am i being clear go on as the shock recedes so do the pressures until theres no fundamental need to protect the psyche as this process takes place your skills and talents will come back to you youll remember certain behavior patterns you may live them out quite naturally your surface reactions instinctive but theres a gap and everything in those pages tell me its irreversible washburn stopped and went back to his chair and his glass he sat down and drank closing his eyes in weariness go on whispered the man the doctor opened his eyes leveling them at his patient we return to the head which weve labeled the brain the physical brain with its millions upon millions of cells and interacting components youve read the books the fornix and the limbic system the hippocampus fibers and the thalamus the callosum and especially the lobotomic surgical techniques the slightest alteration can cause dramatic changes thats what happened to you the damage was physical its as though blocks were rearranged the physical structure no longer what it was again washburn stopped and pressed the man the recessed psychological pressures will alloware allowingyour skills and talents to come back to you but i dont think youll ever be able to relate them to anything in your past why why not because the physical conduits that permit and transmit those memories have been altered physically rearranged to the point where they no longer function as they once did for all intents and purposes theyve been destroyed the man sat motionless the answers in zurich he said not yet youre not ready youre not strong enough i will be yes you will the weeks passed the verbal exercises continued as the pages grew and the mans strength returned it was midmorning of the nineteenth week the day bright the mediterranean calm and glistening as was the mans habit he had run for the past hour along the waterfront and up into the hills he had stretched the distance to something over twelve miles daily the pace increasing daily the rests less frequent he sat in the chair by the bedroom window breathing heavily sweat drenching his undershirt he had come in through the back door entering the bedroom from the dark hallway that passed the living room it was simply easier the living room served as washburns waiting area and there were still a few patients with cuts and gashes to be repaired they were sitting in chairs looking frightened wondering what le docteurs condition would be that morning actually it wasnt bad geoffrey washburn still drank like a mad cossack but these days he stayed on his horse it was as if a reserve of hope had been found in the recesses of his own destructive fatalism and the man with no memory understood that hope was tied to a bank in zurichs bahnhofstrasse why did the street come so easily to mind the bedroom door opened and the doctor burst in grinning his white coat stained with his patients blood i did it he said more triumph in his words than clarification i should open my own hiring hall and live on commissions itd be steadier what are you talking about as we agreed its what you need youve got to function on the outside and as of two minutes ago monsieur jeanpierre noname is gainfully employed at least for a week how did you do that i thought there werent any openings what was about to be opened was claude lamouches infected leg i explained that my supply of local anesthetic was very very limited we negotiated you were the bartered coin a week if youre any good he may keep you on washburn paused although thats not terribly important is it im not sure any of this is a month ago maybe but not now i told you im ready to leave id think youd want me to i have an appointment in zurich and id prefer you function the very best you can at that appointment my interests are extremely selfish no remissions permitted im ready on the surface yes but take my word for it its vital that you spend prolonged periods of time on the water some of it at night not under controlled conditions not as a passenger but subjected to reasonably harsh conditionsthe harsher the better in fact another test every single one i can devise in this primitive menningers of port noir if i could conjure up a storm and a minor shipwreck for you i would on the other hand lamouche is something of a storm himself hes a difficult man the swelling in his leg will go down and hell resent you so will others youll have to replace someone thanks a lot dont mention it were combining two stresses at least one or two nights on the water if lamouche keeps to schedulethats the hostile environment which contributed to your hysteria and exposure to resentment and suspicion from men around yousymbolic of the initial stress situation thanks again suppose they decide to throw me overboard thatd be your ultimate test i suppose but i dont know how much good it would do if i drowned oh therell be nothing like that said washburn scoffing im glad youre so confident i wish i were you can be you have the protection of my presence i may not be christiaan barnard or michael de bakey but im all these people have they need me they wont risk losing me but you want to leave im your passport out in ways unfathomable my dear patient come on now lamouche wants you down at the dock so you can familiarize yourself with his equipment youll be starting out at four oclock tomorrow morning consider how beneficial a week at sea will be think of it as a cruise there had never been a cruise like it the skipper of the filthy oilsoaked fishing boat was a foulmouthed rendering of an insignificant captain bligh the crew a quartet of misfits who were undoubtedly the only men in port noir willing to put up with claude lamouche the regular fifth member was a brother of the chief netman a fact impressed on the man called jeanpierre within minutes after leaving the harbor at four oclock in the morning you take food from my brothers table whispered the netman angrily between rapid puffs on an immobile cigarette from the stomachs of his children its only for a week protested jeanpierre it would have been easierfar easierto offer to reimburse the unemployed brother from washburns monthly stipend but the doctor and his patient had agreed to refrain from such compromises i hope youre good with the nets he was not there were moments during the next seventytwo hours when the man called jeanpierre thought the alternative of financial appeasement was warranted the harassment never stopped even at nightespecially at night it was as though eyes were trained on him as he lay on the infested deck mattress waiting for him to reach the brink of sleep you take the watch the mate is sick you fill in get up philippe is writing his memoirs he cant be disturbed on your feet you tore a net this afternoon we wont pay for your stupidity weve all agreed fix it now the nets if two men were required for one flank his two arms took the place of four if he worked beside one man there were abrupt hauls and releases that left him with the full weight a sudden blow from an adjacent shoulder sending him crashing into the gunnel and nearly over the side and lamouche a limping maniac who measured each kilometer of water by the fish he had lost his voice was a grating staticprone bullhorn he addressed no one without an obscenity preceding his name a habit the patient found increasingly maddening but lamouche did not touch washburns patient he was merely sending the doctor a message dont ever do this to me again not where my boat and my fish are concerned lamouches schedule called for a return to port noir at sundown on the third day the fish to be unloaded the crew given until four the next morning to sleep fornicate get drunk or with luck all three as they came within sight of land it happened the nets were being doused and folded at midships by the netman and his first assistant the unwelcomed crewman they cursed as jeanpierre sangsue the leech scrubbed down the deck with a longhandled brush the two remaining crew heaved buckets of sea water in front of the brush more often than not drenching the leech with truer aim than the deck a bucketful was thrown too high momentarily blinding washburns patient causing him to lose his balance the heavy brush with its metallike bristles flew out of his hands its head upended the sharp bristles making contact with the kneeling netmans thigh merde alors désolé said the offender casually shaking the water from his eyes the hell you say shouted the netman i said i was sorry replied the man called jeanpierre tell your friends to wet the deck not me my friends dont make me the object of their stupidity they were the cause of mine just now the netman grabbed the handle of the brush got to his feet and held it out like a bayonet you want to play leech come on give it to me with pleasure leech here the netman shoved the brush forward downward the bristles scraping the patients chest and stomach penetrating the cloth of his shirt whether it was the contact with the scars that covered his previous wounds or the frustration and anger resulting from three days of harassment the man would never know he only knew he had to respond and his response was as alarming to him as anything he could imagine he gripped the handle with his right hand jamming it back into the netmans stomach pulling it forward at the instant of impact simultaneously he shot his left foot high off the deck ramming it into the mans throat tao the guttural whisper came from his lips involuntarily he did not know what it meant before he could understand he had pivoted his right foot now surging forward like a battering ram crashing into the netmans left kidney chesah he whispered the netman recoiled then lunged toward him in pain and fury his hands outstretched like claws pig the patient crouched shooting his right hand up to grip the netmans left forearm yanking it downward then rising pushing his victims arm up twisting it at its highest arc clockwise yanking again finally releasing it while jamming his heel into the small of the netmans back the frenchman sprawled forward over the nets his head smashing into the wall of the gunnel meesah again he did not know the meaning of his silent cry a crewman grabbed his neck from the rear the patient crashed his left fist into the pelvic area behind him then bent forward gripping the elbow to the right of his throat he lurched to his left his assailant was lifted off the ground his legs spiraling in the air as he was thrown across the deck his face and neck impaled between the wheels of a winch the two remaining men were on him fists and knees pummeling him as the captain of the fishing boat repeatedly screamed his warnings le docteur rappelons le docteur va doucement the words were as misplaced as the captains appraisal of what he saw the patient gripped the wrist of one man bending it downward twisting it counterclockwise in one violent movement the man roared in agony the wrist was broken washburns patient viced the fingers of his hands together swinging his arms upward like a sledgehammer catching the crewman with the broken wrist at the midpoint of his throat the man somersaulted off his feet and collapsed on the deck kwasah the whisper echoed in the patients ears the fourth man backed away staring at the maniac who simply looked at him it was over three of lamouches crew were unconscious severely punished for what they had done it was doubtful that any would be capable of coming down to the docks at four oclock in the morning lamouches words were uttered in equal parts astonishment and contempt where you come from i dont know but you will get off this boat the man with no memory understood the unintentional irony of the captains words i dont know where i came from either you cant stay here now said geoffrey washburn coming into the darkened bedroom i honestly believed i could prevent any serious assault on you but i cant protect you when youve done the damage it was provoked to the extent it was inflicted a broken wrist and lacerations requiring sutures on a mans throat and face and anothers skull a severe concussion and an undetermined injury to a kidney to say nothing of a blow to the groin thats caused a swelling of the testicles i believe the word is overkill it would have been just plain kill and i would have been the dead man if itd happened any other way the patient paused but spoke again before the doctor could interrupt i think we should talk several things happened other words came to me we should talk we should but we cant there isnt time youve got to leave now ive made arrangements now yes i told them you went into the village probably to get drunk the families will go looking for you every ablebodied brother cousin and inlaw theyll have knives hooks perhaps a gun or two when they cant find you theyll come back here they wont stop until they do find you because of a fight i didnt start because youve injured three men who will lose at least a months wages between them and something else thats infinitely more important whats that the insult an offislander proved himself more than a match for not one but three respected fishermen of port noir respected in the physical sense lamouches crew is considered the roughest on the waterfront thats ridiculous not to them its their honor now hurryget your things together theres a boat in from marseilles the captains agreed to stow you and drop you a halfmile offshore north of la ciotat the man with no memory held his breath then its time he said quietly its time replied washburn i think i know whats going through your mind a sense of helplessness of drifting without a rudder to put you on a course ive been your rudder and i wont be with you theres nothing i can do about that but believe me when i tell you you are not helpless you will find your way to zurich added the patient to zurich agreed the doctor here ive wrapped some things together for you in this oilcloth strap it around your waist what is it all the money i have some two thousand francs its not much but it will help you get started and my passport for whatever good it will do were about the same age and its eight years old people change dont let anyone study it its merely an official paper what will you do i wont ever need it if i dont hear from you youre a decent man i think you are too as ive known you but then i didnt know you before so i cant vouch for that man i wish i could but theres no way i can the man leaned against the railing watching the lights of ile de port noir recede in the distance the fishing boat was heading into darkness as he had plunged into darkness nearly five months ago as he was plunging into another darkness now there were no lights on the coast of france only the wash of the dying moon outlined the rocky shore they were two hundred yards from land the fishing boat bobbing gently in the crosscurrents of the inlet the captain pointed over the side theres a small stretch of beach between those two clusters of rock its not much but youll reach it if you swim to the right we can drift in another thirty forty feet no more than that only a minute or two youre doing more than i expected i thank you for that no need to i pay my debts and im one very much so the doctor in port noir sewed up three of my crew after that madness five months ago you werent the only one brought in you know the storm you know me you were chalk white on the table but i dont know you and i dont want to know you i had no money then no catch the doctor said i could pay when my circumstances were better youre my payment i need papers said the man sensing a source of help i need a passport altered why speak to me asked the captain i said i would put a package over the side north of la ciotat thats all i said you wouldnt have said that if you werent capable of other things i will not take you into marseilles i will not risk the patrol boats the sûreté has squadrons all over the harbor the narcotics teams are maniacs you pay them or you pay twenty years in a cell which means i can get papers in marseilles and you can help me i did not say that yes you did i need a service and that service can be found in a place where you wont take mestill the service is there you said it said what that youll talk to me in marseillesif i can get there without you just tell me where the skipper of the fishing boat studied the patients face the decision was not made lightly but it was made theres a café on rue sarrasin south of old harborle bouc de mer ill be there tonight between nine and eleven youll need money some of it in advance how much thats between you and the man you speak with ive got to have an idea its cheaper if you have a document to work with otherwise one has to be stolen i told you ive got one the captain shrugged fifteen hundred two thousand francs are we wasting time the patient thought of the oilcloth packet strapped to his waist bankruptcy lay in marseilles but so did an altered passport a passport to zurich ill handle it he said not knowing why he sounded so confident tonight then the captain peered at the dimly lit shoreline this is as far as we can drift youre on your own now remember if we dont meet in marseilles youve never seen me and ive never seen you none of my crew has seen you either ill be there le bouc de mer rue sarrasin south of old harbor in gods hands said the skipper signaling a crewman at the wheel the engines rumbled beneath the boat by the way the clientele at le bouc are not used to the parisian dialect id rough it up if i were you thanks for the advice said the patient as he swung his legs over the gunnel and lowered himself into the water he held his knapsack above the surface legs scissoring to stay afloat see you tonight he added in a louder voice looking up at the black hull of the fishing boat there was no one there the captain had left the railing the only sounds were the slapping of the waves against the wood and the muffled acceleration of the engines youre on your own now he shivered and spun in the cold water angling his body toward the shore remembering to sidestroke to his right to head for a cluster of rocks on the right if the captain knew what he was talking about the current would take him into the unseen beach it did he could feel the undertow pulling his bare feet into the sand making the last thirty yards the most difficult to cross but the canvas knapsack was relatively dry still held above the breaking waves minutes later he was sitting on a dune of wild grass the tall reeds bending with the offshore breezes the first rays of morning intruding on the night sky the sun would be up in an hour he would have to move with it he opened the knapsack and took out a pair of boots and heavy socks along with rolledup trousers and a coarse denim shirt somewhere in his past he had learned to pack with an economy of space the knapsack contained far more than an observer might think where had he learned that why the questions never stopped he got up and took off the british walking shorts he had accepted from washburn he stretched them across the reeds of grass to dry he could discard nothing he removed his undershirt and did the same standing there naked on the dune he felt an odd sense of exhilaration mingled with a hollow pain in the middle of his stomach the pain was fear he knew that he understood the exhilaration too he had passed his first test he had trusted an instinctperhaps a compulsionand had known what to say and how to respond an hour ago he was without an immediate destination knowing only that zurich was his objective but knowing too that there were borders to cross official eyes to satisfy the eightyearold passport was so obviously not his own that even the dullest immigration clerk would spot the fact and even if he managed to cross into switzerland with it he had to get out with each move the odds of his being detained were multiplied he could not permit that not now not until he knew more the answers were in zurich he had to travel freely and he had honed in on a captain of a fishing boat to make that possible you are not helpless you will find your way before the day was over he would make a connection to have washburns passport altered by a professional transformed into a license to travel it was the first concrete step but before it was taken there was the consideration of money the two thousand francs the doctor had given him were inadequate they might not even be enough for the passport itself what good was a license to travel without the means to do so money he had to get money he had to think about that he shook out the clothes he had taken from the knapsack put them on and shoved his feet into the boots then he lay down on the sand staring at the sky which progressively grew brighter the day was being born and so was he he walked the narrow stone streets of la ciotat going into the shops as much to converse with the clerks as anything else it was an odd sensation to be part of the human traffic not an unknown derelict dragged from the sea he remembered the captains advice and gutturalized his french allowing him to be accepted as an unremarkable stranger passing through town money there was a section of la ciotat that apparently catered to a wealthy clientele the shops were cleaner and the merchandise more expensive the fish fresher and the meat several cuts above that in the main shopping area even the vegetables glistened many exotic imported from north africa and the mid east the area held a touch of paris or nice set down on the fringes of a routinely middleclass coastal community a small café its entrance at the end of a flagstone path stood separated from the shops on either side by a manicured lawn money he walked into a butcher shop aware that the owners appraisal of him was not positive nor the glance friendly the man was waiting on a middleaged couple who from their speech and manner were domestics at an outlying estate they were precise curt and demanding the veal last week was barely passable said the woman do better this time or ill be forced to order from marseilles and the other evening added the man the marquis mentioned to me that the chops of lamb were much too thin i repeat a full inch and a quarter the owner sighed and shrugged uttering obsequious phrases of apology and assurance the woman turned to her escort her voice no less commanding than it was to the butcher wait for the packages and put them in the car ill be at the grocers meet me there of course my dear the woman left a pigeon in search of further seeds of conflict the moment she was out the door her husband turned to the shopowner his demeanor entirely different gone was the arrogance a grin appeared just your average day eh marcel he said taking a pack of cigarettes from his pocket seen better seen worse were the chops really too thin my god no when was he last able to tell but she feels better if i complain you know that where is the marquis of the dungheap now drunk next door waiting for the whore from toulon ill come down later this afternoon pick him up and sneak him past the marquise into the stables he wont be able to drive his car by then he uses jeanpierres room above the kitchen you know ive heard at the mention of the name jeanpierre washburns patient turned from the display case of poultry it was an automatic reflex but the movement only served to remind the butcher of his presence what is it what do you want it was time to degutturalize his french you were recommended by friends in nice said the patient his accent more befitting the quai dorsay than le bouc de mer oh the shopowner made an immediate reappraisal among his clientele especially the younger ones there were those who preferred to dress in opposition to their status the common basque shirt was even fashionable these days youre new here sir my boats in for repairs we wont be able to reach marseilles this afternoon may i be of service the patient laughed you may be to the chef i wouldnt dare presume hell be around later and i do have some influence the butcher and his friend laughed i would think so sir said the shopowner ill need a dozen ducklings and say eighteen chateaubriands of course good ill send our master of the galley directly to you the patient turned to the middleaged man by the way i couldnt help overhearing no please dont be concerned the marquis wouldnt be that jackass dambois would he i think someone told me he lived around here oh no sir replied the servant i dont know the marquis dambois i was referring to the marquis de chamford a fine gentleman sir but he has problems a difficult marriage sir very difficult its no secret chamford yes i think weve met rather short fellow isnt he no sir quite tall actually about your size id say really the patient learned the various entrances and inside staircases of the twostory café quicklya produce delivery man from roquevaire unsure of his new route there were two sets of steps that led to the second floor one from the kitchen the other just beyond the front entrance in the small foyer this was the staircase used by patrons going to the upstairs washrooms there was also a window through which an interested party outside could see anyone who used this particular staircase and the patient was sure that if he waited long enough he would see two people doing so they would undoubtedly go up separately neither heading for a washroom but instead to a bedroom above the kitchen the patient wondered which of the expensive automobiles parked on the quiet street belonged to the marquis de chamford whichever the middleaged manservant in the butcher shop did not have to be concerned his employer would not be driving it money the woman arrived shortly before one oclock she was a windswept blonde her large breasts stretching the blue silk of her blouse her long legs tanned striding gracefully above spiked heels thighs and fluid hips outlined beneath the tightfitting white skirt chamford might have problems but he also had taste twenty minutes later he could see the white skirt through the window the girl was heading upstairs less than sixty seconds later another figure filled the windowframe dark trousers and a blazer beneath a white face cautiously lurched up the staircase the patient counted off the minutes he hoped the marquis de chamford owned a watch carrying his canvas knapsack as unobtrusively as possible by the straps the patient walked down the flagstone path to the entrance of the restaurant inside he turned left in the foyer excusing himself past an elderly man trudging up the staircase reached the second floor and turned left again down a long corridor that led toward the rear of the building above the kitchen he passed the washrooms and came to a closed door at the end of the narrow hallway where he stood motionless his back pressed into the wall he turned his head and waited for the elderly man to reach the washroom door and push it open while unzipping his trousers the patientinstinctively without thinking reallyraised the soft knapsack and placed it against the center of the door panel he held it securely in place with his outstretched arms stepped back and in one swift movement crashed his left shoulder into the canvas dropping his right hand as the door sprang open gripping the edge before the door could smash into a wall no one below in the restaurant could have heard the muted forced entry nom de dieu she shrieked qui estce silence the marquis de chamford spun off the naked body of the blond woman sprawling over the edge of the bed onto the floor he was a sight from a comic opera still wearing his starched shirt the tie knotted in place and on his feet black silk kneelength socks but that was all he wore the woman grabbed the covers doing her best to lessen the indelicacy of the moment the patient issued his commands swiftly dont raise your voices no one will be hurt if you do exactly as i say my wife hired you cried chamford his words slurred his eyes barely in focus ill pay you more thats a beginning answered dr washburns patient take off your shirt and tie also the socks he saw the glistening gold band around the marquis wrist and the watch several minutes later the transformation was complete the marquis clothes were not a perfect fit but no one could deny the quality of the cloth or the original tailoring too the watch was a girard perregaux and chamfords billfold contained over thirteen thousand francs the car keys were also impressive they were set in monogrammed heads of sterling silver for the love of god give me your clothes said the marquis the implausibility of his predicament penetrating the haze of alcohol im sorry but i cant do that replied the intruder gathering up both his own clothes and those of the blond woman you cant take mine she yelled i told you to keep your voice down all right all right she continued but you cant yes i can the patient looked around the room there was a telephone on a desk by a window he crossed to it and yanked the cord out of the socket now no one will disturb you he added picking up the knapsack you wont go free you know snapped chamford you wont get away with this the police will find you the police asked the intruder do you really think you should call the police a formal report will have to be made the circumstances described im not so sure thats such a good idea i think youd be better off waiting for that fellow to pick you up later this afternoon i heard him say he was going to get you past the marquise into the stables all things considered i honestly believe thats what you should do im sure you can come up with a better story than what really happened here i wont contradict you the unknown thief left the room closing the damaged door behind him you are not helpless you will find your way so far he had and it was a little frightening what had washburn said that his skills and talents would come back but i dont think youll ever be able to relate them to anything in your past the past what kind of past was it that produced the skills he had displayed during the past twentyfour hours where had he learned to maim and cripple with lunging feet and fingers entwined into hammers how did he know precisely where to deliver the blows who had taught him to play upon the criminal mind provoking and evoking a reluctant commitment how did he zero in so quickly on mere implications convinced beyond doubt that his instincts were right where had he learned to discern instant extortion in a casual conversation overheard in a butcher shop more to the point perhaps was the simple decision to carry out the crime my god how could he the more you fight it the more you crucify yourself the worse it will be he concentrated on the road and on the mahogany dashboard of the marquis de chamfords jaguar the array of instruments was not familiar his past did not include extensive experience with such cars he supposed that told him something in less than an hour he crossed a bridge over a wide canal and knew he had reached marseilles small square houses of stone angling like blocks up from the water narrow streets and walls everywherethe outskirts of the old harbor he knew it all and yet he did not know it high in the distance silhouetted on one of the surrounding hills were the outlines of a cathedral a statue of the virgin seen clearly atop its steeple notredamedelagarde the name came to him he had seen it beforeand yet he had not seen it oh christ stop it within minutes he was in the pulsing center of the city driving along the crowded canebière with its proliferation of expensive shops the rays of the afternoon sun bouncing off expanses of tinted glass on either side and on either side enormous sidewalk cafés he turned left toward the harbor passing warehouses and small factories and fenced off lots that contained automobiles prepared for transport north to the showrooms of saintetienne lyons and paris and to points south across the mediterranean instinct follow instinct for nothing could be disregarded every resource had an immediate use there was value in a rock if it could be thrown or a vehicle if someone wanted it he chose a lot where the cars were both new and used but all expensive he parked at the curb and got out beyond the fence was a small cavern of a garage mechanics in overalls laconically wandering about carrying tools he walked casually around inside until he spotted a man in a thin pinstriped suit whom instinct told him to approach it took less than ten minutes explanations kept to a minimum a jaguars disappearance to north africa guaranteed with the filing of engine numbers the silver monogrammed keys were exchanged for six thousand francs roughly onefifth the value of chamfords automobile then dr washburns patient found a taxi and asked to be taken to a pawnbrokerbut not an establishment that asked too many questions the message was clear this was marseilles and a half hour later the gold girard perregaux was no longer on his wrist having been replaced by a seiko chronograph and eight hundred francs everything had a value in relationship to its practicality the chronograph was shockproof the next stop was a mediumsized department store in the southeast section of la canebière clothes were chosen off the racks and shelves paid for and worn out of the fitting rooms an illfitting dark blazer and trousers left behind from a display on the floor he selected a soft leather suitcase additional garments placed inside with the knapsack the patient glanced at his new watch it was nearly five oclock time to find a comfortable hotel he had not really slept for several days he needed to rest before his appointment in the rue sarrasin at a café called le bouc de mer where arrangements could be made for a more important appointment in zurich he lay back on the bed and stared at the ceiling the wash of the streetlamps below causing irregular patterns of light to dance across the smooth white surface night had come rapidly to marseilles and with its arrival a certain sense of freedom came to the patient it was as if the darkness were a gigantic blanket blocking out the harsh glare of daylight that revealed too much too quickly he was learning something else about himself he was more comfortable in the night like a halfstarved cat he would forage better in the darkness yet there was a contradiction and he recognized that too during the months in ile de port noir he had craved the sunlight hungered for it waited for it each da wn wishing only for the darkness to go away things were happening to him he was changing things had happened events that gave a certain lie to the concept of foraging more successfully at night twelve hours ago he was on a fishing boat in the mediterranean an objective in mind and two thousand francs strapped to his waist two thousand francs something less than five hundred american dollars according to the daily rate of exchange posted in the hotel lobby now he was outfitted with several sets of acceptable clothing and lying on a bed in a reasonably expensive hotel with something over twentythree thousand francs in a louis vuitton billfold belonging to the marquis de chamford twentythreethousand francs nearly six thousand american dollars where had he come from that he was able to do the things he did stop it the rue sarrasin was so ancient that in another city it might have been designated as a landmark thoroughfare a wide brick alley connecting streets built centuries later but this was marseilles ancient coexisted with old both uncomfortable with the new the rue sarrasin was no more than two hundred feet long frozen in time between the stone walls of waterfront buildings devoid of streetlights trapping the mists that rolled off the harbor it was a backstreet conducive to brief meetings between men who did not care for their conferences to be observed the only light and sound came from le bouc de mer the café was situated roughly in the center of the wide alley its premises once a nineteenthcentury office building a number of cubicles had been taken down to allow for a large barroom and tables an equal number were left standing for less public appointments these were the waterfronts answer to those private rooms found at restaurants along la canebière and as befitting their status there were curtains but no doors the patient made his way between the crowded tables cutting his way through the layers of smoke excusing himself past lurching fishermen and drunken soldiers and redfaced whores looking for beds to rest in as well as new francs he peered into a succession of cubicles a crewman looking for his companionsuntil he found the captain of the fishing boat there was another man at the table thin pale faced narrow eyes peering up like a curious ferrets sit down said the dour skipper i thought youd be here before this you said between nine and eleven its quarter to eleven you stretch the time you can pay for the whiskey be glad to order something decent if theyve got it the thin palefaced man smiled things were going to be all right they were the passport in question was naturally one of the most difficult in the world to tamper with but with great care equipment and artistry it could be done how much these skillsand equipmentdo not come cheap twentyfive hundred francs when can i have it the care the artistry they take time three or four days and thats putting the artist under great pressure hell scream at me theres an additional one thousand francs if i can have it tomorrow by ten in the morning said the palefaced man quickly ill take the abuse and the thousand interrupted the scowling captain what did you bring out of port noir diamonds talent answered the patient meaning it but not understanding it ill need a photograph said the connection i stopped at an arcade and had this made replied the patient taking a small square photograph out of his shirt pocket with all that expensive equipment im sure you can sharpen it up nice clothes said the captain passing the print to the palefaced man well tailored agreed the patient the location of the morning rendezvous was agreed upon the drinks paid for and the captain slipped five hundred francs under the table the conference was over the buyer left the cubicle and started across the crowded raucous smokelayered barroom toward the door it happened so rapidly so suddenly so completely unexpectedly there was no time to think only react the collision was abrupt casual but the eyes that stared at him were not casual they seemed to burst out of their sockets widening in disbelief on the edge of hysteria no oh my god no it cannot the man spun in the crowd the patient lurched forward clamping his hand down on the mans shoulder wait a minute the man spun again thrusting the v of his outstretched thumb and fingers up into the patients wrist forcing the hand away you youre dead you could not have lived i lived what do you know the face was now contorted a mass of twisted fury the eyes squinting the mouth open sucking air baring yellow teeth that took on the appearance of animals teeth suddenly the man pulled out a knife the snap of its recessed blade heard through the surrounding din the arm shot forward the blade an extension of the hand that gripped it both surging in toward the patients stomach i know ill finish it whispered the man the patient swung his right forearm down a pendulum sweeping aside all objects in front of it he pivoted lashing his left foot up his heel plunging into his attackers pelvic bone chesah the echo in his ears was deafening the man lurched backward into a trio of drinkers as the knife fell to the floor the weapon was seen shouts followed men converged fists and hands separating the combatants get out of here take your argument somewhere else we dont want the police in here you drunken bastards the angry coarse dialects of marseilles rose over the cacophonous sounds of le bouc de mer the patient was hemmed in he watched as his wouldbe killer threaded his way through the crowd holding his groin forcing a path to the entrance the heavy door swung open the man raced into the darkness of rue sarrasin someone who thought he was deadwanted him deadknew he was alive the economy class section of air frances caravelle to zurich was filled to capacity the narrow seats made more uncomfortable by the turbulence that buffeted the plane a baby was screaming in its mothers arms other children whimpered swallowing cries of fear as parents smiled with tentative reassurances they did not feel most of the remaining passengers were silent a few drinking their whiskey more rapidly than obviously was normal fewer still were forcing laughter from tight throats false bravados that emphasized their insecurity rather than disguising it a terrible flight was many things to many people but none escape the essential thoughts of terror when man encased himself in a metal tube thirty thousand feet above the ground he was vulnerable with one elongated screaming dive he could be plummeting downward into the earth and there were fundamental questions that accompanied the essential terror what thoughts would go through ones mind at such a time how would one react the patient tried to find out it was important to him he sat next to the window his eyes on the aircrafts wing watching the broad expanse of metal bend and vibrate under the brutalizing impact of the winds the currents were clashing against one another pounding the manmade tube into a kind of submission warning the microscopic pretenders that they were no match for the vast infirmities of nature one ounce of pressure beyond the flex tolerance and the wing would crack the liftsustaining limb torn from its tubular body shredded into the winds one burst of rivets and there would be an explosion the screaming plunge to follow what would he do what would he think other than the uncontrollable fear of dying and oblivion would there be anything else thats what he had to concentrate on that was the projection washburn kept emphasizing in port noir the doctors words came back to him whenever you observe a stress situationand you have the timedo your damndest to project yourself into it associate as freely as you can let words and images fill your mind in them you may find clues the patient continued to stare out the window consciously trying to raise his unconscious fixing his eyes on the natural violence beyond the glass distilling the movement silently doing his damndest to let his reactions give rise to words and images they cameslowly there was the darkness again and the sound of rushing wind earshattering continuous growing in volume until he thought his head would burst his head the winds were lashing the left side of his head and face burning his skin forcing him to raise his left shoulder for protection left shoulder left arm his arm was raised the gloved fingers of his left hand gripping a straight edge of metal his right holding a a strap he was holding on to a strap waiting for something a signal a flashing light or a tap on the shoulder or both a signal it came he plunged into the darkness into the void his body tumbling twisting swept away into the night sky he had parachuted etesvous malade his insane reverie was broken the nervous passenger next to him had touched his left arm which was raised the fingers of his hand spread as if resisting rigid in their locked position across his chest his right forearm was pressed into the cloth of his jacket his right hand gripping the lapel bunching the fabric and on his forehead were rivulets of sweat it had happened the somethingelse had come brieflyinsanelyinto focus pardon he said lowering his arms un mauvais rêve he added meaninglessly there was a break in the weather the caravelle stabilized the smiles on the harried stewardesses faces became genuine again full service was resumed as embarrassed passengers glanced at one another the patient observed his surroundings but reached no conclusions he was consumed by the images and the sounds that had been so clearly defined in his minds eye and ear he had hurled himself from a plane at night signals and metal and straps intrinsic to his leap he had parachuted where why stop crucifying yourself if for no other reason than to take his thoughts away from the madness he reached into his breast pocket pulled out the altered passport and opened it as might be expected the name washburn had been retained it was common enough and its owner had explained that there were no flags out for it the geoffrey r however had been changed to george p the eliminations and spaceline blockage expertly accomplished the photographic insertion was expert too it no longer resembled a cheap print from a machine in an amusement arcade the identification numbers of course were entirely different guaranteed not to cause an alarm in an immigration computer at least up until the moment the bearer submitted the passport for its first inspection from that time on it was the buyers responsibility one paid as much for this guarantee as he did for the artistry and the equipment for it required connections within interpol and the immigration clearing houses customs officials computer specialists and clerks throughout the european border networks were paid on a regular basis for this vital information they rarely made mistakes if and when they did the loss of an eye or an arm was not out of the question such were the brokers of false papers george p washburn he was not comfortable with the name the owner of the unaltered original had instructed him too well in the basics of projection and association george p was a sidestep from geoffrey r a man who had been eaten away by a compulsion that had its roots in escapeescape from identity that was the last thing the patient wanted he wanted more than his life to know who he was or did he no matter the answer was in zurich in zurich there was mesdames et messieurs nous commençons notre descente pour laéroport de zurich he knew the name of the hotel carillon du lac he had given it to the taxi driver without thinking had he read it somewhere had the name been one of those listed in the welcometozurich folders placed in the elasticized pockets in front of his seat in the plane no he knew the lobby the heavy dark polished wood was familiar somehow and the huge plateglass windows that looked out over lake zurich he had been here before he had stood where he was standing nowin front of the marbletopped countera long time ago it was all confirmed by the words spoken by the clerk behind the desk they had the impact of an explosion its good to see you again sir its been quite a while since your last visit has it how long why dont you call me by my name for gods sake i dont know you i dont know me help me please help me i guess it has he said do me a favor will you i sprained my hand its difficult to write could you fill in the registration and ill do my damndest to sign it the patient held his breath suppose the polite man behind the counter asked him to repeat his name or the spelling of his name of course the clerk turned the card around and wrote would you care to see the hotel doctor later perhaps not now the clerk continued writing then lifted up the card reversing it for the guests signature mr j bourne new york ny usa he stared at it transfixed mesmerized by the letters he had a namepart of a name and a country as well as a city of residence j bourne john james joseph what did the j stand for is something wrong herr bourne asked the clerk wrong no not at all he picked up the pen remembering to feign discomfort would he be expected to write out a first name no he would sign exactly as the clerk had printed mr j bourne he wrote the name as naturally as he could letting his mind fall free allowing whatever thoughts or images that might be triggered come through none did he was merely signing an unfamiliar name he felt nothing you had me worried mein herr said the clerk i thought perhaps id made a mistake its been a busy week a busier day but then i was quite certain and if he had made a mistake mr j bourne of new york city usa did not care to think about the possibility it never occurred to me to question your memory herr stossel replied the patient glancing up at the onduty sign on the left wall of the counter the man behind the desk was the carillon du lacs assistant manager youre most kind the assistant manager leaned forward i assume youll require the usual conditions of your stay with us some may have changed said j bourne how did you understand them before whoever telephones or inquires at the desk is to be told youre out of the hotel whereupon youre to be informed immediately the only exception is your firm in new york the treadstone seventyone corporation if i remember correctly another name one he could trace with an overseas call fragmentary shapes were falling into place the exhilaration began to return thatll do i wont forget your efficiency this is zurich replied the polite man shrugging youve always been exceedingly generous herr bourne pagehierher bitte as the patient followed the page into the elevator several things were clearer he had a name and he understood why that name came so quickly to the carillon du lacs assistant manager he had a country and a city and a firm that employed himhad employed him at any rate and whenever he came to zurich certain precautions were implemented to protect him from unexpected or unwanted visitors that was what he could not understand one either protected oneself thoroughly or one did not bother to protect oneself at all where was any real advantage in a screening process that was so loose so vulnerable to penetration it struck him as secondrate without value as if a small child were playing hideandseek where am i try and find me ill say something out loud and give you a hint it was not professional and if he had learned anything about himself during the past fortyeight hours it was that he was a professional of what he had no idea but the status was not debatable the voice of the new york operator faded sporadically over the line her conclusion however was irritatingly clear and final theres no listing for any such company sir ive checked the latest directories as well as the private telephones and theres no treadstone corporationand nothing even resembling treadstone with numbers following the name perhaps they were dropped to shorten theres no firm or company with that name sir i repeat if you have a first or second name or the type of business the firms engaged in i might be of further help i dont only the name treadstone seventyone new york city its an odd name sir im sure if there were a listing it would be a simple matter to find it im sorry thanks very much for your trouble said j bourne replacing the phone it was pointless to go on the name was a code of some sort words relayed by a caller that gained him access to a hotel guest not so readily accessible and the words could be used by anyone regardless of where he had placed the call therefore the location of new york might well be meaningless according to an operator five thousand miles away it was the patient walked to the bureau where he had placed the louis vuitton billfold and the seiko chronograph he put the billfold in his pocket and the watch on his wrist he looked in the mirror and spoke quietly you are j bourne citizen of the united states resident of new york city and its entirely possible that the numbers zerosevenseventeentwelvezerofourteentwentysixzero are the most important things in your life the sun was bright filtering through the trees along the elegant bahnhofstrasse bouncing off the windows of the shops and creating blocks of shadows where the great banks intruded on its rays it was a street where solidity and money security and arrogance determination and a touch of frivolity all coexisted and dr washburns patient had walked along its pavements before he strolled into the burkli platz the square that overlooked the zurichsee with its numerous quays along the waterfront bordered by gardens that in the heat of summer became circles of bursting flowers he could picture them in his minds eye images were coming to him but no thoughts no memories he doubled back into the bahnhofstrasse instinctively knowing that the gemeinschaft bank was a nearby building of offwhite stone it had been on the opposite side of the street on which he had just walked he had passed it deliberately he approached the heavy glass doors and pushed the center plate forward the righthand door swung open easily and he was standing on a floor of brown marble he had stood on it before but the image was not as strong as others he had the uncomfortable feeling that the gemeinschaft was to be avoided it was not to be avoided now bonjour monsieur vous désirez the man asking the question was dressed in a cutaway the red boutonnière his symbol of authority the use of french was explained by the clients clothes even the subordinate gnomes of zurich were observant i have personal and confidential business to discuss replied j bourne in english once again mildly startled by the words he spoke so naturally the reason for the english was twofold he wanted to watch the gnomes expression at his error and he wanted no possible misinterpretation of anything said during the next hour pardon sir said the man his eyebrows arched slightly studying the clients topcoat the elevator to your left second floor the receptionist will assist you the receptionist referred to was a middleaged man with closecropped hair and tortoiseshell glasses his expression was set his eyes rigidly curious do you currently have personal and confidential business with us sir he asked repeating the new arrivals words i do your signature please said the official holding out a sheet of gemeinschaft stationery with two blank lines centered in the middle of the page the client understood no name was required the handwritten numbers take the place of a name they constitute the signature of the account holder standard procedure washburn the patient wrote out the numbers relaxing his hand so the writing would be free he handed the stationery back to the receptionist who studied it rose from the chair and gestured to a row of narrow doors with frosted glass panels if youll wait in the fourth room sir someone will be with you shortly the fourth room the fourth door from the left it will lock automatically is that necessary the receptionist glanced at him startled it is in line with your own request sir he said politely an undertone of surprise beneath his courtesy this is a threezero account its customary at the gemeinschaft for holders of such accounts to telephone in advance so that a private entrance can be made available i know that lied washburns patient with a casualness he did not feel its just that im in a hurry ill convey that to verifications sir verifications mr j bourne of new york city usa could not help himself the word had the sound of an alarm signature verifications sir the man adjusted his glasses the movement covered his taking a step nearer his desk his lower hand inches from a console i suggest you wait in room four sir the suggestion was not a request it was an order the command in the praetorians eyes why not just tell them to hurry will you the patient crossed to the fourth door opened it and walked inside the door closed automatically he could hear the click of the lock j bourne looked at the frosted panel it was no simple pane of glass for there was a network of thin wires webbed beneath the surface undoubtedly if cracked an alarm would be triggered he was in a cell waiting to be summoned the rest of the small room was paneled and furnished tastefully two leather armchairs next to one another across from a miniature couch flanked by antique tables at the opposite end was a second door startling in its contrast it was made of gray steel uptodate magazines and newspapers in three languages were on the tables the patient sat down and picked up the paris edition of the heraldtribune he read the printed words but absorbed nothing the summons would come any moment now his mind was consumed by thoughts of maneuver maneuver without memory only by instinct finally the steel door opened revealing a tall slender man with aquiline features and meticulously groomed gray hair his face was patrician eager to serve an equal who needed his expertise he extended his hand his english refined mellifluous under his swiss intonation so very pleased to meet you forgive the delay it was rather humorous in fact in what way im afraid you rather startled herr koenig its not often a threezero account arrives without prior notice hes quite set in his ways you know the unusual ruins his day on the other hand it generally makes mine more pleasant im walther apfel please come in the bank officer released the patients hand and gestured toward the steel door the room beyond was a vshaped extension of the cell dark paneling heavy comfortable furniture and a wide desk that stood in front of a wider window overlooking the bahnhofstrasse im sorry i upset him said j bourne its just that i have very little time yes he relayed that apfel walked around the desk nodding at the leather armchair in front do sit down one or two formalities and we can discuss the business at hand both men sat the instant they did so the bank officer picked up a white clipboard and leaned across his desk handing it to the gemeinschaft client secured in place was another sheet of stationery but instead of two blank lines there were ten starting below the letterhead and extending to within an inch of the bottom border your signature please a minimum of five will be sufficient i dont understand i just did this and very successfully verification confirmed it then why again a signature can be practiced to the point where a single rendition is acceptable however successive repetitions will result in flaws if its not authentic a graphological scanner will pick them up instantly but then im sure thats no concern of yours apfel smiled as he placed a pen at the edge of the desk nor of mine frankly but koenig insists hes a cautious man said the patient taking the pen and starting to write he had begun the fourth set when the banker stopped him that will do the rest really is a waste of time apfel held out his hand for the clipboard verifications said you werent even a borderline case upon receipt of this the account will be delivered he inserted the sheet of paper into the slot of a metal case on the right side of his desk and pressed a button a shaft of bright light flared and then went out this transmits the signatures directly to the scanner continued the banker which of course is programmed again frankly its all a bit foolish no one forewarned of our precautions would consent to the additional signatures if he were an imposter why not as long as hed gone this far why not chance it there is only one entrance to this office conversely one exit im sure you heard the lock snap shut in the waiting room and saw the wire mesh in the glass added the patient then you understand a certified imposter would be trapped suppose he had a gun you dont no one searched me the elevator did from four different angles if you had been armed the machinery would have stopped between the first and second floors youre all cautious we try to be of service the telephone rang apfel answered yes come in the banker glanced at his client your account files here that was quick herr koenig signed for it several minutes ago he was merely waiting for the scanner release apfel opened a drawer and took out a ring of keys im sure hes disappointed he was quite certain something was amiss the steel door opened and the receptionist entered carrying a black metal container which he placed on the desk next to a tray that held a bottle of perrier and two glasses are you enjoying your stay in zurich asked the banker obviously to fill in the silence very much so my room overlooks the lake its a nice view very peaceful quiet splendid said apfel pouring a glass of perrier for his client herr koenig left the door was closed and the banker returned to business your account sir he said selecting a key from the ring may i unlock the case or would you prefer doing so yourself go ahead open it the banker looked up i said unlock not open thats not my privilege nor would i care for the responsibility why not in the event your identity is listed its not my position to be aware of it suppose i wanted business transacted money transferred sent to someone else it could be accomplished with your numerical signature on a withdrawal form or sent to another bank outside of switzerland for me then a name would be required under those circumstances an identity would be both my responsibility and my privilege open it the bank officer did so dr washburns patient held his breath a sharp pain forming in the pit of his stomach apfel took out a sheaf of statements held together by an outsized paperclip his bankers eyes strayed to the righthand column of the top pages his bankers expression unchanged but not totally his lower lip stretched ever so slightly creasing the corner of his mouth he leaned forward and handed the pages to their owner beneath the gemeinschaft letterhead the typewritten words were in english the obvious language of the client account zerosevenseventeentwelvezerofourteentwentysixzero name restricted to legal instructions and owner access sealed under separate cover current funds on deposit francs the patient exhaled slowly staring at the figure whatever he thought he was prepared for nothing prepared him for this it was as frightening as anything he had experienced during the past five months roughly calculated the amount was over five million american dollars how why controlling the start of a tremble in his hand he leafed through the statements of entry they were numerous the sums extraordinary none less than francs the deposits spaced every five to eight weeks apart going back twentythree months he reached the bottom statement the first it was a transfer from a bank in singapore and the largest single entry two million seven hundred thousand malaysian dollars converted into swiss francs beneath the statement he could feel the outline of a separate envelope far shorter than the page itself he lifted up the paper the envelope was rimmed with a black border typewritten words on the front identity owner access legal restrictions accessregistered officer treadstone seventyone corporation bearer will produce written instructions from owner subject to verifications id like to check this said the client its your property replied apfel i can assure you it has remained intact the patient removed the envelope and turned it over a gemeinschaft seal was pressed over the borders of the flap none of the raised letters had been disturbed he tore the flap open took out the card and read owner jason charles bourne address unlisted citizenship usa jason charles bourne jason the j was for jason his name was jason bourne the bourne had meant nothing the j bourne still meaningless but in the combination jason and bourne obscure tumblers locked into place he could accept it he did accept it he was jason charles bourne american yet he could feel his chest pounding the vibration in his ears was deafening the pain in his stomach more acute what was it why did he have the feeling that he was plunging into the darkness again into the black waters again is something wrong asked walther apfel is something wrong herr bourne no everythings fine my names bourne jason bourne was he shouting whispering he could not tell my privilege to know you mr bourne your identity will remain confidential you have the word of an officer of the bank gemeinschaft thank you now im afraid ive got to transfer a great deal of this money and ill need your help again my privilege whatever assistance or advice i can render i shall be happy to do so bourne reached for the glass of perrier the steel door of apfels office closed behind him within seconds he would walk out of the tasteful anteroom cell into the reception room and over to the elevators within minutes he would be on the bahnhofstrasse with a name a great deal of money and little else but fear and confusion he had done it dr geoffrey washburn had been paid far in excess of the value of the life he had saved a teletype transfer in the amount of swiss francs had been sent to a bank in marseilles deposited to a coded account that would find its way to ile de port noirs only doctor without washburns name ever being used or revealed all washburn had to do was to get to marseilles recite the codes and the money was his bourne smiled to himself picturing the expression on washburns face when the account was turned over to him the eccentric alcoholic doctor would have been overjoyed with ten or fifteen thousand pounds he had more than a million dollars it would either ensure his recovery or his destruction that was his choice his problem a second transfer of francs was sent to a bank in paris on the rue madeleine deposited in the name of jason c bourne the transfer was expedited by the gemeinschafts twiceweekly pouch to paris signature cards in triplicate sent with the documents herr koenig had assured both his superior and the client that the papers would reach paris in three days the final transaction was minor by comparison one hundred thousand francs in large bills were brought to apfels office the withdrawal slip signed in the account holders numerical signature remaining on deposit in the gemeinschaft bank were swiss francs a not inconsequential sum by any standard how why from where the entire business had taken an hour and twenty minutes only one discordant note intruding on the smooth proceedings in character it had been delivered by koenig his expression a mixture of solemnity and minor triumph he had rung apfel was admitted and had brought a small blackbordered envelope to his superior une fiche he had said in french the banker had opened the envelope removed a card studied the contents and had returned both to koenig procedures will be followed he had said koenig had left did that concern me bourne had asked only in terms of releasing such large amounts merely house policy the banker had smiled reassuringly the lock clicked bourne opened the frosted glass door and walked out into herr koenigs personal fiefdom two other men had arrived seated at opposite ends of the reception room since they were not in separate cells behind opaque glass windows bourne presumed that neither had a threezero account he wondered if they had signed names or written out a series of numbers but he stopped wondering the instant he reached the elevator and pressed the button out of the corner of his eye he perceived movement koenig had shifted his head nodding at both men they rose as the elevator door opened bourne turned the man on the right had taken a small radio out of his overcoat pocket he spoke into itbriefly quickly the man on the left had his right hand concealed beneath the cloth of his raincoat when he pulled it out he was holding a gun a black caliber automatic pistol with a perforated cylinder attached to the barrel a silencer both men converged on bourne as he backed into the deserted elevator the madness began the elevator doors started to close the man with the handheld radio was already inside the shoulders of his armed companion angling between the moving panels the weapon aimed at bournes head jason leaned to his righta sudden gesture of fearthen abruptly without warning swept his left foot off the floor pivoting his heel plunging into the armed mans hand sending the gun upward reeling the man backward out of the enclosure two muted gunshots preceded the closing of the doors the bullets embedding themselves in the thick wood of the ceiling bourne completed his pivot his shoulder crashing into the second mans stomach his right hand surging into the chest his left pinning the hand with the radio he hurled the man into the wall the radio flew across the elevator as it fell words came out of its speaker henri ça va quesce qui se passe the image of another frenchman came to jasons mind a man on the edge of hysteria disbelief in his eyes a wouldbe killer who had raced out of le bouc de mer into the shadows of the rue sarrasin less than twentyfour hours ago thatman had wasted no time sending his message to zurich the one they thought was dead was alive very much alive kill him bourne grabbed the frenchman in front of him now his left arm around the mans throat his right hand tearing at the mans left ear how many he asked in french how many are there down there where arethey find out pig the elevator was halfway to the first floor lobby jason angled the mans face down ripping the ear half out of its roots smashing the mans head into the wall the frenchman screamed sinking to the floor bourne rammed his knee into the mans chest he could feel the holster he yanked the overcoat open reached in and pulled out a shortbarreled revolver for an instant it occurred to him that someone had deactivated the scanning machinery in the elevator koenig he would remember thered be no amnesia where herr koenig was concerned he jammed the gun into the frenchmans open mouth tell me or ill blow the back of your skull off the man expunged a throated wail the weapon was withdrawn the barrel now pressed into his cheek two one by the elevators one outside on the pavement by the car what kind of car peugeot color the elevator was slowing down coming to a stop brown the man in the lobby whats he wearing i dont know jason cracked the gun across the mans temple youd better remember a black coat the elevator stopped bourne pulled the frenchman to his feet the doors opened to the left a man in a dark raincoat and wearing an oddlooking pair of goldrimmed spectacles stepped forward the eyes beyond the lenses recognized the circumstances blood was trickling down across the frenchmans cheek he raised his unseen hand concealed by the wide pocket of his raincoat another silenced automatic leveled at the target from marseilles jason propelled the frenchman in front of him through the doors three rapid spits were heard the frenchman shouted his arms raised in a final guttural protest he arched his back and fell to the marble floor a woman to the right of the man with the goldrimmed spectacles screamed joined by several men who called to no one and everyone for hilfe for the polizei bourne knew he could not use the revolver he had taken from the frenchman it had no silencer the sound of a gunshot would mark him he shoved it into his topcoat pocket sidestepped the screaming woman and grabbed the uniformed shoulders of the elevator starter whipping the bewildered man around throwing him into the figure of the killer in the dark raincoat the panic in the lobby mounted as jason ran toward the glass doors of the entrance the boutonnièred greeter who had mistaken his language an hour and a half ago was shouting into a wall telephone a uniformed guard at his side weapon drawn barricading the exit eyes riveted on the chaos riveted suddenly on him getting out was instantly a problem bourne avoided the guards eyes directing his words to the guards associate on the telephone the man wearing goldrimmed glasses he shouted hes the one i saw him what who are you im a friend of walther apfel listen to me the man wearing goldrimmed glasses in a black raincoat over there bureaucratic mentality had not changed in several millenniums at the mention of a superior officers name one followed orders herr apfel the gemeinschaft greeter turned to the guard you heard him the man wearing glasses goldrimmed glasses yes sir the guard raced forward jason edged past the greeter to the glass doors he shoved the door on the right open glancing behind him knowing he had to run again but not knowing if a man outside on the pavement waiting by a brown peugeot would recognize him and fire a bullet into his head the guard had run past a man in a black raincoat a man walking more slowly than the panicked figures around him a man wearing no glasses at all he accelerated his pace toward the entrance toward bourne out on the sidewalk the growing chaos was jasons protection word had gone out of the bank wailing sirens grew louder as police cars raced up the bahnhofstrasse he walked several yards to the right flanked by pedestrians then suddenly ran wedging his way into a curious crowd taking refuge in a storefront his attention on the automobiles at the curb he saw the peugeot saw the man standing beside it his hand ominously in his overcoat pocket in less than fifteen seconds the driver of the peugeot was joined by the man in the black raincoat now replacing his goldrimmed glasses adjusting his eyes to his restored vision the two men conferred rapidly their eyes scanning the bahnhofstrasse bourne understood their confusion he had walked with an absence of panic out of the gemeinschafts glass doors into the crowd he had been prepared to run but he had not run for fear of being stopped until he was reasonably clear of the entrance no one else had been permitted to do soand the driver of the peugeot had not made the connection he had not recognized the target identified and marked for execution in marseilles the first police car reached the scene as the man in the goldrimmed spectacles removed his raincoat shoving it through the open window of the peugeot he nodded to the driver who climbed in behind the wheel and started the engine the killer took off his delicate glasses and did the most unexpected thing jason could imagine he walked rapidly back toward the glass doors of the bank joining the police who were racing inside bourne watched as the peugeot swung away from the curb and sped off down the bahnhofstrasse the crowd in the storefront began to disperse many edging their way toward the glass doors craning their necks around one another rising on the balls of their feet peering inside a police officer came out waving the curious back demanding that a path be cleared to the curb as he shouted an ambulance careened around the northwest corner its horn joining the sharp piercing notes from its roof warning all to get out of its way the driver nosed his outsized vehicle to a stop in the space created by the departed peugeot jason could watch no longer he had to get to the carillon du lac gather his things and get out of zurich out of switzerland to paris why paris why had he insisted that the funds be transferred to paris it had not occurred to him before he sat in walther apfels office stunned by the extraordinary figures presented him they had been beyond anything in his imaginationso much so that he could only react numbly instinctively and instinct had evoked the city of paris as though it were somehow vital why again no time he saw the ambulance crew carry a stretcher through the doors of the bank on it was a body the head covered signifying death the significance was not lost on bourne save for skills he could not relate to anything he understood he was the dead man on that stretcher he saw an empty taxi at the corner and ran toward it he had to get out of zurich a message had been sent from marseilles yet the dead man was alive jason bourne was alive kill him kill jason bourne god in heaven why he was hoping to see the carillon du lacs assistant manager behind the front desk but he was not there then he realized that a short note to the manwhat was his namestossel yes stosselwould be sufficient an explanation for his sudden departure was not required and five hundred francs would easily take care of the few hours he had accepted from the carillon du lac and the favor he would ask of herr stossel in his room he threw his shaving equipment into his unpacked suitcase checked the pistol he had taken from the frenchman leaving it in his topcoat pocket and sat down at the desk he wrote out the note for herr stossel asst mgr in it he included a sentence that came easilyalmost too easily i may be in contact with you shortly relative to messages i expect will have been sent to me i trust it will be convenient for you to keep an eye out for them and accept them on my behalf if any communication came from the elusive treadstone seventyone he wanted to know about it this was zurich he would he put a five hundred franc note between the folded stationery and sealed the envelope then he picked up his suitcase walked out of the room and went down the hallway to the bank of elevators there were four he touched a button and looked behind him remembering the gemeinschaft there was no one there a bell pinged and the red light above the third elevator flashed on he had caught a descending machine fine he had to get to the airport just as fast as he could he had to get out of zurich out of switzerland a message had been delivered the elevator doors opened two men stood on either side of an auburnhaired woman they interrupted their conversation nodded at the newcomernoting the suitcase and moving to the sidethen resumed talking as the doors closed they were in their midthirties and spoke french softly rapidly the woman glancing alternately at both men alternately smiling and looking pensive decisions of no great import were being made laughter intermingled with semiserious interrogation youll be going home then after the summations tomorrow asked the man on the left im not sure im waiting for word from ottawa the woman replied i have relations in lyon it would be good to see them its impossible said the man on the right for the steering committee to find ten people willing to summarize this godforsaken conference in a single day well all be here another week brussels will not approve said the first man grinning the hotels too expensive then by all means move to another said the second with a leer at the woman weve been waiting for you to do just that havent we youre a lunatic said the woman youre both lunatics and thats my summation youre not marie interjected the first a lunatic i mean your presentation yesterday was brilliant it was nothing of the sort she said it was routine and quite dull no no disagreed the second it was superb it had to be i didnt understand a word but then i have other talents lunatic the elevator was braking the first man spoke again lets sit in the back row of the hall were late anyway and bertinelli is speakingto little effect i suggest his theories of enforced cyclical fluctuations went out with the finances of the borgias before then said the auburnhaired woman laughing caesars taxes she paused then added if not the punic wars the back row then said the second man offering his arm to the woman we can sleep he uses a slide projector itll be dark no you two go ahead ill join you in a few minutes i really must send off some cables and i dont trust the telephone operators to get them right the doors opened and the threesome walked out of the elevator the two men started diagonally across the lobby together the woman toward the front desk bourne fell in step behind her absently reading a sign on a triangular stand several feet away welcome to members of the sixth world economic conference todays schedule pm the hon james frazier mp united kingdom suite pm dr eugenio bertinelli univ of milan italy suite pm chairmans farewell dinner hospitality suite room the operator said there was a cablegram for me english the auburnhaired woman now beside him at the counter spoke english but then she had said she was waiting for word from ottawa a canadian the desk clerk checked the slots and returned with the cable dr st jacques he asked holding out the envelope yes thanks very much the woman turned away opening the cable as the clerk moved in front of bourne yes sir id like to leave this note for herr stossel he placed the carillon du lac envelope on the counter herr stossel will not return until six oclock in the morning sir in the afternoons he leaves at four might i be of service no thanks just make sure he gets it please then jason remembered this was zurich its nothing urgent he added but i need an answer ill check with him in the morning of course sir bourne picked up his suitcase and started across the lobby toward the hotels entrance a row of wide glass doors that led to a circular drive fronting the lake he could see several taxis waiting in line under the floodlights of the canopy the sun had gone down it was night in zurich still there were flights to all points of europe until well past midnight he stopped walking his breath suspended a form of paralysis sweeping over him his eyes did not believe what else he saw beyond the glass doors a brown peugeot pulled up in the circular drive in front of the first taxi its door opened and a man stepped outa killer in a black raincoat wearing thin goldrimmed spectacles then from the other door another figure emerged but it was not the driver who had been at the curb on the bahnhofstrasse waiting for a target he did not recognize instead it was another killer in another raincoat its wide pockets recessed for powerful weapons it was the man who had sat in the reception room on the second floor of the gemeinschaft bank the same man who had pulled a caliber pistol from a holster beneath his coat a pistol with a perforated cylinder on its barrel that silenced two bullets meant for the skull of the quarry he had followed into an elevator how how could they have found him then he remembered and felt sick it had been so innocuous so casual are you enjoying your stay in zurich walther apfel had asked while they were waiting for a minion to leave and be alone again very much my room overlooks the lake its a nice view very peaceful quiet koenig koenig had heard him say his room looked over the lake how many hotels had rooms overlooking the lake especially hotels a man with a threezero account might frequent two three from unremembered memory names came to him carillon du lac baur au lac eden au lac were there others no further names came how easy it must have been to narrow them down how easy it had been for him to say the words how stupid no time too late he could see through the row of glass doors so too could the killers the second man had spotted him words were exchanged over the hood of the peugeot goldrimmed spectacles adjusted hands placed in outsized pockets unseen weapons gripped the two men converged on the entrance separating at the last moment one on either end of the row of clear glass panels the flanks were covered the trap set he could not race outside did they think they could walk into a crowded hotel lobby and simply kill a man of course they could the crowds and the noise were their cover two three four muted gunshots fired at close range would be as effective as an ambush in a crowded square in daylight escape easily found in the resulting chaos he could not let them get near him he backed away thoughts racing through his mind outrage paramount how dared they what made them think he would not run for protection scream for the police and then the answer was clear as numbing as the question itself the killers knew with certainty that which he could only surmise he could not seek that kind of protectionhe could not seek the police for jason bourne all the authorities had to be avoided why were they seeking him jesus christ why the two opposing doors were opened by outstretched hands other hands hidden around steel bourne turned there were elevators doorways corridorsa roof and cellars there had to be a dozen ways out of the hotel or were there did the killers now threading their way through the crowds know something else he could only surmise did the carillon du lac have only two or three exits easily covered by men outside easily used as traps themselves to cut down the lone figure of a running man a lone man a lone man was an obvious target but suppose he were not alone suppose someone was with him two people were not one but for one alone an extra person was camouflageespecially in crowds especially at night and it was night determined killers avoided taking the wrong life not from compassion but for practicality in any ensuing panic the real target might escape he felt the weight of the gun in his pocket but there was not much comfort in knowing it was there as at the bank to use itto even display itwas to mark him still it was there he started back toward the center of the lobby then turned to his right where there was a greater concentration of people it was the preevening hour during an international conference a thousand tentative plans being made rank and courtesan separated by glances of approval and rebuke odd groupings everywhere there was a marble counter against the wall a clerk behind it checking pages of yellow paper with a pencil held like a paintbrush cablegrams in front of the counter were two people an obese elderly man and a woman in a dark red dress the rich color of the silk complementing her long titian hair auburn hair it was the woman in the elevator who had joked about caesars taxes and the punic wars the doctor who had stood beside him at the hotel desk asking for the cable she knew was there bourne looked behind him the killers were using the crowds well excusing themselves politely but firmly through one on the right one on the left closing in like two prongs of a pincer attack as long as they kept him in sight they could force him to keep running blindly without direction not knowing which path he took might lead to a dead end where he could run no longer and then the muted spits would come pockets blackened by powder burns kept him in sight the back row then we can sleep he uses a slide projector itll be dark jason turned again and looked at the auburnhaired woman she had completed her cable and was thanking the clerk removing a pair of tinted hornrimmed glasses from her face placing them into her purse she was not more than eight feet away bertinelli is speaking to little effect i suggest there was no time for anything but instinctive decisions bourne shifted his suitcase to his left hand walked rapidly over to the woman at the marble counter and touched her elbow gently with as little alarm as possible doctor i beg your pardon you are doctor he released her a bewildered man st jacques she completed using the french pronunciation of saint youre the one in the elevator i didnt realize it was you he said i was told youd know where this bertinelli is speaking its right on the board suite seven im afraid i dont know where it is would you mind showing me im late and ive got to take notes on his talk on bertinelli why are you with a marxist newspaper a neutral pool said jason wondering where the phrases came from im covering for a number of people they dont think hes worth it perhaps not but he should be heard there are a few brutal truths in what he says i lost so ive got to find him maybe you can point him out im afraid not ill show you the room but ive a phone call to make she snapped her purse shut please hurry what she looked at him not kindly sorry but i am in a hurry he glanced to his right the two men were no more than twenty feet away youre also rude said the st jacques woman coldly please he restrained his desire to propel her forward away from the moving trap that was closing in its this way she started across the floor toward a wide corridor carved out of the left rear wall the crowds were thinner prominence less apparent in the back regions of the lobby they reached what looked like a velvetcovered tunnel of deep red doors on opposite sides lighted signs above them identifying conference room one conference room two at the end of the hallway were double doors the gold letters to the right proclaiming them to be the entrance to suite seven there you are said marie st jacques be careful when you go in its probably dark bertinelli lectures with slides like a movie commented bourne looking behind him at the crowds at the far end of the corridor he was there the man with goldrimmed spectacles was excusing himself past an animated trio in the lobby he was walking into the hallway his companion right behind him a considerable difference he sits below the stage and pontificates the st jacques woman had said something and was now leaving him what did you say a stage well a raised platform for exhibits usually they have to be brought in he said what does exhibits is there an exit in there another door i have no idea and i really must make my call enjoy the professore she turned away he dropped the suitcase and took her arm at the touch she glared at him take your hand off me please i dont want to frighten you but i have no choice he spoke quietly his eyes over her shoulder the killers had slowed their pace the trap sure about to close you have to come with me dont be ridiculous he viced the grip around her arm moving her in front of him then he pulled the gun out of his pocket making sure her body concealed it from the men thirty feet away i dont want to use this i dont want to hurt you but ill do both if i have to my god be quiet just do as i say and youll be fine i have to get out of this hotel and youre going to help me once im out ill let you go but not until then come on were going in there you cant yes i can he pushed the barrel of the gun into her stomach into the dark silk that creased under the force of his thrust she was terrified into silence into submission lets go he stepped to her left his hand still gripping her arm the pistol held across his chest inches from her own her eyes were riveted on it her lips parted her breath erratic bourne opened the door propelling her through it in front of him he could hear a single word shouted from the corridor schnell they were in darkness but it was brief a shaft of white light shot across the room over the rows of chairs illuminating the heads of the audience the projection on the faraway screen on the stage was that of a graph the grids marked numerically a heavy black line starting at the left extending in a jagged pattern through the lines to the right a heavily accented voice was speaking amplified by a loudspeaker you will note that during the years of seventy and seventyone when specific restraints in production were selfimposedi repeat selfimposedby these leaders of industry the resulting economic recession was far less severe than inslide twelve pleasethe socalled paternalistic regulation of the marketplace by government interventionists the next slide please the room went dark again there was a problem with the projector no second shaft of light replaced the first slide twelve please jason pushed the woman forward in front of the figures standing by the back wall behind the last row of chairs he tried to judge the size of the lecture hall looking for a red light that could mean escape he saw it a faint reddish glow in the distance on the stage behind the screen there were no other exits no other doors but the entrance to suite seven he had to reach it he had to get them to that exit on that stage mariepar ici the whisper came from their left from a seat in the back row non chérie reste avec moi the second whisper was delivered by the shadowed figure of a man standing directly in front of marie st jacques he had stepped away from the wall intercepting her on nous a séparé il ny a plus de chaises bourne pressed the gun firmly into the womans rib cage its message unmistakable she whispered without breathing jason grateful that her face could not be seen clearly please let us by she said in french please whats this is he your cablegram my dear an old friend whispered bourne a shout rose over the increasingly louder hum from the audience may i please have slide twelve per favore we have to see someone at the end of the row continued jason looking behind him the righthand door of the entrance opened in the middle of a shadowed face a pair of goldrimmed glasses reflected the dim light of the corridor bourne edged the girl past her bewildered friend forcing him back into the wall whispering an apology sorry but were in a hurry youre damn rude too yes i know slide twelve ma che infamia the beam of light shot out from the projector it vibrated under the nervous hand of the operator another graph appeared on the screen as jason and the woman reached the far wall the start of the narrow aisle that led down the length of the hall to the stage he pushed her into the corner pressing his body against hers his face against her face ill scream she whispered ill shoot he said he peered around the figures leaning against the wall the killers were both inside both squinting shifting their heads like alarmed rodents trying to spot their target among the rows of faces the voice of the lecturer rose like the ringing of a cracked bell his diatribe brief but strident ecco for the skeptics i address here this eveningand that is most of youhere is statistical proof identical in substance to a hundred other analyses i have prepared leave the marketplace to those who live there minor excesses can always be found they are a small price to pay for the general good there was a scattering of applause the approval of a definite minority bertinelli resumed a normal tone and droned on his long pointer stabbing at the screen emphasizing the obvioushis obvious jason leaned back again the gold spectacles glistened in the harsh glare of the projectors side light the killer who wore them touching his companions arm nodding to his left ordering his subordinate to continue the search on the left side of the room he would take the right he began the gold rims growing brighter as he sidestepped his way in front of those standing studying each face he would reach the corner reach them in a matter of seconds stopping the killer with a gunshot was all that was left and if someone along the row of those standing moved or if the woman he had pressed against the wall went into panic and shoved him or if he missed the killer for any number of reasons he was trapped and even if he hit the man there was another killer across the room certainly a marksman slide thirteen if you please that was it now the shaft of light went out in the blackout bourne pulled the woman from the wall spun her in her place his face against hers if you make a sound ill kill you i believe you she whispered terrified youre a maniac lets go he pushed her down the narrow aisle that led to the stage fifty feet away the projectors light went on again he grabbed the girls neck forcing her down into a kneeling position as he too knelt down behind her they were concealed from the killers by the rows of bodies sitting in the chairs he pressed her flesh with his fingers it was his signal to keep moving crawling slowly keeping down but moving she understood she started forward on her knees trembling the conclusions of this phase are irrefutable cried the lecturer the profit motive is inseparable from productivity incentive but the adversary roles can never be equal as socrates understood the inequality of values is constant gold simply is not brass or iron who among you can deny it slide fourteen if you please the darkness again now he yanked the woman up pushing her forward toward the stage they were within three feet of the edge cosa succede what is the matter please slide fourteen it had happened the projector was jammed again the darkness was extended again and there on the stage in front of them above them was the red glow of the exit sign jason gripped the girls arm viciously get up on that stage and run to the exit im right behind you you stop or cry out ill shoot for gods sake let me go not yet he meant it there was another exit somewhere men waiting outside for the target from marseilles go on now the st jacques woman got to her feet and ran to the stage bourne lifted her off the floor over the edge leaping up as he did so pulling her to her feet again the blinding light of the projector shot out flooding the screen washing the stage cries of surprise and derision came from the audience at the sight of two figures the shouts of the indignant bertinelli heard over the din è insoffribile ci sono comunisti qui and there were other soundsthreelethal sharp sudden cracks of a muted weapon weapons wood splintered on the molding of the proscenium arch jason hammered the girl down and lunged toward the shadows of the narrow wing space pulling her behind him da ist er da oben schnell der projektor a scream came from the center aisle of the hall as the light of the projector swung to the right spilling into the wingsbut not completely its beam was intercepted by receding upright flats that masked the offstage area light shadow light shadow and at the end of the flats at the rear of the stage was the exit a high wide metal door with a crashbar against it glass shattered the red light exploded a marksmans bullet blew out the sign above the door it did not matter he could see the gleaming brass of the crashbar clearly the lecture hall had broken out in pandemonium bourne grabbed the woman by the cloth of her blouse yanking her beyond the flats toward the door for an instant she resisted he slapped her across the face and dragged her beside him until the crashbar was above their heads bullets spat into the wall to their right the killers were racing down the aisles for accurate sightlines they would reach them in seconds and in seconds other bullets or a single bullet would find its mark there were enough shells left he knew that he had no idea how or why he knew but he knew by sound he could visualize the weapons extract the clips count the shells he smashed his forearm into the crashbar of the exit door it flew open and he lunged through the opening dragging the kicking st jacques woman with him stop it she screamed i wont go any farther youre insane those were gunshots jason slammed the large metal door shut with his foot get up no he lashed the back of his hand across her face sorry but youre coming with me get up once were outside you have my word ill let you go but where was he going now they were in another tunnel but there was no carpet no polished doors with lighted signs above them they were in some sort of deserted loading area the floor was concrete and there were two pipeframed freight dollies next to him against the wall he had been right exhibits used on the stage of suite seven had to be trucked in the exit door high enough and wide enough to accommodate large displays the door he had to block the door marie st jacques was on her feet he held her as he grabbed the first dolly pulling it by its frame in front of the exit door slamming it with his shoulder and knee until it was lodged against the metal he looked down beneath the thick wooden base were footlocks on the wheels he jammed his heel down on the front lever lock and then the back one the girl spun trying to break his grip as he stretched his leg to the end of the dolly he slid his hand down her arm gripped her wrist and twisted it inward she screamed tears in her eyes her lips trembling he pulled her alongside him forcing her to the left breaking into a run assuming the direction was toward the rear of the carillon du lac hoping hed find the exit for there and only there he might need the woman a brief few seconds when a couple emerged not a lone man running there was a series of loud crashes the killers were trying to force the stage door open but the locked freight dolly was too heavy a barrier he yanked the girl along the cement floor she tried to pull away kicking again twisting her body again from one side to the other she was over the edge of hysteria he had no choice he gripped her elbow his thumb on the inner flesh and pressed as hard as he could she gasped the pain sudden and excruciating she sobbed expelling breath allowing him to propel her forward they reached a cement staircase the four steps edged in steel leading to a pair of metal doors below it was the loading dock beyond the doors was the carillon du lacs rear parking area he was almost there it was only a question of appearances now listen to me he said to the rigid frightened woman do you want me to let you go oh god yes please then you do exactly as i say were going to walk down these steps and out that door like two perfectly normal people at the end of a normal days work youre going to link your arm in mine and were going to walk slowly talking quietly to the cars at the far end of the parking lot and were both going to laughnot loudly just casuallyas if we were remembering funny things that happened during the day have you got that nothing funny at all has happened to me during the past fifteen minutes she answered in a barely audible monotone pretend that it has i may be trapped if i am i dont care do you understand i think my wrist is broken its not my left arm my shoulder i cant move them theyre throbbing a nerve ending was depressed itll pass in a matter of minutes youll be fine youre an animal i want to live he said come on remember when i open the door look at me and smile tilt your head back laugh a little it will be the most difficult thing ive ever done its easier than dying she put her injured hand under his arm and they walked down the short flight of steps to the platform door he opened it and they went outside his hand in his topcoat pocket gripping the frenchmans pistol his eyes scanning the loading dock there was a single bulb encased in wire mesh above the door its spill defining the concrete steps to the left that led to the pavement below he led his hostage toward them she performed as he had ordered the effect macabre as they walked down the steps her face was turned to his her terrified features caught in the light her generous lips were parted stretched over her white teeth in a false tense smile her wide eyes were two dark orbs reflecting primordial fear her tearstained skin taut and pale marred by the reddish splotches where he had hit her he was looking at a face of chiseled stone a mask framed by dark red hair that cascaded over her shoulders swept back by the night breezesmoving the only living thing about the mask choked laughter came from her throat the veins in her long neck pronounced she was not far from collapsing but he could not think about that he had to concentrate on the space around them at whatever movementhowever slighthe might discern in the shadows of the large parking lot it was obvious that these back unlit regionswere used by the carillon du lacs employees it was nearly the night shift well immersed in its duties everything was still a smooth black field broken up by rows of silent automobiles ranks of huge insects the dull glass of the headlamps a hundred eyes staring at nothing a scratch metal had scraped against metal it came from the right from one of the cars in a nearby row which row which car he tilted his head back as if responding to a joke made by his companion letting his eyes roam across the windows of the cars nearest to them nothing something it was there but it was so small barely seen so bewildering a tiny circle of green an infinitesimal glow of green light it moved as they moved green small light suddenly from somewhere in a forgotten past the image of crosshairs burst across his eyes his eyes were looking at two thin intersecting lines crosshairs a scope an infrared scope of a rifle how did the killers know any number of answers a handheld radio had been used at the gemeinschaft one could be in use now he wore a topcoat his hostage wore a thin silk dress and the night was cool no woman would go out like that he swung to his left crouching lunging into marie st jacques his shoulder crashing into her stomach sending her reeling back toward the steps the muffled cracks came in staccato repetition stone and asphalt exploded all around them he dove to his right rolling over and over again the instant he made contact with the pavement yanking the pistol from his topcoat pocket then he sprang again now straight forward his left hand steadying his right wrist the gun centered aimed at the window with the rifle he fired three shots a scream came from the dark open space of the stationary car it was drawn out into a cry then a gasp and then nothing bourne lay motionless waiting listening watching prepared to fire again silence he started to get up but he could not something had happened he could barely move then the pain spread through his chest the pounding so violent he bent over supporting himself with both hands shaking his head trying to focus his eyes trying to reject the agony his left shoulder his lower chestbelow the ribs his left thighabove the knee below the hip the locations of his previous wounds where dozens of stitches had been removed over a month ago he had damaged the weakened areas stretching tendons and muscles not yet fully restored oh christ he had to get up he had to reach the wouldbe killers car pull the killer from it and get away he whipped his head up grimacing with the pain and looked over at marie st jacques she was getting slowly to her feet first on one knee then on one foot supporting herself on the outside wall of the hotel in a moment she would be standing then running away he could not let her go she would race screaming into the carillon du lac men would come some to take him some to kill him he had to stop her he let his body fall forward and started rolling to his left spinning like a wildly outofcontrol manikin until he was within four feet of the wall four feet from her he raised his gun aiming at her head help me up he said hearing the strain in his voice what you heard me help me up you said i could go you gave me your word i have to take it back no please this gun is aimed directly at your face doctor you come here and help me get up or ill blow it off he pulled the dead man from the car and ordered her to get behind the wheel then he opened the rear door and crawled into the back seat out of sight drive he said drive where i tell you whenever youre in a stress situation yourselfand theres time of coursedo exactly as you would do when you project yourself into one youre observing let your mind fall free let whatever thoughts and images that surface come cleanly try not to exercise any mental discipline be a sponge concentrate on everything and nothing specifics may come to you certain repressed conduits electrically prodded into functioning bourne thought of washburns words as he adjusted his body into the corner of the seat trying to restore some control he massaged his chest gently rubbing the bruised muscles around his previous wound the pain was still there but not as acute as it had been minutes ago you cant just tell me to drive cried the st jacques woman i dont know where im going neither do i said jason he had told her to stay on the lakeshore drive it was dark and he had to have time to think if only to be a sponge people will be looking for me she exclaimed theyre looking for me too youve taken me against my will you struck me repeatedly she spoke more softly now imposing a control on herself thats kidnapping assault those are serious crimes youre out of the hotel thats what you said you wanted let me go and i wont say anything i promise you you mean youll give me your word yes i gave you mine and took it back so could you youre different i wont no ones trying to kill met oh god please keep driving one thing was clear to him the killers had seen him drop his suitcase and leave it behind in his race for escape that suitcase told them the obvious he was getting out of zurich undoubtedly out of switzerland the airport and the train station would be watched and the car he had taken from the man he had killedwho had tried to kill himwould be the object of a search he could not go to the airport or to the train station he had to get rid of the car and find another yet he was not without resources he was carrying swiss francs and more than french francs the swiss currency in his passport case the french in the billfold he had stolen from the marquis de chamford it was more than enough to buy him secretly to paris why paris it was as though the city were a magnet pulling him to her without explanation you are not helpless you will find your way follow your instincts reasonably of course to paris have you been to zurich before he asked his hostage never you wouldnt lie to me would you ive no reason to please let me stop let me go how long have you been here a week the conference was for a week then youve had time to get around do some sightseeing i barely left the hotel there wasnt time the schedule i saw on the board didnt seem very crowded only two lectures for the entire day they were guest speakers there were never more than two a day the majority of our work was done in conference small conferences ten to fifteen people from different countries different interests youre from canada i work for the canadian government treasury board department of national revenue the doctors not medical then economics mcgill university pembroke college oxford im impressed suddenly with controlled stridency she added my superiors expect me to be in contact with them tonight if they dont hear from me theyll be alarmed theyll make inquiries theyll call the zurich police i see he said thats something to think about isnt it it occurred to bourne that throughout the shock and the violence of the last half hour the st jacques woman had not let her purse out of her hand he leaned forward wincing as he did so the pain in his chest suddenly acute again give me your purse what she moved her hand quickly from the wheel grabbing the purse in a futile attempt to keep it from him he thrust his right hand over the seat his fingers grasping the leather just drive doctor he said as he lifted the purse off the seat and leaned back again you have no right she stopped the foolishness of her remark apparent i know that he replied opening the purse turning on the sedans reading lamp moving the handbag into its spill as befitted the owner the purse was well organized passport wallet a change purse keys and assorted notes and messages in the rear pockets he looked for a specific message it was in a yellow envelope given her by the clerk at the carillon du lacs front desk he found it lifted the flap and took out the folded paper it was a cablegram from ottawa daily reports first rate leave granted will meet you at airport wednesday call or cable flight in lyon do not miss belle meuniere cuisine superb love peter jason put the cable back in the purse he saw a small book of matches the cover a glossy white scroll writing on the front he picked it out and read the name kronenhalle a restaurant a restaurant something bothered him he did not know what it was but it was there something about a restaurant he kept the matches closed the purse and leaned forward dropping it on the front seat thats all i wanted to see he said settling back into the corner staring at the matches i seem to remember your saying something about word from ottawa you got it the twentysixth is over a week away please the supplication was a cry for help he heard it for what it was but could not respond for the next hour or so he needed this woman needed her as a lame man needed a crutch or more aptly as one who could not function behind a wheel needed a driver but not in this car turn around he ordered head back to the carillon to the hotel yes he said his eyes on the matches turning them over and over in his hand under the light of the reading lamp we need another car we no you cant i wont go any again she stopped before the statement was made before the thought was completed another thought had obviously struck her she was abruptly silent as she swung the wheel until the sedan was facing the opposite direction on the dark lakeshore road she pressed the accelerator down with such force that the car bolted the tires spun under the sudden burst of speed she depressed the pedal instantly gripping the wheel trying to control herself bourne looked up from the matches at the back of her head at the long dark red hair that shone in the light he took the gun from his pocket and once more leaned forward directly behind her he raised the weapon moving his hand over her shoulder turning the barrel and pressing it against her cheek understand me clearly youre going to do exactly as i tell you youre going to be right at my side and this gun will be in my pocket it will be aimed at your stomach just as its aimed at your head right now as youve seen im running for my life and i wont hesitate to pull the trigger i want you to understand i understand her reply was a whisper she breathed through her parted lips her terror complete jason removed the barrel of the gun from her cheek he was satisfied satisfied and revolted let your mind fall free the matches what was it about the matches but it was not the matches it was the restaurantnot the kronenhalle but a restaurant heavy beams candlelight black triangles on the outside white stone and black triangles three three black triangles someone was there at a restaurant with three triangles in front the image was so clear so vivid so disturbing what was it did such a place even exist specifics may come to you certain repressed conduits prodded into functioning was it happening now oh christ i cant stand it he could see the lights of the carillon du lac several hundred yards down the road he had not fully thought out his moves but was operating on two assumptions the first was that the killers had not remained on the premises on the other hand bourne was not about to walk into a trap of his own making he knew two of the killers he would not recognize others if they had been left behind the main parking area was beyond the circular drive on the left side of the hotel slow down jason ordered turn into the first drive on the left its an exit protested the woman her voice strained were going the wrong way no ones coming out go on drive into the parking lot past the lights the scene at the hotels canopied entrance explained why no one paid attention to them there were four police cars lined up in the circular drive their roof lights revolving conveying the aura of emergency he could see uniformed police tuxedoed hotel clerks at their sides among the crowds of excited hotel guests they were asking questions as well as answering them checking off names of those leaving in automobiles marie st jacques drove across the parking area beyond the floodlights and into an open space on the right she turned off the engine and sat motionless staring straight ahead be very careful said bourne rolling down his window and move slowly open your door and get out then stand by mine and help me remember the windows open and the guns in my hand youre only two or three feet in front of me theres no way i could miss if i fired she did as she was told a terrified automaton jason supported himself on the frame of the window and pulled himself to the pavement he shifted his weight from one foot to another mobility was returning he could walk not well and with a limp but he could walk what are you going to do asked the st jacques woman as if she were afraid to hear his answer wait sooner or later someone will drive a car back here and park it no matter what happened in there its still dinnertime reservations were made parties arranged a lot of it business those people wont change their plans and when a car does come how will you take it she paused then answered her own question oh my god youre going to kill whoevers driving it he gripped her arm her frightened chalkwhite face inches away he had to control her by fear but not to the point where she might slip into hysterics if i have to i will but i dont think itll be necessary parking attendants bring the cars back here keys are usually left on the dashboard or under the seats its just easier headlight beams shot out from the fork in the circular drive a small coupé entered the lot accelerating once into it the mark of an attendant driver the car came directly toward them alarming bourne until he saw the empty space nearby but they were in the path of the headlights they had been seen reservations for the dining room a restaurant jason made his decision he would use the moment the attendant got out of the coupé and placed the keys under the seat as he walked to the rear of the car he nodded at them not without curiosity bourne spoke in french hey young fellow maybe you can help us sir the attendant approached them haltingly cautiously the events in the hotel obviously on his mind im not feeling so well too much of your excellent swiss wine it will happen sir the young man smiled relieved my wife thought it would be a good idea to get some air before we left for town a good idea sir is everything still crazy inside i didnt think the police officer would let us out until he saw that i might be sick all over his uniform crazy sir theyre everywhere weve been told not to discuss it of course but weve got a problem an associate flew in this afternoon and we agreed to meet at a restaurant only ive forgotten the name ive been there but i just cant remember where it is or what its called i do remember that on the front there were three odd shapes a design of some sort i think triangles i believe thats the drei alpenhäuser sir the three chalets its in a sidestreet off the falkenstrasse yes of course thats it and to get there from here we bourne trailed off the words a man with too much wine trying to concentrate just turn left out of the exit sir stay on the uto quai for about one hundred meters until you reach a large pier then turn right it will take you into the falkenstrasse once you pass seefeld you cant miss the street or the restaurant theres a sign on the corner thank you will you be here a few hours from now when we return im on duty until two this morning sir good ill look for you and express my gratitude more concretely thank you sir may i get your car for you youve done enough thanks a little more walking is required the attendant saluted and started for the front of the hotel jason led marie st jacques toward the coupé limping beside her hurry up the keys are under the seat if they stop us what will you do that attendant will see the car go out hell know youve stolen it i doubt it not if we leave right away the minute hes back in that crowd suppose he does then i hope youre a fast driver said bourne pushing her toward the door get in the attendant had turned the corner and suddenly hurried his pace jason took out the gun and limped rapidly around the hood of the coupé supporting himself on it while pointing the pistol at the windshield he opened the passenger door and climbed in beside her goddamn iti said get the keys all right i cant think try harder oh god she reached below the seat stabbing her hand around the carpet until she found the small leather case start the motor but wait until i tell you to back out he watched for headlight beams to shine into the area from the circular drive it would be a reason for the attendant to have suddenly broken into a near run a car to be parked they did not come the reason could be something else two unknown people in the parking lot go ahead quickly i want to get out of here she threw the gear into reverse seconds later they approached the exit into the lakeshore drive slow down he commanded a taxi was swinging into the curve in front of them bourne held his breath and looked through the opposite window at the carillon du lads entrance the scene under the canopy explained the attendants sudden decision to hurry an argument had broken out between the police and a group of hotel guests a line had formed names checked off for those leaving the hotel the resulting delays angering the innocent lets go said jason wincing again the pain shooting through his chest were clear it was a numbing sensation eerie and uncanny the three triangles were as he had pictured them thick dark wood raised in basrelief on white stone three equal triangles abstract renditions of chalet roofs in a valley of snow so deep the lower stories were obscured above the three points was the restaurants name in germanic letters drei alpenhauser below the baseline of the center triangles was the entrance double doors that together formed a cathedral arch the hardware massive rings of iron common to an alpine château the surrounding buildings on both sides of the narrow brick street were restored structures of a zurich and a europe long past it was not a street for automobiles instead one pictured elaborate coaches drawn by horses drivers sitting high in mufflers and top hats and gas lamps everywhere it was a street filled with the sights and sounds of forgotten memories thought the man who had no memory to forget yet he had had one vivid and disturbing three dark triangles heavy beams and candlelight he had been right it was a memory of zurich but in another life were here said the woman i know tell me what to do she cried were going past it go to the next corner and turn left go around the block then drive back through here why i wish i knew what because i said so someone was there at that restaurant why didnt other images come another image a face they drove down the street past the restaurant twice more two separate couples and a foursome went inside a single man came out heading for the falkenstrasse to judge from the cars parked on the curb there was a mediumsized crowd at the drei alpenhäuser it would grow in number as the next two hours passed most of zurich preferring its evening meal nearer tenthirty than eight there was no point in delaying any longer nothing further came to bourne he could only sit and watch and hope something would come something for something had a book of matches had evoked an image of reality within that reality there was a truth he had to discover pull over to your right in front of the last car well walk back silently without comment or protest the st jacques woman did as she was told jason looked at her her reaction was too docile inconsistent with her previous behavior he understood a lesson had to be taught regardless of what might happen inside the drei alpenhäuser he needed her for a final contribution she had to drive him out of zurich the car came to a stop tires scraping the curb she turned off the motor and began to remove the keys her movement slow too slow he reached over and held her wrist she stared at him in the shadows without breathing he slid his fingers over her hand until he felt the key case ill take those he said naturally she replied her left hand unnaturally at her side poised by the panel of the door now get out and stand by the hood he continued dont do anything foolish why should i youd kill me good he reached for the handle of the door exaggerating the difficulty the back of his head was to her he snapped the handle down the rustle of fabric was sudden the rush of air more sudden still her door crashed open the woman half out into the street but bourne was ready a lesson had to be taught he spun around his left arm an uncoiling spring his hand a claw gripping the silk of her dress between her shoulder blades he pulled her back into the seat and grabbing her by the hair yanked her head toward him until her neck was stretched her face against his i wont do it again she cried tears welling at her eyes i swear to you i wont he reached across and pulled the door shut then looked at her closely trying to understand something in himself thirty minutes ago in another car he had experienced a degree of nausea when he had pressed the barrel of the gun into her cheek threatening to take her life if she disobeyed him there was no such revulsion now with one overt action she had crossed over into another territory she had become an enemy a threat he could kill her if he had to kill her without emotion because it was the practical thing to do say something she whispered her body went into a brief spasm her breasts pressing against the dark silk of her dress rising and falling with the agitated movement she gripped her own wrist in an attempt to control herself she partially succeeded she spoke again the whisper replaced by a monotone i said i wouldnt do it again and i wont youll try he replied quietly therell come a moment when you think you can make it and youll try believe me when i tell you you cant but if you try again i will have to kill you i dont want to do that theres no reason for it no reason at all unless you become a threat to me and in running away before i let you go you do just that i cant allow it he had spoken the truth as he understood the truth the simplicity of the decision was as astonishing to him as the decision itself killing was a practical matter nothing else you say youll let me go she said when when im safe he answered when it doesnt make any difference what you say or do when will that be an hour or so from now when were out of zurich and im on my way to someplace else you wont know where or how why should i believe you i dont care whether you do or not he released her pull yourself together dry your eyes and comb your hair were going inside whats in there i wish i knew he said glancing through the rear window at the door of the drei alpenhäuser you said that before he looked at her at the wide brown eyes that were searching his searching in fear in bewilderment i know hurry up there were thick beams running across the high alpine ceiling tables and chairs of heavy wood deep booths and candlelight everywhere an accordion player moved through the crowd muted strains of bavarian music coming from his instrument he had seen the large room before the beams and the candlelight printed somewhere in his mind the sounds recorded also he had come here in another life they stood in the shallow foyer in front of the maître ds station the tuxedoed man greeted them haben sie einen tisch schon reserviert mein herr if you mean reservations im afraid not but you were highly recommended i hope you can fit us in a booth if possible certainly sir its the early sitting were not yet crowded this way please they were taken to a booth in the nearest corner a flickering candle in the center of the table bournes limp and the fact that he held on to the woman dictated the closest available location jason nodded to marie st jacques she sat down and he slid into the booth opposite her move against the wall he said after the maitre d had left remember the guns in my pocket and all i have to do is raise my foot and youre trapped i said i wouldnt try i hope you dont order a drink theres no time to eat i couldnt eat she gripped her wrist again her hands visibly trembling why isnt there time what are you waiting for i dont know why do you keep saying that i dont know i wish i knew why did you come here because ive been here before thats no answer theres no reason for me to give you one a waiter approached the st jacques woman asked for wine bourne ordered scotch needing the stronger drink he looked around the restaurant trying to concentrate on everything and nothing a sponge but there was only nothing no images filled his mind no thoughts intruded on his absence of thought nothing and then he saw the face across the room it was a large face set in a large head above an obese body pressed against the wall of an end booth next to a closed door the fat man stayed in the shadows of his observation point as if they were his protection the unlit section of the floor his sanctuary his eyes were riveted on jason equal parts fear and disbelief in his stare bourne did not know the face but the face knew him the man brought his fingers to his lips and wiped the corners of his mouth then shifted his eyes taking in each diner at every table only then did he begin what was obviously a painful journey around the room toward their booth a mans coming over here jason said over the flame of the candle a fat man and hes afraid dont say anything no matter what he says keep your mouth shut and dont look at him raise your hand rest your head on your elbow casually look at the wall not him the woman frowned bringing her right hand to her face her fingers trembled her lips formed a question but no words came jason answered the unspoken for your own good he said theres no point in his being able to identify you the fat man edged around the corner of the booth bourne blew out the candle throwing the table into relative darkness the man stared him down and spoke in a low strained voice du lieber gott why did you come here what have i done that you should do this to me i enjoy the food you know that have you no feelings i have a family a wife and children i did only as i was told i gave you the envelope i did not look inside i know nothing but you were paid werent you asked jason instinctively yes but i said nothing we never met i never described you i spoke to no one then why are you afraid im just an ordinary patron about to order dinner i beg you leave now im angry youd better tell me why the fat man brought his hand to his face his fingers again wiping the moisture that had formed around his mouth he angled his head glancing at the door then turned back to bourne others may have spoken others may know who you are ive had my share of trouble with the police they would come directly to me the st jacques woman lost control she looked at jason the words escaping the police they were the police bourne glared at her then turned back to the nervous fat man are you saying the police would harm your wife and children not in themselvesas you well know but their interest would lead others to me to my family how many are there that look for you mein herr and what are they that do you need no answer from me they stop at nothingthe death of a wife or a child is nothing please on my life ive said nothing leave youre exaggerating jason brought the drink to his lips a prelude to dismissal in the name of christ dont do this the man leaned over gripping the edge of the table you wish proof of my silence i give it to you word was spread throughout the verbrecherwelt anyone with any information whatsoever should call a number set up by the zurich police everything would be kept in the strictest confidence they would not lie in the verbrecherwelt about that rewards were ample the police in several countries sending funds through interpol past misunderstandings might be seen in new judicial lights the conspirator stood up wiping his mouth again his large bulk hovering above the wood a man like myself could profit from a kinder relationship with the police yet i did nothing in spite of the guarantee of confidentiality i did nothing at all did anyone else tell me the truth ill know if youre lying i know only chernak hes the only one ive ever spoken with who admits having even seen you but you know that the envelope was passed through him to me hed never say anything wheres chernak now where he always is in his flat on the löwenstrasse ive never been there whats the number youve never been the fat man paused his lips pressed together alarm in his eyes are you testing me answer the question number you know it as well as i do then im testing you who gave the envelope to chernak the man stood motionless his dubious integrity challenged i have no way of knowing nor would i ever inquire you werent even curious of course not a goat does not willingly enter the wolfs cave goats are surefooted theyve got an accurate sense of smell and they are cautious mein herr because the wolf is faster infinitely more aggressive there would be only one chase the goats last what was in the envelope i told you i did not open it but you know what was in it money i presume you presume very well money a great deal of money if there was any discrepancy it had nothing to do with me now please i beg you get out of here one last question anything just leave what was the money for the obese man stared down at bourne his breathing audible sweat glistening on his chin you put me on the rack mein herr but i will not turn away from you call it the courage of an insignificant goat who has survived every day i read the newspapers in three languages six months ago a man was killed his death was reported on the front page of each of those papers they circled the block emerging on the falkenstrasse then turned right on the limmat quai toward the cathedral of grossmünster the löwenstrasse was across the river on the west side of the city the quickest way to reach it was to cross the munster bridge to the bahnhofstrasse then to the nüschelerstrasse the streets intersected according to a couple who had been about to enter the drei alpenhäuser marie st jacques was silent holding onto the wheel as she had gripped the straps of her handbag during the madness at the carillon somehow her connection with sanity bourne glanced at her and understood a man was killed his death reported on the front pages of each of those papers jason bourne had been paid to kill and the police in several countries had sent funds through interpol to convert reluctant informers to broaden the base of his capture which meant that other men had been killed how many are there that look for you mein herr and what are they that do they stop at nothingthe death of a wife or a child is nothing not the police others the twin bell towers of the grossmünster church rose in the night sky floodlights creating eerie shadows jason stared at the ancient structure as so much else he knew it but did not know it he had seen it before yet he was seeing it now for the first time i know only chernak the envelope was passed through him to me löwenstrasse number you know it as well as i do did he would he they drove over the bridge into the traffic of the newer city the streets were crowded automobiles and pedestrians vying for supremacy at every intersection the red and green signals erratic and interminable bourne tried to concentrate on nothing and everything the outlines of the truth were being presented to him shape by enigmatic shape each more startling than the last he was not at all sure he was capablementally capableof absorbing a great deal more halt die dame da die scheinwerfer sind aus und sie haben links signaliziert das ist eine einbahnstrasse jason looked up a hollow pain knotting his stomach a patrol car was beside them a policeman shouting through his open window everything was suddenly clear clear and infuriating the st jacques woman had seen the police car in the sideview mirror she had extinguished the headlights and slipped her hand down to the directional signal flipping it for a left turn a left turn into a oneway street whose arrows at the intersection clearly defined the traffic heading right and turning left by bolting in front of the police car would result in several violations the absence of headlights perhaps even a premeditated collision they would be stopped the woman free to scream bourne snapped the headlights on then leaned across the girl one hand disengaging the directional signal the other gripping her arm where he had gripped it before ill kill you doctor he said quietly then shouted through the window at the police officer sorry were a little confused tourists we want the next block the policeman was barely two feet away from marie st jacques his eyes on her face evidently puzzled by her lack of reaction the light changed ease forward dont do anything stupid said jason he waved at the police officer through the glass sorry again he yelled the policeman shrugged turning to his partner to resume a previous conversation i wasconfused said the girl her soft voice trembling theres so much traffic oh god youve broken my arm you bastard bourne released her disturbed by her anger he preferred fear you dont expect me to believe you do you my arm your confusion you said we were going to turn left soon thats all i was thinking about next time look at the traffic he moved away from her but did not take his eyes off her face you are an animal she whispered briefly closing her eyes opening them in fear it had come back they reached the löwenstrasse a wide avenue where low buildings of brick and heavy wood stood sandwiched between modern examples of smooth concrete and glass the character of nineteenthcentury flats competed against the utilitarianism of contemporary neuterness they did not lose jason watched the numbers they were descending from the middle eighties with each block the old houses more in evidence than the highrise apartments until the street had returned in time to that other era there was a row of neat fourstory flats roofs and windows framed in wood stone steps and railings leading up to recessed doorways washed in the light of carriage lamps bourne recognized the unremembered the fact that he did so was not startling but something else was the row of houses evoked another image a very strong image of another row of flats similar in outlines but oddly different weathered older nowhere near as neat or scrubbed cracked windows broken steps incomplete railingsjagged ends of rusted iron further away in another part of zurich yes they were in zurich in a small district rarely if ever visited by those who did not live there a part of the city that was left behind but not gracefully steppdeckstrasse he said to himself concentrating on the image in his mind he could see a doorway the paint a faded red as dark as the red silk dress worn by the woman beside him a boardinghouse in the steppdeckstrasse what marie st jacques was startled the words he uttered alarmed her she had obviously related them to herself and was terrified nothing he took his eyes off the dress and looked out the window theres number he said pointing to the fifth house in the row stop the car he got out first ordering her to slide across the seat and follow he tested his legs and took the keys from her you can walk she said if you can walk you can drive i probably can then let me go ive done everything youve wanted and then some he added i wont say anything cant you understand that youre the last person on earth i ever want to see again or have anything to do with i dont want to be a witness or get involved with the police or statements or anything i dont want to be a part of what youre a part of im frightened to death thats your protection dont you see let me go please i cant you dont believe me thats not relevant i need you for what for something very stupid i dont have a drivers license you cant rent a car without a drivers license and ive got to rent a car youve got this car its good for maybe another hour someones going to walk out of the carillon du lac and want it the description will be radioed to every police car in zurich she looked at him dead fear in the glaze of her eyes i dont want to go up there with you i heard what that man said in the restaurant if i hear any more youll kill me what you heard makes no more sense to me than it does to you perhaps less come on he took her by the arm and put his free hand on the railing so he could climb the steps with a minimum of pain she stared at him bewilderment and fear converged in her look the name m chernak was under the second mail slot a bell beneath the letters he did not ring it but pressed the adjacent four buttons within seconds a cacophony of voices sprang out of the small dotted speakers asking in schweizerdeutsch who was there but someone did not answer he merely pressed a buzzer which released the lock jason opened the door pushing marie st jacques in front of him he moved her against the wall and waited from above came the sounds of doors opening footsteps walking toward the staircase wer ist da johann wo bist du denn silence followed by words of irritation footsteps were heard again doors closed m chernak was on the second floor flat c bourne took the girls arm limped with her to the staircase and started the climb she was right of course it would be far better if he were alone but there was nothing he could do about that he did need her he had studied road maps during the weeks in port noir lucerne was no more than an hour away bern two and a half or three he could head for either one dropping her off in some deserted spot along the way and then disappear it was simply a matter of timing he had the resources to buy a hundred connections he needed only a conduit out of zurich and she was it but before he left zurich he had to know he had to talk to a man named m chernak the name was to the right of the doorbell he sidestepped away from the door pulling the woman with him do you speak german jason asked no dont lie im not bourne thought glancing up and down the short hallway then ring the bell if the door opens just stand there if someone answers from inside say you have a messagean urgent message from a friend at the drei alpenhäuser suppose heor shesays to slide it under the door jason looked at her very good i just dont want any more violence i dont want to know anything or see anything i just want to i know he interrupted go back to caesars taxes and the punic wars if heor shesays something like that explain in a couple of words that the message is verbal and can only be delivered to the man who was described to you if he asks for that description said marie st jacques icily analysis momentarily preempting fear youve got a good mind doctor he said im precise im frightened i told you that what do i do say to hell with them someone else can deliver it then start to walk away she moved to the door and rang the bell there was an odd sound from within a scratching growing louder constant then it stopped and a deep voice was heard through the wood ja im afraid i dont speak german englisch what is it who are you i have an urgent message from a friend at the drei alpenhäuser shove it under the door i cant do that it isnt written down i have to deliver it personally to the man who was described to me well that shouldnt be difficult said the voice the lock clicked and the door opened bourne stepped away from the wall into the doorframe youre insane cried a man with two stumps for legs propped up in a wheelchair get out get away from here im tired of hearing that said jason pulling the girl inside and closing the door it took no pressure to convince marie st jacques to remain in a small windowless bedroom while they talked she did so willingly the legless chernak was close to panic his ravaged face chalk white his unkempt gray hair matted about his neck and forehead what do you want from me he asked you swore the last transaction was our final one i can do no more i cannot take the risk messengers have been here no matter how cautious how many times removed from your sources they have been here if one leaves an address in the wrong surroundings im a dead man youve done pretty well for the risks youve taken said bourne standing in front of the wheelchair his mind racing wondering if there was a word or a phrase that could trigger a flow of information then he remembered the envelope if there was any discrepancy it had nothing to do with me a fat man at the drei alpenhäuser minor compared to the magnitude of those risks chernak shook his head his upper chest heaved the stumps that fell over the chair moved obscenely back and forth i was content before you came into my life mein herr for i was minor an old soldier who made his way to zurich blown up a cripple worthless except for certain facts stored away that former comrades paid meagerly to keep suppressed it was a decent life not much but enough then you found me im touched broke in jason lets talk about the envelopethe envelope you passed to our mutual friend at drei alpenhäuser who gave it to you a messenger who else where did it come from how would i know it arrived in a box just like the others i unpacked it and sent it on it was you who wished it so you said you could not come here any longer but you opened it a statement never suppose i told you there was money missing then it was not paid it was not in the envelope the legless mans voice rose however i dont believe you if that were so you would not have accepted the assignment but you did accept that assignment so why are you here now because i have to know because im going out of my mind i see things and i hear things i do not understand im a skilled resourceful vegetable help me bourne moved away from the chair he walked aimlessly toward a bookcase where there were several upright photographs recessed against the wall they explained the man behind him groups of german soldiers some with shepherd dogs posing outside of barracks and by fences and in front of a highwire gate with part of a name showing dach dachau the man behind him he was moving jason turned the legless chernak had his hand in the canvas bag strapped to his chair his eyes were on fire his ravaged face contorted the hand came out swiftly in it a shortbarreled revolver and before bourne could reach his own chernak fired the shots came rapidly the icelike pain filling his left shoulder then headoh god he dove to his right spinning on the rug shoving a heavy floor lamp toward the cripple spinning again until he was at the far side of the wheelchair he crouched and lunged crashing his right shoulder into chernaks back sending the legless man out of the chair as he reached into his pocket for the gun theyll pay for your corpse screamed the deformed man writhing on the floor trying to steady his slumped body long enough to level his weapon you wont put me in a coffin ill see you there carlos will pay by christ hell pay jason sprang to the left and fired chernaks head snapped back his throat erupting in blood he was dead a cry came from the door of the bedroom it grew in depth low and hollow an elongated wail fear and revulsion weaved into the chord a womans cry of course it was a woman his hostage his conduit out of zurich oh jesus he could not focus his eyes his temple was in agony he found his vision refusing to acknowledge the pain he saw a bathroom the door open towels and a sink and a mirrored cabinet he ran in pulled the mirror back with such force that it jumped its hinges crashing to the floor shattered shelves rolls of gauze and tape and they were all he could grab he had to get out gunshots gunshots were alarms he had to get out take his hostage and get away the bedroom the bedroom where was it the cry the wail follow the cry he reached the door and kicked it open the woman his hostagewhat the hell was her namewas pressed against the wall tears streaming down her face her lips parted he rushed in and grabbed her by the wrist dragging her out my god you killed him she cried an old man with no shut up he pushed her toward the door opened it and shoved her into the hallway he could see blurred figures in open spaces by railings inside rooms they began running disappearing he heard doors slam people shout he took the womans arm with his left hand the grip caused shooting pains in his shoulder he propelled her to the staircase and forced her to descend with him using her for support his right hand holding the gun they reached the lobby and the heavy door open it he ordered she did they passed the row of mailboxes to the outside entrance he released her briefly opening the door himself peering out into the street listening for sirens there were none come on he said pulling her out to the stone steps and down to the pavement he reached into his pocket wincing and took out the car keys get in inside the car he unraveled the gauze bunching it against the side of his head blotting the trickle of blood from deep inside his consciousness there was a strange feeling of relief the wound was a graze the fact that it had been his head had sent him into panic but the bullet had not entered his skull it had not entered there would be no return to the agonies of port noir goddamn it start the car get out of here where you didnt say where the woman was not screaming instead she was calm unreasonably calm looking at him was she looking at him he was feeling dizzy again losing focus again steppdeckstrasse he heard the word as he spoke it not sure the voice was his but he could picture the doorway faded dark red paint cracked glass rusted iron steppdeckstrasse he repeated what was wrong why wasnt the motor going why didnt the car move forward didnt she hear him his eyes were closed he opened them the gun it was on his lap he had set it down to press the bandage she was hitting it hitting it the weapon crashed to the floor he reached down and she pushed him sending his head against the window her door opened and she leaped out into the street and began running she was running away his hostage his conduit was racing up the löwenstrasse he could not stay in the car he dared not try to drive it it was a steel trap marking him he put the gun in his pocket with the roll of tape and grabbed the gauze clutching it in his left hand ready to press it against his temple at the first recurrence of blood he got out and limped as fast as he could down the pavement somewhere there was a corner somewhere a taxi steppdeckstrasse marie st jacques kept running in the middle of the wide deserted avenue in and out of the spills of the streetlamps waving her arms at the automobiles in the löwenstrasse they sped by her she turned in the wash of headlights behind her holding up her hands pleading for attention the cars accelerated and passed her by this was zurich and the löwenstrasse at night was too wide too dark too near the deserted park and the river sihl the men in one automobile however were aware of her its headlights were off the driver inside having seen the woman in the distance he spoke to his companion in schweizerdeutsch it could be her this chernak lives only a block or so down the street stop and let her come closer shes supposed to be wearing a silk its her lets make certain before we radio the others both men got out of the car the passenger moving discreetly around the trunk to join the driver they wore conservative business suits their faces pleasant but serious businesslike the panicked woman approached they walked rapidly into the middle of the street the driver called out was ist passiert fräulein help me she screamed i i dont speak german nicht sprechen call the police the polizei the drivers companion spoke with authority calming her with his voice we are with the police he said in english zurich sicherheitpolizei we werent sure miss you are the woman from the carillon du lac yes she cried he wouldnt let me go he kept hitting me threatening me with his gun it was horrible where is he now hes hurt he was shot i ran from the car he was in the car when i ran she pointed down the löwenstrasse over there two blocks i thinkin the middle of the block a coupé a gray coupé he has a gun so do we miss said the driver come along get in the back of the car youll be perfectly safe well be very careful quickly now they approached the gray coupé coasting headlights extinguished there was no one inside there were however people talking excitedly on the pavement and up the stone steps of number the drivers associate turned and spoke to the frightened woman pressed into the corner of the rear seat this is the residence of a man named chernak did he mention him did he say anything about going in to see him he did go he made me come with him he killed him he killed that crippled old man der senderschnell said the associate to the driver as he grabbed a microphone from the dashboard wir sind zwei strassen von da the car bolted forward the woman gripped the front seat what are you doing a man was killed back there and we must find the killer said the driver as you say he was wounded he may still be in the area this is an unmarked vehicle and we could spot him well wait of course to make sure the inspection team arrives but our duties are quite separate the car slowed down sliding into the curb several hundred yards from number löwenstrasse the associate had spoken into the microphone while the driver had explained their official position there was static from the dashboard speaker then the words wir kommen binnen zwanzig minuten wartet our superior will be here shortly the associate said were to wait for him he wishes to speak with you marie st jacques leaned back in the seat closing her eyes expelling her breath oh godi wish i had a drink the driver laughed nodded to his companion the associate took out a pint bottle from the glove compartment and held it up smiling at the woman were not very chic miss we have no glasses or cups but we do have brandy for medical emergencies of course i think this is one now please our compliments she smiled back and accepted the bottle youre two very nice people and youll never know how grateful i am if you ever come to canada ill cook you the best french meal in the province of ontario thank you miss said the driver bourne studied the bandage on his shoulder squinting at the dull reflection in the dirty streaked mirror adjusting his eyes to the dim light of the filthy room he had been right about the steppdeckstrasse the image of the faded red doorway accurate down to the cracked windowpanes and rusted iron railings no questions had been asked when he rented the room in spite of the fact that he was obviously hurt however a statement had been made by the building manager when bourne paid him for something more substantial a doctor can be found who keeps his mouth shut ill let you know the wound was not that severe the tape would hold it until he found a doctor somewhat more reliable than one who practiced surreptitiously in the steppdeckstrasse if a stress situation results in injury be aware of the fact that the damage may be as much psychological as physical you may have a very real revulsion to pain and bodily harm dont take risks but if theres time give yourself a chance to adjust dont panic he had panicked areas of his body had frozen although the penetration in his shoulder and the graze at his temple were real and painful neither was serious enough to immobilize him he could not move as fast as he might wish or with the strength he knew he had but he could move deliberately messages were sent and received brain to muscle and limb he could function he would function better after a rest he had no conduit now he had to be up long before daybreak and find another way out of zurich the building manager on the first floor liked money he would wake up the slovenly landlord in an hour or so he lowered himself onto the sagging bed and lay back on the pillow staring at the naked lightbulb in the ceiling trying not to hear the words so he could rest they came anyway filling his ears like the pounding of kettledrums a man was killed but you did accept that assignment he turned to the wall shutting his eyes blocking out the words then other words came and he sat up sweat breaking out on his forehead theyll pay for your corpse carlos will pay by christ hell pay carlos a large sedan pulled up in front of the coupe and parked at the curb behind them at löwenstrasse the patrol cars had arrived fifteen minutes ago the ambulance less than five crowds from surrounding flats lined the pavement near the staircase but the excitement was muted now a death had occurred a man killed at night in this quiet section of the löwenstrasse anxiety was uppermost what had happened at number could happen at or or the world was going mad and zurich was going with it our superior has arrived miss may we take you to him please the associate got out of the car and opened the door for marie st jacques certainly she stepped out on the pavement and felt the mans hand on her arm it was so much gentler than the hard grip of the animal who had held the barrel of a gun to her cheek she shuddered at the memory they approached the rear of the sedan and she climbed inside she sat back in the seat and looked at the man beside her she gasped suddenly paralyzed unable to breathe the man beside her evoking a memory of terror the light from the streetlamps was reflected off the thin gold rims of his spectacles you you were at the hotel you were one of them the man nodded wearily his fatigue apparent thats right were a special branch of the zurich police and before we speak further i must make it clear to you that at no time during the events of the carillon du lac were you in any danger of being harmed by us were trained marksmen no shots were fired that could have struck you a number were withheld because you were too close to the man in our sights her shock eased the mans quiet authority reassuring thank you for that its a minor talent said the official now as i understand you last saw him in the front seat of the car back there yes he was wounded how seriously enough to be incoherent he held some kind of bandage to his head and there was blood on his shoulderon the cloth of his coat i mean who is he names are meaningless he goes by many but as youve seen hes a killer a brutal killer and he must be found before he kills again weve been hunting him for several years many police from many countries we have the opportunity now none of them has had we know hes in zurich and hes wounded he would not stay in this area but how far can he go did he mention how he expected to get out of the city he was going to rent a car in my name i gather he doesnt have a drivers license he was lying he travels with all manner of false papers you were an expendable hostage now from the beginning tell me everything he said to you where you went whom he met whatever comes to mind theres a restaurant drei alpenhäuser and a large fat man who was frightened to death marie st jacques recounted everything she could remember from time to time the police official interrupted questioning her about a phrase or reaction or a sudden decision on the part of the killer intermittently he removed his gold spectacles wiping them absently gripping the frames as if the pressure controlled his irritation the interrogation lasted nearly twentyfive minutes then the official made his decision he spoke to his driver drei alpenhäuser schnell he turned to marie st jacques well confront that man with his own words his incoherence was quite intentional he knows far more than he said at the table incoherence she said the word softly remembering her own use of it steppdeck steppdeckstrasse cracked windows rooms what a boardinghouse in the steppdeckstrasse thats what he said everything was happening so fast but he said it and just before i jumped out of the car he said it again steppdeckstrasse the driver spoke ich kenne diese strasse früher gab es textilfabriken da i dont understand said marie st jacques its a rundown section that has not kept up with the times replied the official the old fabric mills used to be there a haven for the less fortunate and others los he ordered they drove off a crack outside the room snaplike echoing off into a sharp coda the sound penetrating diminishing in the distance bourne opened his eyes the staircase the staircase in the filthy hallway outside his room someone had been walking up the steps and had stopped aware of the noise his weight had caused on the warped cracked wood a normal boarder at the steppdeckstrasse rooming house would have no such concerns silence crack now closer a risk was taken timing paramount speed the cover jason spun off the bed grabbing the gun that was by his head and lunged to the wall by the door he crouched hearing the footstepsone manthe runner no longer concerned with sound only with reaching his destination bourne had no doubt what it was he was right the door crashed open he smashed it back then threw his full weight into the wood pinning the intruder against the doorframe pummeling the mans stomach chest and arm into the recessed edge of the wall he pulled the door back and lashed the toe of his right foot into the throat below him reaching down with his left hand grabbing blond hair and yanking the figure inside the mans hand went limp the gun in it fell to the floor a longbarreled revolver with a silencer attached jason closed the door and listened for sounds on the staircase there were none he looked down at the unconscious man thief killer what was he police had the manager of the boardinghouse decided to overlook the code of the steppdeckstrasse in search of a reward bourne rolled the intruder over and took out a billfold second nature made him remove the money knowing it was ludicrous to do so he had a small fortune on him he looked at the various credit cards and the drivers license he smiled but then his smile disappeared there was nothing funny the names on the cards were different ones the name on the license matching none the unconscious man was no police officer he was a professional come to kill a wounded man in the steppdeckstrasse someone had hired him who who could possibly know he was there the woman had he mentioned the steppdeckstrasse when he had seen the row of neat houses looking for number no it was not she he may have said something but she would not have understood and if she had thered be no professional killer in his room instead the rundown boardinghouse would be surrounded by police the image of a large fat man perspiring above a table came to bourne that same man had wiped the sweat from his protruding lips and had spoken of the courage of an insignificant goatwho had survived was this an example of his survival technique had he known about the steppdeckstrasse was he aware of the habits of the patron whose sight terrified him had he been to the filthy rooming house delivered an envelope there jason pressed his hand to his forehead and shut his eyes why cant i remember when will the mists clear will they ever clear dont crucify yourself bourne opened his eyes fixing them on the blond man for the briefest of moments he nearly burst out laughing he had been presented with his exit visa from zurich and instead of recognizing it he was wasting time tormenting himself he put the billfold in his pocket wedging it behind the marquis de chamfords picked up the gun and shoved it into his belt then dragged the unconscious figure over to the bed a minute later the man was strapped to the sagging mattress gagged by a torn sheet wrapped around his face he would remain where he was for hours and in hours jason would be out of zurich compliments of a perspiring fat man he had slept in his clothes there was nothing to gather up or carry except his topcoat he put it on and tested his leg somewhat after the fact he reflected in the heat of the past few minutes he had been unaware of the pain it was there as the limp was there but neither immobilized him the shoulder was not in as good shape a slow paralysis was spreading he had to get to a doctor his head he did not want to think about his head he walked out into the dimly lit hallway pulled the door closed and stood motionless listening there was a burst of laughter from above he pressed his back against the wall gun poised the laughter trailed off it was a drunks laughterincoherent pointless he limped to the staircase held on to the railing and started down he was on the third floor of the fourstory building having insisted on the highest room when the phrase high ground had come to him instinctively why had it come to him what did it mean in terms of renting a filthy room for a single night sanctuary stop it he reached the second floor landing creaks in the wooden staircase accompanying each step if the manager came out of his flat below to satisfy his curiosity it would be the last thing he satisfied for several hours a noise a scratch soft fabric moving briefly across an abrasive surface cloth against wood someone was concealed in the short stretch of hallway between the end of one staircase and the beginning of another without breaking the rhythm of his walk he peered into the shadows there were three recessed doorways in the right wall identical to the floor above in one of them he took a step closer not the first it was empty and it would not be the last the bordering wall forming a culdesac no room to move it had to be the second yes the second doorway from it a man could rush forward to his left or right or throwing a shoulder into an unsuspecting victim send his target over the railing plunging down the staircase bourne angled to his right shifting the gun to his left hand and reaching into his belt for the weapon with a silencer two feet from the recessed door he heaved the automatic in his left hand into the shadows as he pivoted against the wall was ist an arm appeared jason fired once blowing the hand apart ahh the figure lurched out in shock incapable of aiming his weapon bourne fired again hitting the man in the thigh he collapsed on the floor writhing cringing jason took a step forward and knelt his knee pressing into the mans chest his gun at the mans head he spoke in a whisper is there anyone else down there nein said the man wincing in pain zwei two of us only we were paid by whom you know a man named carlos i will not answer that kill me first how did you know i was here chernak hes dead now not yesterday word reached zurich you were alive we checked everyone everywhere chernak knew bourne gambled youre lying he pushed the gun into the mans throat i never told chernak about the steppdeckstrasse the man winced again his neck arched perhaps you did not have to the nazi pig had informers everywhere why should the steppdeckstrasse be any different he could describe you who else could a man at the drei alpenhäuser we never heard of any such man whos we the man swallowed his lips stretched in pain businessmen only businessmen and your service is killing youre a strange one to talk but nein you were to be taken not killed where we would be told by radio car frequency terrific said jason flatly youre not only secondrate youre accommodating wheres your car outside give me the keys the radio would identify it the man tried to resist he pushed bournes knee away and started to roll into the wall nein you havent got a choice jason brought the handle of the pistol down on the mans skull the swiss collapsed bourne found the keysthere were three in a leather casetook the mans gun and put it into his pocket it was a smaller weapon than the one he held in his hand and had no silencer lending a degree of credence to the claim that he was to be taken not killed the blond man upstairs had been acting as the point and therefore needed the protection of a silenced gunshot should wounding be required but an unmuffled report could lead to complications the swiss on the second floor was a backup his weapon to be used as a visible threat then why was he on the second floor why hadnt he followed his colleague on the staircase something was odd but there was no accounting for tactics nor the time to consider them there was a car outside on the street and he had the keys for it nothing could be disregarded the third gun he got up painfully and found the revolver he had taken from the frenchman in the elevator at the gemeinschaft bank he pulled up his left trouser leg and inserted the gun under the elasticized fabric of his sock it was secure he paused to get his breath and his balance then crossed to the staircase aware that the pain in his left shoulder was suddenly more acute the paralysis spreading more rapidly messages from brain to limb were less clear he hoped to god he could drive he reached the fifth step and abruptly stopped listening as he had listened barely a minute ago for sounds of concealment there was nothing the wounded man may have been tactically deficient but he had told the truth jason hurried down the staircase he would drive out of zurich somehowand find a doctorsomewhere he spotted the car easily it was different from the other shabby automobiles on the street an outsized wellkept sedan and he could see the bulge of an antenna base riveted into the trunk he walked to the drivers side and ran his hand around the panel and left front fender there was no alarm device he unlocked the door then opened it holding his breath in case he was wrong about the alarm he was not he climbed in behind the wheel adjusting his position until he was as comfortable as he could be grateful that the car had an automatic shift the large weapon in his belt inhibited him he placed it on the seat beside him then reached for the ignition assuming the key that had unlocked the door was the proper one it was not he tried the one next to it but it too would not fit for the trunk he assumed it was the third key or was it he kept stabbing at the opening the key would not enter he tried the second again it was blocked then the first none of the keys would fit into the ignition or were the messages from brain to limb to fingers too garbled his coordination too inadequate goddamn it try again a powerful light came from his left burning his eyes blinding him he grabbed for the gun but a second beam shot out from the right the door was yanked open and a heavy flashlight crashed down on his hand another hand taking the weapon from the seat get out the order came from his left the barrel of a gun pressed into his neck he climbed out a thousand coruscating circles of white in his eyes as vision slowly came back to him the first thing he saw was the outline of two circles gold circles the spectacles of the killer who had hunted him throughout the night the man spoke they say in the laws of physics that every action has an equal and opposite reaction the behavior of certain men under certain conditions is similarly predictable for a man like you one sets up a gauntlet each combatant told what to say if he falls if he does not fall you are taken if he does you are misled lulled into a false sense of progress its a high degree of risk said jason for those in the gauntlet theyre paid well and theres something elseno guarantee of course but its there the enigmatic bourne does not kill indiscriminately not out of compassion naturally but for a far more practical reason men remember when theyve been spared he infiltrates the armies of others refined guerrilla tactics applied to a sophisticated battleground i commend you youre a horses ass it was all jason could think to say but both your men are alive if thats what you want to know another figure came into view led from the shadows of the building by a short stocky man it was the woman it was marie st jacques thats him she said softly her look unwavering oh my god bourne shook his head in disbelief how was it done doctor he asked her raising his voice was someone watching my room at the carillon was the elevator timed the others shut down youre very convincing and i thought you were going to crash into a police car as it turned out she replied it wasnt necessary these are the police jason looked at the killer in front of him the man was adjusting his gold spectacles i commend you he said a minor talent answered the killer the conditions were right you provided them what happens now the man inside said i was to be taken not killed you forget he was told what to say the swiss paused so this is what you look like many of us have wondered during the past two or three years how much speculation theres been how many contradictions hes tall you know no hes of medium height hes blond no he has dark black hair very light blue eyes of course no quite clearly they are brown his features are sharp no theyre really quite ordinary cant pick him out in a crowd but nothing was ordinary it was all extraordinary your features have been softened the character submerged change your hair you change your face certain types of contact lenses are designed to alter the color of the eyes wear glasses youre a different man visas passports switched at will the design was there everything fit not all the answers but more of the truth than he wanted to hear id like to get this over with said marie st jacques stepping forward ill sign whatever i have to signat your office i imagine but then i really must get back to the hotel i dont have to tell you what ive been through tonight the swiss glanced at her through his goldrimmed glasses the stocky man who had led her out of the shadows took her arm she stared at both men then down at the hand that held her then at bourne her breathing stopped a terrible realization becoming clear her eyes grew wide let her go said jason shes on her way back to canada youll never see her again be practical bourne shes seen us we two are professionals there are rules the man flicked his gun up under jasons chin the barrel pressed once more into bournes throat he ran his left hand about his victims clothes felt the weapon in jasons pocket and took it out i thought as much he said and turned to the stocky man take her in the other car the limmat bourne froze marie st jacques was to be killed her body thrown into the limmat river wait a minute jason stepped forward the gun was jammed into his neck forcing him back into the hood of the car youre being stupid she works for the canadian government theyll be all over zurich why should that concern you you wont be here because its a waste cried bourne were professiona ls remember you bore me the killer turned to the stocky man geh schnell guisan quai scream your goddamn head off shouted jason start yelling dont stop she tried the scream cut short by a paralyzing blow to her throat she fell to the pavement as her wouldbe executioner dragged her toward a small nondescript black sedan that was stupid said the killer peering through his goldrimmed spectacles into bournes face you only hasten the inevitable on the other hand it will be simpler now i can free a man to tend to our wounded everythings so military isnt it it really is a battlefield he turned to the man with the flashlight signal johann to go inside well come back for them the flashlight was switched on and off twice a fourth man who had opened the door of the small sedan for the condemned woman nodded marie st jacques was thrown into the rear seat the door slammed shut the man named johann started for the concrete steps nodding now at the executioner jason felt sick as the engine of the small sedan was gunned and the car bolted away from the curb into the steppdeckstrasse the twisted chrome bumper disappearing into the shadows of the street inside that car was a woman he had never seen in his life before three hours ago and he had killed her you dont lack for soldiers he said if there were a hundred men i could trust id pay them willingly as they say your reputation precedes you suppose i paid you you were at the bank you know ive got funds probably millions but i wouldnt touch a franc note why are you afraid most assuredly wealth is relative to the amount of time one has to enjoy it i wouldnt have five minutes the killer turned to his subordinate put him inside strip him i want photographs taken of him nakedbefore and after he leaves us youll find a great deal of money on him i want him holding it ill drive he looked again at bourne carlos will get the first print and i have no doubt that ill be able to sell the others quite profitably on the open market magazines pay outrageous prices why should carlos believe you why should anyone believe you you said it no one knows what i look like ill be covered said the swiss sufficient unto the day two zurich bankers will step forward identifying you as one jason bourne the same jason bourne who met the excessively rigid standards set by swiss law for the release of a numbered account it will be enough he spoke to the gunman hurry i have cables to send debts to collect a powerful arm shot over bournes shoulder vicing his throat in a hammerlock the barrel of a gun was jolted into his spine pain spreading throughout his chest as he was dragged inside the sedan the man holding him was a professional even without his wounds it would have been impossible to break the grip the gunmans expertise however did not satisfy the bespectacled leader of the hunt he climbed behind the wheel and issued another command break his fingers he said the armlock briefly choked off jasons air as the barrel of the gun crashed down repeatedly on his handhands instinctively bourne had swung his left hand over his right protecting it as the blood burst from the back of his left he twisted his fingers letting it flow between them until both hands were covered he choked his screams the grip lessened he shouted my hands theyre broken gut but they were not broken the left was damaged to the point where it was useless not the right he moved his fingers in the shadows his hand was intact the car sped down the steppdeckstrasse and swung into a sidestreet heading south jason collapsed back in the seat gasping the gunman tore at his clothes ripping his shirt yanking at his belt in seconds his upper body would be naked passport papers cards money no longer his all the items intrinsic to his escape from zurich taken from him it was now or it was not to be he screamed my leg my goddamned leg he lurched forward his right hand working furiously in the dark fumbling under the cloth of his trouser leg he felt it the handle of the automatic nein roared the professional in the front watch him he knew it was instinctive knowledge it was also too late bourne held the gun in the darkness of the floor the powerful soldier pushed him back he fell with the blow the revolver now at his waist pointed directly at his attackers chest he fired twice the man arched backward jason fired again his aim sure the heart punctured the man fell over into the recessed jump seat put it down yelled bourne swinging the revolver over the rounded edge of the front seat pressing the barrel into the base of the drivers skull drop it his breathing erratic the killer let the gun fall we will talk he said gripping the wheel we are professionals we will talk the large automobile lurched forward gathering speed the driver increasing pressure on the accelerator slow down what is your answer the car went faster ahead were the headlights of traffic they were leaving the steppdeckstrasse district entering the busier city streets you want to get out of zurich i can get you out without me you cant all i have to do is spin the wheel crash into the pavement i have nothing whatsoever to lose herr bourne there are police everywhere up ahead i dont think you want the police well talk lied jason everything was timing splitsecond timing there were now two killers in a speeding enclosure that was in itself a trap neither killer was to be trusted both knew it one had to make use of that extra halfsecond the other would not take professionals put on the brakes said bourne drop your gun on the seat next to mine jason released the weapon it fell on top of the killers the ring of heavy metal proof of contact done the killer took his foot off the accelerator transferring it to the brake he applied the pressure slowly then in short stabs so that the large automobile pitched back and forth the jabs on the pedal would become more pronounced bourne understood this it was part of the drivers strategy balance a factor of life and death the arrow on the speedometer swung left kilometers kilometers kilometers they had nearly stopped it was the moment for the extra halfsecond of effortbalance a factor life in balance jason grabbed the man by the neck clawing at his throat yanking him up off the seat then he raised his bloody left hand and thrust it forward smearing the area of the killers eyes he released the throat surging his right hand down toward the guns on the seat bourne gripped a handle shoving the killers hand away the man screamed his vision blurred the gun out of reach jason lunged across the mans chest pushing him down against the door elbowing the killers throat with his left arm grabbing the wheel with his bloody palm he looked up through the windshield and turned the wheel to the right heading the car toward a pyramid of trash on the pavement the automobile plowed into the mound of debrisa huge somnambulant insect crawling into garbage its appearance belying the violence taking place inside its shell the man beneath him lunged up rolling on the seat bourne held the automatic in his hand his fingers jabbing for the open space of the trigger he found it he bent his wrist and fired his wouldbe executioner went limp a dark red hole in his forehead in the street men came running toward what must have looked like a dangerously careless accident jason shoved the dead body across the seat and climbed over behind the wheel he pushed the gearshift into reverse the sedan backed awkwardly out of the debris over the curb and into the street he rolled down his window calling out to the wouldbe rescuers as they approached sorry everythings fine just a little too much to drink the small band of concerned citizens broke up quickly a few making gestures of admonition others running back to their escorts and companions bourne breathed deeply trying to control the involuntary trembling that seized his entire body he pulled the gear into drive the car started forward he tried to picture the streets of zurich from a memory that would not serve him he knew vaguely where he waswhere he had beenand more important he knew more clearly where the guisan quai was in relationship to the limmat geh schnell guisan quai marie st jacques was to be killed on the guisan quai her body thrown into the river there was only one stretch where the guisan and the limmat met it was at the mouth of lake zurich at the base of the western shore somewhere in an empty parking lot or a deserted garden overlooking the water a short stocky man was about to carry out an execution ordered by a dead man perhaps by now the gun had been fired or a knife plunged into its mark there was no way to know but jason knew he had to find out whoever and whatever he was he could not walk away blindly the professional in him however demanded that he swerve into the dark wide alley ahead there were two dead men in the car they were a risk and a burden he could not tolerate the precious seconds it would take to remove them could avoid the danger of a traffic policeman looking through the windows and seeing death thirtytwo seconds was his guess it had taken less than a minute to pull his wouldbe executioners from the car he looked at them as he limped around the hood to the door they were curled up obscenely next to one another against a filthy brick wall in darkness he climbed behind the wheel and backed out of the alley geh schnell guisan quai he reached an intersection the traffic light red lights on the left several blocks east he could see lights arching gently into the night sky a bridge the limmat the signal turned green he swung the sedan to the left he was back on the bahnhofstrasse the start of the guisan quai was only minutes away the wide avenue curved around the waters edge riverbank and lakefront merging moments later on his left was the silhouetted outline of a park in summer a strollers haven now dark devoid of tourists and zurichers he passed an entrance for vehicles there was a heavy chain across the white pavement suspended between two stone posts he came to a second another chain prohibiting access but it was not the same something was different something odd he stopped the car and looked closer reaching across the seat for the flashlight he had taken from his wouldbe executioner he snapped it on and shot the beam over the heavy chain what was it what was different it was not the chain it was beneath the chain on the white pavement kept spotless by maintenance crews there were tire marks at odds with the surrounding cleanliness they would not be noticed during the summer months they were now it was as if the filth of the steppdeckstrasse had traveled too well bourne switched off the flashlight and dropped it on the seat the pain in his battered left hand suddenly fused with the agony in his shoulder and his arm he had to push all pain out of his mind he had to curtail the bleeding as best he could his shirt had been ripped he reached inside and ripped it further pulling out a strip of cloth which he proceeded to wrap around his left hand knotting it with teeth and fingers he was as ready as he would ever be he picked up the gunhis wouldbe executioners gunand checked the clip full he waited until two cars had passed him then extinguished the headlights and made a uturn parking next to the chain he got out instinctively testing his leg on the pavement then favoring it as he limped to the nearest post and lifted the hook off the iron circle protruding from the stone he lowered the chain making as little noise as possible and returned to the car he pulled at the gearshift gently pressed the accelerator then released it he was now coasting into the wide expanse of an unlit parking area made darker by the abrupt end of the white entrance road and the start of a field of black asphalt beyond twohundredodd yards in the distance was the straight dark line of the seawall a wall that contained no sea but instead the currents of the limmat as they poured into the waters of lake zurich farther away were the lights of the boats bobbing in stately splendor beyond these were the stationary lights of the old city the blurred floodlights of darkened piers jasons eyes took everything in for the distance was his backdrop he was looking for shapes in front of it to the right the right a dark outline darker than the wall an intrusion of black on lesser black obscure faint barely discernible but there a hundred yards away now ninety eightyfive he cut off the engine and brought the car to a stop he sat motionless by the open window staring into the darkness trying to see more clearly he heard the wind coming off the water it covered any sound the car had made sound a cry low throated delivered in fear a harsh slap followed then another and another a scream was formed then swallowed broken echoing off into silence bourne got out of the car silently the gun in his right hand the flashlight awkward in the bloody fingers of his left he walked toward the obscure black shape each step each limp a study in silence what he saw first was what he had seen last when the small sedan had disappeared in the shadows of the steppdeckstrasse the shining metal of the twisted chrome bumper it glistened now in the night light four slaps in rapid succession flesh against flesh blows maniacally administered received with muted screams of terror cries terminated gasps permitted thrashing movement part of it all inside the car jason crouched as best he could sidestepping around the trunk toward the right rear window he rose slowly then suddenly using sound as a weapon of shock shouted as he switched on the powerful flashlight you move youre dead what he saw inside filled him with revulsion and fury marie st jacques clothes were torn away shredded into strips hands were poised like claws on her halfnaked body kneading her breasts separating her legs the executioners organ protruded from the cloth of his trousers he was inflicting the final indignity before he carried out the sentence of death get out you son of a bitch there was a massive shattering of glass the man raping marie st jacques saw the obvious bourne could not fire the gun for fear of killing the woman he had spun off her crashing the heel of his shoe into the window of the small car glass flew out sharp fragments blanketing jasons face he closed his eyes limping backward to avoid the spray the door swung open a blinding spit of light accompanied the explosion hot searing pain spread through bournes right side the fabric of his coat was blown away blood matting what remained of his shirt he squeezed the trigger only vaguely able to see the figure rolling on the ground he fired again the bullet detonating the surface of the asphalt the executioner had rolled and lurched out of sight into the darker blackness unseen jason knew he could not stay where he was to do so was his own execution he raced dragging his leg to the cover of the open door stay inside he yelled to marie st jacques the woman had started to move in panic goddamn it stay in there a gunshot the bullet imbedded in the metal of the door a running figure was silhouetted above the wall bourne fired twice grateful for an expulsion of breath in the distance he had wounded the man he had not killed him but the executioner would function less well than he had sixty seconds ago lights dim lights squared frames what was it what were they he looked to the left and saw what he could not possibly have seen before a small brick structure some kind of dwelling by the seawall lights had been turned on inside a watchmans station someone inside had heard the gunshots was ist los wer ist da the shouts came from the figure of a mana bentover old man standing in a lighted doorway then the beam of a flashlight pierced the blacker darkness bourne followed it with his eyes hoping it would shine on the executioner it did he was crouched by the wall jason stood up and fired at the sound of his gun the beam swung over to him he was the target two shots came from the darkness a bullet ricocheting off a metal strip in the window steel punctured his neck blood erupted racing footsteps the executioner was running toward the source of the light nein he had reached it the figure in the doorway was lashed by an arm that was both his leash and his cage the beam went out in the light of the windows jason could see the killer pulling the watchman away using the old man as a shield dragging him back into darkness bourne watched until he could see no more his gun raised helplessly over the hood as he was helpless his body draining there was a final shot followed by a guttural cry and once again racing footsteps the executioner had carried out a sentence of death not with the condemned woman but with an old man he was running he had made his escape bourne could run no longer the pain had finally immobilized him his vision too blurred his sense of survival exhausted he lowered himself to the pavement there was nothing he simply did not care whatever he was let it be let it be the st jacques woman crawled out of the car holding her clothes every move made in shock she stared at jason disbelief horror and confusion coming together in her eyes go on he whispered hoping she could hear him theres a car back there the keys are in it get out of here he may bring others i dont know you came for me she said her voice echoing through a tunnel of bewilderment get out get in that car and go like hell doctor if anyone tries to stop you run him down reach the police real ones with uniforms you damn fool his throat was so hot his stomach so cold fire and ice hed felt them before together where was it you saved my life she continued in that hollow tone the words floating in the air you came for me you came back for me and saved my life dont make it what it wasnt you are incidental doctor you are a reflex an instinct born of forgotten memories conduits electrically prodded by stress you see i know the words i dont care anymore i hurtoh my god i hurt you were free you could have kept going but you didnt you came back for me he heard her through mists of pain he saw her and what he saw was unreasonableas unreasonable as the pain she was kneeling beside him touching his face touching his head stop it do not touch my head leave me why did you do that it was her voice not his she was asking him a question didnt she understand he could not answer her what was she doing she had torn a piece of cloth and was wrapping it around his neck and now another this larger part of her dress she had loosened his belt and was pushing the soft smooth cloth down into the boiling hot skin on his right hip it wasnt you he found words and used them quickly he wanted the peace of darknessas he had wanted it before but could not remember when he could find it if she left him that man hed seen me he could identify me it was him i wanted him now get out so could half a dozen others she replied another note in her voice i dont believe you believe me she was standing above him now then she was not there she was gone she had left him the peace would come quickly now he would be swallowed up in the dark crashing waters and the pain would be washed away he leaned back against the car and let himself drift with the currents of his mind a noise intruded a motor rolling and disruptive he did not care for it it interfered with the freedom of his own particular sea then a hand was on his arm then another gently pulling him up come on said the voice help me let go of me the command was shouted he had shouted it but the command was not obeyed he was appalled commands should be obeyed yet not always something told him that the wind was there again but not a wind in zurich in some other place high in the night sky and a signal came a light flashed on and he leaped up whipped by furious new currents all right youre all right said the maddening voice that would not pay attention to his commands lift your foot up lift it thats right you did it now inside the car ease yourself back slowly thats right he was falling falling in the pitch black sky and then the falling stopped everything stopped and there was stillness he could hear his own breathing and footsteps he could hear footsteps and the sound of a door closing followed by the rolling disruptive noise beneath him in front of him somewhere motion swaying in circles balance was gone and he was falling again only to be stopped again another body against his body a hand holding him lowering him his face felt cool and then he felt nothing he was drifting again currents gentler now darkness complete there were voices above him in the distance but not so far away shapes came slowly into focus lit by the spill of table lamps he was in a fairly large room and on a bed a narrow bed blankets covering him across the room were two people a man in an overcoat and a woman dressed in a dark red skirt beneath a white blouse dark red as the hair was the st jacques woman it was she standing by a door talking to a man holding a leather bag in his left hand they were speaking french rest mainly the man was saying if youre not accessible to me anyone can remove the sutures they can be taken out in a week id guess thank you doctor thank you youve been most generous ill go now perhaps ill hear from you perhaps not the doctor opened the door and let himself out when he was gone the woman reached down and slid the bolt in place she turned and saw bourne looking at her she walked slowly cautiously toward the bed can you hear me she asked he nodded youre hurt she said quite badly but if you stay quiet it wont be necessary for you to get to a hospital that was a doctor obviously i paid him out of the money i found on you quite a bit more than might seem usual but i was told he could be trusted it was your idea incidentally while we were driving you kept saying you had to find a doctor one you could pay to keep quiet you were right it wasnt difficult where are we he could hear his voice it was weak but he could hear it a village called lenzburg about twenty miles outside of zurich the doctors from wohlen its a nearby town hell see you in a week if youre here how he tried to raise himself but the strength wasnt there she touched his shoulder it was an order to lie back down ill tell you what happened and perhaps that will answer your questions at least i hope so because if it doesnt im not sure i can she stood motionless looking down at him her tone controlled an animal was raping meafter which he had orders to kill me there was no way i was going to live in the steppdeckstrasse you tried to stop them and when you couldnt you told me to scream to keep screaming it was all you could do and by shouting to me you risked being killed at that moment yourself later you somehow got freei dont know how but i know you were hurt very badly doing soand you came back to find me him interrupted jason i wanted him you told me that and ill say what i said before i dont believe you not because youre a poor liar but because it doesnt conform with the facts i work with statistics mr washburn or mr bourne or whatever your name is i respect observable data and i can spot inaccuracies im trained to do that two men went in that building to find you and i heard you say they were both alive they could identify you and theres the owner of the drei alpenhäuser he could too those are the facts and you know them as well as i do no you came back to find me you came back and saved my life go on he said his voice gaining strength what happened i made a decision it was the most difficult decision ive ever made in my life i think a person can only make a decision like that if hes nearly lost his life by an act of violence his life saved by someone else i decided to help you only for a whilefor just a few hours perhapsbut i would help you get away why didnt you go to the police i almost did and im not sure i can tell you why i didnt maybe it was the rape i dont know im being honest with you ive always been told its the most horrible experience a woman can go through i believe it now and i heard the angerthe disgustin your own voice when you shouted at him ill never forget that moment as long as i live as much as i may want to the police he repeated that man at the drei alpenhäuser said the police were looking for you that a telephone number had been set up in zurich she paused i couldnt give you to the police not then not after what you did knowing what i am he asked i know only what ive heard and what ive heard doesnt correspond with the injured man who came back for me and offered his life for mine thats not very bright thats the one thing i am mr bournei assume its bourne its what he called you very bright i hit you i threatened to kill you if id been you and men were trying to kill me i probably would have done the sameif i were capable so you drove out of zurich not at first not for a half hour or so i had to calm down reach my decision im methodical im beginning to see that i was a wreck a mess i needed clothes hairbrush makeup i couldnt walk anywhere i found a telephone booth down by the river and there was no one around so i got out of the car and called a colleague at the hotel the frenchman the belgian interrupted jason no theyd been at the bertinelli lecture and if they had recognized me up on the stage with you i assumed theyd given my name to the police instead i called a woman whos a member of our delegation she loathes bertinelli and was in her room weve worked together for several years and were friends i told her that if she heard anything about me to disregard it i was perfectly all right as a matter of fact if anyone asked about me she was to say i was with a friend for the eveningfor the night if pressed that id left the bertinelli lecture early methodical said bourne yes marie allowed herself a tentative smile i asked her to go to my roomwere only two doors away from each other and the night maid knows were friends if no one was there she was to put some clothes and makeup in my suitcase and come back to her room id call her in five minutes she just accepted what you said i told you were friends she knew i was all right excited perhaps but all right and that i wanted her to do as i asked marie paused again she probably thought i was telling her the truth go ahead i called her back and she had my things which means the two other delegates didnt give your name to the police your room would have been watched sealed off i dont know whether they did or not but if they did my friend was probably questioned quite a while ago shed simply say what i told her to say she was at the carillon you were down at the river how did you get your things it was quite simple a little tacky but simple she spoke to the night maid telling her i was avoiding one man at the hotel seeing another outside i needed my overnight case and could she suggest a way to get it to me to an automobile down at the river an offduty waiter brought it to me wasnt he surprised at the way you looked he didnt have much of a chance to see anything i opened the trunk stayed in the car and told him to put it in the back i left a tenfranc note on the spare tire youre not methodical youre remarkable methodical will do how did you find the doctor right here the concierge or whatever hes called in switzerland remember id wrapped you up as best i could reduced the bleeding as much as possible like most people i have a working knowledge of first aid that meant i had to remove some of your clothing i found the money and then i understood what you meant by finding a doctor you could pay you have thousands and thousands of dollars on you i know the rates of exchange thats only the beginning what never mind he tried to rise again it was too difficult arent you afraid of me afraid of what youve done of course i am but i know what you did for me youre more trusting than id be under the circumstances then perhaps youre not that aware of the circumstances youre still very weak and i have the gun besides you dont have any clothes none not even a pair of shorts ive thrown everything away youd look a little foolish running down the street in a plastic money belt bourne laughed through his pain remembering la ciotat and the marquis de chamford methodical he said very what happens now ive written out the name of the doctor and paid a weeks rent for the room the concierge will bring you meals starting at noon today ill stay here until midmorning its nearly six oclock it should be light soon then ill return to the hotel for the rest of my things and my airline tickets and do my best to avoid any mention of you suppose you cant suppose you were identified ill deny it it was dark the whole place was in panic now youre not being methodical at least not as methodical as the zurich police would be ive got a better way call your friend and tell her to pack the rest of your clothes and settle your bill take as much money as you want from me and grab the first plane to canada its easier to deny longdistance she looked at him in silence then nodded thats very tempting its very logical she continued to stare at him a moment longer the tension inside her building conveyed by her eyes she turned away and walked to the window looking out at the earliest rays of the morning sun he watched her feeling the intensity knowing its roots seeing her face in the pale orange glow of dawn there was nothing he could do she had done what she felt she had to do because she had been released from terror from a kind of terrible degradation no man could really understand from death and in doing what she did she had broken all the rules she whipped her head toward him her eyes glaring who are you you heard what they said i know what i saw what i feel dont try to justify what you did you simply did it thats all let it be let it be oh god you could have let me be and there would have been peace but now you have given part of my life back to me and ive got to struggle again face it again suddenly she was standing at the foot of the bed the gun in her hand she pointed it at him and her voice trembled should i undo it then should i call the police and tell them to come and take you a few hours ago i would have said go ahead i cant bring myself to say it now then who are you they say my name is bourne jason charles bourne what does that mean they say he stared at the gun at the dark circle of its barrel there was nothing left but the truthas he knew the truth what does it mean he repeated you know almost as much as i do doctor what you might as well hear it maybe itll make you feel better or worse i dont know but you may as well because i dont know what else to tell you she lowered the gun tell me what my life began five months ago on a small island in the mediterranean called ile de port noir the sun had risen to the midpoint of the surrounding trees its rays filtered by windblown branches streaming through the windows and mottling the walls with irregular shapes of light bourne lay back on the pillow exhausted he had finished there was nothing more to say marie sat across the room in a leather armchair her legs curled up under her cigarettes and the gun on a table to her left she had barely moved her gaze fixed on his face even when she smoked her eyes never wavered never left his she was a technical analyst evaluating data filtering facts as the trees filtered the sunlight you kept saying it she said softly spacing out her next words i dont know i wish i knew youd stare at something and i was frightened id ask you what was it what were you going to do and youd say it again i wish i knew my god what youve been through what youre going through after what ive done to you you can even think about whats happened to me theyre two separate lines of occurrence she said absently frowning in thought separate related in origin developed independently thats economics nonsense and then on the löwenstrasse just before we went up to chernaks flat i begged you not to make me go with you i was convinced that if i heard any more youd kill me thats when you said the strangest thing of all you said what you heard makes no more sense to me than it does to you perhaps less i thought you were insane what ive got is a form of insanity a sane person remembers i dont why didnt you tell me chernak tried to kill you there wasnt time and i didnt think it mattered it didnt at that momentto you it did to me why because i was holding on to an outside hope that you wouldnt fire your gun at someone who hadnt tried to kill you first but he did i was wounded i didnt know the sequence you didnt tell me i dont understand marie lit a cigarette its hard to explain but during all the time you kept me hostage even when you hit me and dragged me and pressed the gun into my stomach and held it against my head god knows i was terrifiedbut i thought i saw something in your eyes call it reluctance its the best i can come up with itll do whats your point im not sure perhaps it goes back to something else you said in the booth at the drei alpenhäuser that fat man was coming over and you told me to stay against the wall cover my face with my hand for your own good you said theres no point in his being able to identify you there wasnt for your own good thats not the reasoning of a pathological killer i think i held on to thatfor my own sanity maybethat and the look in your eyes i still dont get the point the man with the goldrimmed glasses who convinced me he was the police said you were a brutal killer who had to be stopped before he killed again had it not been for chernak i wouldnt have believed him on either point the police dont behave like that they dont use guns in dark crowded places and you were a man running for your lifeare running for your lifebut youre not a killer bourne held up his hand forgive me but that strikes me as a judgment based on false gratitude you say you have a respect for factsthen look at them i repeat you heard what they said regardless of what you think you saw and feelyou heard the words boiled down envelopes were filled with money and delivered to me to fulfill certain obligations id say those obligations were pretty clear and i accepted them i had a numbered account at the gemeinschaft bank totaling about five million dollars where did i get it where does a man like mewith the obvious skills i haveget that kind of money jason stared at the ceiling the pain was returning the sense of futility also those are the facts dr st jacques its time you left marie rose from the chair and crushed out her cigarette then she picked up the gun and walked toward the bed youre very anxious to condemn yourself arent you i respect facts then if what you say is true i have an obligation too dont i as a lawabiding member of the social order i must call the zurich police and tell them where you are she raised the gun bourne looked at her i thought why not she broke in youre a condemned man who wants to get it over with arent you you lie there talking with such finalitywith if youll forgive me not a little selfpity expecting to appeal to my what was it false gratitude well i think youd better understand something im not a fool if i thought for a minute youre what they say you are i wouldnt be here and neither would you facts that cannot be documented arent facts at all you dont have facts you have conclusions your own conclusions based on statements made by men you know are garbage and an unexplained bank account with five million dollars in it dont forget that how could i im supposed to be a financial whiz that account may not be explained in ways that youd like but theres a proviso attached that lends a considerable degree of legitimacy to it it can be inspectedprobably invadedby any certified director of a corporation called somethingorother seventyone thats hardly an affiliation for a hired killer the corporation may be named it isnt listed in a telephone book you are naive but lets get back to you right now shall i really call the police you know my answer i cant stop you but i dont want you to marie lowered the gun and i wont for the same reason you dont want me to i dont believe what they say you are any more than you do then what do you believe i told you im not sure all i really know is that seven hours ago i was underneath an animal his mouth all over me his hands clawing me and i knew i was going to die and then a man came back for mea man who could have kept runningbut who came back for me and offered to die in my place i guess i believe in him suppose youre wrong then ill have made a terrible mistake thank you wheres the money on the bureau in your passport case and billfold also the name of the doctor and the receipt for the room may i have the passport please thats the swiss currency i know marie brought them to him i gave the concierge three hundred francs for the room and two hundred for the name of the doctor the doctors services came to four hundred and fifty to which i added another hundred and fifty for his cooperation altogether i paid out eleven hundred francs you dont have to give me an accounting he said you should know what are you going to do give you money so you can get back to canada i mean afterwards see how i feel later on probably pay the concierge to buy me some clothes ask him a few questions ill be all right he took out a number of large bills and held them out for her thats over fifty thousand francs ive put you through a great deal marie st jacques looked at the money then down at the gun in her left hand i dont want your money she said placing the weapon on the bedside table what do you mean she turned and walked back to the armchair turning again to look at him as she sat down i think i want to help you now wait a minute please she interrupted please dont ask me any questions dont say anything for a while book ii neither of them knew when it happened or in truth whether it had happened or if it had to what lengths either would go to preserve it or deepen it there was no essential drama no conflicts to overcome or barriers to surmount all that was required was communication by words and looks and perhaps as vital as either of these the frequent accompaniment of quiet laughter their living arrangements in the room at the village inn were as clinical as they might have been in the hospital ward it replaced during the daylight hours marie took care of various practical matters such as clothes meals maps and newspapers on her own she had driven the stolen car ten miles south to the town of reinach where she had abandoned it taking a taxi back to lenzburg when she was out bourne concentrated on rest and mobility from somewhere in his forgotten past he understood that recovery depended upon both and he applied rigid discipline to both he had been there before before port noir when they were together they talked at first awkwardly the thrusts and parries of strangers thrown together and surviving the shock waves of cataclysm they tried to insert normalcy where none could exist but it was easier when they both accepted the essential abnormality there was nothing to say not related to what had happened and if there was it would begin to appear only during those moments when the probing of whathadhappened was temporarily exhausted the silences springboards to relief to other words and thoughts it was during such moments that jason learned the salient facts about the woman who had saved his life he protested that she knew as much about him as he did but he knew nothing about her where had she sprung from why was an attractive woman with dark red hair and skin obviously nurtured on a farm somewhere pretending to be a doctor of economics because she was sick of the farm marie replied no kidding a farm really well a small ranch would be more like it small in comparison to the kingsized ones in alberta in my fathers time when a canuck went west to buy land there were unwritten restrictions dont compete in size with your betters he often said that if hed used the name st james rather than st jacques hed be a far wealthier man today he was a rancher marie had laughed no he was an accountant who became a rancher by way of a vickers bomber in the war he was a pilot in the royal canadian air force i guess once he saw all that sky an accounting office seemed a little dull that takes a lot of nerve more than you know he sold cattle he didnt own on land he didnt have before he bought the ranch french to the core people said i think id like him you would she had lived in calgary with her parents and two brothers until she was eighteen when she went to mcgill university in montreal and the beginnings of a life she had never contemplated an indifferent student who preferred racing over the fields on the back of a horse to the structured boredom of a convent school in alberta discovered the excitement of using her mind it was really as simple as that she told him id looked at books as natural enemies and suddenly here i was in a place surrounded by people who were caught up in them having a marvelous time everything was talk talk all day talk all nightin classrooms and seminars in crowded booths over pitchers of beer i think it was the talk that turned me on does that make sense to you i cant remember but i can understand bourne said i have no memories of college or friends like that but im pretty sure i was there he smiled talking over pitchers of beer is a pretty strong impression she smiled back and i was pretty impressive in that department a strapping girl from calgary with two older brothers to compete with could drink more beer than half the university boys in montreal you must have been resented no just envied a new world had been presented to marie st jacques she never returned to her old one except for proscribed midterm holidays prolonged trips to calgary grew less and less frequent her circles in montreal expanded the summers taken up with jobs in and outside the university she gravitated first to history then reasoned that most of history was shaped by economic forcespower and significance had to be paid forand so she tested the theories of economics and was consumed she remained at mcgill for five years receiving her masters degree and a canadian government fellowship to oxford that was a day i can tell you i thought my father would have apoplexy he left his precious cattle to my brothers long enough to fly east to talk me out of it talk you out of it why he was an accountant you were going after a doctorate in economics dont make that mistake marie exclaimed accountants and economists are natural enemies one views trees the other forests and the visions are usually at odds as they should be besides my fathers not simply canadian hes frenchcanadian i think he saw me as a traitor to versailles but he was mollified when i told him that a condition of the fellowship was a commitment to work for the government for a minimum of three years he said i could serve the cause better from within vive québec librevive la france they both laughed the threeyear commitment to ottawa was extended for all the logical reasons whenever she thought of leaving she was promoted a grade given a large office and an expanded staff power corrupts of courseshe smiledand no one knows it better than a ranking bureaucrat whom banks and corporations pursue for a recommendation but i think napoleon said it better give me enough medals and ill win you any war so i stayed i enjoy my work immensely but then its work im good at and that helps jason watched her as she talked beneath the controlled exterior there was an exuberant childlike quality about her she was an enthusiast reining in her enthusiasm whenever she felt it becoming too pronounced of course she was good at what she did he suspected she never did anything with less than her fullest application im sure you aregood i meanbut it doesnt leave much time for other things does it what other things oh the usual husband family house with the picket fence they may come one day i dont rule them out but they havent no there were a couple of close calls but no brass ring or diamond either whos peter the smile faded id forgotten you read the cable im sorry dont be weve covered that peter i adore peter we lived together for nearly two years but it didnt work out apparently he doesnt hold any grudges hed better not she laughed again hes director of the section hopes for a cabinet appointment soon if he doesnt behave himself ill tell the treasury board what he doesnt know and hell be back as an sxtwo he said he was going to pick you up at the airport on the twentysixth youd better cable him yes i know her leaving was what they had not talked about they had avoided the subject as though it were a distant eventuality it was not related to whathadhappened it was something that was going to be marie had said she wanted to help him he had accepted assuming she was driven by false gratitude into staying with him for a day or soand he was grateful for that but anything else was unthinkable which was why they did not talk about it words and looks had passed between them quiet laughter evoked comfort established at odd moments there were tentative rushes of warmth and they both understood and backed away anything else was unthinkable so they kept returning to the abnormality to whathadhappened to him more than to them for he was the irrational reason for their being together together in a room at a small village inn in switzerland abnormality it was not part of the reasonable ordered world of marie st jacques and because it was not her orderly analytical mind was provoked unreasonable things were to be examined unraveled explained she became relentless in her probing as insistent as geoffrey washburn had been on the ile de port noir but without the doctors patience for she did not have the time she knew it and it drove her to the edges of stridency when you read the newspapers what strikes you the mess seems its universal be serious whats familiar to you most everything but i cant tell you why give me an example this morning there was a story about an american arms shipment to greece and the subsequent debate in the united nations the soviets protested i understand the significance the mediterranean power struggle the mid east spillover give me another there was an article about east german interference with the bonn governments liaison office in warsaw eastern bloc western bloc again i understood you see the relationship dont you youre politicallygeopoliticallyreceptive or i have a perfectly normal working knowledge of current events i dont think i was ever a diplomat the money at the gemeinschaft would rule out any kind of government employment i agree still youre politically aware what about maps you asked me to buy you maps what comes to mind when you look at them in some cases names trigger images just as they did in zurich buildings hotels streets sometimes faces but never names the faces dont have any still youve traveled a great deal i guess i have you know you have all right ive traveled how did you travel what do you mean how was it usually by plane or by carnot taxis but driving yourself both i think why planes would mean greater distances more frequently did people meet you are there faces at airports hotels streets he replied involuntarily streets why streets i dont know faces met me in the streets and in quiet places dark places restaurants cafés yes and rooms hotel rooms yes not offices business offices sometimes not usually all right people met you faces men women both men mostly some women but mostly men what did they talk about i dont know try to remember i cant there arent any voices there arent any words were there schedules you met with people that means you had appointments they expected to meet with you and you expected to meet with them who scheduled those appointments someone had to cables telephone calls from whom from where i dont know they would reach me at hotels mostly i imagine you told me the assistant manager at the carillon said you did receive messages then they came to hotels somethingorother seventyone treadstone treadstone thats your company isnt it it doesnt mean anything i couldnt find it concentrate i am it wasnt listed i called new york you seem to think thats so unusual its not why not it could be a separate inhouse division or a blind subsidiarya corporation set up to make purchases for a parent company whose name would push up a negotiating price its done every day whom are you trying to convince you its entirely possible that youre a roving negotiator for american financial interests everything points to it funds set up for immediate capital confidentiality open for corporate approval which was never exercised these facts plus your own antenna for political shifts point to a trusted purchasing agent and quite probably a large shareholder or part owner of the parent company you talk awfully fast ive said nothing that isnt logical theres a hole or two where that account didnt show any withdrawals only deposits i wasnt buying i was selling you dont know that you cant remember payments can be made with shortfall deposits i dont even know what that means a treasurer aware of certain tax strategies would whats the other hole men dont try to kill someone for buying something at a lower price they may expose him they dont kill him they do if a gargantuan error has been made or if that person has been mistaken for someone else what im trying to tell you is that you cant be what youre not no matter what anyone says youre that convinced im that convinced ive spent three days with you weve talked ive listened a terrible error has been made or its some kind of conspiracy involving what against what thats what you have to find out thanks tell me something what comes to mind when you think of money stop it dont do this cant you understand youre wrong when i think of money i think of killing i dont know he said im tired i want to sleep send your cable in the morning tell peter youre flying back it was well past midnight the beginning of the fourth day and still sleep would not come bourne stared at the ceiling at the dark wood that reflected the light of the table lamp across the room the light remained on during the nights marie simply left it on no explanation sought none offered in the morning she would be gone and his own plans had to crystallize he would stay at the inn for a few more days call the doctor in wohlen and arrange to have the stitches removed after that paris the money was in paris and so was something else he knew it he felt it a final answer it was in paris you are not helpless you will find your way what would he find a man named carlos who was carlos and what was he to jason bourne he heard the rustle of cloth from the couch against the wall he glanced over startled to see that marie was not asleep instead she was looking at him staring at him really youre wrong you know she said about what what youre thinking you dont know what im thinking yes i do ive seen that look in your eyes seeing things youre not sure are there afraid that they may be they have been he replied explain the steppdeckstrasse explain a fat man at the drei alpenhäuser i cant but neither can you they were there i saw them and they were there find out why you cant be what youre not jason find out paris he said yes paris marie got up from the couch she was in a soft yellow nightgown nearly white pearl buttons at the neck it flowed as she walked toward the bed in her bare feet she stood beside him looking down then raised both her hands and began unbuttoning the top of the gown she let it fall away as she sat on the bed her breasts above him she leaned toward him reaching for his face cupping it holding him gently her eyes as so often during the past few days unwavering fixed on his thank you for my life she whispered thank you for mine he answered feeling the longing he knew she felt wondering if an ache accompanied hers as it did his he had no memory of a woman and perhaps because he had none she was everything he could imagine everything and much much more she repelled the darkness for him she stopped the pain he had been afraid to tell her and she was telling him now it was all right if only for a while for an hour or so for the remainder of that night she was giving him a memory because she too longed for release from the coiled springs of violence tension was suspended comfort theirs for an hour or so it was all he asked for but god in heaven how he needed her he reached for her breast and pulled her lips to his lips her moisture arousing him sweeping away the doubts she lifted the covers and came to him she lay in his arms her head on his chest careful to avoid the wound in his shoulder she slid back gently raising herself on her elbows he looked at her their eyes locked and both smiled she lifted her left hand pressing her index finger over his lips and spoke softly i have something to say and i dont want you to interrupt im not sending the cable to peter not yet now just a minute he took her hand from his face please dont interrupt me i said not yet that doesnt mean i wont send it but not for a while im staying with you im going to paris with you he forced the words suppose i dont want you to she leaned forward brushing her lips against his cheek that wont wash the computer just rejected it i wouldnt be so certain if i were you but youre not me im me and i know the way you held me and tried to say so many things you couldnt say things i think we both wanted to say to each other for the past several days i cant explain whats happened oh i suppose its there in some obscure psychological theory somewhere two reasonably intelligent people thrown into hell together and crawling out together and maybe thats all it is but its there right now and i cant run away from it i cant run away from you because you need me and you gave me my life what makes you think i need you i can do things for you that you cant do for yourself its all ive thought about for the past two hours she raised herself further naked beside him youre somehow involved with a great deal of money but i dont think you know a debit from an asset you may have before but you dont now i do and theres something else i have a ranking position with the canadian government i have clearance and access to all manner of inquiries and protection international finance is rotten and canada has been raped weve mounted our own protection and im part of it its why i was in zurich to observe and report alliances not to discuss abstract theories and the fact that you have this clearance this access can help me i think it can and embassy protection that may be the most important but i give you my word that at the first sign of violence ill send the cable and get out my own fears aside i wont be a burden to you under those conditions at the first sign repeated bourne studying her and i determine when and where that is if you like my experience is limited i wont argue he continued to hold her eyes the moment long magnified by silence finally he asked why are you doing this you just said it were two reasonably intelligent people who crawled out of some kind of hell that may be all we are is it worth it she sat motionless i also said something else maybe youve forgotten four nights ago a man who could have kept running came back for me and offered to die in my place i believe in that man more than he does i think thats really what i have to offer i accept he said reaching for her i shouldnt but i do i need that belief very badly you may interrupt now she whispered lowering the sheet her body coming to his make love to me i have needs too three more days and nights went by filled by the warmth of their comfort the excitement of discovery they lived with the intensity of two people aware that change would come and when it came it would come quickly so there were things to talk about which could not be avoided any longer cigarette smoke spiraled above the table joining the steam from the hot bitter coffee the concierge an ebullient swiss whose eyes took in more than his lips would reveal had left several minutes before having delivered the petit déjeuner and the zurich newspapers in both english and french jason and marie sat across from each other both had scanned the news anything in yours asked bourne that old man the watchman at the guisan quai was buried the day before yesterday the police still have nothing concrete investigation in progress it says its a little more extensive here said jason shifting his paper awkwardly in his bandaged left hand how is it asked marie looking at the hand better ive got more play in the fingers now i know youve got a dirty mind he folded the paper here it is they repeat the things they said the other day the shells and blood scrapings are being analyzed bourne looked up but theyve added something remnants of clothing it wasnt mentioned before is that a problem not for me my clothes were bought off a rack in marseilles what about your dress was it a special design or fabric you embarrass me it wasnt all my clothes are made by a woman in ottawa it couldnt be traced then i dont see how the silk came from a bolt an fsthree in our section brought back from hong kong did you buy anything at the shops in the hotel something you might have had on you a kerchief a pin anything like that no im not much of a shopper that way good and your friend wasnt asked any questions when she checked out not by the desk i told you that only by the two men you saw me with in the elevator from the french and belgian delegations yes everything was fine lets go over it again theres nothing to go over paulthe one from brusselsdidnt see anything he was knocked off his chair to the floor and stayed there claudehe tried to stop us rememberat first thought it was me on the stage in the light but before he could get to the police he was hurt in the crowd and taken to the infirmary and by the time he might have said something interrupted jason recalling her words he wasnt sure yes but i have an idea he knew my main purpose for being at the conference my presentation didnt fool him if he did it would reinforce his decision to stay out of it bourne picked up his coffee let me have that again he said you were looking for alliances well hints of them really no ones going to come out and say there are financial interests in his country working with interests in that country so they can buy their way into canadian raw materials or any other market but you see who meets for drinks who has dinner together or sometimes its as dumb as a delegate from say romewhom you know is being paid by agnelli coming up and asking you how serious ottawa is about the declaration laws im still not sure i understand you should your own countrys very touchy about the subject who owns what how many american banks are controlled by opec money how much industry is owned by european and japanese consortiums how many hundreds of thousands of acres have been acquired by capital thats fled england and italy and france we all worry we do marie laughed of course nothing makes a man more nationalistic than to think his countrys owned by foreigners he can adjust in time to losing a warthat only means the enemy was strongerbut to lose his economy means the enemy was smarter the period of occupation lasts longer and so do the scars youve given these things a lot of thought havent you for a brief moment the look in maries eyes lost its edge of humor she answered him seriously yes i have i think theyre important did you learn anything in zurich nothing startling she said moneys flying all over syndicates are trying to find internal investments where bureaucratic machineries look the other way that cablegram from peter said your daily reports were first rate what did he mean i found a number of odd economic bedfellows who i think may be using canadian figureheads to buy up canadian properties im not being elusive its just that they wouldnt mean anything to you im not trying to pry countered jason but i think you put me in one of those beds not with respect to canada but in general i dont rule you out the structures there you could be part of a financial combine thats looking for all manner of illegal purchases its one thing i can put a quiet trace on but i want to do it over a telephone not words written out in a cable now i am prying what do you mean and how if theres a treadstone seventyone behind a multinational corporate door somewhere there are ways to find which company which door i want to call peter from one of those public telephone stations in paris ill tell him that i ran across the name treadstone seventyone in zurich and its been bothering me ill ask him to make a csa covert searchand say that ill call him back and if he finds it if its there hell find it then i get in touch with whoevers listed as the certified directors and surface very cautiously added marie through intermediaries myself if you like why because of what theyve done or not done really which is they havent tried to reach you in nearly six months you dont know thati dont know that the bank knows it millions of dollars left untouched unaccounted for and no one has bothered to find out why thats what i cant understand its as though you were being abandoned its where the mistake could have been made bourne leaned back in the chair looking at his bandaged left hand remembering the sight of the weapon smashing repeatedly downwardin the shadows of a racing car in the steppdeckstrasse he raised his eyes and looked at marie what youre saying is that if i was abandoned its because that mistake is thought to be the truth by the directors at treadstone possibly they might think youve involved them in illega l transactionswith criminal elementsthat could cost them millions more conceivably risking expropriation of entire companies by angry governments or that you joined forces with an international crime syndicate probably not knowing it anything it would account for their not going near the bank theyd want no guilt by association so in a sense no matter what your friend peter learns im still back at square one were back but its not square one more like fourandahalf to five on a scale of ten even if it were nine nothings really changed men want to kill me and i dont know why others could stop them but they wont that man at the drei alpenhäuser said interpol has its nets out for me and if i walk into one i dont have any answers im guilty as charged because i dont know what im guilty of having no memory isnt much of a defense and its possible that i have no defense period i refuse to believe that and so must you thanks i mean it jason stop it stop it how many times do i say that to myself you are my love the only woman i have ever known and you believe in me why cant i believe in myself bourne got up as always testing his legs mobility was coming back to him the wounds less severe than his imagination had permitted him to believe he had made an appointment that night with the doctor in wohlen to remove the stitches tomorrow change would come paris said jason the answers in paris i know it as surely as i saw the outline of those triangles in zurich i just dont know where to begin its crazy im a man waiting for an image for a word or a phraseor a book of matchesto tell me something to send me somewhere else why not wait until i hear from peter i can call him tomorrow we can be in paris tomorrow because it wouldnt make any difference dont you see no matter what he came up with the one thing i need to know wouldnt be there for the same reason treadstone hasnt gone near the bank me i have to know why men want to kill me why someone named carlos will pay what was it a fortune for my corpse it was as far as he got interrupted by the crash at the table marie had dropped her cup and was staring at him her face white as if the blood had drained from her head what did you just say she asked what i said i have to know the name you just said the name carlos thats right in all the hours weve talked the days weve been together you never mentioned him bourne looked at her trying to remember it was true he had told her everything that had come to him yet somehow he had omitted carlos almost purposely as if blocking it out i guess i didnt he said you seem to know whos carlos are you trying to be funny if you are the jokes not very good im not trying to be funny i dont think theres anything to be funny about whos carlos my godyou dont know she exclaimed studying his eyes its part of what was taken from you who is carlos an assassin hes called the assassin of europe a man hunted for twenty years believed to have killed between fifty and sixty political and military figures no one knows what he looks like but its said he operates out of paris bourne felt a wave of cold going through him the taxi to wohlen was an english ford belonging to the concierges soninlaw jason and marie sat in the back seat the dark countryside passing swiftly outside the windows the stitches had been removed replaced by soft bandages held by wide strips of tape get back to canada said jason softly breaking the silence between them i will i told you that ive a few more days left i want to see paris i dont want you in paris ill call you in ottawa you can make the treadstone search yourself and give me the information over the phone i thought you said it wouldnt make any difference you had to know the why the who was meaningless until you understood ill find a way i just need one man ill find him but you dont know where to begin youre a man waiting for an image for a phrase or a book of matches they may not be there something will be there something is but you dont see it i do its why you need me i know the words the methods you dont bourne looked at her in the rushing shadows i think youd better be clearer the banks jason treadstones connections are in the banks but not in the way that you might think the stooped old man in the threadbare overcoat black beret in hand walked down the far left aisle of the country church in the village of arpajon ten miles south of paris the bells of the evening angelus echoed throughout the upper regions of stone and wood the man held his place at the fifth row and waited for the ringing to stop it was his signal he accepted it knowing that during the pealing of the bells another younger manas ruthless as any man alivehad circled the small church and studied everyone inside and outside had that man seen anything he did not expect to see anyone he considered a threat to his person there would be no questions asked simply an execution that was the way of carlos and only those who understood that their lives could be snuffed out because they themselves had been followed accepted money to act as the assassins messenger they were all like himself old men from the old days whose lives were running out months remaining limited by age or disease or both carlos permitted no risks whatsoever the single consolation being that if one died in his serviceor by his handmoney would find its way to old women or the children of old women or their children it had to be said there was a certain dignity to be found in working for carlos and there was no lack of generosity this was what his small army of infirm old men understood he gave a purpose to the ends of their lives the messenger clutched his beret and continued down the aisle to the row of confessional booths against the left wall he walked to the fifth booth parted the curtain and stepped inside adjusting his eyes to the light of a single candle that glowed from the other side of the translucent drape separating priest from sinner he sat down on the small wooden bench and looked at the silhouette in the holy enclosure it was as it always was the hooded figure of a man in a monks habit the messenger tried not to imagine what that man looked like it was not his place to speculate on such things angelus domini he said angelus domini child of god whispered the hooded silhouette are your days comfortable they draw to an end replied the old man making the proper response but they are made comfortable good its important to have a sense of security at your age said carlos but to business did you get the particulars from zurich the owl is dead so are two others possibly a third anothers hand was severely wounded he cannot work cain disappeared they think the woman is with him an odd turn of events said carlos theres more the one ordered to kill her has not been heard from he was to take her to the guisan quai no one knows what happened except that a watchman was killed in her place its possible she was never a hostage at all but instead bait for a trap a trap that snapped back on cain i want to think about that in the meantime here are my instructions are you ready the old man reached into his pocket and took out the stub of a pencil and a scrap of paper very well telephone zurich i want a man in paris by tomorrow who has seen cain who can recognize him also zurich is to reach koenig at the gemeinschaft and tell him to send his tape to new york hes to use the post office box in village station please interrupted the aged messenger these old hands do not write as they once did forgive me whispered carlos im preoccupied and inconsiderate im sorry not at all not at all go ahead finally i want our team to take rooms within a block of the bank on the rue madeleine this time the bank will be cains undoing the pretender will be taken at the source of his misplaced pride a bargain price as despicable as he is unless hes something else bourne watched from a distance as marie passed through customs and immigration in berns airport looking for signs of interest or recognition from anyone in the crowd that stood around air frances departure area it was four oclock in the afternoon the busiest hour for flights to paris a time when privileged businessmen hurried back to the city of light after dull company chores at the banks in bern marie glanced over her shoulder as she walked through the gate he nodded waited until she had disappeared then turned and started for the swissair lounge george b washburn had a reservation on the plane to orly they would meet later at the café marie remembered from visits during her oxford days it was called au coin de cluny on the boulevard saintmichel several blocks from the sorbonne if by any chance it was no longer there jason would find her around nine oclock on the steps of the cluny museum bourne would be late nearby but late the sorbonne had one of the most extensive libraries in all europe and somewhere in that library were back issues of newspapers university libraries were not subject to the working hours of government employees students used them during the evenings so would he as soon as he reached paris there was something he had to learn every day i read the newspapers in three languages six months ago a man was killed his death reported on the front page of each of those newspapersso said a fat man in zurich he left his suitcase at the library checkroom and walked to the second floor turning left toward the arch that led to the huge reading room the salle de lecture was at this annex the newspapers on spindles placed in racks the issues going back precisely one year from the days date he walked along the racks counting back six months lifting off the first ten weeks worth of papers before that date a half a year ago he carried them to the nearest vacant table and without sitting down flipped through from front page to front page issue to issue great men had died in their beds while others had made pronouncements the dollar had fallen gold risen strikes had crippled and governments had vacillated between action and paralysis but no man had been killed who warranted headlines there was no such incidentno such assassination jason returned to the racks and went back further two weeks twelve weeks twenty weeks nearly eight months nothing then it struck him he had gone back in time not forward from that date six months ago an error could be made in either direction a few days or a week even two he returned the spindles to the racks and pulled out the papers from four and five months ago airplanes had crashed and revolutions had erupted bloodily holy men had spoken only to be rebuked by other holy men poverty and disease had been found where everyone knew they could be found but no man of consequence had been killed he started on the last spindle the mists of doubt and guilt clearing with each turn of a page had a sweating fat man in zurich lied was it all a lie all lies was he somehow living a nightmare that could vanish with ambassadeur leland assassiné à marseille the thick block letters of the headline exploded off the page hurting his eyes it was not imagined pain not invented pain but a sharp ache that penetrated his sockets and seared through his head his breathing stopped his eyes rigid on the name leland he knew it he could picture the face actually picture it thick brows beneath a wide forehead a blunt nose centered between high cheekbones and above curiously thin lips topped by a perfectly groomed gray mustache he knew the face he knew the man and the man had been killed by a single shot from a highpowered rifle fired from a waterfront window ambassador howard leland had walked down a marseilles pier at five oclock in the afternoon his head had been blown off bourne did not have to read the second paragraph to know that howard leland had been admiral h r leland united states navy until an interim appointment as director of naval intelligence preceded his ambassadorship to the quai dorsay in paris nor did he have to reach the body of the article where motives for the assassination were speculated upon to know them he knew them lelands primary function in paris was to dissuade the french government from authorizing massive arms salesin particular fleets of mirage jetsto africa and the middle east to an astonishing degree he had succeeded angering interested parties at all points in the mediterranean it was presumed that he had been killed for his interference a punishment which served as a warning to others buyers and sellers of death were not to be hindered and the seller of death who had killed him would have been paid a great deal of money far from the scene all traces buried zurich a messenger to a legless man another to a fat man in a crowded restaurant off the falkenstrasse zurich marseilles jason closed his eyes the pain now intolerable he had been picked up at sea five months ago his port of origin assumed to have been marseilles and if marseilles the waterfront had been his escape route a boat hired to take him into the vast expanse of the mediterranean everything fitted too well each piece of the puzzle sculpted into the next how could he know the things he knew if he were not that seller of death from a window on the marseilles waterfront he opened his eyes pain inhibiting thought but not all thought one decision as clear as anything in his limited memory there would be no rendezvous in paris with marie st jacques perhaps one day he would write her a letter saying the things he could not say now if he was alive and could write a letter he could not write one now there could be no written words of thanks or love no explanations at all she would wait for him and he would not come to her he had to put distance between them she could not be involved with a seller of death she had been wrong his worst fears accurate oh god he could picture howard lelands face and there was no photograph on the page in front of him the front page with the terrible headline that triggered so much confirmed so many things the date thursday august marseilles it was a day he would remember as long as he could remember for the rest of his convoluted life thursday august something was wrong what was it what was it thursday thursday meant nothing to him the twentysixth of august the twentysixth it could not be the twentysixth the twentysixth was wrong he had heard it over and over again washburns diaryhis patients journal how often had washburn gone back over every fact every phrase every day and point of progress too many times to count too many times not to remember you were brought to my door on the morning of tuesday august twentyfourth at precisely eighttwenty oclock your condition was tuesday august august he was not in marseilles on the twentysixth he could not have fired a rifle from a window on the waterfront he was not the seller of death in marseilles he had not killed howard leland six months ago a man was killed but it was not six months it was close to six months but not six months and he had not killed that man he was half dead in an alcoholics house on ile de port noir the mists were clearing the pain receding a sense of elation filled him he had found one concrete lie if there was one there could be others bourne looked at his watch it was quarter past nine marie had left the café she was waiting for him on the steps of the cluny museum he replaced the spindles in their racks then started toward the large cathedral door of the reading room a man in a hurry he walked down the boulevard saintmichel his pace accelerating with each stride he had the distinct feeling that he knew what it was to have been given a reprieve from hanging and he wanted to share that rare experience for a time he was out of the violent darkness beyond the crashing waters he had found a moment of sunlightlike the moments and the sunlight that had filled a room in a village innand he had to reach the one who had given them to him reach her and hold her and tell her there was hope he saw her on the steps her arms folded against the icy wind that swept off the boulevard at first she did not see him her eyes searching the treelined street she was restless anxious an impatient woman afraid she would not see what she wanted to see frightened that it would not be there ten minutes ago he would not have been she saw him her face became radiant the smile emerged and it was filled with life she rushed to him as he raced up the steps toward her they came together and for a moment neither said anything warm and alone on the saintmichel i waited and waited she breathed finally i was so afraid so worried did anything happen are you all right im fine better than ive been in a long time what he held her by the shoulders six months ago a man was killed remember the joy left her eyes yes i remember i didnt kill him said bourne i couldnt have they found a small hotel off the crowded boulevard montparnasse the lobby and the rooms were threadbare but there was a pretense to forgotten elegance that gave it an air of timelessness it was a quiet resting place set down in the middle of a carnival hanging on to its identity by accepting the times without joining them jason closed the door nodding to the whitehaired bell captain whose indifference had turned to indulgence upon the receipt of a twentyfranc note he thinks youre a provincial deacon flushed with a nights anticipation said marie i hope you noticed i went right to the bed his name is hervé and hell be very solicitous of our needs he has no intention of sharing the wealth he crossed to her and took her in his arms thanks for my life he said any time my friend she reached up and held his face in her hands but dont keep me waiting like that again i nearly went crazy all i could think of was that someone had recognized you that something terrible had happened you forget no one knows what i look like dont count on that its not true there were four men in the steppdeckstrasse including that bastard in the guisan quai theyre alive jason they saw you not really they saw a darkhaired man with bandages on his neck and head who walked with a limp only two were near me the man on the second floor and that pig in the guisan the first wont be leaving zurich for a while he cant walk and he hasnt much of a hand left the second had the beam of the flashlight in his eyes it wasnt in mine she released him frowning her alert mind questioning you cant be sure they were there they did see you change your hair you change your face geoffrey washburn ile de port noir i repeat they saw a darkhaired man in shadows how good are you with a weak solution of peroxide ive never used it then ill find a shop in the morning the montparnasse is the place for it blonds have more fun isnt that what they say she studied his face im trying to imagine what youll look like different not much but enough you may be right i hope to god you are she kissed his cheek her prelude to discussion now tell me what happened where did you go what did you learn about that incident six months ago it wasnt six months ago and because it wasnt i couldnt have killed him he told her everything save for the few brief moments when he thought he would never see her again he did not have to she said it for him if that date hadnt been so clear in your mind you wouldnt have come to me would you he shook his head probably not i knew it i felt it for a minute while i was walking from the café to the museum steps i could hardly breathe it was as though i were suffocating can you believe that i dont want to neither do i but it happened they were sitting she on the bed he in the single armchair close by he reached for her hand im still not sure i should be here i knew that man i saw his face i was in marseilles fortyeight hours before he was killed but you didnt kill him then why was i there why do people think i did christ its insane he sprang up from the chair pain back in his eyes but then i forgot im not sane am i because ive forgotten years a lifetime marie spoke matteroffactly no compassion in her voice the answers will come to you from one source or another finally from yourself that may not be possible washburn said it was like blocks rearranged different tunnels different windows jason walked to the window bracing himself on the sill looking down on the lights of montparnasse the views arent the same they never will be somewhere out there are people i know who know me a couple of thousand miles away are other people i care about and dont care about or oh god maybe a wife and childreni dont know i keep spinning around in the wind turning over and over and i cant get down to the ground every time i try i get thrown back up again into the sky asked marie yes youve jumped from a plane she said making a statement bourne turned i never told you that you talked about it in your sleep the other night you were sweating your face was flushed and hot and i had to wipe it with a towel why didnt you say anything i did in a way i asked you if you were a pilot or if flying bothered you especially at night i didnt know what you were talking about why didnt you press me i was afraid to you were very close to hysterics and im not trained in things like that i can help you try to remember but i cant deal with your unconscious i dont think anyone should but a doctor a doctor i was with a doctor for damn near six months from what youve said about him i think another opinion is called for i dont he replied confused by his own anger why not marie got up from the bed you need help my darling a psychiatrist might no he shouted in spite of himself furious with himself i wont do that i cant please tell me why she asked calmly standing in front of him i i cant do it just tell me why thats all bourne stared at her then turned and looked out the window again his hands on the sill again because im afraid someone lied and i was grateful for that more than i can tell you but suppose there arent any more lies suppose the rest is true what do i do then are you saying you dont want to find out not that way he stood up and leaned against the window frame his eyes still on the lights below try to understand me he said i have to know certain things enough to make a decision but maybe not everything a part of me has to be able to walk away disappear i have to be able to say to myself what was isnt any longer and theres a possibility that it never was because i have no memory of it what a person cant remember didnt exist for him he turned back to her what im trying to tell you is that maybe its better this way you want evidence but not proof is that what youre saying i want arrows pointing in one direction or the other telling me whether to run or not to run telling you what about us thatll come with the arrows wont it you know that then lets find them she replied be careful you may not be able to live with whats out there i mean that i can live with you and i mean that she reached up and touched his face come on its barely five oclock in ontario and i can still reach peter at the office he can start the treadstone search and give us the name of someone here at the embassy who can help us if we need him youre going to tell peter youre in paris hell know it anyway from the operator but the call wont be traceable to this hotel and dont worry ill keep everything inhouse even casual i came to paris for a few days because my relatives in lyon are simply too dull hell accept that would he know someone at the embassy here peter makes it a point to know someone everywhere its one of his more useful but less attractive traits sounds like he will bourne got their coats after your call well have dinner i think we could both use a drink lets go past the bank on rue madeleine i want to see something what can you see at night a telephone booth i hope theres one nearby there was diagonally across the street from the entrance the tall blond man wearing tortoiseshell glasses checked his watch under the afternoon sun on the rue madeleine the pavements were crowded the traffic in the street unreasonable as most traffic was in paris he entered the telephone booth and untangled the telephone which had been hanging free of its cradle the line knotted it was a courteous sign to the next wouldbe user that the phone was out of commission it reduced the chance that the booth would be occupied it had worked he glanced at his watch again the time span had begun marie inside the bank she would call within the next few minutes he took several coins from his pocket put them on the ledge and leaned against the glass panel his eyes on the bank across the street a cloud diminished the sunlight and he could see his reflection in the glass he approved of what he saw recalling the startled reaction of a hairdresser in montparnasse who had sequestered him in a curtained booth while performing the blond transformation the cloud passed the sunlight returned and the telephone rang its you asked marie st jacques its me said bourne make sure you get the name and the location of the office and rough up your french mispronounce a few words so he knows youre american tell him youre not used to the telephones in paris then do everything in sequence ill call you back in exactly five minutes clocks on what nothing i mean lets go all right the clock is on good luck thanks jason depressed the lever released it and dialed the number he had memorized la banque de valois bonjour i need assistance said bourne continuing with the approximate words marie had told him to use i recently transferred sizable funds from switzerland on a pouchcourier basis id like to know if theyve cleared that would be our foreign services department sir ill connect you a click then another female voice foreign services jason repeated his request may i have your name please id prefer speaking with an officer of the bank before giving it there was a pause on the line very well sir ill switch you to the office of vicepresident damacourt monsieur damacourts secretary was less accommodating the bank officers screening process activated as marie had predicted so bourne once more used maries words im referring to a transfer from zurich from the gemeinschaft bank on the bahnhofstrasse and im talking in the area of seven figures monsieur damacourt if you please i have very little time it was not a secretarys place to be the cause of further delay a perplexed first vicepresident got on the line may i help you are you damacourt asked jason i am antoine damacourt yes and who may i ask is calling good i should have been given your name in zurich ill make certain next time certainly said bourne the redundancy intended his accent american i beg your pardon would you be more comfortable speaking english monsieur yes replied jason doing so im having enough trouble with this damn phone he looked at his watch he had less than two minutes my names bourne jason bourne and eight days ago i transferred four and a half million francs from the gemeinschaft bank in zurich they assured me the transaction would be confidential all transactions are confidential sir fine good what i want to know is has everything cleared i should explain continued the bank officer that confidentiality excludes blanket confirmations of such transactions to unknown parties over the telephone marie had been right the logic of her trap clearer to jason i would hope so but as i told your secretary im in a hurry im leaving paris in a couple of hours and i have to put everything in order then i suggest you come to the bank i know that said bourne satisfied that the conversation was going precisely the way marie foresaw it i just wanted everything ready when i got there wheres your office on the main floor monsieur at the rear beyond the gate center door a receptionist is there and ill be dealing only with you right if you wish although any officer look mister exclaimed the ugly american were talking about over four million francs only with me monsieur bourne fine good jason put his fingers on the cradle bar he had fifteen seconds to go look its now he pressed down twice on the lever interrupting the line but not disconnecting it hello hello i am here monsieur damn phones listen ill he pressed down again now three times in rapid succession hello hello monsieur pleaseif youll give me your telephone number operator operator monsieur bourne please i cant hear you four seconds three seconds two seconds wait a minute ill call you back he held the lever down breaking the connection three more seconds elapsed and the phone rang he picked it up his names damacourt office on the main floor rear center door ive got it said marie hanging up bourne dialed the bank again inserted coins again je parlais avec monsieur damacourt quand on ma coupe je regrette monsieur monsieur bourne damacourt yesim so terribly sorry youre having such trouble you were saying about the time oh yeah its a little after ill get there by i look forward to meeting you monsieur jason reknotted the phone letting it hang free then left the booth and walked quickly through crowds to the shade of a storefront canopy he turned and waited his eyes on the bank across the way remembering another bank in zurich and the sound of sirens on the bahnhofstrasse the next twenty minutes would tell if marie was right or not if she was there would be no sirens on the rue madeleine the slender woman in the widebrimmed hat that partially covered the side of her face hung up the public phone on the wall to the right of the banks entrance she opened her purse removed a compact and ostensibly checked her makeup angling the small mirror first to the left then to the right satisfied she replaced the compact closed her purse and walked past the tellers cages toward the rear of the main floor she stopped at a counter in the center picked up a chained ballpoint pen and began writing aimless numbers on a form that had been left on the marble surface less than ten feet away was a small brassframed gate flanked by a low wooden railing that extended the width of the lobby beyond the gate and the railing were the desks of the lesser executives and behind them the desks of the major secretariesfive in allin front of five doors in the rear wall marie read the name printed in gold script on the center door m a r damacourt vicepresident comptes a létranger et devises it would happen any moment nowif it was going to happen if she was right and if she was she had to know what monsieur ar damacourt looked like he would be the man jason could reach reach him and talk to him but not in the bank it happened there was a flurry of controlled activity the secretary at the desk in front of damacourts office rushed inside with her notepad emerged thirty seconds later and picked up the phone she dialed three digitsan inside calland spoke reading from her pad two minutes passed the door of damacourts office opened and the vicepresident stood in the frame an anxious executive concerned over an unwarranted delay he was a middleaged man with a face older than his age but striving to look younger his thinning dark hair was singed and brushed to obscure the bald spots his eyes were encased in small rolls of flesh attesting to long hours with good wine those same eyes were cold darting eyes evidence of a demanding man wary of his surroundings he barked a question to his secretary she twisted in her chair doing her best to maintain her composure damacourt went back inside his office without closing the door the cage of an angry cat left open another minute passed the secretary kept glancing to her right looking at somethingfor something when she saw it she exhaled closing her eyes in relief from the far left wall a green light suddenly appeared above two panels of dark wood an elevator was in use seconds later the door opened and an elderly elegant man walked out carrying a small black case not much larger than his hand marie stared at it experiencing both satisfaction and fear she had guessed right the black case had been removed from a confidential file inside a guarded room and signed out by a man beyond reproach or temptationthe elderly figure making his way past the ranks of desks toward damacourts office the secretary rose from her chair greeted the senior executive and escorted him into damacourts office she came out immediately closing the door behind her marie looked at her watch her eyes on the sweepsecond hand she wanted one more fragment of evidence and it would be hers shortly if she could get beyond the gate with a clear view of the secretarys desk if it was going to happen it would happen in moments the duration brief she walked to the gate opening her purse and smiling vacuously at the receptionist who was speaking into her phone she mouthed the name damacourt with her lips to the bewildered receptionist reached down and opened the gate she moved quickly inside a determined if not very bright client of the valois bank pardon madame the receptionist held her hand over the telephone rushing her words in french can i help you again marie pronounced the name with her lipsnow a courteous client late for an appointment and not wishing to be a further burden to a busy employee monsieur damacourt im afraid im late ill just go see his secretary she continued up the aisle toward the secretarys desk please madame called out the receptionist i must announce the hum of electric typewriters and subdued conversations drowned out her words marie approached the sternfaced secretary who looked up as bewildered as the receptionist yes may i help you monsieur damacourt please im afraid hes in conference madame do you have an appointment oh yes of course said marie opening her purse again the secretary looked at the typed schedule on her desk im afraid i dont have anyone listed for this time period oh my word exclaimed the confused client of the valois bank i just noticed its for tomorrow not today im so sorry she turned and walked rapidly back to the gate she had seen what she wanted to see the last fragment of evidence a single button was lighted on damacourts telephone he had bypassed his secretary and was making an outside call the account belonging to jason bourne had specific confidential instructions attached to it which were not to be revealed to the account holder bourne looked at his watch in the shade of the canopy it was marie would be back by the telephone at the front of the bank a pair of eyes inside the next few minutes would give them the answer perhaps she already knew it he edged his way to the left side of the store window keeping the banks entrance in view a clerk inside smiled at him reminding him that all attention should be avoided he pulled out a pack of cigarettes lit one and looked at his watch again eight minutes to three and then he saw them him three welldressed men walking rapidly up rue madeleine talking to each other their eyes however directed straight ahead they passed the slower pedestrians in front of them excusing themselves with a courtesy that was not entirely parisian jason concentrated on the man in the middle it was him a man named johann signal johann to go inside well come back for them a tall gaunt man wearing goldrimmed spectacles had said the words in the steppdeckstrasse johann they had sent him here from zurich he had seen jason bourne and that told him something there were no photographs the three men reached the entrance johann and the man on his right went inside the third man stayed by the door bourne started back to the telephone booth he would wait four minutes and place his last call to antoine damacourt he dropped his cigarette outside the booth crushed it under his foot and opened the door monsieur a voice came from behind jason spun around holding his breath a nondescript man with a stubble of a beard pointed at the booth le téléphoneil ne marche pas regardez la corde merci bien je vais essayer quand même the man shrugged and left bourne stepped inside the four minutes were up he took the coins from his pocketenough for two callsand dialed the first la banque de valois bonjour ten seconds later damacourt was on the phone his voice strained it is you monsieur bourne i thought you to say you were on your way to my office a change of plans im afraid ill have to call you tomorrow suddenly through the glass panel of the booth jason saw a car swing into a space across the street in front of the bank the third man who was standing by the entrance nodded to the driver i can do damacourt had asked a question i beg your pardon i asked if there was anything i can do i have your account everything is in readiness for you here im sure it is bourne thought the ploy was worth a try look i have to get over to london this afternoon im taking one of the shuttle flights but ill be back tomorrow keep everything with you all right to london monsieur ill call you tomorrow i have to find a cab to orly he hung up and watched the entrance of the bank in less than half a minute johann and his companion came running out they spoke to the third man then all three climbed into the waiting automobile the killers escape car was still in the hunt on its way now to orly airport jason memorized the number on the license plate then dialed his second call if the pay phone in the bank was not in use marie would pick it up before the ring had barely started she did yes see anything a great deal damacourts your man they moved about the store going from counter to counter marie however remained near the wide front window keeping a perpetual eye on the entrance of the bank across rue madeleine i picked out two scarves for you said bourne you shouldnt have the prices are far too high its almost four oclock if he hasnt come out by now he wont until the end of office hours probably not if he were going to meet someone he would have done so by now but we had to know take my word for it his friends are at orly running from shuttle to shuttle theres no way they can tell whether im on one or not because they dont know what name im using theyll depend on the man from zurich to recognize you hes looking for a dark haired man with a limp not me come on lets go into the bank you can point out damacourt we cant do that said marie shaking her head the cameras on the ceilings have wideangle lenses if they ran the tapes they could spot you a blondhaired man with glasses or me i was there the receptionist or his secretary could identify me youre saying its a regular cabal in there i doubt it they could think up any number of reasons to run the tapes marie stopped she clutched jasons arm her eyes on the bank beyond the window there he is the one in the overcoat with the black velvet collardamacourt pulling at his sleeves yes ive got him ill see you back at the hotel be careful be very careful pay for the scarves theyre at the counter in the back jason left the store wincing in the sunlight beyond the canopy looking for a break in the traffic so he could cross the street there was none damacourt had turned right and was strolling casually he was not a man in a rush to meet anyone instead there was the air of a slightly squashed peacock about him bourne reached the corner and crossed with the light falling behind the banker damacourt stopped at a newsstand to buy an evening paper jason held his place in front of a sporting goods shop then followed as the banker continued down the block ahead was a café windows dark entrance heavy wood thick hardware on the door it took no imagination to picture the inside it was a drinking place for men and for women brought with men other men would not discuss it was as good a spot as any for a quiet discussion with antoine damacourt jason walked faster falling in stride beside the banker he spoke in the awkward anglicized french he had used on the phone bonjour monsieur je pense que vous êtes monsieur damacourt id say i was right wouldnt you the banker stopped his cold eyes were frightened remembering the peacock shriveled further into his tailored overcoat bourne he whispered your friends must be very confused by now i expect theyre racing all over orly airport wondering perhaps if you gave them the wrong information perhaps on purpose what the frightened eyes bulged lets go inside here said jason taking damacourts arm his grip firm i think we should have a talk i know absolutely nothing i merely followed the demands of the account i am not involved sorry when i first talked to you you said you wouldnt confirm the sort of bank account i was talking about on the phone you wouldnt discuss business with someone you didnt know but twenty minutes later you said you had everything ready for me thats confirmation isnt it lets go inside the café was in some ways a miniature version of zurichs drei alpenhäuser the booths were deep the partitions between them high and the light dim from there however the appearances veered the café on rue madeleine was totally french carafes of wine replacing steins of beer bourne asked for a booth in the corner the waiter accommodated have a drink said jason youre going to need it you presume replied the banker coldly ill have a whiskey the drinks came quickly the brief interim taken up with damacourt nervously extracting a pack of cigarettes from under his formfitting overcoat bourne struck a match holding it close to the bankers face very close merci damacourt inhaled removed his cigarette and swallowed half the small glass of whiskey im not the man you should talk with he said who is an owner of the bank perhaps i dont know but certainly not me explain that arrangements were made a privately held bank has more flexibility than a publicly owned institution with stockholders how theres greater latitude shall we say with regard to the demands of certain clients and sister banks less scrutiny than might be applied to a company listed on the bourse the gemeinschaft in zurich is also a private institution the demands were made by the gemeinschaft requests demands yes who owns the valois who manya consortium ten or twelve men and their families then i have to talk to you dont i i mean itd be a little foolish my running all over paris tracking them down im only an executive an employee damacourt swallowed the rest of his drink crushed out his cigarette and reached for another and the matches what are the arrangements i could lose my position monsieur you could lose your life said jason disturbed that the words came so easily to him im not as privileged as you think nor as ignorant as youd like me to believe said bourne his eyes wandering over the banker across the table your types everywhere damacourt its in your clothes the way you wear your hair even your walk you strut too much a man like you doesnt get to be the vicepresident of the valois bank without asking questions you cov er yourself you dont make a smelly move unless you can save your own ass now tell me what those arrangements were youre not important to me am i being clear damacourt struck a match and held it beneath his cigarette while staring at jason you dont have to threaten me monsieur youre a very rich man why not pay me the banker smiled nervously youre quite right incidentally i did ask a question or two paris is not zurich a man of my station must have words if not answers bourne leaned back revolving his glass the clicking of the ice cubes obviously annoying damacourt name a reasonable price he said finally and well discuss it im a reasonable man let the decision be based on value and let it be yours bankers the world over are compensated by grateful clients they have advised i would like to think of you as a client im sure you would bourne smiled shaking his head at the mans sheer nerve so we slide from bribe to gratuity compensation for personal advice and service damacourt shrugged i accept the definition and if ever asked would repeat your words the arrangements accompanying the transfer of our funds from zurich was une fiche confidentielle une fiche broke in jason recalling the moment in apfels office at the gemeinschaft when koenig came in saying the words i heard it once before what is it a dated term actually it comes from the middle nineteenth century when it was a common practice for the great banking housesprimarily the rothschildsto keep track of the international flow of money thank you now what is it specifically separate sealed instructions to be opened and followed when the account in question is called up called up funds removed or deposited suppose id just gone to a teller presented a bank book and asked for money a double asterisk would have appeared on the transaction computer you would have been sent to me i was sent to you anyway the operator gave me your office irrelevant chance there are two other officers in the foreign services department had you been connected to either one the fiche would have dictated that you still be sent to me i am the senior executive i see but bourne was not sure that he did see there was a gap in the sequence a space needed filling wait a minute you didnt know anything about a fiche when you had the account brought to your office why did i ask for it interrupted damacourt anticipating the question be reasonable monsieur put yourself in my place a man calls and identifies himself then says he is talking about over four million francs four million would you not be anxious to be of service bend a rule here and there looking at the seedily elegant banker jason realized it was the most unstartling thing he had said the instructions what were they to begin with a telephone numberunlisted of course it was to be called all information relayed do you remember the number i make it a point to commit such things to memory ill bet you do what is it i must protect myself monsieur how else could you have gotten it i pose the question how do you say it rhetorically which means you have the answer how did i get it if it ever comes up in zurich you paid a very high price for someone to break not only the strictest regulation on the bahnhofstrasse but also the laws of switzerland ive got just the man said bourne the face of koenig coming into focus hes already committed the crime at the gemeinschaft are you joking not one bit his name is koenig his desk is on the second floor ill remember that im sure you will the number damacourt gave it to him jason wrote it on a paper napkin how do i know this is accurate you have a reasonable guarantee i have not been paid good enough and as long as value is intrinsic to our discussion i should tell you that it is the second telephone number the first was canceled explain that damacourt leaned forward a photostat of the original fiche arrived with accountscourier it was sealed in a black case accepted and signed for by the senior keeperofrecords the card inside was validated by a partner of the gemeinschaft countersigned by the usual swiss notary the instructions were simple quite clear in all matters pertaining to the account of jason c bourne a transatlantic call to the united states was to be placed immediately the details relayed here the card was altered the number in new york deleted one in paris inserted and initialed new york interrupted bourne how do you know it was new york the telephone area code was parenthetically included spaced in front of the number itself it remained intact it was as first vicepresident foreign services i place such calls daily the alteration was pretty sloppy possibly it could have been made in haste or not thoroughly understood on the other hand there was no way to delete the body of the instructions without renotarization a minor risk considering the number of telephones in new york at any rate the substitution gave me the latitude to ask a question or two change is a bankers anathema damacourt sipped what remained of his drink care for another asked jason no thank you it would prolong our discussion youre the one who stopped im thinking monsieur perhaps you should have in mind a vague figure before i proceed bourne studied the man it could be five he said five what five figures i shall proceed i spoke to a woman a woman how did you begin truthfully i was the vicepresident of the valois and was following instructions from the gemeinschaft in zurich what else was there to say go on i said i had been in communication with a man claiming to be jason bourne she asked me how recently to which i replied a few minutes she was then most anxious to know the substance of our conversation it was at this point that i voiced my own concerns the fiche specifically stated that a call should be made to new york not paris naturally she said it was not my concern and that the change was authorized by signature and did i care for zurich to be informed that an officer of the valois refused to follow the gemeinschaft instructions hold it interrupted jason who was she i have no idea you mean you were talking all this time and she didnt tell you you didnt ask that is the nature of the fiche if a name is proffered well and good if it is not one does not inquire you didnt hesitate to ask about the telephone number merely a device i wanted information you transferred four and a half million francs a sizable amount and were therefore a powerful client with perhaps more powerful strings attached to him one balks then agrees then balks again only to agree again that is the way one learns things especially if the party one is talking with displays anxiety i can assure you she did what did you learn that you should be considered a dangerous man in what way the definition was left open but the fact that the term was used was enough for me to ask why the sûreté was not involved her reply was extremely interesting he is beyond the sûreté beyond interpol she said what did that tell you that it was a highly complicated matter for any number of possibilities all best left private since our talk began however it now tells me something else whats that that you really should pay me well for i must be extremely cautious those who look for you are also perhaps beyond the sûreté beyond interpol well get to that you told this woman i was on my way to your office within the quarter hour she asked me to remain on the telephone for a few moments that she would be right back obviously she made another call she returned with her final instructions you were to be detained in my office until a man came to my secretary inquiring about a matter from zurich and when you left you were to be identified by a nod or a gesture there could be no error the man came of course and of course you never arrived so he waited by the tellers cages with an associate when you phoned and said you were on your way to london i left my office to find the man my secretary pointed him out and i told him the rest you know didnt it strike you as odd that i had to be identified not so odd as intemperate a fiche is one thingtelephone calls faceless communicationsbut to be involved directly in the open as it were is something else again i said as much to the woman what did she say to you damacourt cleared his throat she made it clear that the party she representedwhose stature was indeed confirmed by the fiche itselfwould remember my cooperation you see i withhold nothing apparently they dont know what you look like a man was at the bank who saw me in zurich then his associates do not trust his eyesight or perhaps what he thinks he saw why do you say that merely an observation monsieur the woman was insistent you must understand i strenuously objected to any overt participation that is not the nature of the fiche she said there was no photograph of you an obvious lie of course is it naturally all passports have photographs where is the immigration officer who cannot be bought or duped ten seconds in a passportcontrol room a photograph of a photograph arrangements can be made no they committed a serious oversight i guess they did and you continued damacourt just told me something else yes you really must pay me very well what did i just tell you that your passport does not identify you as jason bourne who are you monsieur jason did not at first answer he revolved his glass again someone who may pay you a lot of money he said entirely sufficient you are simply a client named bourne and i must be cautious i want that telephone number in new york can you get it for me thered be a sizable bonus i wish i could i see no way it might be raised from the fiche card under a lowpower scope when i said it was deleted monsieur i did not mean it was crossed out it was deletedit was cut out then someone has it in zurich or it has been destroyed last question said jason anxious now to leave it concerns you incidentally its the only way youll get paid the question will be tolerated of course what is it if i showed up at the valois without calling you without telling you i was coming would you be expected to make another telephone call yes one does not disregard the fiche it emanates from powerful boardrooms dismissal would follow then how do we get our money damacourt pursed his lips there is a way withdrawal in absentia forms filled out instructions by letter identification confirmed and authenticated by an established firm of attorneys i would be powerless to interfere youd still be expected to make the call though its a matter of timing should an attorney with whom the valois has had numerous dealings call me requesting that i prepare say a number of cashiers checks drawn upon a foreign transfer he has ascertained to have been cleared i would do so he would state that he was sending over the completed forms the checks of course made out to bearer not an uncommon practice in these days of excessive taxes a messenger would arrive with the letter during the most hectic hours of activity and my secretaryan esteemed trusted employee of many yearswould simply bring in the forms for my countersignature and the letter for my initialing no doubt interrupted bourne along with a number of other papers you were to sign exactly i would then place my call probably watching the messenger leave with his briefcase as i did so you wouldnt by any remote chance have in mind the name of a law firm in paris would you or a specific attorney as a matter of fact one just occurred to me how much will he cost ten thousand francs thats expensive not at all he was a judge on the bench an honored man what about you lets refine it as i said im reasonable and the decision should be yours since you mentioned five figures let us be consistent with your words five figures commencing with five fifty thousand francs thats outrageous so is whatever youve done monsieur bourne une fiche confidentielle said marie sitting in the chair by the window the late afternoon sun bouncing off the ornate buildings of the boulevard montparnasse outside so thats the device theyve used i can impress youi know where it comes from jason poured a drink from the bottle on the bureau and carried it to the bed he sat down facing her do you want to hear i dont have to she answered gazing out the window preoccupied i know exactly where it comes from and what it means its a shock thats all why i thought you expected something like this the results yes not the machinery a fiche is an archaic stab at legitimacy almost totally restricted to private banks on the continent american canadian and uk laws forbid its use bourne recalled damacourts words he repeated them it emanates from powerful boardroomsthats what he said he was right marie looked over at him dont you see i knew that a flag was attached to your account i assumed that someone had been bribed to forward information thats not unusual bankers arent in the front ranks for canonization but this is different that account in zurich was establishedat the very beginningwith the fiche as part of its activity conceivably with your own knowledge treadstone seventyone said jason yes the owners of the bank had to work in concert with treadstone and considering the latitude of your access its possible you were aware that they did but someone was bribed koenig he substituted one telephone number for another he was well paid i can assure you he could face ten years in a swiss prison ten thats pretty stiff so are the swiss laws he had to be paid a small fortune carlos said bourne carlos why what am i to him i keep asking myself i say the name over and over and over again i dont get anything nothing at all just a a i dont know nothing but theres something isnt there marie sat forward what is it jason what are you thinking of im not thinking i dont know then youre feeling something what is it i dont know fear maybe anger nerves i dont know concentrate goddamn it do you think im not do you think i havent have you any idea what its like bourne stiffened annoyed at his own outburst sorry dont be ever these are the hints the clues you have to look forwe have to look for your doctor friend in port noir was right things come to you provoked by other things as you yourself said a book of matches a face or the front of a restaurant weve seen it happen now its a name a name you avoided for nearly a week while you told me everything that had happened to you during the past five months down to the smallest detail yet you never mentioned carlos you should have but you didnt it does mean something to you cant you see that its stirring things inside of you they want to come out i know jason drank darling theres a famous bookstore on the boulevard saintgermain thats run by a magazine freak a whole floor is crammed with back issues of old magazines thousands of them he even catalogues subjects indexes them like a librarian id like to find out if carlos is in that index will you do it bourne was aware of the sharp pain in his chest it had nothing to do with his wounds it was fear she saw it and somehow understood he felt it and could not understand there are back issues of newspapers at the sorbonne he said glancing up at her one of them put me on cloud nine for a while until i thought about it a lie was exposed that was the important thing but were not looking for a lie now are we no were looking for the truth dont be afraid of it darling im not jason got up okay saintgermains on the schedule in the meantime call that fellow at the embassy bourne reached into his pocket and took out the paper napkin with the telephone number on it he had added the numbers of the license plate on the car that had raced away from the bank on rue madeleine heres the number damacourt gave me also the license of that car see what he can do all right marie took the napkin and went to the telephone a small spiralhinged notebook was beside it she flipped through the pages here it is his name is dennis corbelier peter said hed call him by noon today paris time and i could rely on him he was as knowledgeable as any attaché in the embassy peter knows him doesnt he hes not just a name from a list they were classmates at the university of toronto i can call him from here cant i sure but dont say where you are marie picked up the phone ill tell him the same thing i told peter that im moving from one hotel to another but dont know which yet she got an outside line then dialed the number of the canadian embassy on the avenue montaigne fifteen seconds later she was talking with dennis corbelier attaché marie got to the point of her call almost immediately i assume peter told you i might need some help more than that replied corbelier he explained that you were in zurich cant say i understood everything he said but i got the general idea seems theres a lot of maneuvering in the world of high finance these days more than usual the trouble is no one wants to say whos maneuvering whom thats my problem how can i help i have a license and a telephone number both here in paris the telephones unlisted it could be awkward if i called give them to me she did a mari usque ad mari corbelier said reciting the national motto of their country we have several friends in splendid places we trade off favors frequently usually in the narcotics area but were all flexible why not have lunch with me tomorrow ill bring what i can id like that but tomorrows no good im spending the day with an old friend perhaps another time peter said id be an idiot not to insist he says youre a terrific lady hes a dear and so are you ill call you tomorrow afternoon fine ill go to work on these talk to you tomorrow and thanks again marie hung up and looked at her watch im to call peter in three hours dont let me forget you really think hell have something so soon he does he started last night by calling washington its what corbelier just said we all trade off this piece of information here for that one there a name from our side for one of yours sounds vaguely like betrayal the opposite were dealing in money not missiles money thats illegally moving around outflanking laws that are good for all our interests unless you want the sheiks of araby owning grumman aircraft then were talking about missiles after theyve left the launching pads strike my objection weve got to see damacourts man first thing in the morning figure out what you want to withdraw all of it all thats right if you were the directors of treadstone what would you do if you learned that six million francs were missing from a corporate account i see damacourt suggested a series of cashiers checks made out to the bearer he said that checks yes something wrong there certainly is the numbers of those checks could be punched on a fraud tape and sent to banks everywhere you have to go to a bank to redeem them payments would be stopped hes a winner isnt he he collects from both sides what do we do accept half of what he told youthe bearer part but not checks bonds bearer bonds of various denominations theyre far more easily brokered youve just earned dinner said jason reaching down and touching her face i tries to earn my keep sir she replied holding his hand against her cheek first dinner then peter and then a bookstore on saintgermain a bookstore on saintgermain repeated bourne the pain coming to his chest again what was it why was he so afraid they left the restaurant on the boulevard raspail and walked to the telephone complex on rue vaugirard there were glass booths against the walls and a huge circular counter in the center of the floor where clerks filled out slips assigning booths to those placing calls the traffic is very light madame said the clerk to marie your call should go through in a matter of minutes number twelve please thank you booth twelve yes madame directly over there as they walked across the crowded floor to the booth jason held her arm i know why people use these places he said theyre a hundred and ten times quicker than a hotel phone thats only one of the reasons they had barely reached the booth and lighted cigarettes when they heard the two short bursts of the bell inside marie opened the door and went in her spiralhinged notebook and a pencil in her hand she picked up the receiver sixty seconds later bourne watched in astonishment as she stared at the wall the blood draining from her face her skin chalk white she began shouting and dropped her purse the contents scattering over the floor of the small booth the notebook was caught on the ledge the pencil broken in the grip of her hand he rushed inside she was close to collapse this is marie st jacques in paris lisa peters expecting my call marie oh my god the secretarys voice trailed off replaced by other voices in the background excited voices muted by a cupped hand over the phone then there was a rustle of movement the phone being given to or taken by another marie this is alan said the first assistant director of the section were all in peters office whats the matter alan i dont have much time may i speak to him please there was a moment of silence i wish i could make this easier for you but i dont know how peters dead marie hes what the police called a few minutes ago theyre on their way over the police what happened oh god hes dead what happened were trying to piece it together were studying his phone log but were not supposed to touch anything on his desk his desk notes or memos or anything like that alan tell me what happened thats just itwe dont know he didnt tell any of us what he was doing all we know is that he got two phone calls this morning from the statesone from washington the other from new york around noon he told lisa he was going to the airport to meet someone flying up he didnt say who the police found him an hour ago in one of those tunnels used for freight it was terrible he was shot in the throat marie marie the old man with the hollow eyes and the stubble of a white beard limped into the dark confessional booth blinking his eyes repeatedly trying to focus on the hooded figure beyond the opaque curtain sight was not easy for this eightyyearold messenger but his mind was clear that was all that mattered angelus domini he said angelus domini child of god whispered the hooded silhouette are your days comfortable they draw to an end but they are made comfortable good zurich they found the man from the guisan quai he was wounded they traced him through a doctor known to the verbrecherwelt under severe interrogation he admitted assaulting the woman cain came back for her it was cain who shot him so it was an arrangement the woman and cain the man from the guisan quai does not think so he was one of the two who picked her up on the löwenstrasse hes also a fool he killed the watchman he admits it and defends it he had no choice in making his escape he may not have to defend it it could be the most intelligent thing he did does he have his gun your people have it good there is a prefect on the zurich police that gun must be given to him cain is elusive the woman far less so she has associates in ottawa theyll stay in touch we trap her we trace him is your pencil ready yes carlos bourne held her in the close confines of the glass booth gently lowering her to the seat that protruded from the narrow wall she was shaking breathing in swallows and gasps her eyes glazed coming into focus as she looked at him they killed him they killed him my god what did i do peter you didnt do it if anyone did it i did not you get that through your head jason im frightened he was half a world away and they killed him treadstone who else there were two phone calls washington new york he went to the airport to meet someone and he was killed how oh jesus christ tears came to maries eyes he was shot in the throat she whispered bourne suddenly felt a dull ache he could not localize it but it was there cutting off air carlos he said not knowing why he said it what marie stared up at him what did you say carlos he repeated softly a bullet in the throat carlos what are you trying to say i dont know he took her arm lets get out of here are you all right can you walk she nodded closing her eyes briefly breathing deeply yes well stop for a drink we both need it then well find it find what a bookstore on saintgermain there were three back issues of magazines under the carlos index a threeyearold copy of the international edition of potomac quarterlyand two paris issues of le globe they did not read the articles inside the store instead they bought all three and took a taxi back to the hotel in montparnasse there they began reading marie on the bed jason in the chair by the window several minutes passed and marie bolted up its here she said fear in both her face and voice read it a particularly brutal form of punishment is said to be inflicted by carlos andor his small band of soldiers it is death by a gunshot in the throat often leaving the victim to die in excruciating pain it is reserved for those who break the code of silence or loyalty demanded by the assassin or others who have refused to divulge information marie stopped incapable of reading further she lay back and closed her eyes he wouldnt tell them and he was killed for it oh my god he couldnt tell them what he didnt know said bourne but you knew marie sat up again her eyes open you knew about a gunshot in the throat you said it i said it i knew it thats all i can tell you how i wish i could answer that i cant may i have a drink certainly jason got up and went to the bureau he poured two short glasses of whiskey and looked over at her do you want me to call for some ice hervés on itll be quick no it wont be quick enough she slammed the magazine down on the bed and turned to himon him perhaps im going crazy join the party of two i want to believe you i do believe you but i i you cant be sure completed bourne any more than i can he brought her the glass what do you want me to say what can i say am i one of carlos soldiers did i break the code of silence or loyalty is that why i knew the method of execution stop it i say that a lot to myself stop it dont think try to remember but somewhere along the line put the brakes on dont go too far too deep one lie can be exposed only to raise ten other questions intrinsic to that lie maybe its like waking up after a long drunk not sure whom you fought with or slept with or goddamn it killed no marie drew out the word you are you dont take that away from me i dont want to i dont want to take it away from myself jason went back to the chair and sat down his face turned to the window you found a method of execution i found something else i knew it just as i knew about howard leland i didnt even have to read it read what bourne reached down and picked up the threeyearold issue of potomac quarterly the magazine was folded open to a page on which there was a sketch of a bearded man the lines rough inconclusive as if drawn from an obscure description he held it out for her read it he said it starts with the upper left under the heading myth or monster then i want to play a game a game yes ive read only the first two paragraphs youll have to take my word for that all right marie watched him bewildered she lowered the magazine into the light and read myth or monster for over a decade the name carlos has been whispered in the back streets of such diverse cities as paris teheran beirut london cairo and amsterdam he is said to be the supreme terrorist in the sense that his commitment is to murder and assassination in themselves with no apparent political ideology yet there is concrete evidence that he has undertaken profitable executions for such extremist radical groups as the plo and baadermeinhof both as teacher and profiteer indeed it is through his infrequent gravitation to and the internal conflicts within such terrorist organizations that a clearer picture of carlos is beginning to emerge informers are coming out of the bloodied spleens and they talk whereas tales of his exploits give rise to images of a world filled with violence and conspiracy highexplosives and higher intrigues fast cars and faster women the facts would seem to indicate at least as much adam smith as ian fleming carlos is reduced to human proportions and in the compression a truly frightening man comes into focus the sadoromantic myth turns into a brilliant bloodsoaked monster who brokers assassination with the expertise of a market analyst fully aware of wages costs distribution and the divisions of underworld labor it is a complicated business and carlos is the master of its dollar value the portrait starts with a reputed name as odd in its way as the owners profession ilich ramirez sanchez he is said to be a venezuelan the son of a fanatically devoted but not very prominent marxist attorney the ilich is the fathers salute to vladimir ilyich lenin and partially explains carlos forays into extremist terrorism who sent the young boy to russia for the major part of his education which included espionage training at the soviet compound in novgorod it is here that portrait fades briefly rumor and speculation now the artists according to these one or another committee of the kremlin that regularly monitors foreign students for future infiltration purposes saw what they had in ilich sanchez and wanted no part of him he was a paranoid who saw all solutions in terms of a wellplaced bullet or bomb the recommendation was to send the youth back to caracas and disassociate any and all soviet ties with the family thus rejected by moscow and deeply antithetical to western society sanchez went about building his own world one in which he was the supreme leader what better way to become the apolitical assassin whose services could be contracted for by the widest range of political and philosophical clients the portrait becomes clearer again fluent in numerous languages including his native spanish as well as russian french and english sanchez used his soviet training as a springboard for refining his techniques months of concentrated study followed his expulsion from moscow some say under the tutelage of the cubans che guevera in particular he mastered the science and handling of all manner of weaponry and explosives there was no gun he could not break down and reassemble blindfolded no explosive he could not analyze by smell and touch and know how to detonate in a dozen different ways he was ready he chose paris as his base of operations and the word went out a man was for hire who would kill where others dared not once again the portrait dims as much for lack of birth records as anything else just how old is carlos how many targets can be attributed to him and how many are mythselfproclaimed or otherwise correspondents based in caracas have been unable to unearth any birth certificates anywhere in the country for an ilich ramirez sanchez on the other hand there are thousands upon thousands of sanchezes in venezuela hundreds with ramirez attached but none with an ilich in front was it added later or is the omission simply further proof of carlos thoroughness the consensus is that the assassin is between thirtyfive and forty years of age no one really knows a grassy knoll in dallas but one fact not disputed is that the profits from his first several kills enabled the assassin to set up an organization that might be envied by an operations analyst of general motors it is capitalism at its most efficient loyalty and service extracted by equal parts fear and reward the consequences of disloyalty are swift in comingdeathabout so too are the benefits of servicegenerous bonuses and huge expense allowances the organization seems to have handpicked executives everywhere and this wellfounded rumor leads to the obvious question where did the profits initially come from who were the original kills the one most often speculated upon took place thirteen years ago in dallas no matter how many times the murder of john f kennedy is debated no one has ever satisfactorily explained a burst of smoke from a grassy knoll three hundred yards away from the motorcade the smoke was caught on camera two open police radios on motorcycles recorded noises yet neither shell casings nor footprints were found in fact the only information about the socalled grassy knoll at that moment was considered so irrelevant that it was buried in the fbidallas investigation and never included in the warren commission report it was provided by a bystander k m wright of north dallas who when questioned made the following statement hell the only son of bitch near there was old burlap billy and he was a couple of hundred yards away the billy referred to was an aged dallas tramp seen frequently panhandling in the tourist areas the burlap defined his penchant for wrapping his shoes in coarse cloth to play upon the sympathies of his marks according to our correspondents wrights statement was never made public yet six weeks ago a captured lebanese terrorist broke under questioning in tel aviv pleading to be spared execution he claimed to possess extraordinary information about the assassin carlos israeli intelligence forwarded the report to washington our capitol correspondents obtained excerpts statement carlos was in dallas in november he pretended to be cuban and programmed oswald he was the backup it was his operation question what proof do you have statement i heard him say it he was on a small embankment of grass beyond a ledge his rifle had a wire shelltrap attached question it was never reported why wasnt he seen statement he may have been but no one would have known it he was dressed as an old man with a shabby overcoat and his shoes were wrapped in canvas to avoid footprints a terrorists information is certainly not proof but neither should it always be disregarded especially when it concerns a master assassin known to be a scholar of deception who has made an admission that so astonishingly corroborates an unknown unpublished statement about a moment of national crisis never investigated that indeed must be taken seriously as so many others associatedeven remotelywith the tragic events in dallas burlap billy was found dead several days later from an overdose of drugs he was known to be an old man drunk consistently on cheap wine he was never known to use narcotics he could not afford them was carlos the man on the grassy knoll what an extraordinary beginning for an extraordinary career if dallas really was his operation how many millions of dollars must have been funneled to him certainly more than enough to establish a network of informers and soldiers that is a corporate world unto itself the myth has too much substance carlos may well be a monster of flesh and too much blood marie put down the magazine whats the game are you finished jason turned from the window yes i gather a lot of statements were made theory supposition equations equations if something happened here and there was an effect over there a relationship existed you mean connections said marie all right connections its all there isnt it to a degree you could say that its hardly a legal brief theres a lot of speculation rumor and secondhand information there are facts however data good data thats fine whats the game marie repeated its got a simple title its called trap trap whom me bourne sat forward i want you to ask me questions anything thats in there a phrase the name of a city a rumor a fragment of data anything lets hear what my responses are my blind responses darling thats no proof of do it ordered jason all right marie raised the issue of potomac quarterly beirut she said embassy he answered cia station head posing as an attaché gunned down in the street three hundred thousand dollars marie looked at him i remember she began i dont interrupted jason go on she returned his gaze then went back to the magazine baadermeinhof stuttgart regensburg munich two kills and a kidnapping baader accreditation fees from bourne stopped then whispered in astonishment u s sources detroit wilmington delaware jason what are go on please the name sanchez the name is ilich ramirez sanchez he replied he is carlos why the ilich bourne paused his eyes wandering i dont know its russian not spanish was his mother russian no yes his mother it had to be his mother i think im not sure novgorod espionage compound communications ciphers frequency traffic sanchez is a graduate jason you read that here i did not read it please keep going maries eyes swept back to the top of the article teheran eight kills divided accreditationkhomeini and plo fee two million source southwest soviet sector paris said marie quickly all contracts will be processed through paris what contracts the contracts kills whose kills whose contracts sanchez carlos carlos then theyre carlos contracts his kills they have nothing to do with you carlos contracts said bourne as if in a daze nothing to do with me he repeated barely above a whisper you just said it jason none of this has anything to do with you no thats not true bourne shouted lunging up from the chair holding his place staring down at her our contracts he added quietly you dont know what youre saying im responding blindly its why i had to come to paris he spun around and walked to the window gripping the frame thats what the game is all about he continued were not looking for a lie were looking for the truth remember maybe weve found it maybe the game revealed it this is no valid test its a painful exercise in incidental recollection if a magazine like potomac quarterly printed this it would have been picked up by half the newspapers in the world you could have read it anywhere the fact is i retained it not entirely you didnt know where the ilich came from that carlos father was a communist attorney in venezuela theyre salient points id think you didnt mention a thing about the cubans if you had it would have led to the most shocking speculation written here you didnt say a word about it what are you talking about dallas she said november kennedy replied bourne thats it kennedy it happened then jason stood motionless it did but thats not what im looking for i know said bourne his voice once again flat as if speaking in a vacuum a grassy knoll burlap billy you read this no then you heard it before read it before thats possible but its not relevant is it stop it jason those words again i wish i could what are you trying to tell me youre carlos god no carlos wants to kill me and i dont speak russian i know that then what what i said at the beginning the game the game is called trapthe soldier a soldier yes one who defected from carlos its the only explanation the only reason i know what i know in all things why do you say defect because he does want to kill me he has to he thinks i know as much about him as anyone alive marie had been crouching on the bed she swung her legs over the side her hands at her sides thats a result of defecting what about the cause if its true then you did it became became she stopped all things considered its a little late to look for a moral position said bourne seeing the pain of acknowledgment on the face of the woman he loved i could think of several reasons clichés how about a falling out among thieves killers meaningless cried marie theres not a shred of evidence theres buckets of it and you know it i could have sold out to a higher bidder or stolen huge sums of money from the fees either would explain the account in zurich he stopped briefly looking at the wall above the bed feeling not seeing either would explain howard leland marseilles beirut stuttgart munich everything all the unremembered facts that want to come out and one especially why i avoided his name why i never mentioned him im frightened im afraid of him the moment passed in silence more was spoken of than fear marie nodded im sure you believe that she said and in a way i wish it were true but i dont think it is you want to believe it because it supports what you just said it gives you an answer an identity it may not be the identity you want but god knows its better than wandering blindly through that awful labyrinth you face every day anything would be i guess she paused and i wish it were true because then we wouldnt be here what thats the inconsistency darling the number or symbol that doesnt fit in your equation if you were what you say you were and afraid of carlosand heaven knows you should beparis would be the last place on earth youd feel compelled to go to wed be somewhere else you said it yourself youd run away youd take the money from zurich and disappear but youre not doing that instead youre walking right back into carlos den thats not a man whos either afraid or guilty there isnt anything else i came to paris to find out its as simple as that then run away well have the money in the morning theres nothing stopping youus thats simple too marie watched him closely jason looked at her then turned away he walked to the bureau and poured himself a drink theres still treadstone to consider he said defensively why any more than carlos theres your real equation carlos and treadstone a man i once loved very much was killed by treadstone all the more reason for us to run to survive id think youd want the people who killed him exposed said bourne make them pay for it i do very much but others can find them i have priorities and revenge isnt at the top of the list we are you and i or is that only my judgment my feelings you know better than that he held the glass tighter in his hand and looked over at her i love you he whispered then lets run she said raising her voice almost mechanically taking a step toward him lets forget it all really forget and run as fast as we can as far away as we can lets do it i i jason stammered the mists interfering infuriating him where are things what things we love each other weve found each other we can go anywhere be anyone theres nothing to stop us is there only you and me he repeated softly the mists now closing in suffocating him i know i know but ive got to think theres so much to learn so much that has to come out why is it so important it just is dont you know yes no im not sure dont ask me now if not now when when can i ask you when will it pass or will it ever stop it he suddenly roared slamming the glass down on the wooden tray i cant run i wont ive got to stay here ive got to know marie rushed to him putting her hands first on his shoulders then on his face wiping away the perspiration now youve said it can you hear yourself darling you cant run because the closer you get the more maddening it is for you and if you did run it would only get worse you wouldnt have a life youd live a nightmare i know that he reached for her face touching it looking at her do you of course but you had to say it not me she held him her head against his chest i had to force you to the funny thing is that i could run i could get on a plane with you tonight and go wherever you wanted disappear and not look back happier than ive ever been in my life but you couldnt do that what isor isnthere in paris would eat away at you until you couldnt stand it anymore thats the crazy irony my darling i could live with it but you couldnt youd just disappear asked jason what about your family your joball the people you know im neither a child nor a fool she answered quickly id cover myself somehow but i dont think id take it very seriously pd request an extended leave for medical and personal reasons emotional stress a breakdown i could always go back the department would understand peter yes she was silent for a moment we went from one relationship to another the second more important to both of us i think he was like an imperfect brother you want to succeed in spite of his flaws because underneath there was such decency im sorry im truly sorry she looked up at him you have the same decency when you do the kind of work i do decency becomes very important its not the meek who are inheriting the earth jason its the corrupters and i have an idea that the distance between corruption and killing is a very short step treadstone seventyone yes we were both right i do want them exposed i want them to pay for what theyve done and you cant run away he brushed his lips against her cheek and then her hair and held her i should throw you out he said i should tell you to get out of my life i cant do it but i know damned well i should it wouldnt make any difference if you did i wouldnt go my love the attorneys suite of offices was on the boulevard de la chapelle the booklined conference room more a stage netting than an office everything was a prop and in its place deals were made in that room not contracts as for the lawyer himself a dignified white goatee and silver pincenez above an aquiline nose could not conceal the essential graft in the man he even insisted on conversing in poor english for which at a later date he could claim to have been misunderstood marie did most of the talking bourne deferring client to adviser she made her points succinctly altering the cashiers checks to bearer bonds payable in dollars in denominations ranging from a maximum of twenty thousand dollars to a minimum of five she instructed the lawyer to tell the bank that all series were to be broken up numerically in threes the international guarantors changed with every fifth lot of certificates her objective was not lost on the attorney she so complicated the issuing of the bonds that tracing them would be beyond the facilities of most banks or brokers nor would such banks or brokers take on the added trouble or expense payments were guaranteed when the irritated goateed lawyer had nearly concluded his telephone conversation with an equally disturbed antoine damacourt marie held up her hand pardon me but monsieur bourne insists that monsieur damacourt also include two hundred thousand francs in cash one hundred thousand to be included with the bonds and one hundred to be held by monsieur damacourt he suggests that the second hundred thousand be divided as follows seventyfive thousand for monsieur damacourt and twentyfive thousand for yourself he realizes that he is greatly in debt to both of you for your advice and the additional trouble he has caused you needless to say no specific record of breakdown is required irritation and disturbance vanished with her words replaced by an obsequiousness not seen since the court of versailles the arrangements were made in accordance with the unusualbut completely understandabledemands of monsieur bourne and his esteemed adviser a leather attaché case was provided by monsieur bourne for the bonds and the money it would be carried by an armed courier who would leave the bank at in the afternoon and meet monsieur bourne at on the pont neuf the distinguished client would identify himself with a small piece of leather cut from the shell of the case and which when fitted in place would prove to be the missing fragment added to this would be the words herr koenig sends greeting from zurich so much for the details except for one which was made clear by monsieur bournes adviser we recognize that the demands of the fiche must be carried out to the letter and fully expect monsieur damacourt to do so said marie st jacques however we also recognize that the timing can be advantageous to monsieur bourne and would expect no less than that advantage were he not to have it im afraid that i as a certifiedif for the present anonymousmember of the international banking commission would feel compelled to report certain aberrations of banking and legal procedures as i have witnessed them im sure that wont be necessary were all very well paid nestce pas monsieur cest vrai madame in banking and law indeed as in life itself timing is everything you have nothing to fear i know said marie bourne examined the grooves of the silencer satisfied that he had removed the particles of dust and lint that had gathered with nonuse he gave it a final wrenching turn depressed the magazine release and checked the clip six shells remained he was ready he shoved the weapon into his belt and buttoned his jacket marie had not seen him with the gun she was sitting on the bed her back to him talking on the telephone with the canadian embassy attaché dennis corbelier cigarette smoke curled up from an ashtray next to her notebook she was writing down corbeliers information when he had finished she thanked him and hung up the phone she remained motionless for two or three seconds the pencil still in her hand he doesnt know about peter she said turning to jason thats odd very agreed bourne i thought hed be one of the first to know you said they looked over peters telephone logs hed placed a call to paris to corbelier youd think someone would have followed up on it i hadnt even considered that i was thinking about the newspapers the wire services peter was was found eighteen hours ago and regardless of how casual i may have sounded he was an important man in the canadian government his death would be news in itself his murder infinitely more so it wasnt reported call ottawa tonight find out why i will what did corbelier tell you oh yes marie shifted her eyes to the notebook the license in rue madeleine was meaningless a car rented at de gaulle airport to a jeanpierre larousse john smith interrupted jason exactly he had better luck with the telephone number damacourt gave you but he cant see what it could possibly have to do with anything neither can i as a matter of fact its that strange i think so its a private line belonging to a fashion house on sainthonoré les classiques a fashion house you mean a studio im sure its got one but its essentially an elegant dress shop like the house of dior or givenchy haute couture in the trade corbelier said its known as the house of rené thats bergeron who rené bergeron a designer hes been around for years always on the fringes of a major success i know about him because my little lady back home copies his designs did you get the address marie nodded why didnt corbelier know about peter why doesnt everybody maybe youll learn when you call its probably as simple as time zones too late for the morning editions here in paris ill pick up the afternoon paper bourne went to the closet for his topcoat conscious of the hidden weight in his belt im going back to the bank ill follow the courier to the pont neuf he put on the coat aware that marie was not listening i meant to ask you do these fellows wear uniforms who bank couriers that would account for the newspapers not the wire services i beg your pardon the difference in time the papers might not have picked it up but the wire services would have known and embassies have teletypes they would have known about it it wasnt reported jason youll call tonight he said im going you asked about the couriers do they wear uniforms i was curious most of the time yes they also drive armored vans but i was specific about that if a van was used it was to be parked a block from the bridge the courier to proceed on foot i heard you but i wasnt sure what you meant why a bonded couriers bad enough but hes necessary bank insurance requires him a van is simply too obvious it could be followed too easily you wont change your mind and let me go with you no believe me nothing will go wrong those two thieves wouldnt permit it then theres no reason for you to be there youre maddening im in a hurry i know and you move faster without me marie got up and came to him i do understand she leaned into him kissing him on the lips suddenly aware of the weapon in his belt she looked into his eyes you are worried arent you just cautious he smiled touching her chin its an awful lot of money it may have to keep us for a long time i like the sound of that the money no us marie frowned a safety deposit box you keep talking in non sequiturs you cant leave negotiable certificates worth over a million dollars in a paris hotel room youve got to get a deposit box we can do it tomorrow he released her turning for the door while im out look up les classiques in the phone book and call the regular number find out how late its open he left quickly bourne sat in the back seat of a stationary taxi watching the front of the bank through the windshield the driver was humming an unrecognizable tune reading a newspaper content with the fiftyfranc note he had received in advance the cabs motor however was running the passenger had insisted upon that the armored van loomed in the right rear window its radio antenna shooting up from the center of the roof like a tapered bowsprit it parked in a space reserved for authorized vehicles directly in front of jasons taxi two small red lights appeared above the circle of bulletproof glass in the rear door the alarm system had been activated bourne leaned forward his eyes on the uniformed man who climbed out of the side door and threaded his way through the crowds on the pavement toward the entrance of the bank he felt a sense of relief the man was not one of the three welldressed men who had come to the valois yesterday fifteen minutes later the courier emerged from the bank the leather attaché case in his left hand his right covering an unlatched holster the jagged rip on the side of the case could be seen clearly jason felt the fragment of leather in his shirt pocket if nothing else it was the primitive combination that made a life beyond paris beyond carlos possible if there was such a life and he could accept it without the terrible labyrinth from which he could find no escape but it was more than that in a manmade labyrinth one kept moving running careening off walls the contact itself a form of progress if only blind his personal labyrinth had no walls no defined corridors through which to race only space and swirling mists in the darkness that he saw so clearly when he opened his eyes at night and felt the sweat pouring down his face why was it always space and darkness and high winds why was he always plummeting through the air at night a parachute why then other words came to him he had no idea where they were from but they were there and he heard them whats left when your memorys gone and your identity mr smith stop it the armored van swung into the traffic on rue madeleine bourne tapped the driver on the shoulder follow that truck but keep at least two cars between us he said in french the driver turned alarmed i think you have the wrong taxi monsieur take back your money im with the armoredcar company you imbecile its a special assignment regrets monsieur we will not lose it the driver plunged diagonally forward into the combat of traffic the van took the quickest route to the seine going down sidestreets turning left on the quai de la rapée toward the pont neuf then within what jason judged to be three or four blocks of the bridge it slowed down hugging the curb as if the courier had decided he was too early for his appointment but if anything bourne thought he was running late it was six minutes to three barely enough time for the man to park and walk the one prescribed block to the bridge then why had the van slowed down slowed down no it had stopped it wasnt moving why the traffic good god of coursethe traffic stop here said bourne to the driver pull over to the curb quickly what is it monsieur youre a very fortunate man said jason my company is willing to pay you an additional one hundred francs if you simply go to the front window of that van and say a few words to the driver what monsieur frankly were testing him hes new do you want the hundred i just go to the window and say a few words thats all five seconds at the most then you can go back to your taxi and drive off theres no trouble i dont want trouble my firms among the most respectable in france youve seen our trucks everywhere i dont know forget it bourne reached for the door handle what are the words jason held out the hundred francs just these herr koenig greetings from zurich can you remember those koenig greetings from zurich whats so difficult you behind me thats right they walked rapidly toward the van hugging the right side of their small alley in the traffic as cars and trucks passed them in starts and stops on their left the van was carlos trap thought bourne the assassin had bought his way into the ranks of the armed couriers a single name and a rendezvous revealed over a monitored radio frequency could bring an underpaid messenger a great deal of money bourne pont neuf so simple this particular courier was less concerned with being prompt than in making sure the soldiers of carlos reached the pont neuf in time paris traffic was notorious anyone could be late jason stopped the taxi driver holding in his hand four additional twohundred franc notes the mans eyes were riveted on them monsieur my companys going to be very generous this man must be disciplined for gross infractions what monsieur after you say herr koenig greetings from zurich simply add the schedules changed theres a fare in my taxi who must see you have you got that the drivers eyes returned to the franc notes whats difficult he took the money they edged their way along the side of the van jasons back pressed against the wall of steel his right hand concealed beneath his topcoat gripping the gun in his belt the driver approached the window and reached up tapping the glass you inside herr koenig greetings from zurich he yelled the window was rolled down no more than an inch or two what is this a voice yelled back youre supposed to be at the pont neuf monsieur the driver was no idiot he was also anxious to leave as rapidly as possible not me you jackass he shouted through the din of the surrounding perilously close traffic im telling you what i was told to say the schedules been changed theres a man back there who says he has to see you tell him to hurry said jason holding a final fiftyfranc note in his hand beyond sight of the window the driver glanced at the money then back up at the courier be quick about it if you dont see him right away youll lose your job now get out of here said bourne the driver turned and ran past jason grabbing the franc note as he raced back to his taxi bourne held his place suddenly alarmed by what he heard through the cacophony of pounding horns and gunning engines in the crowded street there were voices from inside the van not one man shouting into a radio but two shouting at each other the courier was not alone there was another man with him those were the words you heard them he was to come up to you he was to show himself which he will do and present the piece of leather which must fit exactly do you expect him to do that in the middle of a street filled with traffic i dont like it you paid me to help you and your people find someone not to lose my job im going it must be the pont neuf kiss my ass there was the sound of heavy footsteps on the metal floorboards im coming with you the panel door opened jason spun behind it his hand still under his coat below him a childs face was pressed against the glass of a car window the eyes squinting the young features contorted into an ugly mask fright and insult the childish intent the swelling sound of angry horns blaring in counterpoint filled the street the traffic had come to a standstill the courier stepped off the metal ledge the attaché case in his left hand bourne was ready the instant the courier was on the street he slammed the panel back into the body of the second man crashing the heavy steel into a descending kneecap and an outstretched hand the man screamed reeling backward inside the van jason shouted at the courier the jagged scrap of leather in his free hand im bourne heres your fragment and you keep that gun in its holster or you wont just lose your job youll lose your life you son of a bitch i meant no harm monsieur they wanted to find you they have no interest in your delivery you have my word on it the door crashed open jason slammed it again with his shoulder then pulled it back to see the face of carlos soldier his hand on the weapon in his belt what he saw was the barrel of a gun the black orifice of its opening staring him in the eyes he spun back aware that the splitsecond delay in the gunshot that followed was caused by the burst of a shrill ringing that exploded out of the armored van the alarm had been tripped the sound deafening riding over the dissonance in the street the gunshot seemed muted by comparison the eruption of asphalt below not heard once more jason hammered the panel he heard the impact of metal against metal he had made contact with the gun of carlos soldier he pulled his own from his belt dropped to his knees in the street and pulled the door open he saw the face from zurich the killer they had called johann the man they had brought to paris to recognize him bourne fired twice the man arched backward blood spreading across his forehead the courier the attaché case jason saw the man he had ducked below the tailgate for protection his weapon in his hand screaming for help bourne leaped to his feet and lunged for the extended gun gripping the barrel twisting it out of the couriers hand he grabbed the attaché case and shouted no harm right give me that you bastard he threw the mans gun under the van got up and plunged into the hysterical crowds on the pavement he ran wildly blindly the bodies in front of him the movable walls of his labyrinth but there was an essential difference between this gauntlet and one he lived in every day there was no darkness the afternoon sun was bright as blinding as his race through the labyrinth everything is here said marie she had collated the certificates by denominations the stacks and the franc notes on the desk i told you it would be it almost wasnt what the man they called johann the one from zurich hes dead i killed him jason what happened he told her they counted on the pont neuf he said my guess is that the backup car got caught in traffic broke into the couriers radio frequency and told them to delay im sure of it oh god theyre everywhere but they dont know where i am said bourne looking into the mirror above the bureau studying his blond hair while putting on the tortoiseshell glasses and the last place theyd expect to find me at this momentif they conceivably thought i knew about itwould be a fashion house on sainthonoré les classiques asked marie astonished thats right did you call it yes but thats insane why jason turned from the mirror think about it twenty minutes ago their trap fell apart theres got to be confusion recriminations accusations of incompetency or worse right now at this moment theyre more concerned with each other than with me nobody wants a bullet in his throat it wont last long theyll regroup quickly carlos will make sure of that but during the next hour or so while theyre trying to piece together what happened the one place they wont look for me is a relaydrop they havent the vaguest idea im aware of someone will recognize you who they brought in a man from zurich to do that and hes dead theyre not sure what i look like the courier theyll take him he saw you for the next few hours hell be busy with the police damacourt the lawyer i suspect theyre halfway to normandy or marseilles or if theyre lucky out of the country suppose theyre stopped caught suppose they are do you think carlos would expose a drop where he gets messages not on your life or his jason im frightened so am i but not of being recognized bourne returned to the mirror i could give a long dissertation about facial classifications and softened features but i wont youre talking about the evidences of surgery port noir you told me not all of it bourne leaned against the bureau staring at his face what color are my eyes what no dont look at me now tell me what color are my eyes yours are brown with speckles of green what about mine blue bluish or a kind of gray really marie stopped im not really sure i suppose thats dreadful of me its perfectly natural basically theyre hazel but not all the time even ive noticed it when i wear a blue shirt or tie they become bluer a brown coat or jacket theyre gray when im naked theyre strangely nondescript thats not so strange im sure millions of people are the same im sure they are but how many of them wear contact lenses when their eyesight is normal contact thats what i said interrupted jason certain types of contact lenses are worn to change the color of the eyes theyre most effective when the eyes are hazel when washburn first examined me there was evidence of prolonged usage its one of the clues isnt it its whatever you want to make of it said marie if its true why wouldnt it be because the doctor was more often drunk than sober youve told me that he piled conjecture on top of conjecture heaven knows how warped by alcohol he was never specific he couldnt be he was about one thing im a chameleon designed to fit a flexible mold i want to find out whose maybe i can now thanks to you ive got an address someone there may know the truth just one man thats all i need one person i can confront break if i have to i cant stop you but for gods sake be careful if they do recognize you theyll kill you not there they wont itd be rotten for business this is paris i dont think thats funny jason neither do i im counting on it very seriously what are you going to do i mean how ill know better when i get there see if anyones running around looking nervous or anxious or waiting for a phone call as if his life depended on it then what ill do the same as i did with damacourt wait outside and follow whoever it is im this close i wont miss and ill be careful will you call me ill try i may go crazy waiting not knowing dont wait can you deposit the bonds somewhere the banks are closed use a large hotel hotels have vaults you have to have a room take one at the meurice or the george cinq leave the case at the desk but come back here marie nodded it would give me something to do then call ottawa find out what happened i will bourne crossed to the bedside table and picked up a number of fivethousand franc notes a bribe would be easier he said i dont think itll happen but it could it could agreed marie and then in the same breath continued did you hear yourself you just rattled off the names of two hotels i heard he turned and faced her ive been here before many times i lived here but not in those hotels in outoftheway streets i think not very easily found the moment passed in silence the fear electric i love you jason i love you too said bourne come back to me no matter what happens come back to me the lighting was soft and dramatic pinpoint spotlights shining down from the dark brown ceiling bathing manikins and expensively dressed clients in pools of flattering yellows the jewelry and accessories counters were lined with black velvet silks of bright red and green tastefully flowing above the midnight sheen glistening eruptions of gold and silver caught in the recessed frame lights the aisles curved graciously in semicircles giving an illusion of space that was not there for les classiques though hardly small was not a large emporium it was however a beautifully appointed store on one of the most costly strips of real estate in paris fitting rooms with doors of tinted glass were at the rear beneath a balcony where the offices of management were located a carpeted staircase rose on the right beside an elevated switchboard in front of which sat an oddly outofplace middleaged man dressed in a conservative business suit operating the console speaking into a mouthpiece that was an extension of his single earphone the clerks were mostly women tall slender gaunt of face and body living postmortems of former fashion models whose tastes and intelligence had carried them beyond their sisters in the trade other practices no longer feasible the few men in evidence were also slender reedlike figures emphasized by formfitting clothes gestures rapid stances balletically defiant light romantic music floated out of the dark ceiling quiet crescendos abstractly punctuated by the beams of the miniature spotlights jason wandered through the aisles studying manikins touching the fabric making his own appraisals they covered his essential bewilderment where was the confusion the anxiety he expected to find at the core of carlos message center he glanced up at the open office doors and the single corridor that bisected the small complex men and women walked casually about as they did on the main floor every now and then stopping one another exchanging pleasantries or scraps of relevantly irrelevant information gossip nowhere was there the slightest sense of urgency no sign at all that a vital trap had exploded in their faces an imported killerthe only man in paris who worked for carlos and could identify the targetshot in the head dead in the back of an armored van on the quai de la rapée it was incredible if only because the whole atmosphere was the opposite of what he had anticipated not that he expected to find chaos far from it the soldiers of carlos were too controlled for that still he had expected something and here there were no strained faces or darting eyes no abrupt movements that signified alarm nothing whatsoever was unusual the elegant world of haute couture continued to spin in its elegant orbit unmindful of events that should have thrown its axis off balance still there was a private telephone somewhere and someone who not only spoke for carlos but was also empowered to set in motion three killers on the hunt a woman he saw her it had to be her halfway down the carpeted staircase a tall imperious woman with a face that age and cosmetics had rendered into a cold mask of itself she was stopped by a reedlike male clerk who held out a salesbook for the womans approval she looked at it then glanced down at the floor at a nervous middleaged man by a nearby jewelry counter the glance was brief but pointed the message clear all right mon ami pick up your bauble but pay your bill soon otherwise you could be embarrassed next time or worse i might call your wife in milliseconds the rebuke was over a smile as false as it was broad cracked the mask and with a nod and a flourish the woman took a pencil from the clerk and initialed the sales slip she continued down the staircase the clerk following leaning forward in further conversation it was obvious he was flattering her she turned on thebottom step touching her crown of streaked dark hair and tapped his wrist in a gesture of thanks there was little placidity in the womans eyes they were as aware as any pair of eyes bourne had ever seen except perhaps behind goldrimmed glasses in zurich instinct she was his objective it remained how to reach her the first moves of the pavane had to be subtle neither too much nor too little but warranting attention she had to come to him the next few minutes astonished jasonwhich was to say he astonished himself the term was roleplaying he understood that but what shocked him was the ease with which he slid into a character far from himselfas he knew himself where minutes before he had made appraisals he now made inspections pulling garments from their individual racks holding the fabrics up to the light he peered closely at stitchings examined buttons and buttonholes brushing his fingers across collars fluffing them up then letting them fall he was a judge of fine clothes a schooled buyer who knew what he wanted and rapidly disregarded that which did not suit his tastes the only items he did not examine were the price tags obviously they held no interest for him the fact that they did not prodded the interest of the imperious woman who kept glancing over in his direction a sales clerk her concave body floating upright on the carpet approached him he smiled courteously but said he preferred to browse by himself less than thirty seconds later he was behind three manikins each dressed in the most expensive designs to be found in les classiques he raised his eyebrows his mouth set in silent approval as he squinted between the plastic figures at the woman beyond the counter she whispered to the clerk who had spoken to him the former model shook her head shrugging bourne stood arms akimbo billowing his cheeks his breath escaping slowly as his eyes shifted from one manikin to another he was an uncertain man about to make up his mind and a potential client in that situation especially one who did not look at prices needed assistance from the most knowledgeable person in the vicinity he was irresistible the regal woman touched her hair and gracefully negotiated the aisles toward him the pavane had come to its first conclusion the dancers bowed preparing for the gavotte i see youve gravitated to our better items monsieur said the woman in english a presumption obviously based on the judgment of a practiced eye i trust i have replied jason youve got an interesting collection here but one does have to ferret doesnt one the everpresent and inevitable scale of values monsieur however all our designs are exclusive cela va sans dire madame ah vous parlez français un peu passably you are american im rarely there said bourne you say these are made for you alone oh yes our designer is under exclusive contract im sure youve heard of him rené bergeron jason frowned yes i have very respected but hes never made a breakthrough has he he will monsieur its inevitable his reputation grows each season a number of years ago he worked for st laurent then givenchy some say he did far more than cut the patterns if you know what i mean its not hard to follow and how those cats try to push him in the background its disgraceful because he adores women he flatters them and does not make them into little boys vous comprenez je vous comprends parfaitement hell emerge worldwide one day soon and theyll not be able to touch the hems of his creations think of these as the works of an emerging master monsieur youre very convincing ill take these three i assume theyre in the size twelve range fourteen monsieur they will be fitted of course im afraid not but im sure there are decent tailors in capferrat naturellement conceded the woman quickly also bourne hesitated frowning again while im here and to save time select a few others for me along these lines different prints different cuts but related if that makes sense very good sense monsieur thanks i appreciate it ive had a long flight from the bahamas and im exhausted would monsieur care to sit down then frankly monsieur would care for a drink it can be arranged of course as to the method of payment monsieur je paierai cash i think said jason aware that the exchange of merchandise for hard currency would appeal to the overseer of les classiques checks and accounts are like spoors in the forest arent they you are as wise as you are discriminating the rigid smile cracked the mask again the eyes in no way related about that drink why not my office its quite private you can relax and i shall bring you selections for your approval splendid as to the price range monsieur les meilleurs madame naturellement a thin white hand was extended i am jacqueline lavier managing partner of les classiques thank you bourne took the hand without offering a name one might follow in less public surroundings his expression said but not at the moment for the moment money was his introduction your office mines several thousand miles from here this way monsieur the rigid smile appeared once more breaking the facial mask like a sheet of progressively cracked ice madame lavier gestured toward the staircase the world of haute couture continued its orbit uninterrupted by failure and death on the quai de la rapée that lack of interruption was as disturbing to jason as it was bewildering he was convinced the woman walking beside him was the carrier of lethal commands that had been aborted by gunfire an hour ago the orders having been issued by a faceless man who demanded obedience or death yet there was not the slightest indication that a strand of her perfectly groomed hair had been disturbed by nervous fingers no pallor on the chiseled mask that might be taken for fear yet there was no one higher at les classiques no one else who would have a private number in a very private office part of an equation was missing but another had been disturbingly confirmed himself the chameleon the charade had worked he was in the enemys camp convinced beyond doubt that he had not been recognized the whole episode had a déjà vu quality about it he had done such things before experienced the feelings of similar accomplishment before he was a man running through an unfamiliar jungle yet somehow instinctively knowing his way sure of where the traps were and how to avoid them the chameleon was an expert they reached the staircase and started up the steps below on the right the conservatively dressed middleaged operator was speaking quietly into the extended mouthpiece nodding his grayhaired head almost wearily as if assuring the party on the line that their world was as serene as it should be bourne stopped on the seventh step the pause involuntary the back of the mans head the outline of the cheekbone the sight of the thinning gray hairthe way it fell slightly over the ear he had seen that man before somewhere in the past in the unremembered past but remembered now in darkness and with flashes of light explosions mists buffeting winds followed by silences filled with tension what was it where was it why did the pain come to his eyes again the grayhaired man began to turn in his swivel chair jason looked away before they made contact i see monsieur is taken by our rather unique switchboard said madame lavier its a distinction we feel sets les classiques apart from the other shops on sainthonoré how so asked bourne as they proceeded up the steps the pain in his eyes causing him to blink when a client calls les classiques the telephone is not answered by a vacuous female but instead by a cultured gentleman who has all our information at his fingertips a nice touch other gentlemen think so she added especially when making telephone purchases they would prefer to keep confidential there are no spoors in our forest monsieur they reached jacqueline laviers spacious office it was the lair of an efficient executive scores of papers in separate piles on the desk an easel against the wall holding watercolor sketches some boldly initialed others left untouched obviously unacceptable the walls were filled with framed photographs of the beautiful people their beauty too often marred by gaping mouths and smiles as false as the one on the mask of the inhabitant of the office there was a bitch quality in the perfumed air these were the quarters of an aging pacing tigress swift to attack any who threatened her possessions or the sating of her appetites yet she was disciplined all things considered an estimable liaison to carlos who was that man on the switchboard where had he seen him he was offered a drink from a selection of bottles he chose brandy do sit down monsieur i shall enlist the help of rené himself if i can find him thats very kind but im sure whatever you choose will be satisfactory i have an instinct about taste yours is all through this office im comfortable with it youre too generous only when its warranted said jason still standing actually id like to look around at the photographs i see a number of acquaintances if not friends a lot of these faces pass through the bahamian banks with considerable frequency im sure they do agreed lavier in a tone that bespoke regard for such avenues of finance i shant be long monsieur nor would she thought bourne as les classiques partner swept out of the office mme lavier was not about to allow a tired wealthy mark too much time to think she would return with the most expensive designs she could gather up as rapidly as possible therefore if there was anything in the room that could shed light on carlos intermediaryor on the assassins operationit had to be found quickly and if it was there it would be on or around the desk jason circled behind the imperial chair in front of the wall feigning amused interest in the photographs but concentrating on the desk there were invoices receipts and overdue bills along with dunning letters of reprimand awaiting laviers signature an address book lay open four names on the page he moved closer to see more clearly each was the name of a company the individual contacts bracketed his or her positions underlined he wondered if he should memorize each company each contact he was about to do so when his eyes fell on the edge of an index card it was only the edge the rest was concealed under the telephone itself and there was something elsedull barely discernible a strip of transparent tape running along the edge of the card holding it in place the tape itself was relatively new recently stuck over the heavy paper and the gleaming wood it was clean no smudges or coiled borders or signs of having been there very long instinct bourne picked up the telephone to move it aside it rang the bell vibrating through his hand the shrill sound unnerving he replaced it on the desk and stepped away as a man in shirtsleeves rushed through the open door from the corridor he stopped staring at bourne his eyes alarmed but noncommittal the telephone rang a second time the man walked rapidly to the desk and picked up the receiver allô there was silence as the intruder listened head down concentration on the caller he was a tanned muscular man of indeterminate age the sundrenched skin disguising the years his face was taut his lips thin his closecropped hair thick dark brown and disciplined the sinews of his bare arms moved under the flesh as he transferred the phone from one hand to the other speaking harshly pas ici sais pas téléphonez plus tard he hung up and looked at jason où est jacqueline a little slower please said bourne lying in english my french is limited sorry replied the bronzed man i was looking for madame lavier the owner the title will suffice where is she depleting my funds jason smiled raising his glass to his lips oh and who are you monsieur who are you the man studied bourne rené bergeron oh lord exclaimed jason shes looking for you youre very good mr bergeron she said i was to look upon your designs as the work of an emerging master bourne smiled again youre the reason i may have to wire the bahamas for a great deal of money youre most kind monsieur and i apologize for barging in better that you answered that phone than me berlitz considers me a failure buyers suppliers all screaming idiots to whom monsieur do i have the honor of speaking briggs said jason having no idea where the name came from astonished that it came so quickly so naturally charles briggs a pleasure to know you bergeron extended his hand the grip was firm you say jacqueline was looking for me on my behalf im afraid i shall find her the designer left quickly bourne stepped to the desk his eyes on the door his hand on the telephone he moved it to the side exposing the index card there were two telephone numbers the first recognizable as a zurich exchange the second obviously paris instinct he had been right a strip of transparent tape the only sign he had needed he stared at the numbers memorizing them then moved the telephone back in place and stepped away he had barely managed to clear the desk when madame lavier swept back into the room a half dozen dresses over her arm i met rené on the steps he approves of my selections most enthusiastically he also tells me your name is briggs monsieur i would have told you myself said bourne smiling back countering the pout in laviers voice but i dont think you asked spoors in the forest monsieur here i bring you a feast she separated the dresses placing them carefully over several chairs i truly believe these are among the finest creations rené has brought us brought you he doesnt work here then a figure of speech his studios at the end of the corridor but it is a holy sacristy even i tremble when i enter theyre magnificent continued bourne going from one to another but i dont want to overwhelm her just pacify her he added pointing out three garments ill take these a fine selection monsieur briggs box them with the others if you will of course she is indeed a fortunate lady a good companion but a child a spoiled child im afraid however ire been away a lot and havent paid much attention to her so i guess i should make peace its one reason i sent her to capferrat he smiled taking out his louis vuitton billfold la facture siil vous plaît ill have one of the girls expedite everything madame lavier pressed a button on the intercom next to the telephone jason watched closely prepared to comment on the call bergeron had answered in the event the womans eyes settled on a slightly outofplace phone faites venir janine avec les robes la facture aussi she stood up another brandy monsieur briggs merci bien bourne extended his glass she took it and walked to the bar jason knew the time had not yet arrived for what he had in mind it would come soonas soon as he parted with moneybut not now he could however continue building a foundation with the managing partner of les classiques that fellow bergeron he said you say hes under exclusive contract to you madame lavier turned the glass in her hand oh yes we are a closely knit family here bourne accepted the brandy nodded his thanks and sat down in an armchair in front of the desk thats a constructive arrangement he said pointlessly the tall gaunt clerk he had first spoken with came into the office a salesbook in her hand instructions were given rapidly figures entered the garments gathered and separated as the salesbook exchanged hands lavier held it out for jasons perusal voici la facture monsieur she said bourne shook his head dismissing inspection combien he asked vingtmille soixante francs monsieur answered the les classiques partner watching his reaction with the expression of a very large wary bird there was none jason merely removed five fivethousandfranc notes and handed them to her she nodded and gave them in turn to the slender salesclerk who walked cadaverously out of the office with the dresses everything will be packaged and brought up here with your change lavier went to her desk and sat down youre on your way to ferrat then it should be lovely he had paid the time had come a last night in paris before i go back to kindergarten said jason raising his glass in a toast of selfmockery yes you mentioned that your friend is quite young a child is what i said and thats what she is shes a good companion but i think i prefer the company of more mature women you must be very fond of her contested lavier touching her perfectly coiffed hair the flattery accepted you buy her such lovelyand franklyvery expensive things a minor price considering what she might try to opt for really shes my wife my third to be exact and there are appearances to be kept up in the bahamas but all thats neither here nor there my lifes quite in order im sure it is monsieur speaking of the bahamas a thought occurred to me a few minutes ago its why i asked you about bergeron what is that you may think im impetuous i assure you im not but when something strikes me i like to explore it since bergerons yours exclusively have you ever given any thought to opening a branch in the islands the bahamas and points south into the caribbean perhaps monsieur sainthonoré by itself is often more than we can handle untended farmland generally goes fallow as they say it wouldnt have to be tended not in the way that you think a concession here one there the designs exclusive local ownership on a percentagefranchise basis just a boutique or two spreading of course cautiously that takes considerable capital monsieur briggs key prices initially what you might call entrance fees theyre high but not prohibitive in the finer hotels and clubs it usually depends on how well you know the managements and you know them extremely well as i say im just exploring but i think the idea has merit your labels would have a certain distinctionles classiques paris grand bahama caneel bay perhaps bourne swallowed the rest of his brandy but you probably think im crazy consider it just talk although ive made a dollar or two on risks that simply struck me on the spur of the moment risks jacqueline lavier touched her hair again i dont give ideas away madame i generally back them yes i understand as you say the idea does have merit i think so of course id like to see what kind of agreement you have with bergeron it could be produced monsieur tell you what said jason if youre free lets talk about it over drinks and dinner its my only night in paris and you prefer the company of more mature women concluded jacqueline lavier the mask cracked into a smile again the white ice breaking beneath eyes now more in concert cest vrai madame it can be arranged she said reaching for the phone the phone carlos he would break her thought bourne kill her if he had to he would learn the truth marie walked through the crowd toward the booth in the telephone complex on rue vaugirard she had taken a room at the meurice left the attaché case at the front desk and had sat alone in the room for exactly twentytwo minutes until she could not stand it any longer she had sat in a chair facing a blank wall thinking about jason about the madness of the last eight days that had propelled her into an insanity beyond her understanding jason considerate frightening bewildered jason bourne a man with so much violence in him and yet oddly so much compassion and too terribly capable in dealing with a world ordinary men knew nothing about where had he sprung from this love of hers who had taught him to find his way through the dark back streets of paris marseilles and zurich as far away as the orient perhaps what was the far east to him how did he know the languages what were the languages or language tao chesah tam quan another world and she knew nothing of it but she knew jason bourne or the man called jason bourne and she held on to the decency she knew was there oh god how she loved him so ilich ramirez sanchez carlos what was he to jason bourne stop it she had screamed at herself while in that room alone and then she had done what she had seen jason do so many times she had lunged up from the chair as if the physical movement would clear the mists awayor allow her to break through them canada she had to reach ottawa and find out why peters deathhis murderwas being handled so secretly so obscenely it did not make sense she objected with all her heart for peter too was a decent man and he had been killed by indecent men she would be told why or she would expose that deaththat murderherself she would scream out loud to the world that she knew and say do something and so she had left the meurice taken a cab to the rue vaugirard and placed the call to ottawa she waited now outside the booth her anger mounting an unlit cigarette creased between her fingers when the bell rang she could not take the time to crush it out it rang she opened the glass door of the booth and went inside is this you alan yes was the curt reply alan what the hell is going on peter was murdered and there hasnt been a single word in any newspaper or on any broadcast i dont think the embassy even knows its as though no one cared what are you people doing what were told to do and so will you what that was peter he was your friend listen to me alan no the interruption was harsh you listen get out of paris now take the next direct flight back here if you have any problems the embassy will clear thembut youre to talk only to the ambassador is that understood no screamed marie st jacques i dont understand peter was killed and nobody cares all youre saying is bureaucratic bullshit dont get involved for gods sake dont ever get involved stay out of it marie stay out of what thats what youre not telling me isnt it well youd better i cant alan lowered his voice i dont know im only telling you what i was told to tell you by whom you cant ask me that i am asking listen to me marie i havent been home for the past twentyfour hours ive been waiting here for the last twelve for you to call try to understand meim not suggesting you come back those are orders from your government orders without explanations thats the way it is ill say this much they want you out of there they want him isolated thats the way it is sorry alanthats not the way it is goodbye she slammed the receiver down then instantly gripped her hands to stop the trembling oh my god she loved him so and they were trying to kill him jason my jason they all want you killed why the conservatively dressed man at the switchboard snapped the red toggle that blocked the lines reducing all incoming calls to a busy signal he did so once or twice an hour if only to clear his mind and expunge the empty insanities he had been required to mouth during the past minutes the necessity to cut off all conversation usually occurred to him after a particularly tedious one he had just had it the wife of a deputy trying to conceal the outrageous price of a single purchase by breaking it up into several thus not to be so apparent to her husband enough he needed a few minutes to breathe the irony struck him it was not that many years ago when others sat in front of switchboards for him at his companies in saigon and in the communications room of his vast plantation in the mekong delta and here he was now in front of someone elses switchboard in the perfumed surroundings of sainthonoré the english poet said it best there were more preposterous vicissitudes in life than a single philosophy could conjure he heard laughter on the staircase and looked up jacqueline was leaving early no doubt with one of her celebrated and fully bankrolled acquaintances there was no question about it jacqueline had a talent for removing gold from a wellguarded mine even diamonds from de beers he could not see the man with her he was on the other side of jacqueline his head oddly turned away then for an instant he did see him their eyes made contact it was brief and explosive the grayhaired switchboard operator suddenly could not breathe he was suspended in a moment of disbelief staring at a face a head he had not seen in years and then almost always in darkness for they had worked at night died at night oh my godit was him from the livingdyingnightmares thousands of miles away it was him the grayhaired man rose from the switchboard as if in a trance he pulled the mouthpieceearphone off and let it drop to the floor it clattered as the board lit up with incoming calls that made no connections answered only with discordant hums he stepped off the platform and sidestepped his way quickly toward the aisle to get a better look at jacqueline lavier and the ghost that was her escort the ghost who was a killerabove all men he had ever known a killer they said it might happen but he had never believed them he believed them now it was the man he saw them both clearly saw him they were walking down the center aisle toward the entrance he had to stop them stop her but to rush out and yell would mean death a bullet in the head instantaneous they reached the doors he pulled them open ushering her out to the pavement the grayhaired man raced out from his hiding place across the intersecting aisle and down to the front window out in the street he had flagged a taxi he was opening the door motioning for jacqueline to get inside oh god she was going the middleaged man turned and ran as fast as he could toward the staircase he collided with two startled customers and a salesclerk pushing all three violently out of his way he raced up the steps across the balcony and down the corridor to the open studio door rené rené he shouted bursting inside bergeron looked up from his sketchboard astonished what is it that man with jacqueline who is he how long has he been here oh probably the american said the designer his names briggs a fatted calf hes done very well by our grosses today where did they go i didnt know they went anywhere she left with him our jacqueline retains her touch no and her good sense find them get her why he knows hell kill her what its him id swear to it that man is cain the man is cain said colonel jack manning bluntly as if he expected to be contradicted by at least three of the four civilians at the pentagon conference table each was older than he and each considered himself more experienced none was prepared to acknowledge that the army had obtained information where his own organization had failed there was a fourth civilian but his opinion did not count he was a member of the congressional oversight committee and as such to be treated with deference but not seriously if we dont move now continued manning even at the risk of exposing everything weve learned he could slip through the nets again as of eleven days ago he was in zurich were convinced hes still there and gentlemen it is cain thats quite a statement said the balding birdlike academic from the national security council as he read the summary page concerning zurich given to each delegate at the table his name was alfred gillette an expert in personnel screening and evaluation and was considered by the pentagon to be bright vindictive and with friends in high places i find it extraordinary added peter knowlton an associate director of the central intelligence agency a man in his middle fifties who perpetuated the dressy the appearance and the attitude of an ivy leaguer of thirty years ago our sources have cain in brussels not zurich at the same timeeleven days ago our sources are rarely in error thats quite a statement said the third civilian the only one at that table manning really respected he was the oldest there a man named david abbott a former olympic swimmer whose intellect had matched his physical prowess he was in his late sixties now but his bearing was still erect his mind as sharp as it had ever been his age however betrayed by a face lined from the tensions of a lifetime he would never reveal he knew what he was talking about thought the colonel although he was currently a member of the omnipotent forty committee he had been with the cia since its origins in the oss the silent monk of covert operations had been the sobriquet given him by his colleagues in the intelligence community in my days at the agency continued abbott chuckling the sources were often as not in conflict as in agreement we have different methods of verification pressed the associate director no disrespect mr abbott but our transmissions equipment is literally instantaneous thats equipment not verification but i wont argue it seems we have a disagreement brussels or zurich the case for brussels is airtight insisted knowlton firmly lets hear it said the balding gillette adjusting his glasses we can return to the zurich summary its right in front of us also our sources have some input to offer although its not in conflict with brussels or zurich it happened some six months ago the silverhaired abbott glanced over at gillette six months ago i dont recall nsc having delivered anything about cain six months ago it wasnt totally confirmed replied gillette we try not to burden the committee with unsubstantiated data thats also quite a statement said abbott not needing to clarify congressman walters interrupted the colonel looking at the man from oversight do you have any questions before we go on hell yes drawled the congressional watchdog from the state of tennessee his intelligent eyes roaming the faces but since im new at this you go ahead so ill know where to begin very well sir said manning nodding at the cias knowlton whats this about brussels eleven days ago a man was killed in the place fontainasa covert dealer in diamonds between moscow and the west he operated through a branch of russolmaz the soviet firm in geneva that brokers all such purchases we know its one way cain converts his funds what ties the killing to cain asked the dubious gillette method first the weapon was a long needle implanted in a crowded square at noontime with surgical precision cains used it before thats quite true agreed abbott there was a rumanian in london somewhat over a year ago another only weeks before him both were narrowed to cain narrowed but not confirmed objected colonel manning they were highlevel political defectors they could have been taken by the kgb or by cain with far less risk to the soviets argued the cia man or by carlos added gillette his voice rising neither carlos nor cain is concerned about ideology theyre both for hire why is it every time theres a killing of consequence we ascribe it to cain whenever we do replied knowlton his condescension obvious its because informed sources unknown to each other have reported the same information since the informants have no knowledge of each other there could hardly be collusion its all too pat said gillette disagreeably back to brussels interrupted the colonel if it was cain why would he kill a broker from russolmaz he used him a covert broker corrected the cia director and for any number of reasons according to our informants the man was a thief and why not most of his clients were too they couldnt very well file charges he might have cheated cain and if he did itd be his last transaction or he could have been foolish enough to speculate on cains identity even a hint of that would call for the needle or perhaps cain simply wanted to bury his current traces regardless the circumstances plus the sources leave little doubt that it was cain therell be a lot more when i clarify zurich said manning may we proceed to the summary a moment please david abbott spoke casually while lighting his pipe i believe our colleague from the security council mentioned the occurrence related to cain that took place six months ago perhaps we should hear about it why asked gillette his eyes owllike beyond the lenses of his rimless glasses the time factor removes it from having any bearing on brussels or zurich i mentioned that too yes you did agreed the onceformidable monk of covert services i thought however any background might be helpful as you also said we can return to the summary its right in front of us but if its not relevant lets get on with zurich thank you mr abbott said the colonel youll note that eleven days ago four men were killed in zurich one of them was a watchman in a parking area by the limmat river it can be presumed that he was not involved in cains activities but caught in them two others were found in an alley on the west bank of the city on the surface unrelated murders except for the fourth victim hes tied in with the dead men in the alleyall three part of the zurichmunich underworldand is without question connected to cain thats chernak said gillette reading the summary at least i assume its chernak i recognize the name and associate it with the cain file somewhere you should replied manning it first appeared in a gtwo report eighteen months ago and cropped up again a year later which would make it six months ago interjected abbott softly looking at gillette yes sir continued the colonel if there was ever an example of whats called the scumoftheearth it was chernak during the war he was a czechoslovakian recruit at dachau a trilingual interrogator as brutal as any guard in the camp he sent poles slovaks and jews to the showers after torture sessions in which he extractedand manufacturedincriminating information dachaus commandants wanted to hear he went to any length to curry favor with his superiors and the most sadistic cliques were hard pressed to match his exploits what they didnt realize was that he was cataloguing theirs after the war he escaped got his legs blown off by an undetected land mine and still managed to survive very nicely on his dachau extortions cain found him and used him as a gobetween for payments on his kills now just wait a minute objected knowlton strenuously weve been over this chernak business before if you recall it was the agency that first uncovered him we would have exposed him long ago if state hadnt interceded on behalf of several powerful antisoviet officials in the bonn government you assume cains used chernak you dont know it for certain any more than we do we do now said manning seven and a half months ago we received a tip about a man who ran a restaurant called the drei alpenhäuser it was reported that he was an intermediary between cain and chernak we kept him under surveillance for weeks but nothing came of it he was a minor figure in the zurich underworld that was all we didnt stay with him long enough the colonel paused satisfied that all eyes were on him when we heard about chernaks murder we gambled five nights ago two of our men hid in the drei alpenhäuser after the restaurant closed they cornered the owner and accused him of dealing with chernak working for cain they put on a hell of a show you can imagine their shock when the man broke literally fell to his knees begging to be protected he admitted that cain was in zurich the night chernak was killed that in fact he had seen cain that night and chernak had come up in the conversation very negatively the military man paused again the silence filled by a slow soft whistle from david abbott his pipe held in front of his craglined face now that is a statement said the monk quietly why wasnt the agency informed of this tip you received seven months ago asked the cias knowlton abrasively it didnt prove out in your hands it might have been different in ours thats possible i admitted we didnt stay with him long enough manpowers limited which of us can keep up a nonproductive surveillance indefinitely we might have shared it if wed known and we could have saved you the time it took to build the brussels file if wed been told about that where did the tip come from asked gillette interrupting impatiently his eyes on manning it was anonymous you settled for that the birdlike expression on gillettes face conveyed his astonishment its one reason the initial surveillance was limited yes of course but you mean you never dug for it naturally we did replied the colonel testily apparently without much enthusiasm continued gillette angrily didnt it occur to you that someone over at langley or on the council might have helped might have filled in a gap i agree with peter we should ha ve been informed theres a reason why you werent manning breathed deeply in less military surroundings it might have been construed as a sigh the informant made it clear that if we brought in any other branch he wouldnt make contact again we felt we had to abide by that weve done it before what did you say knowlton put down the page summary and stared at the pentagon officer its nothing new peter each of us sets up his own sources protects them im aware of that its why you werent told about brussels both drones said to keep the army out silence broken by the abrasive voice of the security councils alfred gillette how often is weve done it before colonel what manning looked at gillette but was aware that david abbott was watching both of them closely id like to know how many times youve been told to keep your sources to yourself i refer to cain of course quite a few i guess you guess most of the time and you peter what about the agency weve been severely limited in terms of indepth dissemination for gods sake whats that mean the interruption came from the least expected member of the conference the congressman from oversight dont misunderstand me i havent begun yet i just want to follow the language he turned to the cia man what the hell did you just say indepth what dissemination congressman walters its throughout cains file we risked losing informants if we brought them to the attention of other intelligence units i assure you its standard it sounds like you were testtubing a heifer with about the same results added gillette no crosspollinization to corrupt the strain and conversely no crosschecking to look for patterns of inaccuracy a nice turn of phrases said abbott his craggy face wrinkled in appreciation but im not sure i understand you id say its pretty damned clear replied the man from nsc looking at colonel manning and peter knowlton the countrys two most active intelligence branches have been fed information about cainfor the past three yearsand theres been no crosspooling for origins of fraud weve simply received all information as bona fide data stored and accepted as valid well ive been around a long timeperhaps too long i concedebut theres nothing here i havent heard before said the monk sources are shrewd and defensive people they guard their contacts jealously none are in the business for charity only for profit and survival im afraid youre overlooking my point gillette removed his glasses i said before that i was alarmed so many recent assassinations have been attributed to cainattributed here to cainwhen it seems to me that the most accomplished assassin of our timeperhaps in historyhas been relegated to a comparatively minor role i think thats wrong i think carlos is the man we should be concentrating on whats happened to carlos i question your judgment alfred said the monk carlos time has passed cains moved in the old order changes theres a new and i suspect far more deadly shark in the waters i cant agree with that said the man from national security his owleyes boring into the elder statesman of the intelligence community forgive me david but it strikes me as if carlos himself were manipulating this committee to take the attention away from himself making us concentrate on a subject of much less importance were spending all our energies going after a toothless sand shark while the hammerhead roams free no ones forgetting carlos objected manning hes simply not as active as cains been perhaps said gillette icily thats exactly what carlos wants us to believe and by god we believe it can you doubt it asked abbott the record of cains accomplishments is staggering can i doubt it repeated gillette thats the question isnt it but can any of us be sure thats also a valid question we now find out that both the pentagon and the central intelligence agency have been literally operating independently of each other without even conferring as to the accuracy of their sources a custom rarely breached in this town said abbott amused again the congressman from oversight interrupted what are you trying to say mr gillette id like more information about the activities of one ilich ramirez sanchez thats carlos said the congressman i remember my reading i see thank you go on gentlemen manning spoke quickly may we get back to zurich please our recommendation is to go after cain now we can spread the word in the verbrecherwelt pull in every informer we have request the cooperation of the zurich police we cant afford to lose another day the man in zurich is cain then what was brussels the cias knowlton asked the question as much of himself as anyone at the table the method was cains the informants unequivocal what was the purpose to feed you false information obviously said gillette and before we make any dramatic moves in zurich i suggest that each of you comb the cain files and recheck every source given you have your european stations pull in every informant who so miraculously appeared to offer information i have an idea you might find something you didnt expect the fine latin hand of ramirez sanchez since youre so insistent on clarification alfred interrupted abbott why not tell us about the unconfirmed occurrence that took place six months ago we seem to be in a quagmire here it might be helpful for the first time during the conference the abrasive delegate from the national security council seemed to hesitate we received word around the middle of august from a reliable source in aixenprovence that cain was on his way to marseilles august exclaimed the colonel marseilles that was leland ambassador leland was shot in marseilles in august but cain didnt fire that rifle it was a carlos kill that was confirmed boremarkings matched with previous assassinations three descriptions of an unknown darkhaired man on the third and fourth floors of the waterfront warehouse carrying a satchel there was never any doubt that leland was murdered by carlos for christs sake roared the officer thats after the fact after the kill no matter whose there was a contract out on lelandhadnt that occurred to you if wed known about cain we might have been able to cover leland he was military property goddamn it he might be alive today unlikely replied gillette calmly leland wasnt the sort of man to live in a bunker and given his lifestyle a vague warning would have served no purpose besides had our strategy held together warning leland would have been counterproductive in what way asked the monk harshly its your fuller explanation our source was to make contact with cain during the hours of midnight and three in the morning in the rue sarrasin on august leland wasnt due until the twentyfifth as i say had it held together we would have taken cain it didnt cain never showed up and your source insisted on cooperating solely with you said abbott to the exclusion of all others yes nodded gillette trying but unable to conceal his embarrassment in our judgment the risk to leland had been eliminatedwhich in terms of cain turned out to be the truthand the odds for capture greater than theyd ever been wed finally found someone willing to come out and identify cain would any of you have handled it any other way silence this time broken by the drawl of the astute congressman from tennessee jesus christ almighty what a bunch of bullshitters silence terminated by the thoughtful voice of david abbott may i commend you sir on being the first honest man sent over from the hill the fact that you are not overwhelmed by the rarefied atmosphere of these highly classified surroundings is not lost on any of us its refreshing i dont think the congressman fully grasps the sensitivity of oh shut up peter said the monk i think the congressman wants to say something just for a bit said walters i thought you were all over twentyone i mean you look over twentyone and by then youre supposed to know better youre supposed to be able to hold intelligent conversations exchange information while respecting confidentiality and look for common solutions instead you sound like a bunch of kids jumping on a goddamn carousel squabbling over whos going to get the cheap brass ring its a hell of a way to spend taxpayers money youre oversimplifying congressman broke in gillette youre talking about a utopian factfinding apparatus theres no such thing im talking about reasonable men sir im a lawyer and before i came up to this godforsaken circus i dealt with ascending levels of confidentiality every day of my life whats so damn new about them and whats your point asked the monk i want an explanation for over eighteen months ive sat on the house assassination subcommittee ive plowed through thousands of pages filled with hundreds of names and twice as many theories i dont think theres a suggested conspiracy or a suspected assassin im not aware of ive lived with those names and those theories for damn near two years until i didnt think there was anything left to learn id say your credentials were very impressive interrupted abbott i thought they might be its why i accepted the oversight chair i thought i could make a realistic contribution but now im not so sure im suddenly beginning to wonder what i do know why asked manning apprehensively because ive been sitting here listening to the four of you describe an operation thats been going on for three years involving networks of personnel and informants and major intelligence posts throughout europeall centered on an assassin whose list of accomplishments is staggering am i substantively correct go on replied abbott quietly holding his pipe his expression rapt whats your question who is he who the hell is this cain the silence lasted precisely five seconds during which time eyes roamed other eyes several throats were cleared and no one moved in his chair it was as if a decision were being reached without discussion evasion was to be avoided congressman efrem walters out of the hills of tennessee by way of the yale law review was not to be dismissed with facile circumlocution that dealt with the esoterica of clandestine manipulations bullshit was out david abbott put his pipe down on the table the quiet clatter his overture the less public exposure a man like cain receives the better it is for everyone thats no answer said walters but i assume its the beginning of one it is hes a professional assassinthat is a trained expert in wideranging methods of taking life that expertise is for sale neither politics nor personal motivation any concern to him whatsoever hes in business solely to make a profitand his profits escalate in direct ratio to his reputation the congressman nodded so by keeping as tight a lid as you can on that reputation youre holding back free advertising exactly there are a lot of maniacs in this world with too many real or imagined enemies who might easily gravitate to cain if they knew of him unfortunately more than we care to think about already have to date thirtyeight killings can be directly attributed to cain and some twelve to fifteen are probables thats his list of accomplishments yes and were losing the battle with each new killing his reputation spreads he was dormant for a while said knowlton of the cia for a number of months recently we thought he might have been taken himself there were several probables in which the killers themselves were eliminated we thought he might have been one of them such as asked walters a banker in madrid who funneled bribes for the europolitan corporation for government purchases in africa he was shot from a speeding car on the paseo de la castellana a chauffeurbodyguard gunned down both driver and killer for a time we believed the killer was cain i remember the incident who might have paid for it any number of companies answered gillette who wanted to sell goldplated cars and indoor plumbing to instant dictators what else who else sheik mustafa kalig in oman said colonel manning he was reported killed in an abortive coup not so continued the officer there was no attempted coup gtwo informants confirmed that kalig was unpopular but the other sheiks arent fools the coup story was a cover for an assassination that could tempt other professional killers three troublesome nonentities from the officer corps were executed to lend credence to the lie for a while we thought one of them was cain the timing corresponds to cains dormancy who would pay cain for assassinating kalig we asked ourselves that over and over again said manning the only possible answer came from a source who claimed to know but there was no way to verify it he said cain did it to prove it could be done by him oil sheiks travel with the tightest security in the world there are several dozen other incidents added knowlton probables that fall into the same pattern where highly protected figures were killed and sources came forward to implicate cain i see the congressman picked up the summary page for zurich but from what i gather you dont know who he is no two descriptions have been alike interjected abbott cains apparently a virtuoso at disguise yet people have seen him talked to him your sources the informants this man in zurich none of them may come out in the open and testify but surely youve interrogated them youve got to have come up with a composite with something weve come up with a great deal replied abbott but a consistent description isnt part of it for openers cain never lets himself be seen in daylight he holds meetings at night in dark rooms or alleyways if hes ever met more than one person at a timeas cainwe dont know about it weve been told he never stands hes always seatedin a dimly lit restaurant or a corner chair or parked car sometimes he wears heavy glasses sometimes none at all at one rendezvous he may have dark hair on another white or red or covered by a hat language were closer here said the cia director anxious to put the companys research on the table fluent english and french and several oriental dialects dialects what dialects doesnt a language come first of course its rootvietnamese viet walters leaned forward why do i get the idea that im coming to something youd rather not tell me because youre probably quite astute at crossexamination counselor abbott struck a match and lit his pipe passably alert agreed the congressman now what is it cain said gillette his eyes briefly oddly on david abbott we know where he came from where out of southeast asia answered manning as if sustaining the pain of a knife wound as far as we can gather he mastered the fringe dialects so to be understood in the hill country along the cambodian and laos border routes as well as in rural north vietnam we accept the data it fits with what operation medusa the colonel reached for a large thick manila envelope on his left he opened it and removed a single folder from among several inside he placed it in front of him thats the cain file he said nodding at the open envelope this is the medusa material the aspects of it that might in any way be relevant to cain the tennessean leaned back in his chair the trace of a sardonic smile creasing his lips you know gentlemen you slay me with your pithy titles incidentally thats a beaut its very sinister very ominous i think you fellows take a course in this kind of thing go on colonel whats this medusa manning glanced briefly at david abbott then spoke it was a clandestine outgrowth of the searchanddestroy concept designed to function behind enemy lines during the vietnam war in the late sixties and early seventies units of american french british australian and native volunteers were formed into teams to operate in territories occupied by the north vietnamese their priorities were the disruption of enemy communications and supply lines the pinpointing of prison camps and not the least the assassination of village leaders known to be cooperating with the communists as well as the enemy commanders whenever possible it was a warwithinawar broke in knowlton unfortunately racial appearances and languages made participation infinitely more dangerous than say the german and dutch undergrounds or the french resistance in world war two therefore occidental recruitment was not always as selective as it might have been there were dozens of these teams continued the colonel the personnel ranging from oldline navy chiefs who knew the coastlines to french plantation owners whose only hope for reparations lay in an american victory there were british and australian drifters whod lived in indochina for years as well as highly motivated american army and civilian intelligence career officers also inevitably there was a sizable faction of hardcore criminals in the main smugglersmen who dealt in running guns narcotics gold and diamonds throughout the entire south china sea area they were walking encyclopedias when it came to night landings and jungle routes many we employed were runaways or fugitives from the states a number welleducated all resourceful we needed their expertise thats quite a crosssection of volunteers interrupted the congressman oldline navy and army british and australian drifters french colonials and platoons of thieves how the hell did you get them to work together to each according to his greeds said gillette promises amplified the colonel guarantees of rank promotions pardons outright bonuses of cash and in a number of cases opportunities to steal funds from the operation itself you see they all had to be a little crazy we understood that we trained them secretly using codes methods of transport entrapment and killingeven weapons command saigon knew nothing about as peter mentioned the risks were incrediblecapture resulting in torture and execution the price was high and they paid it most people would have called them a collection of paranoiacs but they were geniuses where disruption and assassination were concerned especially assassination what was the price operation medusa sustained over ninety percent casualties but theres a catchamong those who didnt come back were a number who never meant to from that faction of thieves and fugitives yes some stole considerable amounts of money from medusa we think cain is one of those men why his modus operandi hes used codes traps methods of killing and transport that were developed and specialized in the medusa training then for christs sake broke in walters youve got a direct line to his identity i dont care where theyre buriedand im damn sure you dont want them made publicbut i assume records were kept they were and weve extracted them all from the clandestine archives inclusive of this material here the officer tapped the file in front of him weve studied everything put rosters under microscopes fed facts into computerseverything we could think of were no further along than when we began thats incredible said the congressman or incredibly incompetent not really protested manning look at the man look at what weve had to work with after the war cain made his reputation throughout most of east asia from as far north as tokyo down through the philippines malaysia and singapore with side trips to hong kong cambodia laos and calcutta about two and a half years ago reports began filtering in to our asian stations and embassies there was an assassin for hire his name was cain highly professional ruthless these reports started growing with alarming frequency it seemed that with every killing of note cain was involved sources would phone embassies in the middle of the night or stop attachés in the streets always with the same information it was cain cain was the one a murder in tokyo a car blown up in hong kong a narcotics caravan ambushed in the triangle a banker shot in calcutta an ambassador assassinated in moulmein a russian technician or an american businessman killed in the streets of shanghai itself cain was everywhere his name whispered by dozens of trusted informants in every vital intelligence sector yet no onenot one single person in the entire east pacific areawould come forward to give us an identification where were we to begin but by this time hadnt you established the fact that hed been with medusa asked the tennessean yes firmly then with the individual medusa dossiers damn it the colonel opened the folder he had removed from the cain file these are the casualty lists among the white occidentals who disappeared from operation medusaand when i say disappeared i mean vanished without a traceare the following seventythree americans fortysix french thirtynine and twentyfour australians and british respectively and an estimated fifty white male contacts recruited from neutrals in hanoi and trained in the fieldmost of them we never knew over two hundred and thirty possibilities how many are blind alleys whos alive whos dead even if we learned the name of every man who actually survived who is he now what is he were not even sure of cains nationality we think hes american but theres no proof cains one of the side issues contained in our constant pressure on hanoi to trace mias explained knowlton we keep recycling these names in with the division lists and theres a catch with that too added the army officer hanois counterintelligence forces broke and executed scores of medusa personnel they were aware of the operation and we never ruled out the possibility of infiltration hanoi knew the medusans werent combat troops they wore no uniforms accountability was never required walters held out his hand may i he said nodding at the stapled pages certainly the officer gave them to the congressman you understand of course that those names still remain classified as does the medusa operation itself who made that decision its an unbroken executive order from successive presidents based on the recommendation of the joint chiefs of staff it was supported by the senate armed services committee thats considerable firepower isnt it it was felt to be in the national interest said the cia man in this case i wont argue agreed walters the specter of such an operation wouldnt do much for the glory of old glory we dont train assassins much less field them he flipped through the pages and somewhere here just happens to be an assassin we trained and fielded and now cant find we believe that yes said the colonel you say he made his reputation in asia but moved to europe when about a year ago why any ideas the obvious id suggest said peter knowlton he overextended himself something went wrong and he felt threatened he was a white killer among orientals at best a dangerous concept it was time for him to move on god knows his reputation was made thered be no lack of employment in europe david abbott cleared his throat id like to offer another possibility based on something alfred said a few minutes ago the monk paused and nodded deferentially at gillette he said that we had been forced to concentrate on a toothless sand shark while the hammerhead roamed free i believe that was the phrase although my sequence may be wrong yes said the man from nsc i was referring to carlos of course its not cain we should be after its carlos of course carlos the most elusive killer in modern history a man many of us truly believe has been responsiblein one way or anotherfor the most tragic assassinations of our time you were quite right alfred and in a way i was wrong we cannot afford to forget carlos thank you said gillette im glad i made my point you did with me at any rate but you also made me think can you imagine the temptation for a man like cain operating in the steamy confines of an area rife with drifters and fugitives and regimes up to their necks in corruption how he must have envied carlos how he must have been jealous of the faster brighter more luxurious world of europe how often did he say to himself im better than carlos no matter how cold these fellows are their egos are immense i suggest he went to europe to find that better world and to dethrone carlos the pretender sir wants to take the title he wants to be champion gillette stared at the monk its an interesting theory and if i follow you interjected the congressman from oversight by tracking cain we may come up with carlos exactly im not sure i follow said the cia director annoyed why two stallions in a paddock answered walters they tangle a champion does not give up the title willingly abbott reached for his pipe he fights viciously to retain it as the congressman says we continue to track cain but we must also watch for other spoors in the forest and when and if we find cain perhaps we should hold back wait for carlos to come after him then take both added the military officer very enlightening said gillette the meeting was over the members in various stages of leaving david abbott stood with the pentagon colonel who was gathering together the pages of the medusa folder he had picked up the casualty sheets prepared to insert them may i take a look asked abbott we dont have a copy over at forty those were our instructions replied the officer handing the stapled pages to the older man i thought they came from you only three copies here at the agency and over at the council they did come from me the silent monk smiled benignly too damn many civilians in my part of town the colonel turned away to answer a question posed by the congressman from tennessee david abbott did not listen instead his eyes sped rapidly down the columns of names he was alarmed a number had been crossed out accounted for accountability was the one thing they could not allow ever where was it he was the only man in that room who knew the name and he could feel the pounding in his chest as he reached the last page the name was there bourne jason clast known station tam quan what in gods name had happened rené bergeron slammed down the telephone on his desk his voice only slightly more controlled than his gesture weve tried every café every restaurant and bistro shes ever frequented theres not a hotel in paris that has him registered said the grayhaired switchboard operator seated at a second telephone by a drafting board its been more than two hours now she could be dead if shes not she might well wish she were she can only tell him so much mused bergeron less than we could she knows nothing of the old men she knows enough shes called parc monceau shes relayed messages shes not certain to whom she knows why so does cain i can assure you and he would make a grotesque error with parc monceau the designer leaned forward his powerful forearms tensing as he locked his hands together his eyes on the grayhaired man tell me again everything you remember why are you so sure hes bourne i dont know that i said he was cain if youve described his methods accurately hes the man bourne is cain we found him through the medusa records its why you were hired then hes bourne but its not the name he used of course there were a number of men in medusa who would not permit their real names to be used for them false identities were guaranteed they had criminal records he would be one of those men why him others disappeared you disappeared i could say because he was here in sainthonoré and that should be enough but theres more much more i watched him function i was assigned to a mission he commanded it was not an experience to be forgotten nor was he that man could bewould beyour cain tell me we parachuted at night into a sector called tam quan our objective to bring out an american named webb who was being held by the viet cong we didnt know it but the odds against survival were monumental even the flight from saigon was horrendous galeforce winds at a thousand feet the aircraft vibrating as if it would fall apart still he ordered us to jump and you did his gun was pointed at our heads at each of us as we approached the hatchway we might survive the elements not a bullet in our skulls how many were there of you ten you could have taken him you didnt know him go on said bergeron concentrating immobile at the desk eight of us regrouped on the ground two we assumed had not survived the jump it was amazing that i did i was the oldest and hardly a bull but i knew the area it was why i was sent the grayhaired man paused shaking his head at the memory less than an hour later we realized it was a trap we were running like lizards through the jungle and during the nights he went out alone through the mortar explosions and the grenades to kill always coming back before dawn to force us closer and closer to the base camp i thought at the time sheer suicide why did you do it he had to give you a reason you were medusans not soldiers he said it was the only way to get out alive and there was logic to that we were far behind the lines we needed the supplies we could find at the base campif we could take it he said we had to take it we had no choice if any argued hed put a bullet in his headwe knew it on the third night we took the camp and found the man named webb more dead than alive but breathing we also found the two missing members of our team very much alive and stunned at what had happened a white man and a vietnamese theyd been paid by the cong to trap ustrap him i suspect cain yes the vietnamese saw us first and escaped cain shot the white man in the head i understand he just walked up to him and blew his head off he got you back through the lines four of us yes and the man named webb five men were killed it was during that terrible journey back that i thought i understood why the rumors might be truethat he was the highestpaid recruit in medusa in what sense he was the coldest man i ever saw the most dangerous and utterly unpredictable i thought at the time it was a strange war for him he was a savonarola but without religious principle only his own odd morality which was centered about himself all men were his enemiesthe leaders in particular and he cared not one whit for either side the middleaged man paused again his eyes on the drafting board his mind obviously thousands of miles away and back in time remember medusa was filled with diverse and desperate men many were paranoid in their hatred of communists kill a communist and christ smiledodd examples of christian teaching others such as myselfhad fortunes stolen from us by the viet minh the only path to restitution was if the americans won the war france had abandoned us at dienbienphu but there were dozens who saw that fortunes could be made from medusa pouches often contained fifty to seventyfive thousand american dollars a courier siphoning off half during ten fifteen runs could retire in singapore or kuala lumpur or set up his own narcotics network in the triangle beyond the exorbitant payand frequently the pardoning of past crimesthe opportunities were unlimited it was in this group that i placed that very strange man he was a modernday pirate in the purest sense bergeron unlocked his hands wait a minute you used the phrase a mission he commanded there were military men in medusa are you sure he wasnt an american officer american to be sure but certainly not army why he hated all aspects of the military his scorn for command saigon was in every decision he made he considered the army fools and incompetents at one point orders were radioed to us in tam quan he broke off the transmission and told a regimental general to have sex with himself he would not obey an army officer would hardly do that unless he was about to abandon his profession said the designer as paris abandoned you and you did the best you could stealing from medusa setting up your own hardly patriotic activitieswherever you could my country betrayed me before i betrayed her rené back to cain you say bourne was not the name he used what was it i dont recall as i said for many surnames were not relevant he was simply delta to me mekong no the alphabet i think alpha bravo charlie delta said bergeron pensively in english but in many operations the code word charlie was replaced by cain because charlie had become synonymous with the cong charlie became cain quite true so bourne dropped back a letter and assumed cain he could have chosen echo or foxtrot or zulu twentyodd others whats the difference whats your point he chose cain deliberately it was symbolic he wanted it clear from the beginning wanted what clear that cain would replace carlos think carlos is spanish for charlescharlie the code word cain was substituted for charliecarlos it was his intention from the start cain would replace carlos and he wanted carlos to know it does carlos of course word goes out in amsterdam and berlin geneva and lisbon london and right here in paris cain is available contracts can be made his price lower than carlos fee he erodes he constantly erodes carlos stature two matadors in the same ring there can only be one it will be carlos weve trapped the puffedup sparrow hes somewhere within two hours of sainthonoré but where no matter well find him after all he found us hell come back his ego will demand it and then the eagle will sweep down and catch the sparrow carlos will kill him the old man adjusted his single crutch under his left arm parted the black drape and stepped into the confessional booth he was not well the pallor of death was on his face and he was glad the figure in the priests habit beyond the transparent curtain could not see him clearly the assassin might not give him further work if he looked too worn to carry it out he needed work now there were only weeks remaining and he had responsibilities he spoke angelus domini angelus domini child of god came the whisper are your days comfortable they draw to an end but they are made comfortable yes i think this will be your last job for me it is of such importance however that your fee will be five times the usual i hope it will be of help to you thank you carlos you know then i know this is what you must do for it and the information must leave this world with you there can be no room for error i have always been accurate i will go to my death being accurate now die in peace old friend its easier you will go to the vietnamese embassy and ask for an attaché named phan loc when you are alone say the following words to him late march medusa the tam quan sector cain was there another also have you got that late march medusa the tam quan sector cain was there another also hell tell you when to return it will be in a matter of hours i think its time we talked about a fiche confidentielleout of zurich my god im not the man youre looking for bourne gripped the womans hand holding her in place preventing her from running into the aisles of the crowded elegant restaurant in argenteuil a few miles outside of paris the pavane was over the gavotte finished they were alone the velvet booth a cage who are you the lavier woman grimaced trying to pull her hand away the veins in the cosmeticized neck pronounced a rich american who lives in the bahamas dont you believe that i should have known she said no charges no checkonly cash you didnt even look at the bill or the prices before that its what brought you over to me i was a fool the rich always look at prices if only for the pleasure of dismissing them lavier spoke while glancing around looking for a space in the aisles a waiter she might summon escape dont said jason watching her eyes itd be foolish wed both be better off if we talked the woman stared at him the bridge of hostile silence accentuated by the hum of the large dimly lit candelabraed room and the intermittent eruptions of quiet laughter from the nearby tables i ask you again she said who are you my name isnt important settle for the one i gave you briggs its false sos larousse and thats on the lease of a rented car that picked up three killers at the valois bank they missed there they also missed this afternoon at the pont neuf he got away oh god she cried trying to break away i said dont bourne held her firmly pulling her back if i scream monsieur the powdered mask was cracked with lines of venom now the bright red lipstick defining the snarl of an aging cornered rodent ill scream louder replied jason wed both be thrown out and once outside i dont think youll be unmanageable why not talk we might learn something from each other after all were employees not employers i have nothing to say to you then ill start maybe youll change your mind he lessened his grip cautiously the tension remained on her white powdered face but it too was lessened as the pressure of his fingers was reduced she was ready to listen you paid a price in zurich we paid too obviously more than you did were after the same man we know why we want him he released her why do you she did not speak for nearly half a minute instead studying him in silence her eyes angry yet frightened bourne knew he had phrased the question accurately for jacqueline lavier not to talk to him would be a dangerous mistake it could cost her her life if subsequent questions were raised who is we she asked a company that wants its money a great deal of money he has it he did not earn it then jason knew he had to be careful he was expected to know far more than he did lets say theres a dispute how could there be either he did or he did not theres hardly a middle ground its my turn said bourne you answered a question with a question and i didnt avoid you now lets go back why do you want him why is the private telephone of one of the better shops in sainthonoré put on a fiche in zurich it was an accommodation monsieur for whom are you mad all right ill pass on that for now we think we know anyway impossible maybe maybe not so it was an accommodation to kill a man i have nothing to say yet a minute ago when i mentioned the car you tried to run thats saying something a perfectly natural reaction jacqueline lavier touched the stem of her wineglass i arranged for the rental i dont mind telling you that because theres no evidence that i did so beyond that i know nothing of what happened suddenly she gripped the glass her mask of a face a mixture of controlled fury and fear who are you people i told you a company that wants its money back youre interfering get out of paris leave this alone why should we were the injured party we want the balance sheet corrected were entitled to that youre entitled to nothing spat mme lavier the error was yours and youll pay for it error he had to be very careful it was hereright below the hard surfacethe eyes of the truth could be seen beneath the ice come off it theft isnt an error committed by the victim the error was in your choice monsieur you chose the wrong man he stole millions from zurich said jason but you know that he took millions and if you think youre going to take them from himwhich is the same as taking them from usyoure very much mistaken we want no money im glad to know it whos we i thought you said you knew i said we had an idea enough to expose a man named koenig in zurich damacourt here in paris if we decide to do that it could prove to be a major embarrassment couldnt it money embarrassment these are not issues you are consumed with stupidity all of you ill say it again get out of paris leave this alone it is not your concern any longer we dont think its yours frankly we dont think youre competent competent repeated lavier as if she did not believe what she had heard thats right have you any idea what youre saying whom youre talking about it doesnt matter unless you back off my recommendation is that we come out loud and clear mock up chargesnot traceable to us of course expose zurich the valois call in the sûreté interpol anyone and anything to create a manhunta massive manhunt you are mad and a fool not at all we have friends in very important positions well get the information first well be waiting at the right place at the right time well take him you wont take him hell disappear again cant you see that hes in paris and a network of people he cannot know are looking for him he may have escaped once twice but not a third time hes trapped now weve trapped him we dont want you to trap him thats not in our interests it was almost the moment thought bourne almost but not quite her fear had to match her anger she had to be detonated into revealing the truth heres our ultimatum and were holding you responsible for conveying it otherwise youll join koenig and damacourt call off your hunt tonight if you dont well move first thing in the morning well start shouting les classiquesll be the most popular store in sainthonoré but i dont think itll be the right people the powdered face cracked you wouldnt dare how dare you who are you to say this he paused then struck a group of people who dont care much for your carlos the lavier woman froze her eyes wide stretching the taut skin into scar tissue you do know she whispered and you think you can oppose him you think youre a match for carlos in a word yes youre insane you dont give ultimatums to carlos i just did then youre dead you raise your voice to anyone and you wont last the day he has men everywhere theyll cut you down in the street they might if they knew whom to cut down said jason you forget no one does but they know who you are and koenig and damacourt the minute we expose you youd be eliminated carlos couldnt afford you any longer but no one knows me you forget monsieur i do the least of my worries find me after the damage is done and before the decision is made regarding your own future it wont be long this is madness you come out of nowhere and talk like a madman you cannot do this are you suggesting a compromise its conceivable said jacqueline lavier anything is possible are you in a position to negotiate it im in a position to convey it far better than i can an ultimatum others will relay it to the one who decides what youre saying is what i said a few minutes ago we can talk we can talk monsieur agreed mme lavier her eyes fighting for her life then lets start with the obvious which is now the truth whats bourne to carlos why does he want him whats bourne the woman stopped venom and fear replaced by an expression of absolute shock you can ask that ill ask it again said jason hearing the pounding echoes in his chest whats bourne to carlos hes cain you know it as well as we do he was your error your choice you chose the wrong man cain he heard the name and the echoes erupted into cracks of deafening thunder and with each crack pain jolted him bolts searing one after another through his head his mind and body recoiling under the onslaught of the name cain cain the mists were there again the darkness the wind the explosions alpha bravo cain delta echo foxtrot cain delta delta cain delta cain cain is for charlie delta is for cain what is it whats wrong with you nothing bourne had slipped his right hand over his left wrist gripping it his fingers pressed into his flesh with such pressure he thought his skin might break he had to do something he had to stop the trembling lessen the noise repulse the pain he had to clear his mind the eyes of the truth were staring at him he could not look away he was there he was home and the cold made him shiver go on he said imposing a control on his voice that resulted in a whisper he could not help himself are you ill youre very pale and youre im fine he interrupted curtly i said go on whats there to tell you say it all i want to hear it from you why theres nothing you dont know you chose cain you dismissed carlos you think you can dismiss him now you were wrong then and you are wrong now i will kill you i will grab your throat and choke the breath out of you tell me for christs sake tell me at the end there is only my beginning i must know it that doesnt matter he said if you are looking for a compromiseif only to save your life tell me why we should listen why is carlos so adamant so paranoid about bourne explain it to me as if i hadnt heard it before if you dont those names that shouldnt be mentioned will be spread all over paris and youll be dead by the afternoon lavier was rigid her alabaster mask set carlos will follow cain to the ends of the earth and kill him we know that we want to know why he has to look to yourself to people like you thats meaningless you dont know who we are i dont have to i know what youve done spell it out i did you picked cain over carlosthat was your error you chose the wrong man you paid the wrong assassin the wrong assassin you were not the first but you will be the last the arrogant pretender will be killed here in paris whether there is a compromise or not we picked the wrong assassin the words floated in the elegant perfumed air of the restaurant the deafening thunder receded angry still but far away in the storm clouds the mists were clearing circles of vapor swirling around him he began to see and what he saw was the outlines of a monster not a myth but a monster another monster there were two can you doubt it asked the woman dont interfere with carlos let him take cain let him have his revenge she paused both hands slightly off the table mother rat i promise nothing but i will speak for you for the loss your people have sustained its possible only possible you understand that your contract might be honored by the one you should have chosen in the first place the one we should have chosen because we chose the wrong one you see that do you not monsieur carlos should be told that you see it perhaps only perhaps he might have sympathy for your losses if he were convinced you saw your error thats your compromise said bourne flatly struggling to find a line of thought anything is possible no good can come from your threats i can tell you that for any of us and im frank enough to include myself there would be only pointless killing and cain would stand back laughing you would lose not once but twice if thats true jason swallowed nearly choking as dry air filled the vacuum in his dry throat then ill have to explain to my people why we chose the wrong man stop it finish the statement control yourself tell me everything you know about cain to what purpose lavier put her fingers on the table her bright red nail polish ten points of a weapon if we chose the wrong man then we had the wrong information you heard he was the equal of carlos no that his fees were more reasonable his apparatus more contained and because fewer intermediaries were involved there was no possibility of a contract being traced is this not so maybe of course its so its what everyones been told and its all a lie carlos strength is in his farreaching sources of informationinfallible information in his elaborate system of reaching the right person at precisely the right moment prior to a kill sounds like too many people there were too many people in zurich too many here in paris all blind monsieur every one blind to put it plainly ive been part of the operation for a number of years meeting in one way or another dozens who have played their minor rolesnone is major i have yet to meet a single person who has ever spoken to carlos much less has any idea who he is thats carlos i want to know about cain what you know about cain stay controlled you cannot turn away look at her look at her where shall i begin with whatever comes to mind first where did he come from do not look away southeast asia of course of course oh god from the american medusa we know that medusa the winds the darkness the flashes of light the pain the pain ripped through his skull now he was not where he was but where he had been a world away in distance and time the pain oh jesus the pain tao chesah tam quan alpha bravo cain delta delta cain cain is for charlie delta is for cain what is it the woman looked frightened she was studying his face her eyes roving boring into his youre perspiring your hands are shaking are you having an attack it passes quickly jason pried his hand away from his wrist and reached for a napkin to wipe his forehead it comes with the pressures no with the pressures yes go on there isnt much time people have to be reached decisions made your life is probably one of them back to cain you say he came from the american medusa les mercenaires du diable said lavier it was the nickname given medusa by the indochina colonialswhat was left of them quite appropriate dont you think it doesnt make any difference what i think or what i know i want to hear what you think what you know about cain your attack makes you rude my impatience makes me impatient you say we chose the wrong man if we did we had the wrong information les mercenaires du diable are you implying that cain is french not at all you test me poorly i mentioned that only to indicate how deeply we penetrated medusa we being the people who work for carlos you could say that i will say that if cains not french what is he undoubtedly american oh god why everything he does has the ring of american audacity he pushes and shoves with little or no finesse taking credit where none is his claiming kills when he had nothing to do with them he had studied carlos methods and connections like no other man alive were told he recites them with total recall to potential clients more often than not putting himself in carlos place convincing fools that it was he not carlos who accepted and fulfilled the contracts lavier paused ive struck a chord no he did the same with youyour peopleyes perhaps jason reached for his own wrist again as the statements came back to him statements made in response to clues in a dreadful game stuttgart regensburg munich two kills and a kidnapping baader accreditation fees from u s sources teheran eight kills divided accreditationkhomeini and plo fee two million southwest soviet sector paris all contracts will be processed through paris whose contracts sanchez carlos always such a transparent device the lavier woman had spoken he had not heard her what did you say you were remembering yes he used the same device with youyour people its how he gets his assignments assignments bourne tensed the muscles in his stomach until the pain brought him back to the table in the candelabraed dining room in argenteuil he gets assignments then he said pointlessly and carries them out with considerable expertise no one denies him that his record of kills is impressive in many ways he is second to carlosnot his equal but far above the ranks of les guérilleros hes a man of immense skill extremely inventive a trained lethal weapon out of medusa but it is his arrogance his lies at the expense of carlos that will bring him down and that makes him american or is it your bias i have an idea you like american money but thats about all they export that you do like immense skill extremely inventive a trained lethal weapon port noir la ciotat marseilles zurich paris it is beyond prejudice monsieur the identification is positive how did you get it lavier touched the stem of her wineglass her redtipped index finger curling around it a discontented man was bought in washington washington the americans also look for cainwith an intensity approaching carlos i suspect medusa has never been made public and cain might prove to be an extraordinary embarrassment this discontented man was in a position to give us a great deal of information including the medusa records it was a simple matter to match the names with those in zurich simple for carlos not for anyone else too simple thought jason not knowing why the thought struck him i see he said and you how did you find him not cain of course but bourne through the mists of anxiety jason recalled another statement not his but one spoken by marie far simpler he said we paid the money to him by means of a shortfall deposit into one account the surplus diverted blindly into another the numbers could be traced its a tax device cain permitted it he didnt know it the numbers were paid for as you paid for different numberstelephone numberson a fiche i commend you its not required but everything you know about cain is all youve done so far is explain an identification now go on everything you know about this man bourne everything youve been told be careful take the tension from your voice you are merely evaluating data marie you said that dear dear marie thank god youre not here what we know about him is incomplete hes managed to remove most of the vital records a lesson he undoubtedly learned from carlos but not all weve pieced together a sketch before he was recruited into medusa he supposedly was a frenchspeaking businessman living in singapore representing a collective of american importers from new york to california the truth is he had been dismissed by the collective which then tried to have him extradited back to the states for prosecution he had stolen hundreds of thousands from it he was known in singapore as a reclusive figure very powerful in contraband operations and extraordinarily ruthless before that interrupted jason feeling again the perspiration breaking out on his hairline before singapore where did he come from be careful the images he could see the streets of singapore prince edward road kim chuan boon tat street maxwell cuscaden those are the records no one can find there are only rumors and they are meaningless for example it was said that he was a defrocked jesuit gone mad another speculation was that he had been a young aggressive investment banker caught embezzling funds in concert with several singapore banks theres nothing concrete nothing that can be traced before singapore nothing youre wrong there was a great deal but none of that is part of it there is a void and it must be filled and you cant help me perhaps no one can perhaps no one should so far you havent told me anything startling said bourne nothing relative to the information im interested in then i dont know what you wan you ask me questions press for details and when i offer you answers you reject them as immaterial what do you want what do you know about cains work since youre looking for a compromise give me a reason for it if our information differs it would be over what hes done wouldnt it when did he first come to your attention carlos attention quickly two years ago said mme lavier disconcerted by jasons impatience annoyed frightened word came out of asia of a white man offering a service astonishingly similar to the one provided by carlos he was swiftly becoming an industry an ambassador was assassinated in moulmein two days later a highly regarded japanese politician was killed in tokyo prior to a debate in the diet a week after that a newspaper editor was blown out of his car in hong kong and in less than forty eight hours a banker was shot on a street in calcutta behind each one cain always cain the woman stopped appraising bournes reaction he gave none dont you see he was everywhere he raced from one kill to another accepting contracts with such rapidity that he had to be indiscriminate he was a man in an enormous hurry building his reputation so quickly that he shocked even the most jaded professionals and no one doubted that he was a professional least of all carlos instructions were sent find out about this man learn all you can you see carlos understood what none of us did and in less than twelve months he was proven correct reports came from informers in manila osaka hong kong and tokyo cain was moving to europe they said he would make paris itself his base of operations the challenge was clear the gauntlet thrown cain was out to destroy carlos he would become the new carlos his services the services required by those who sought them as you sought them monsieur moulmein tokyo calcutta jason heard the names coming from his lips whispered from his throat again they were floating suspended in the perfumed air shadows of a past forgotten manila hong kong he stopped trying to clear the mists peering at the outlines of strange shapes that kept racing across his minds eye these places and many others continued lavier that was cains error his error still carlos may be many things to many people but among those who have benefited from his trust and generosity there is loyalty his informers and hirelings are not so readily for sale although cain has tried time and again it is said that carlos is swift to make harsh judgments but as they also say better a satan one knows than a successor one doesnt what cain did not realizedoes not realize nowis that carlos network is a vast one when cain moved to europe he did not know that his activities were uncovered in berlin lisbon amsterdam as far away as oman oman said bourne involuntarily sheik mustafa kalig he whispered as if to himself never proven interjected the lavier woman defiantly a deliberate smokescreen of confusion the contract itself fiction he took credit for an internal murder no one could penetrate that security a lie a lie repeated jason so many lies added mme lavier contemptuously hes no fool however he lies quietly dropping a hint here and there knowing that they will be exaggerated in the telling into substance he provokes carlos at every turn promoting himself at the expense of the man he would replace but hes no match for carlos he takes contracts he cannot fulfill you are only one example we hear there have been several others its said thats why he stayed away for months avoiding people like yourselves avoiding people jason reached for his wrist the trembling had begun again the sound of distant thunder vibrating in far regions of his skull youre sure of that very much so he wasnt dead he was in hiding cain botched more than one assignment it was inevitable he accepted too many in too short a time yet whenever he did he followed an abortive kill with a spectacular unsolicited one to uphold his stature he would select a prominent figure and blow him away the assassination a shock to everyone and unmistakably cains the ambassador traveling in moulmein was an example no one had called for his death there were two others that we know ofa russian commissar in shanghai and more recently a banker in madrid the words came from the bright red lips working feverishly in the lower part of the powdered mask facing him he heard them he had heard them before he had lived them before they were no longer shadows but remembrances of that forgotten past images and reality were fused she began no sentence he could not finish nor could she mention a name or a city or an incident with which he was not instinctively familiar she was talking about him alpha bravo cain delta cain is for charlie and delta is for cain jason bourne was the assassin called cain there was a final question his brief reprieve from darkness two nights ago at the sorbonne marseilles august what happened in marseilles he asked marseilles the lavier woman recoiled how could you what lies were you told what other lies just tell me what happened you refer to leland of course the ubiquitous ambassador whose death was called forpaid for the contract accepted by carlos what if i told you that there are those who think cain was responsible its what he wanted everyone to think it was the ultimate insult to carlosto steal the kill from him payment was irrelevant to cain he only wanted to show the worldour worldthat he could get there first and do the job for which carlos had been paid but he didnt you know he had nothing to do with the leland kill he was there he was trapped at least he never showed up some said hed been killed but since there was no corpse carlos didnt believe it how was cain supposedly killed madame lavier retreated shaking her head in short rapid movements two men on the waterfront tried to take credit tried to get paid for it one was never seen again it can be presumed cain killed him if it was cain they were dock garbage what was the trap the alleged trap monsieur they claimed to have gotten word that cain was to meet someone in the rue sarrasin a night or so before the assassination they say they left appropriately obscure messages in the street and lured the man they were convinced was cain down to the piers to a fishing boat neither trawler nor skipper were seen again so they may have been rightbut as i say there was no proof not even an adequate description of cain to match against the man led away from the sarrasin at any rate thats where it ends youre wrong thats where it began for me i see said bourne trying again to infuse naturalness into his voice our informations different naturally we made a choice on what we thought we knew the wrong choice monsieur what ive told you is the truth yes i know do we have our compromise then why not bien relieved the woman lifted the wineglass to her lips youll see it will be better for everyone it doesnt really matter now he could barely be heard and he knew it what did he say what had he just said why did he say it the mists were closing in again the thunder getting louder the pain had returned to his temples i mean i mean as you say its better for everyone he could feelseelaviers eyes on him studying him its a reasonable solution of course it is you are not feeling well i said it was nothing itll pass im relieved now would you excuse me for a moment no jason grabbed her arm je vous prie monsieur the powder room that is all if you care to stand outside the door well leave you can stop on the way bourne signaled the waiter for a check as you wish she said watching him he stood in the darkened corridor between the spills of light that came from recessed lamps in the ceiling across the way was the ladies room denoted by small uncapitalized letters of gold that read femmes beautiful peoplestunning women handsome menkept passing by the orbit was similar to that of les classiques jacqueline lavier was at home she had also been in the ladies room for nearly ten minutes a fact that would have disturbed jason had he been able to concentrate on the time he could not he was on fire noise and pain consumed him every nerve ending raw exposed the fibers swelling terrified of puncture he stared straight ahead a history of dead men behind him the past was in the eyes of truth they had sought him out and he had seen them cain cain cain he shook his head and looked up at the black ceiling he had to function he could not allow himself to keep falling plunging into the abyss filled with darkness and high wind there were decisions to make no they were made it was a question now of implementing them marie marie oh god my love weve been so wrong he breathed deeply and glanced at his watchthe chronometer he had traded for a thin gold piece of jewelry belonging to a marquis in the south of france he is a man of immense skill extremely inventive there was no joy in that appraisal he looked across at the ladies room where was jacqueline lavier why didn t she come out what could she hope to accomplish remaining inside he had had the presence of mind to ask the maître d if there was a telephone there the man had replied negatively pointing to a booth by the entrance the lavier woman had been at his side she heard the answer understanding the inquiry there was a blinding flash of light he lurched backward recoiling into the wall his hands in front of his eyes the pain oh christ his eyes were on fire and then he heard the words spoken through the polite laughter of welldressed men and women walking casually about the corridor in memory of your dinner at rogets monsieur said an animated hostess holding a press camera by its vertical flashbar the photograph will be ready in a few minutes compliments of roget bourne remained rigid knowing that he could not smash the camera the fear of another realization sweeping over him why me he asked your fiancée requested it monsieur replied the girl nodding her head toward the ladies room we talked inside you are most fortunate she is a lovely lady she asked me to give you this the hostess held out a folded note jason took it as she pranced away toward the restaurant entrance your illness disturbs me as im sure it does you my new friend you may be what you say you are and then again you may not i shall have the answer in a half hour or so a telephone call was made by a sympathetic diner and that photograph is on its way to paris you cannot stop it any more than you can stop those driving now to argenteuil if we indeed have our compromise neither will disturb youas your illness disturbs meand we shall talk again when my associates arrive it is said that cain is a chameleon appearing in various guises and most convincing it is also said that he is prone to violence and to fits of temper these are an illness no he ran down the dark street in argenteuil after the receding roof light of the taxi it turned the corner and disappeared he stopped breathing heavily looking in all directions for another there were none the doorman at rogets had told him a cab would take ten to fifteen minutes to arrive why had not monsieur requested one earlier the trap was set and he had walked into it up ahead a light another taxi he broke into a run he had to stop it he had to get back to paris to marie he was back in a labyrinth racing blindly knowing finally there was no escape but the race would be made alone that decision was irrevocable there would be no discussion no debate no screaming back and fortharguments based in love and uncertainty for the certainty had been made clear he knew who he was what he had been he was guilty as chargedas suspected an hour or two saying nothing just watching talking quietly about anything but the truth loving and then he would leave she would never know when and he could never tell her why he owed her that it would hurt deeply for a while but the ultimate pain would be far less than that caused by the stigma of cain cain marie marie what have i done taxi taxi get out of paris now whatever youre doing stop it and get out those are orders from your government they want you out of there they want him isolated marie crushed out her cigarette in the ashtray on the bedside table her eyes falling on the threeyearold issue of potomac quarterly her thoughts briefly on the terrible game jason had forced her to play i wont listen she said to herself out loud startled at the sound of her own voice in the empty room she walked to the window the same window he had faced looking out frightened trying to make her understand i have to know certain things enough to make a decision but ma ybe not everything a part of me has to be able to run disappear i have to be able to say to myself what was isnt any longer and theres a possibility that it never was because i have no memory of it what a person cant remember didnt exist for him my darling my darling dont let them do this to you her spoken words did not startle now for it was as though he were there in the room listening heeding his own words willing to run disappear with her but at the core of her understanding she knew he could not do that he could not settle for a halftruth or threequarters of a lie they want him isolated who were they the answer was in canada and canada was cut off another trap jason was right about paris she felt it too whatever it was was here if they could find one person to lift the shroud and let him see for himself he was being manipulated then other questions might be manageable the answers no longer pushing him toward selfdestruction if he could be convinced that whatever unremembered crimes he had committed he was a pawn for a much greater single crime he might be able to walk away disappear with her everything was relative what the man she loved had to be able to say to himself was not that the past no longer existed but that it had and he could live with it and put it to rest that was the rationalization he needed the conviction that whatever he had been was far less than his enemies wanted the world to believe for they would not use him otherwise he was the scapegoat his death to take the place of anothers if he could only see that if she could only convince him and if she did not she would lose him they would take him they would kill him they who are you she screamed at the window at the lights of paris outside where are you she could feel a cold wind against her face as surely as if the panes of glass had melted the night air rushing inside it was followed by a tightening in her throat and for a moment she could not swallow could not breathe the moment passed and she breathed again she was afraid it had happened to her before on their first night in paris when she had left the café to find him on the steps of the cluny she had been walking rapidly down the saintmichel when it happened the cold wind the swelling of the throat at that moment she had not been able to breathe later she thought she knew why at that moment also several blocks away inside the sorbonne jason had raced to a judgment that in minutes he would reversebut he had reached it then he had made up his mind he would not come to her stop it she cried its crazy she added shaking her head looking at her watch he had been gone over five hours where was he where was he bourne got out of the taxi in front of the seedily elegant hotel in montparnasse the next hour would be the most difficult of his briefly remembered lifea life that was a void before port noir a nightmare since the nightmare would continue but he would live with it alone he loved her too much to ask her to live it with him he would find a way to disappear taking with him the evidence that tied her to cain it was as simple as that he would leave for a nonexistent rendezvous and not return and sometime during the next hour he would write her a note its over ive found my arrows go back to canada and say nothing for both our sakes i know where to reach you the last was unfairhe would never reach herbut the small feathered hope had to be there if only to get her on a plane to ottawa in timewith timetheir weeks together would fade into a darkly kept secret a cache of brief riches to be uncovered and touched at odd quiet moments and then no more for life was lived for active memories the dormant ones lost meaning no one knew that better than he did he passed through the lobby nodding at the concierge who sat on his stool behind the marble counter reading a newspaper the man barely looked up noting only that the intruder belonged the elevator rumbled and groaned its way up to the fifth floor jason breathed deeply and reached for the gate above all he would avoid dramaticsno alarms raised by words or by looks the chameleon had to merge with his quiet part of the forest one in which no spoors could be found he knew what to say he had thought about it carefully as he had the note he would write most of the night walking around he said holding her stroking her dark red hair cradling her head against his shoulder and aching chasing down cadaverous clerks listening to animated nonsense and drinking coffee disguised as sour mud les classiques was a waste of time its a zoo the monkeys and the peacocks put on a hell of a show but i dont think anyone really knows anything theres one outside possibility but he could simply be a sharp frenchman in search of an american mark he asked marie her trembling diminished a man who operated the switchboard said bourne repelling images of blinding explosions and darkness and high winds as he pictured the face he did not know but knew so well that man now was only a device he pushed the images away i agreed to meet him around midnight at the bastringue on rue hautefeuille what did he say very little but enough to interest me i saw him watching me while i was asking questions the place was fairly crowded so i could move around pretty freely talk to the clerks questions what questions did you ask anything i could think of mainly about the manager or whatever shes called considering what happened this afternoon if she were a direct relay to carlos she should have been close to hysterics i saw her she wasnt she behaved as if nothing had happened except a good day in the shop but she was a relay as you call it damacourt explained that the fiche indirect she gets a phone call and is told what to say before making another call herself actually jason thought the invented assessment was based on reality jacqueline lavier was indeed an indirect relay you couldnt just walk around asking questions without seeming suspicious protested marie you can answered bourne if youre an american writer doing an article on the stores in sainthonoré for a national magazine thats very good jason it worked no one wants to be left out what did you learn like most of those kinds of places les classiques has its own clientele all wealthy most known to each other and with the usual marital intrigues and adulteries that go with the scene carlos knew what he was doing its a regular answering service over there but not the kind listed in a phone book people told you that asked marie holding his arms watching his eyes not in so many words he said aware of the shadows of her disbelief the accent was always on this bergerons talent but one thing leads to another you can get the picture everyone seems to gravitate to that manager from what ive gathered shes a font of social information although she probably couldnt tell me anything except that she did someone a favoran accommodationand that someone will turn out to be someone else who did another favor for another someone the source could be untraceable but its all ive got why the meeting tonight at bastringue he came over to me when i was leaving and said a very strange thing jason did not have to invent this part of the lie he had read the words on a note in an elegant restaurant in argenteuil less than an hour ago he said you may be what you say you are and then again you may not thats when he suggested a drink later on away from sainthonoré bourne saw her doubts receding he had done it she accepted the tapestry of lies and why not he was a man of immense skill extremely inventive the appraisal was not loathsome to him he was cain he may be the one jason you said you only needed one he could be it well see bourne looked at his watch the countdown to his departure had begun he could not look back weve got almost two hours where did you leave the attaché case at the meurice im registered there lets pick it up and get some dinner you havent eaten have you no maries expression was quizzical why not leave the case where it is its perfectly safe we wouldnt have to worry about it we would if we had to get out of here in a hurry he said almost brusquely going to the bureau everything was a question of degree now traces of friction gradually slipping into speech into looks into touch nothing alarming nothing based on false heroics she would see through such tactics only enough so that later she would understand the truth when she read his words its over ive found my arrows whats the matter darling nothing the chameleon smiled im just tired and probably a little discouraged good heavens why a man wants to meet you confidentially late at night a man who operates a switchboard he could lead you somewhere and youre convinced youve narrowed carlos contact down to this woman shes bound to be able to tell you somethingwhether she wants to or not in a macabre way id think youd be elated im not sure i can explain it said jason now looking at her reflection in the mirror youd have to understand what i found there what you found a question what i found a statement its a different world continued bourne reaching for the bottle of scotch and a glass different people its soft and beautiful and frivolous with lots of tiny spotlights and dark velvet nothings taken seriously except gossip and indulgence any one of those giddy peopleincluding that womancould be a relay for carlos and never know it never even suspect it a man like carlos would use such people anyone like him would including me thats what i found its discouraging and unreasonable whatever you believe those people make very conscious decisions that indulgence you talk of demands it they think and you know what i think i think you are tired and hungry and need a drink or two i wish you could put off tonight youve been through enough for one day i cant do that he said sharply all right you cant she answered defensively sorry im edgy yes i know she started for the bathroom ill freshen up and we can go pour yourself a stiff one darling your teeth are showing marie yes try to understand what i found there upset me i thought it would be different easier while you were looking i was waiting jason not knowing that wasnt easy either i thought you were going to call canada didnt you she held her place for a moment no she said it was too late the bathroom door closed bourne walked to the desk across the room he opened the drawer took out stationery picked up the ballpoint pen and wrote the words its over ive found my arrows go back to canada and say nothing for both our sakes i know where to reach you he folded the stationery inserted it into an envelope holding the flap open as he reached for his billfold he took out both the french and the swiss bills slipping them behind the folded note and sealed the envelope he wrote on the front marie he wanted so desperately to add my love my dearest love he did not he could not the bathroom door opened he put the envelope in his jacket pocket that was quick he said was it i didnt think so what are you doing i wanted a pen he answered picking up the ballpoint if that fellow has anything to tell me i want to be able to write it down marie was by the bureau she glanced at the dry empty glass you didnt have your drink i didnt use the glass i see shall we go they waited in the corridor for the rumbling elevator the silence between them awkward in a real sense unbearable he reached for her hand at the touch she gripped his staring at him her eyes telling him that her control was being tested and she did not know why quiet signals had been sent and received not loud enough or abrasive enough to be alarms but they were there and she had heard them it was part of the countdown rigid irreversible prelude to his departure oh god i love you so you are next to me and we are touching and i am dying but you cannot die with me you must not i am cain well be fine he said the metal cage vibrated noisily into its recessed perch jason pulled the brass grille open then suddenly swore under his breath oh christ i forgot what my wallet i left it in the bureau drawer this afternoon in case there was any trouble in sainthonoré wait for me in the lobby he gently swung her through the gate pressing the button with his free hand ill be right down he closed the grille the brass latticework cutting off the sight of her startled eyes he turned away and walked rapidly back toward the room inside he took the envelope out of his pocket and placed it against the base of the lamp on the bedside table he stared down at it the ache unendurable goodbye my love he whispered bourne waited in the drizzle outside the hotel meurice on the rue de rivoli watching marie through the glass doors of the entrance she was at the front desk having signed for the attaché case which had been handed to her over the counter she was now obviously asking a mildly astonished clerk for her bill about to pay for a room that had been occupied less than six hours two minutes passed before the bill was presented reluctantly it was no way for a guest at the meurice to behave indeed all paris shunned such inhibited visitors marie walked out on the pavement joining him in the shadows and the mistlike drizzle to the left of the canopy she gave him the attaché case a forced smile on her lips a slight breathless quality in her voice that man didnt approve of me im sure hes convinced i used the room for a series of quick tricks what did you tell him asked bourne that my plans had changed thats all good the less said the better your names on the registration card think up a reason why you were there think up i should think up a reason she studied his eyes the smile gone i mean well think up a reason naturally naturally lets go they started walking toward the corner the traffic noisy in the street the drizzle in the air fuller the mist denser the promise of heavy rain imminent he took her armnot to guide her not even out of courtesyonly to touch her to hold a part of her there was so little time i am cain i am death can we slow down asked marie sharply what jason realized he had been practically running for a few seconds he had been back in the labyrinth racing through it careening feeling and not feeling he looked up ahead and found an answer at the corner an empty cab had stopped by a garish newsstand the driver shouting through an open window to the dealer i want to catch that taxi said bourne without breaking stride its going to rain like hell they reached the corner both breathless as the empty cab pulled away swinging left into rue de rivoli jason looked up into the night sky feeling the wet pounding on his face unnerved the rain had arrived he looked at marie in the gaudy lights of the newsstand she was wincing in the sudden downpour no she was not wincing she was staring at something staring in disbelief in shock in horror without warning she screamed her face contorted the fingers of her right hand pressed against her mouth bourne grabbed her pulling her head into the damp cloth of his topcoat she would not stop screaming he turned trying to find the cause of her hysterics then he saw it and in that unbelievable split halfsecond he knew the countdown was aborted he had committed the final crime he could not leave her not now not yet on the first ledge of the newsstand was an earlymorning tabloid black headlines electrifying under the circles of light slayer in paris woman sought in zurich killings suspect in rumored theft of millions under the screaming words was a photograph of marie st jacques stop it whispered jason using his body to cover her face from the curious newsdealer reaching into his pocket for coins he threw the money on the counter grabbed two papers and propelled her down the dark rainsoaked street they were both in the labyrinth now bourne opened the door and led marie inside she stood motionless looking at him her face pale and frightened her breathing erratic an audible mixture of fear and anger ill get you a drink said jason going to the bureau as he poured his eyes strayed to the mirror and he had an overpowering urge to smash the glass so despicable was his own image to him what the hell had he done oh god i am cain i am death he heard her gasp and spun around too late to stop her too far away to lunge and tear the awful thing from her hand oh christ he had forgotten she had found the envelope on the bedside table and was reading his note her single scream was a searing terrible cry of pain jasonnnn please no he raced from the bureau and grabbed her it doesnt matter it doesnt count anymore he shouted helplessly seeing the tears swelling in her eyes streaking down her face listen to me that was before not now you were leaving my god you were leaving me her eyes went blank two blind circles of panic i knew it i felt it i made you feel it he said forcing her to look at him but its over now i wont leave you listen to me i wont leave you she screamed again i couldnt breathe it was so cold he pulled her to him enveloping her we have to begin again try to understand its different nowand i cant cha nge what wasbut i wont leave you not like this she pushed her hands against his chest her tearstained face angled back begging why jason why later not now dont say anything for a while just hold me let me hold you the minutes passed hysteria ran its course and the outlines of reality came back into focus bourne led her to the chair she caught the sleeve of her dress on the frayed lace they both smiled as he knelt beside her holding her hand in silence how about that drink he said finally i think so she replied briefly tightening her grip on his hand as he got up from the floor you poured it quite a while ago it wont go flat he went to the bureau and returned with two glasses half filled with whiskey she took hers feeling better he asked calmer still confused frightened of course maybe angry too im not sure im too afraid to think about that she drank closing her eyes her head pressed back against the chair why did you do it jason because i thought i had to thats the simple answer and no answer at all i deserve more than that yes you do and ill give it to you i have to now because you have to hear it you have to understand you have to protect yourself protect he held up his hand interrupting her itll come later all of it if you like but the first thing we have to do is know what happenednot to me but to you thats where we have to begin can you do it the newspaper yes god knows im interested she said smiling weakly here jason went to the bed where he had dropped the two papers well both read it no games no games they read the long article in silence an article that told of death and intrigue in zurich every now and then marie gasped shocked at what she was reading at other times she shook her head in disbelief bourne said nothing he saw the hand of ilich ramirez sanchez carlos will follow cain to the ends of the earth carlos will kill him marie st jacques was expendable a baited decoy that would die in the trap that caught cain i am cain i am death the article was in fact two articlesan odd mixture of fact and conjecture speculations taking over where evidence came to an end the first part indicated a canadian government employee a female economist marie st jacques she was placed at the scene of three murders her fingerprints confirmed by the canadian government in addition police found a hotel key from the carillon du lac apparently lost during the violence on the guisan quai it was the key to marie st jacques room given to her by the hotel clerk who remembered her wellremembered what appeared to him to be a guest in a highly disturbed state of anxiety the final piece of evidence was a handgun discovered not far from the steppdeckstrasse in an alley close by the scene of two other killings ballistics held it to be the murder weapon and again there were fingerprints again confirmed by the canadian government they belonged to the woman marie st jacques it was at this point that the article veered from fact it spoke of rumors along the bahnhofstrasse that a multimilliondollar theft had taken place by means of a computer manipulation dealing with a numbered confidential account belonging to an american corporation called treadstone seventyone the bank was also named it was of course the gemeinschaft but everything else was clouded obscure more speculation than fact according to unnamed sources an american male holding the proper codes transferred millions to a bank in paris assigning the new account to specific individuals who were to assume rights of possession the assignees were waiting in paris and upon clearance withdrew the millions and disappeared the success of the operation was traced to the americans obtaining the accurate codes to the gemeinschaft account a feat made possible by penetrating the banks numerical sequence related to year month and day of entry standard procedure for confidential holdings such an analysis could only be made through the use of sophisticated computer techniques and a thorough knowledge of swiss banking practices when questioned an officer of the bank herr walther apfel acknowledged that there was an ongoing investigation into matters pertaining to the american company but pursuant to swiss law the bank would have no further commentto anyone here the connection to marie st jacques was clarified she was described as a government economist extensively schooled in international banking procedures as well as a skilled computer programmer she was suspected of being an accomplice her expertise necessary to the massive theft and there was a male suspect she was reported to have been seen in his company at the carillon du lac marie finished the article first and let the paper drop to the floor at the sound bourne looked over from the edge of the bed she was staring at the wall a strange pensive serenity having come over her it was the last reaction he expected he finished reading quickly feeling depressed and hopelessfor a moment speechless then he found his voice and spoke lies he said and they were made because of me because of who and what i am smoke you out they find me im sorry sorrier than i can ever tell you marie shifted her eyes from the wall and looked at him it goes deeper than lies jason she said theres too much truth for lies alone truth the only truth is that you were in zurich you never touched a gun you were never in an alley near the steppdeckstrasse you didnt lose a hotel key and you never went near the gemeinschaft agreed but thats not the truth im talking about then what is the gemeinschaft treadstone seventyone apfel those are true and the fact that any were mentionedespecially apfels acknowledgmentis incredible swiss bankers are cautious men they dont ridicule the laws not this way the jail sentences are too severe the statutes pertaining to banking confidentiality are among the most sacrosanct in switzerland apfel could go to prison for years for saying what he did for even alluding to such an account much less confirming it by name unless he was ordered to say what he did by an authority powerful enough to contravene the laws she stopped her eyes straying to the wall again why why was the gemeinschaft or treadstone or apfel ever made part of the story i told you they want me and they know were together carlos knows were together find you he finds me no jason it goes beyond carlos you really dont understand the laws in switzerland not even a carlos could cause them to be flaunted this way she looked at him but her eyes did not see him she was peering through her own mists this isnt one story its two both are constructed out of lies the first connected to the second by tenuous speculationpublic speculationon a banking crisis that would never be made public unless and until a thorough and private investigation proved the facts and that second storythe patently false statement that millions were stolen from the gemeinschaftwas tacked onto the equally false story that im wanted for killing three men in zurich it was added deliberately explain that please its there jason believe me when i tell you that its right in front of us what is someones trying to send us a message the army sedan sped south on manhattans east river drive headlights illuminating the swirling remnants of a latewinter snowfall the major in the back seat dozed his long body angled into the corner his legs stretched out diagonally across the floor in his lap was a briefcase a thin nylon cord attached to the handle by a metal clamp the cord itself strung through his right sleeve and down his inner tunic to his belt the security device had been removed only twice in the past nine hours once during the majors departure from zurich and again with his arrival at kennedy airport in both places however u s government personnel had been watching the customs clerksmore precisely watching the briefcase they were not told why they were simply ordered to observe the inspections and at the slightest deviation from normal procedureswhich meant any undue interest in the briefcasethey were to intercede with weapons if necessary there was a sudden quiet ringing the major snapped his eyes open and brought his left hand up in front of his face the sound was a wrist alarm he pressed the button on his watch and squinted at the second radium dial of his twozoned instrument the first was on zurich time the second new york the alarm had been set twentyfour hours ago when the officer had received his cabled orders the transmission would come within the next three minutes that is thought the major it would come if iron ass was as precise as he expected his subordinates to be the officer stretched awkwardly balancing the briefcase and leaned forward speaking to the driver sergeant turn on your scrambler to megahertz will you please yes sir the sergeant flipped two switches on the radio panel beneath the dashboard then twisted the dial to the frequency there it is major thanks will the microphone reach back here i dont know never tried it sir the driver pulled the small plastic microphone from its cradle and stretched the spiral cord over the seat guess it does he concluded static erupted from the speaker the scrambling transmitter electronically scanning and jamming the frequency the message would follow in seconds it did treadstone treadstone confirm please treadstone receiving said major gordon webb youre clear go ahead whats your position about a mile south of the triborough east river drive said the major your timing is acceptable came the voice from the speaker glad to hear it it makes my day sir there was a brief pause the majors comment not appreciated proceed to east seventyfirst confirm by repeat onethreeniner east seventyfirst keep your vehicle out of the area approach on foot understood out out webb snapped the transmission button in place and handed the microphone back to the driver forget that address sergeant your names on a very short file now gotcha major nothing but static on that thing anyway but since i dont know where it is and these wheels arent supposed to go there where do you want to be dropped off webb smiled no more than two blocks away id go to sleep in the gutter if i had to walk any further than that how about lex and seventysecond is that two blocks no more than three if its three blocks youre a private then i couldnt pick you up later major privates arent cleared for this duty whatever you say captain webb closed his eyes after two years he was about to see treadstone seventyone for himself he knew he should feel a sense of anticipation he did not he felt only a sense of weariness of futility what had happened the incessant hum of the tires on the pavement below was hypnotic but the rhythm was broken by sharp intrusions where concrete and wheels were not compatible the sounds evoked memories of long ago of screeching jungle noises woven into a single tone and then the nightthat night when blinding lights and staccato explosions were all around him and below him telling him he was about to die but he did not die a miracle wrought by a man had given his life back to him and the years went on that night those days never to be forgotten what the hell had happened here we are major webb opened his eyes his hand wiping the sweat that had formed on his forehead he looked at his watch gripped his briefcase and reached for the handle of the door ill be here between and hours sergeant if you cant park just cruise around and ill find you yes sir the driver turned in his seat could the major tell me if were going to be driving any distance later why have you got another fare come on sir im assigned to you until you say otherwise you know that but these heavyplated trucks use gas like the oldtime shermans if were going far id better fill it sorry the major paused okay youll have to find out where it is anyway because i dont know were going to a private airfield in madison new jersey i have to be there no later than one hundred hours ive got a vague idea said the driver at youre cutting it pretty close sir ok then and thanks webb got out of the car closed the door and waited until the brown sedan entered the flow of traffic on seventysecond street he stepped off the curb and headed south to seventyfirst four minutes later he stood in front of a wellkept brownstone its muted rich design in concert with those around it in the treelined street it was a quiet street a monied streetold money it was the last place in manhattan a person would suspect of housing one of the most sensitive intelligence operations in the country and as of twenty minutes ago major gordon webb was one of only eight or ten people in the country who knew of its existence treadstone seventyone he climbed the steps aware that the pressure of his weight on the iron grids embedded in the stone beneath him triggered electronic devices that in turn activated cameras producing his image on screens inside beyond this he knew little except that treadstone seventyone never closed it was operated and monitored twentyfour hours a day by a select few identities unknown he reached the top step and rang the bell an ordinary bell but not for an ordinary door the major could see that the heavy wood was riveted to a steel plate behind it the decorative iron designs in actuality the rivets the large brass knob disguising a hotplate that caused a series of steel bolts to shoot across into steel receptacles at the touch of a human hand when the alarms were turned on webb glanced up at the windows each pane of glass he knew was an inch thick capable of withstanding the impact of caliber shells treadstone seventyone was a fortress the door opened and the major involuntarily smiled at the figure standing there so totally out of place did she seem she was a petite elegantlooking grayhaired woman with soft aristocratic features and a bearing that bespoke monied gentility her voice confirmed the appraisal it was midatlantic refined in the better finishing schools and at innumerable polo matches how good of you to drop by major jeremy wrote us that you might do come in its such a pleasure to see you again its good to see you again too replied webb stepping into the tasteful foyer finishing his statement when the door was closed but im not sure where it was we met before the woman laughed oh weve had dinner ever so many times with jeremy of course whos jeremy a devoted nephew whos also your devoted friend such a nice young man its a pity he doesnt exist she took his elbow as they walked down a long hallway its all for the benefit of neighbors who might be strolling by come along now theyre waiting they passed an archway that led to a large living room the major looked inside there was a grand piano by the front windows harp beside it and everywhereon the piano and on polished tables glistening under the spill of subdued lampswere silverframed photographs mementos of a past filled with wealth and grace sailboats men and women on the decks of ocean liners several military portraits and yes two candid shots of someone mounted for a polo match it was a room that belonged in a brownstone on this street they reached the end of the hallway there was a large mahogany door basrelief and iron ornamentation part of its design part of its security if there was an infrared camera webb could not detect the whereabouts of the lens the grayhaired woman pressed an unseen bell the major could hear a slight hum your friend is here gentlemen stop playing poker and go to work snap to jesuit jesuit asked webb bewildered an old joke replied the woman it goes back to when you were probably playing marbles and snarling at little girls the door opened and the aged but still erect figure of david abbott was revealed glad to see you major said the former silent monk of covert services extending his hand good to be here sir webb shook hands another elderly imposinglooking man came up beside abbott a friend of jeremys no doubt said the man his deep voice edged with humor dreadfully sorry time preludes proper introductions young fellow come along margaret theres a lovely fire upstairs he turned to abbott youll let me know when youre leaving david usual time for me i expect replied the monk ill show these two how to ring you it was then that webb realized there was a third man in the room he was standing in the shadows at the far end and the major recognized him instantly he was elliot stevens senior aide to the president of the united statessome said his alter ego he was in his early forties slender wore glasses and had the bearing of unpretentious authority about him itll be fine the imposing older man who had not found time to introduce himself had been speaking webb had not heard him his attention on the white house aide ill be waiting till next time continued abbott shifting his eyes kindly to the grayhaired woman thanks sister meg keep your habit pressed and down youre still wicked jesuit the couple left closing the door behind them webb stood for a moment shaking his head and smiling the man and woman of east seventyfirst belonged to the room down the hall just as that room belonged in the brownstone all a part of the quiet monied treelined street youve known them a long time havent you a lifetime you might say replied abbott he was a yachtsman we put to good use in the adriatic runs for donovans operations in yugoslavia mikhailovitch once said he sailed on sheer nerve bending the worst weather to his will and dont let sister megs graciousness fool you she was one of intrepids girls a piranha with very sharp teeth theyre quite a story itll never be told said abbott closing the subject i want you to meet elliot stevens i dont think i have to tell you who he is webb stevens stevens webb that sounds like a law firm said stevens amiably walking across the room hand extended nice to know you webb have a good trip i would have preferred military transport i hate those damned commercial airlines i thought a customs agent at kennedy was going to slice the lining of my suitcase you look too respectable in that uniform laughed the monk youre obviously a smuggler im still not sure i understand the uniform said the major carrying his briefcase to a long hatch table against the wall and unclipping the nylon cord from his belt i shouldnt have to tell you answered abbott that the tightest security is often found in being quite obvious on the surface an army intelligence officer prowling around undercover in zurich at this particular time could raise alarms then i dont understand either said the white house aide coming up beside webb at the table watching the majors manipulations with the nylon cord and the lock wouldnt an obvious presence raise even more shrill alarms i thought the assumption of undercover was that discovery was less probable webbs trip to zurich was a routine consulate check predated on the gtwo schedules no one fools anybody about those trips theyre what they are and nothing else ascertaining new sources paying off informants the soviets do it all the time they dont even bother to hide it neither do we frankly but that wasnt the purpose of this trip said stevens beginning to understand so the obvious conceals the unobvious thats it can i help the presidential aide seemed fascinated by the briefcase thanks said webb just pull the cord through stevens did so i always thought it was chains around the wrist he said too many hands cut off explained the major smiling at the white house mans reaction theres a steel wire running through the nylon he freed the briefcase and opened it on the table looking around at the elegance of the furnished libraryden at the rear of the room was a pair of french doors that apparently led to an outside garden an outline of a high stone wall seen dimly through the panes of thick glass so this is treadstone seventyone it isnt the way i pictured it pull the curtains again will you please elliot abbott said the presidential aide walked to the french doors and did so abbott crossed to a bookcase opened the cabinet beneath it and reached inside there was a quiet whir the entire bookcase came out of the wall and slowly revolved to the left on the other side was an electronic radio console one of the most sophisticated gordon webb had seen is this more what you had in mind asked the monk jesus the major whistled as he studied the dials calibrations cable patches and scanning devices built into the panel the pentagon war rooms had far more elaborate equipment but this was the miniaturized equal of most wellstructured intelligence stations id whistle too said stevens standing in front of the dense curtain but mr abbott already gave me my personal sideshow thats only the beginning for more buttons and this place looks like a sac base in omaha those same buttons also transform this room back into a graceful east side library the old man reached inside the cabinet in seconds the enormous console was replaced by bookshelves he then walked to the adjacent bookcase opened the cabinet beneath and once again put his hand inside the whirring began the bookcase slid out and shortly in its place were three tall filing cabinets the monk took out a key and pulled out a file drawer im not showing off gordon when were finished i want you to look through these ill show you the switch thatll send them back if you have any problems our host will take care of everything what am i to look for well get to it right now i want to hear about zurich what have you learned excuse me mr abbott interrupted stevens if im slow its because all this is new to me but i was thinking about something you said a minute ago about major webbs trip what is it you said the trip was predated on the gtwo schedules thats right why the majors obvious presence was to confuse zurich not washington or was it the monk smiled i can see why the president keeps you around weve never doubted that carlos has bought his way into a circle or twoor tenin washington he finds the discontented men and offers them what they do not have a carlos could not exist without such people you must remember he doesnt merely sell death he sells a nations secrets all too frequently to the soviets if only to prove to them how rash they were to expel him the president would want to know that said the aide it would explain several things its why youre here isnt it said abbott i guess it is and its a good place to begin for zurich said webb taking his briefcase to an armchair in front of the filing cabinets he sat down spreading the folds inside the case at his feet and took out several sheets of paper you may not doubt carlos is in washington but i can confirm it where treadstone theres no clear proof of that but it cant be ruled out he found the fiche he altered it good god how the how i can only guess the who i know who a man named koenig until three days ago he was in charge of primary verifications at the gemeinschaft bank three days ago where is he now dead a freak automobile accident on a road he traveled every day of his life heres the police report i had it translated abbott took the papers and sat down in a nearby chair elliot stevens remained standing webb continued theres something very interesting there it doesnt tell us anything we dont know but theres a lead id like to follow up what is it asked the monk reading this describes the accident the curve speed of vehicle apparent swerving to avoid a collision its at the end it mentions the killing at the gemeinschaft the bolt that got us off our asses it does abbott turned the page look at it last couple of sentences see what i mean not exactly replied abbott frowning this merely states that koenig was employed by the gemeinschaft where a recent homicide took place and he had been a witness to the initial gunfire thats all i dont think it is all said webb i think there was more someone started to raise a question but it was left hanging id like to find out who has his red pencil on the zurich police reports he could be carlos man we know hes got one there the monk leaned back in the chair his frown unrelieved assuming youre right why wasnt the entire reference deleted too obvious the killing did take place koenig was a witness the investigating officer who wrote up the report might legitimately ask why but if he had speculated on a connection wouldnt he be just as disturbed that the speculation was deleted not necessarily were talking about a bank in switzerland certain areas are officially inviolable unless theres proof not always i understood you were very successful with the newspapers unofficially i appealed to prurient journalistic sensationalism andalthough it damn near killed himgot walther apfel to corroborate halfway interruption said elliot stevens i think this is where the oval office has to come in i assume by the newspapers youre referring to the canadian woman not really that story was already out we couldnt stop it carlos is wired into the zurich police they issued that report we simply enlarged on it and tied her to an equally false story about millions having been stolen from the gemeinschaft webb paused and looked at abbott thats something we have to talk about it may not be false after all i cant believe that said the monk i dont want to believe it replied the major ever would you mind backing up asked the white house aide sitting down opposite the army officer i have to get this very clear let me explain broke in abbott seeing the bewilderment on webbs face elliots here on orders from the president its the killing at the ottawa airport its an unholy mess said stevens bluntly the prime minister damn near told the president to take our stations out of nova scotia hes one angry canadian how did it come down asked webb very badly all they know is that a ranking economist at national revenues treasury board made discreet inquiries about an unlisted american corporation and got himself killed for it to make matters worse canadian intelligence was told to stay out of it it was a highly sensitive u s operation who the hell did that i believe ive heard the name iron ass bandied about here and there said the monk general crawford stupid son of a bitchstupid ironassed son of a bitch can you imagine interjected stevens their man gets killed and we have the gall to tell them to stay out he was right of course corrected abbott it had to be done swiftly no room for misunderstanding a clamp had to be put on instantly the shock sufficiently outrageous to stop everything it gave me time to reach mackenzie hawkinsmac and i worked together in burma hes retired but they listen to him theyre cooperating now and thats the important thing isnt it there are other considerations mr abbott protested stevens theyre on different levels elliot we working stiffs arent on them we dont have to spend time over diplomatic posturing ill grant you those postures are necessary but they dont concern us they do concern the president sir theyre part of his every workingstiff day and thats why i have to go back with a very clear picture stevens paused turning to webb now please let me have it again exactly what did you do and why what part did we play regarding this canadian woman initially not a goddamn thing that was carlos move someone very high up in the zurich police is on carlos payroll it was the zurich police who mocked up the socalled evidence linking her to the three killings and its ludicrous shes no killer all right all right said the aide that was carlos why did he do it to flush out bourne the st jacques woman and bourne are together bourne being this assassin who calls himself cain correct yes said webb carlos has sworn to kill him cains moved in on carlos all over europe and the middle east but theres no photograph of cain no one really knows what he looks like so by circulating a picture of the womanand let me tell you its in every damn newspaper over there someone may spot her if shes found the chances are that cainbournewill be found too carlos will kill them both all right again thats carlos now what did you do just what i said reached the gemeinschaft and convinced the bank into confirming the fact that the woman mightjust mightbe tied with a massive theft it wasnt easy but it was their man koenig whod been bribed not one of our people thats an internal matter they wanted a lid on it then i called the papers and referred them to walther apfel mysterious woman murder millions stolen the editors leaped at it for christs sake why shouted stevens you used a citizen of another country for a u s intelligence strategy a staff employee of a closely allied government are you out of your minds you only exacerbated the situation you sacrificed her youre wrong said webb were trying to save her life weve turned carlos weapon against him how the monk raised his hand before we answer we have to go back to another question he said because the answer to that may give you an indication of how restricted the information must remain a moment ago i asked the major how carlos man could have found bournefound the fiche that identified bourne as cain i think i know but i want him to tell you webb leaned forward the medusa records he said quietly reluctantly medusa stevens expression conveyed the fact that the medusa had been the subject of early white house confidential briefings theyre buried he said correction intruded abbott theres an original and two copies and theyre in vaults at the pentagon the cia and the national security council access to them is limited to a select group each one among the highestranking members of his unit bourne came out of medusa a crosschecking of those names with the bank records would produce his name someone gave them to carlos stevens stared at the monk are you saying that carlos is wired into men like that its an extraordinary charge its the only explanation said webb by why would bourne ever use his own name it was necessary replied abbott it was a vital part of the portrait it had to be authentic everything had to be authentic everything authentic maybe youll understand now continued the major by tying the st jacques woman into millions supposedly stolen from the gemeinschaft bank were telling bourne to surface he knows its false bourne to surface the man called jason bourne said abbott getting to his feet and walking slowly toward the drawn curtains is an american intelligence officer there is no cain not the one carlos believes hes a lure a trap for carlos thats who he is or was the silence was brief broken by the white house man i think youd better explain the president has to know i suppose so mused abbott parting the curtains looking absently outside its an insoluble dilemma really presidents change different men with different temperaments and appetites sit in the oval office however a longrange intelligence strategy doesnt change not one like this yet an offhand remark over a glass of whiskey in a postpresidential conversation or an egotistical phrase in a memoir can blow that same strategy right to hell there isnt a day that we dont worry about those men who have survived the white house please interrupted stevens i ask you to remember that im here on the orders of this president whether you approve or disapprove doesnt matter he has the right by law to know and in his name i insist on that right very well said abbott still looking outside three years ago we borrowed a page from the british we created a man who never was if you recall prior to the normandy invasion british intelligence floated a corpse into the coast of portugal knowing that whatever documents were concealed on it would find their way to the german embassy in lisbon a life was created for that dead body a name a naval officers rank schools training travel orders drivers license membership cards in exclusive london clubs and a halfdozen personal letters scattered throughout were hints vaguely worded allusions and a few very direct chronological and geographical references they all pointed to the invasion taking place a hundred miles away from the beaches at normandy and six weeks off the target date in june after panicked checks were made by german agents all over englandand incidentally controlled and monitored by mi fivethe high command in berlin bought the story and shifted a large part of their defenses as many as were lost thousands upon thousands of lives were saved by that man who never was abbott let the curtain fall into place and walked wearily back to his chair ive heard the story said the white house aide and ours was a variation said the monk sitting down wearily create a living man a quickly established legend seemingly everywhere at once racing all over southeast asia outdoing carlos at every turn especially in the area of sheer numbers whenever there was a killing or an unexplained death or a prominent figure involved in a fatal accident there was cain reliable sourcespaid informants known for accuracywere fed his name embassies listening posts entire intelligence networks were repeatedly funneled reports that concentrated on cains rapidly expanding activities his kills were mounting every month sometimes it seemed weekly he was everywhere and he was in all ways you mean this bourne was yes he spent months learning everything there was to learn about carlos studying every file we had every known and suspected assassination with which carlos was involved he pored over carlos tactics his methods of operation everything much of that material has never seen the light of day and probably never will its explosivegovernments and international combines would be at each others throats there was literally nothing bourne did not knowthat could be known about carlos and then hed show himself always with a different appearance speaking any of several languages talking about things to selected circles of hardened criminals that only a professional killer would talk about then hed be gone leaving behind bewildered and often frightened men and women they had seen cain he existed and he was ruthless that was the image bourne conveyed hes been underground like this for three years asked stevens yes he moved to europe the most accomplished white assassin in asia graduate of the infamous medusa challenging carlos in his own yard and in the process he saved four men marked by carlos took credit for others carlos had killed mocked him at every opportunity always trying to force him out in the open he spent nearly three years living the most dangerous sort of lie a man can live the kind of existence few men ever know most would have broken under it and that possibility can never be ruled out what kind of man is he a professional answered gordon webb someone who had the training and the capability who understood that carlos had to be found stopped but three years if that seems incredible said abbott you should know that he submitted to surgery it was like a final break with the past with the man he was in order to become a man he wasnt i dont think theres any way a nation can repay a man like bourne for what hes done perhaps the only way is to give him the chance to succeedand by god i intend to do that the monk stopped for precisely two seconds then added if it is bourne it was as if elliot stevens had been struck by an unseen hammer what did you say he asked im afraid ive held this to the end i wanted you to understand the whole picture before i described the gap it may not be a gapwe just dont know too many things have happened that make no sense to us but we dont know its the reason why there can be absolutely no interference from other levels no diplomatic sugar pills that might expose the strategy we could condemn a man to death a man whos given more than any of us if he succeeds he can go back to his own life but only anonymously only without his identity ever being revealed im afraid youll have to explain that said the astonished presidential aide loyalty elliot its not restricted to whats commonly referred to as the good guys carlos has built up an army of men and women who are devoted to him they may not know him but they revere him however if he can take carlosor trap carlos so we can take himthen vanish hes home free but you say he may not be bourne i said we dont know it was bourne at the bank the signatures were authentic but is it bourne now the next few days will tell us if he surfaces added webb its delicate continued the old man there are so many variables if it isnt bourneor if hes turnedit could explain the call to ottawa the killing at the airport from what we can gather the womans expertise was used to withdraw the money in paris all carlos had to do was make a few inquiries at the canadian treasury board the rest would be childs play for him kill her contact panic her cut her off and use her to contain bourne were you able to get word to her asked the major i tried and failed i had mac hawkins call a man who also worked closely with the st jacques woman a man named alan somebodyorother he instructed her to return to canada immediately she hung up on him goddamn it exploded webb precisely if we could have gotten her back we might have learned so much shes the key why is she with him why he with her nothing makes sense less to me said stevens his bewilderment turning into anger if you want the presidents cooperationand i promise nothingyoud better be clearer abbott turned to him some six months ago bourne disappeared he said something happened were not sure what but we can piece together a probability he got word into zurich that he was on his way to marseilles latertoo latewe understood hed learned that carlos had accepted a contract on howard leland and bourne tried to stop it then nothing he vanished had he been killed had he broken under the strain had he given up i cant accept that interrupted webb angrily i wont accept it i know you wont said the monk its why i want you to go through that file you know his codes theyre all in there see if you can spot any deviations in zurich please broke in stevens what do you think you must have found something concrete something on which to base a judgment i need that mr abbott the president needs it i wish to heaven i had replied the monk what have we found everything and nothing almost three years of the most carefully constructed deception in our records every false act documented every move defined and justified each man and womaninformants contacts sourcesgiven faces voices stories to tell and every month every week just a little bit closer to carlos then nothing silence six months of a vacuum not now countered the presidents aide that silence was broken by whom thats the basic question isnt it said the old man his voice tired months of silence then suddenly an explosion of unauthorized incomprehensible activity the account penetrated the fiche altered millions transferredby all appearances stolen above all men killed and traps set for other men but for whom by whom the monk shook his head wearily who is the man out there the limousine was parked between two streetlamps diagonally across from the heavy ornamental doors of the brownstone in the front seat sat a uniformed chauffeur such a driver at the wheel of such a vehicle not an uncommon sight on the treelined street what was unusual however was the fact that two other men remained in the shadows of the deep back seat neither making any move to get out instead they watched the entrance of the brownstone confident that they could not be picked up by the infrared beam of a scanning camera one man adjusted his glasses the eyes beyond his thick lenses owllike flatly suspicious of most of what they surveyed alfred gillette director of personnel screening and evaluation for the national security council spoke how gratifying to be there when arrogance collapses how much more so to be the instrument you really dislike him dont you said gillettes companion a heavyshouldered man in a black raincoat whose accent was derived from a slavic language somewhere in europe i loathe him he stands for everything i hate in washington the right schools houses in georgetown farms in virginia quiet meetings at their clubs theyve got their tight little world and you dont break inthey run it all the bastards the superior selfinflated gentry of washington they use other mens intellects other mens work wrapping it all into decisions bearing their imprimaturs and if youre on the outside you become part of that amorphous entity a damn fine staff you exaggerate said the european his eyes on the brownstone you havent done badly down there we never would have contacted you otherwise gillette scowled if i havent done badly its because ive become indispensable to too many like david abbott i have in my head a thousand facts they couldnt possibly recall its simply easier for them to place me where the questions are where problems need solutions director of personnel screening and evaluation they created that title that post for me do you know why no alfred replied the european looking at his watch i dont know why because they dont have the patience to spend hours poring over thousands of résumés and dossiers theyd rather be dining at sans souci or preening in front of senate committees reading from pages prepared by othersby those unseen unnamed damn fine staffs youre a bitter man said the european more than youll know a lifetime doing the work those bastards should have done for themselves and for what a title and an occasional lunch where my brains are picked between the shrimp and the entrée by men like the supremely arrogant david abbott theyre nothing without people like me dont underestimate the monk carlos doesnt how could he he doesnt know what to evaluate everything abbott does is shrouded in secrecy no one knows how many mistakes hes made and if any come to light men like me are blamed for them the european shifted his gaze from the window to gillette youre very emotional alfred he said coldly you must be careful about that the bureaucrat smiled it never gets in the way i believe my contributions to carlos bear that out lets say im preparing myself for a confrontation i wouldnt avoid for anything in the world an honest statement said the heavyshouldered man what about you you found me i knew what to look for the european returned to the window i mean you the work you do for carlos i have no such complicated reasoning i come out of a country where educated men are promoted at the whim of morons who recite marxist litany by rote carlos too knew what to look for gillette laughed his flat eyes close to shining were not so different after all change the bloodlines of our eastern establishment for marx and theres a distinct parallel perhaps agreed the european looking again at his watch it shouldnt be long now abbott always catches the midnight shuttle his every hour accounted for in washington youre sure hell come out alone he always does and he certainly wouldnt be seen with elliot stevens webb and stevens will also leave separately twentyminute intervals is standard for those called in how did you find treadstone it wasnt so difficult you contributed alfred you were part of a damn fine staff the man laughed his eyes on the brownstone cain was out of medusa you told us that and if carlos suspicions are accurate that meant the monk we knew that it tied him to bourne carlos instructed us to keep abbott under twentyfourhour surveillance something had gone wrong when the gunshots in zurich were heard in washington abbott got careless we followed him here it was merely a question of persistence that led you to canada to the man in ottawa the man in ottawa revealed himself by looking for treadstone when we learned who the girl was we had the treasury board watched her section watched a call came from paris it was she telling him to start a search we dont know why but we suspect bourne may be trying to blow treadstone apart if hes turned its one way to get out and keep the money it doesnt matter suddenly this section head no one outside the canadian government had ever heard of was transformed into a problem of the highest priority intelligence communiqués were burning the wires it meant carlos was right you were right alfred there is no cain hes an invention a trap from the beginning insisted gillette i told you that three years of false reports sources unverified it was all there from the beginning mused the european undoubtedly the monks finest creation until something happened and the creation turned everythings turning its all coming apart at the seams stevens being here confirms that the president insists on knowing he has to theres a nagging suspicion in ottawa that a section head at the treasury board was killed by american intelligence the european turned from the window and looked at the bureaucrat remember alfred we simply want to know what happened ive given you the facts as weve learned them theyre irrefutable and abbott cannot deny them but they must be presented as having been obtained independently by your own sources youre appalled you demand an accounting the entire intelligence community has been duped it has exclaimed gillette duped and used no one in washington knows about bourne about treadstone theyve excluded everyone it is appalling i dont have to pretend arrogant bastards alfred cautioned the european holding up his hand in the shadows do remember whom youre working for the threat cannot be based on emotion but in cold professional outrage hell suspect you instantly you must dispel those suspicions just as swiftly you are the accuser not he ill remember good headlight beams bounced through the glass abbotts taxi is here ill take care of the driver the european reached to his right and flipped a switch beneath the armrest ill be in my car across the street listening he spoke to the chauffeur abbott will be coming out any moment now you know what to do the chauffeur nodded both men got out of the limousine simultaneously the driver walked around the hood as if to escort a wealthy employer to the south side of the street gillette watched through the rear window the two men stayed together for several seconds then separated the european heading for the approaching cab his hand held up a bill between his fingers the taxi would be sent away the callers plans had changed the chauffeur had raced to the north side of the street and was now concealed in the shadows of a staircase two doors away from treadstone seventyone thirty seconds later gillettes eyes were drawn to the door of the brownstone light spilled through as an impatient david abbott came outside looking up and down the street glancing at his watch obviously annoyed the taxi was late and he had a plane to catch precise schedules had to be followed abbott walked down the steps turning left on the pavement looking for the cab expecting it in seconds he would pass the chauffeur he did both men well out of camera range the interception was quick the discussion rapid in moments a bewildered david abbott climbed inside the limousine and the chauffeur walked away into the shadows you said the monk anger and disgust in his voice of all people you i dont think youre in any position to be disdainful much less arrogant what youve done how dare you zurich the medusa records it was you the medusa records yes zurich yes but its not a question of what ive done its what youve done we sent our own men to zurich telling them what to look for we found it his name is bourne isnt it hes the man you call cain the man you invented abbott kept himself in check how did you find this house persistence i had you followed you had me followed what the hell did you think you were doing trying to set a record straight a record youve warped and lied about keeping the truth from the rest of us what did you think you were doing oh my god you damn fool abbott inhaled deeply why did you do it why didnt you come to me yourself because youd have done nothing youve manipulated the entire intelligence community millions of dollars untold thousands of man hours embassies and stations fed lies and distortions about a killer that never existed oh i recall your wordswhat a challenge to carlos what an irresistible trap is what it was only we were your pawns too and as a responsible member of the security council i resent it deeply youre all alike who elected you god so you could break the rulesno not just the rules the lawsand make us look like fools there was no other way said the old man wearily his face a drawn mass of crevices in the dim light how many know tell me the truth ive contained it i gave you that it may not be enough oh christ it may not last period said the bureaucrat emphatically i want to know what happened what happened to this grand strategy of yours it seems to be falling apart at the seams why do you say that its perfectly obvious youve lost bourne you cant find him your cain has disappeared with a fortune banked for him in zurich abbott was silent for a moment wait a minute what put you on to it you said gillette quickly the prudent man rising to the baited question i must say i admired your control when that ass from the pentagon spoke so knowingly of operation medusa sitting directly across from the man who created it history the old mans voice was strong now that wouldnt have told you anything lets say it was rather unusual for you not to say anything i mean who at that table knew more about medusa than you but you didnt say a word and that started me thinking so i objected strenuously to the attention being paid this assassin cain you couldnt resist david you had to offer a very plausible reason to continue the search for cain you threw carlos into the hunt it was the truth interrupted abbott certainly it was you knew when to use it and i knew when to spot it ingenious a snake pulled out of medusas head groomed for a mythical title the contender jumps into the champions ring to draw the champion out of his corner it was sound sound from the beginning why not as i say it was ingenious even down to every move made by his own people against cain who better to relay those moves to cain but the one man on the forty committee whos given reports on every covert operations conference you used us all the monk nodded very well to a point youre right thereve been degrees of abusein my opinion totally justifiedbut its not what you think there are checks and balances there always are i wouldnt have it any other way treadstone is comprised of a small group of men among the most trustworthy in the government they range from army gtwo to the senate from the cia to naval intelligence and now frankly the white house should there be any true abuse theres not one of them that would hesitate to put a stop to the operation none has ever seen fit to do so and i beg you not to do so either would i be made part of treadstone you are part of it now i see what happened where is bourne i wish to god we knew were not even sure it is bourne youre not even sure of what i see what happened where is bourne i wish to god we knew were not even sure it is bourne youre not even sure of what the european reached for the switch on the dashboard and snapped it off thats it he said thats what we had to know he turned to the chauffeur beside him quickly now get beside the staircase remember if one of them comes out you have precisely three seconds before the door is closed work fast the uniformed man got out first he walked up the pavement toward treadstone seventyone from one of the adjacent brownstones a middleaged couple were saying loud goodbyes to their hosts the chauffeur slowed down reached into his pocket for a cigarette and stopped to light it he was now a bored driver whiling away the hours of a tedious vigil the european watched then unbuttoned his raincoat and withdrew a long thin revolver its barrel enlarged by a silencer he switched off the safety shoved the weapon back into his holster got out of the car and walked across the street toward the limousine the mirrors had been angled properly by staying in the blind spot there was no way either man inside could see him approach the european paused briefly for the rear trunk then swiftly hand extended lunged for the right front door opened it and spun inside leveling his weapon over the seat alfred gillette gasped his left hand surging for the door handle the european snapped the fourway lock david abbott remained immobile staring at the invader good evening monk said the european another whom im told often assumes a religious habit sends you his congratulations not only for cain but for your household personnel at treadstone the yachtsman for instance once a superior agent gillette found his voice it was a mixture of a scream and a whisper what is this who are you he cried feigning ignorance oh come now old friend thats not necessary said the man with the gun i can see by the expression on mr abbotts face that he realizes his initial doubts about you were accurate one should always trust ones first instincts shouldnt one monk you were right of course we found another discontented man your system reproduces them with alarming rapidity he indeed gave us the medusa files and they did indeed lead us to bourne what are you doing screamed gillette what are you saying youre a bore alfred but you were always part of a damn fine staff its too bad you didnt know which staff to stay with your kind never do you gillette rose bodily off the seat his face contorted the european fired his weapon the cough from the barrel echoing briefly in the soft interior of the limousine the bureaucrat slumped over his body crumbling to the floor against the door owleyes wide in death i dont think you mourn him said the european i dont said the monk it is bourne out there you know cain turned he broke the long period of silence is over the snake from medusas head decided to strike out on his own or perhaps he was bought thats possible too isnt it carlos buys many men the one at your feet now for example youll learn nothing from me dont try theres nothing to learn we know it all delta charlie cain but the names arent important any longer they never were really all that remains is the final isolationremoving of the manmonk who makes the decisions you bourne is trapped hes finished there are others who make decisions hell reach them if he does theyll kill him on sight theres nothing more despicable than a man whos turned but in order for a man to turn there has to be irrefutable proof that he was yours to begin with carlos has the proof he was yours his origins as sensitive as anything in the medusa files the old man frowned he was frightened not for his life but for something infinitely more indispensable youre out of your mind he said there is no proof that was the flaw your flaw carlos is thorough his tentacles reach into all manner of hidden recesses you needed a man from medusa someone who had lived and disappeared you chose a man named bourne because the circumstances of his disappearance had been obliterated eliminated from every existing recordor so you believed but you didnt consider hanois own field personnel who had infiltrated medusa those records exist on march jason bourne was executed by an american intelligence officer in the jungles of tam quan the monk lunged forward there was nothing left but a final gesture a final defiance the european fired the door of the brownstone opened from the shadows beneath the staircase the chauffeur smiled the white house aide was being escorted out by the old man who lived at treadstone the one they called the yachtsman the killer knew that meant the primary alarms were off the threesecond span was eliminated so good of you to drop by said the yachtsman shaking hands thank you very much sir those were the last words either man spoke the chauffeur aimed above the walled brick railing pulling the trigger twice the muffled reports indistinguishable from the myriad of distant sounds of the city the yachtsman fell back inside the white house aide clutched his upper chest reefing into the door frame the chauffeur spun around the brick railing and raced up the steps catching stevens body as it plummeted down with bulllike strength the killer lifted the white house man off his feet hurling him back through the door into the foyer beyond the yachtsman then he turned to the interior border of the heavy steelplated door he knew what to look for he found it along the upper molding disappearing into the wall was a thick cable stained the color of the doorframe he closed the door part way raised his gun and fired into the cable the spit was followed by an eruption of static and sparks the security cameras were blown out screens everywhere now dark he opened the door to signal it was not necessary the european was walking rapidly across the quiet street within seconds he had climbed the steps and was inside glancing around the foyer and the hallwaythe door at the end of the hallway together both men lifted a rug from the foyer floor the european closing the door on its edge welding cloth and steel together so that a twoinch space remained the security bolts still in place no backup alarms could be raised they stood erect in silence both knew that if the discovery was going to be made it would be made quickly it came with the sound of an upstairs door opening followed by footsteps and words that floated down the staircase in a cultured female voice darling i just noticed the damn cameras on the fritz would you check it please there was a pause then the woman spoke again on second thought why not tell david again the pause again with precise timing dont bother the jesuit darling tell david two footsteps silence a rustle of cloth the european studied the stairwell a light went out david jesuit monk get her he roared at the chauffeur spinning around his weapon leveled at the door at the end of the hallway the uniformed man raced up the staircase there was a gunshot it came from a powerful weaponunmuffled unsilenced the european looked up the chauffeur was holding his shoulder his coat drenched with blood his pistol held out spitting repeatedly up the well of the stairs the door at the end of the hallway was yanked open the major standing there in shock a file folder in his hand the european fired twice gordon webb arched backward his throat torn open the papers in the folder flying out behind him the man in the raincoat raced up the steps to the chauffeur above over the railing was the grayhaired woman dead blood spilling out of her head and neck are you all right can you move asked the european the chauffeur nodded the bitch blew half my shoulder off but i can manage you have to commanded his superior ripping off his raincoat put on my coat i want the monk in here quickly jesus carlos wants the monk in here awkwardly the wounded man put on the black raincoat and made his way down the staircase around the bodies of the yachtsman and the white house aide carefully in pain he let himself out the door and down the front steps the european watched him holding the door making sure the man was sufficiently mobile for the task he was he was a bull whose every appetite was satisfied by carlos the chauffeur would carry david abbotts corpse back into the brownstone no doubt supporting it as though helping an aging drunk for the benefit of anyone in the street and then he would somehow contain his bleeding long enough to drive alfred gillettes body across the river burying him in a swamp carlos men were capable of such things they were all bulls discontented bulls who had found their own causes in a single man the european turned and started down the hallway there was work to do the final isolation of the man called jason bourne it was more than could be hoped for the exposed files a gift beyond belief included were folders containing every code and method of communication ever used by the mythical cain now not so mythical thought the european as he gathered the papers together the scene was set the four corpses in position in the peaceful elegant library david abbott was arched in a chair his dead eyes in shock elliot stevens at his feet the yachtsman was slumped over the hatch table an overturned bottle of whiskey in his hand while gordon webb sprawled on the floor clutching his briefcase whatever violence had taken place the setting indicated that it had been unexpected conversations interrupted by abrupt gunfire the european walked around in suede gloves appraising his artistry and it was artistry he had dismissed the chauffeur wiped every door handle every knob every gleaming surface of wood it was time for the final touch he walked to a table where there were brandy glasses on a silver tray picked one up and held it to the light as he expected it was spotless he put it down and took out a small flat plastic case from his pocket he opened it and removed a strip of transparent tape holding it too up to the light there they were as clear as portraitsfor they were portraits as undeniable as any photograph they had been taken off a glass of perrier removed from an office at the gemeinschaft bank in zurich they were the fingerprints of jason bournes right hand the european picked up the brandy glass and with the patience of the artist he was pressed the tape around the lower surface then gently peeled it off again he held the glass up the prints were seen in dull perfection against the light of the table lamp he carried the glass over to a corner of the parquet floor and dropped it he knelt down studied the fragments removed several and brushed the rest under the curtain they were enough later said bourne throwing their suitcases on the bed weve got to get out of here marie sat in the armchair she had reread the newspaper article again selecting phrases repeating them her concentration was absolute she was consumed more and more confident of her analysis im right jason someone is sending us a message well talk about it later weve stayed here too long as it is that newspaperll be all over this hotel in an hour and the morning papers may be worse its no time for modesty you stand out in a hotel lobby and youve been seen in this one by too many people get your things marie stood up but made no other move instead she held her place and forced him to look at her well talk about several things later she said firmly you were leaving me jason and i want to know why i told you id tell you he answered without evasion because you have to know and i mean that but right now i want to get out of here get your things goddamn it she blinked his sudden anger having its effect yes of course she whispered they took the elevator down to the lobby as the worn marble floor came into view bourne had the feeling they were in a cage exposed and vulnerable if the machine stopped they would be taken then he understood why the feeling was so strong below on the left was the front desk the concierge sitting behind it a pile of newspapers on the counter to his right they were copies of the same tabloid jason had put in the attaché case marie was now carrying the concierge had taken one he was reading it avidly poking a toothpick between his teeth oblivious to everything but the latest scandal walk straight through said jason dont stop just go right to the door ill meet you outside oh my god she whispered seeing the concierge ill pay him as quickly as i can the sound of maries heels on the marble floor was a distraction bourne did not want the concierge looked up as jason moved in front of him blocking his view its been very pleasant he said in french but im in a great hurry i have to drive to lyon tonight just round out the figure to the nearest five hundred francs i havent had time to leave gratuities the financial distraction accomplished its purpose the concierge reached his totals quickly he presented the bill jason paid it and bent down for the suitcases glancing up at the sound of surprise that exploded from the concierges gaping mouth the man was staring at the pile of newspapers on his right his eyes on the photograph of marie st jacques he looked over at the glass doors of the entrance marie stood on the pavement he shifted his astonished gaze to bourne the connection was made the man inhibited by sudden fear jason walked rapidly toward the glass doors angling his shoulder to push them open glancing back at the front desk the concierge was reaching for a telephone lets go he cried to marie look for a cab they found one on rue lecourbe five blocks from the hotel bourne feigned the role of an inexperienced american tourist employing the inadequate french that had served him so well at the valois bank he explained to the driver that he and his petite amie wanted to get out of central paris for a day or so someplace where they could be alone perhaps the driver could suggest several places and they would choose one the driver could and did theres a small inn outside issylesmoulineaux called la maison carrée he said another in ivry sur seine you might like its very private monsieur or perhaps the auberge du coin in montrouge its very discreet lets take the first said jason its the first that came to your mind how long will it take no more than fifteen twenty minutes monsieur good bourne turned to marie and spoke softly change your hair what change your hair pull it up or push it back i dont care but change it move out of sight of his mirror hurry up several moments later maries long auburn hair was pulled severely back away from her face and neck fastened with the aid of a mirror and hairpins from her purse into a tight chignon jason looked at her in the dim light wipe off your lipstick all of it she took out a tissue and did so all right yes have you got an eyebrow pencil of course thicken your eyebrows just a little bit extend them about a quarter of an inch curve the ends down just a touch again she followed his instructions now she asked thats better he replied studying her the changes were minor but the effect major she had been subtly transformed from a softly elegant striking woman into a harsher image at the least she was not on first sight the woman in the newspaper photograph and that was all that mattered when we reach moulineaux he whispered get out quickly and stand up dont let the driver see you its a little late for that isnt it just do as i say listen to me i am a chameleon called cain and i can teach you many things i do not care to teach you but at the moment i must i can change my color to accommodate any backdrop in the forest i can shift with the wind by smelling it i can find my way through the natural and the manmade jungles alpha bravo charlie delta delta is for charlie and charlie is for cain i am cain i am death and i must tell you who i am and lose you my darling what is it what youre looking at me youre not breathing are you all right sorry he said glancing away breathing again im figuring out our moves ill know better what to do when we get there they arrived at the inn there was a parking lot bordered by a postandrail fence on the right several late diners came out of the latticeframed entrance in front bourne leaned forward in the seat let us off inside the parking area if you dont mind he ordered offering no explanation for the odd request certainly monsieur said the driver nodding his head then shrugging his movements conveying the fad that his passengers were indeed a cautious couple the rain had subsided returning to a mistlike drizzle the taxi drove off bourne and marie remained in the shadows of the foliage at the side of the inn until it disappeared jason put the suitcases down on the wet ground wait here he said where are you going to phone for a taxi the second taxi took them into the montrouge district this driver was singularly unimpressed by the sternfaced couple who were obviously from the provinces and probably seeking cheaper lodgings when and if he picked up a newspaper and saw a photograph of a frenchcanadiènne involved with murder and theft in zurich the woman in his back seat now would not come to mind the auberge du coin did not live up to its name it was not a quaint village inn situated in a secluded nook of the countryside instead it was a large flat twostory structure a quarter of a mile off the highway if anything it was reminiscent of motels the world over that blighted the outskirts of cities commerciality guaranteeing the anonymity of their guests it was not hard to imagine various appointments by the scores that were best left to erroneous registrations so they registered erroneously and were given a plastic room where every accessory worth over twenty francs was bolted into the floor or attached with headless screws to lacquered formica there was however one positive feature to the place an ice machine down the hall they knew it worked because they could hear it with the door closed all right now who would be sending us a message asked bourne standing revolving the glass of whiskey in his hand if i knew id get in touch with them she said sitting at the small desk chair turned legs crossed watching him closely it could be connected with why you were running away if it was it was a trap it was no trap a man like walther apfel didnt do what he did to accommodate a trap i wouldnt be so sure of that bourne walked to the single plastic armchair and sat down koenig did he marked me right there in the waiting room he was a bribed footsoldier not an officer of the bank he acted alone apfel wouldnt jason looked up what do you mean apfels statement had to be cleared by his superiors it was made in the name of the bank if youre so sure lets call zurich they dont want that either they havent the answer or they cant give it apfels last words were that they would have no further comment to anyone that too was part of the message were to contact someone else bourne drank he needed the alcohol for the moment was coming when he would begin the story of a killer named cain then were back to whom he said back to the trap you think you know who it is dont you marie reached for her cigarettes on the desk its why you were running isnt it the answer to both questions is yes the moment had come the message was sent by carlos i am cain and you must leave me i must lose you but first there is zurich and you have to understand that article was planted to find me i wont argue with that she broke in surprising him with the interruption ive had time to think they know the evidence is falseso patently false its ridiculous the zurich police fully expect me to get in touch with the canadian embassy now marie stopped the unlit cigarette in her hand my god jason thats what they want us to do who wants us to do whoevers sending us the message they know i have no choice but to call the embassy get the protection of the canadian government i didnt think of it because ive already spoken to the embassy to whats his namedennis corbelierand he had absolutely nothing to tell me he only did what i asked him to do there was nothing else but that was yesterday not today not tonight marie started for the telephone on the bedside table bourne rose quickly from the chair and intercepted her holding her arm dont he said firmly why not because youre wrong im right jason let me prove it to you bourne moved in front of her i think youd better listen to what i have to say no she cried startling him i dont want to hear it not now an hour ago in paris it was the only thing you wanted to hear hear it no an hour ago i was dying youd made up your mind to run without me and i know now it will happen over and over again until it stops for you you hear words you see images and fragments of things come back to you that you cant understand but because theyre there you condemn yourself you always will condemn yourself until someone proves to you that whatever you were there are others using you who will sacrifice you but theres also someone else out there who wants to help you help us thats the message i know im right i want to prove it to you let me bourne held her arms in silence looking at her face her lovely face filled with pain and useless hope her eyes pleading the terrible ache was everywhere within him perhaps it was better this way she would see for herself and her fear would make her listen make her understand there was nothing for them any longer i am cain all right you can make the call but its got to be done my way he released her and went to the telephone he dialed the auberge du coins front desk this is room ive just heard from friends in paris theyre coming out to join us in a while do you have a room down the hall for them fine their name is briggs an american couple ill come down and pay in advance and you can let me have the key splendid thank you what are you doing proving something to you he said get me a dress he continued the longest one youve got what if you want to make your call youll do as i tell you youre crazy ive admitted that he said taking trousers and a shirt from his suitcase the dress please fifteen minutes later mr and mrs briggs room six doors away and across the hall from room was in readiness the clothes had been properly placed selected lights left on others not functioning because the bulbs had been removed jason returned to their room marie was standing by the telephone were set what have you done what i wanted to do what i had to do you can make the call now its very late suppose he isnt there i think he will be if not theyll give you his home phone his name was in the telephone logs in ottawa it had

be right beside you listening go ahead she picked up the phone and dialed seven seconds after she reached the embassy switchboard dennis corbelier was on the line it was quarter past one in the morning christ almighty where are you you were expecting me to call then i was hoping to hell you would this place is in an uproar ive been waiting here since five oclock this afternoon so was alan in ottawa alan who what are you talking about where the hell are you first i want to know what you have to tell me tell you you have a message for me dennis what is it what is what what message maries face went pale i didnt kill anyone in zurich i wouldnt then for gods sake interrupted the attaché get in here well give you all the protection we can no one can touch you here dennis listen to me youve been waiting there for my call havent you yes of course someone told you to wait isnt that true a pause when corbelier spoke his voice was subdued yes he did they did what did they tell you that you need our help very badly marie resumed breathing and they want to help us by us replied corbelier youre saying hes with you then bournes face was next to hers his head angled to hear corbeliers words he nodded yes she answered were together but hes out for a few minutes its all lies they told you that didnt they all they said was that you had to be found protected they do want to help you they want to send a car for you one of ours diplomatic who are they i dont know them by name i dont have to i know their rank rank specialists fsfive you dont get much higher than that you trust them my god yes they reached me through ottawa their orders came from ottawa theyre at the embassy now no theyre outposted corbelier paused obviously exasperated jesus christ mariewhere are you bourne nodded again she spoke were at the auberge du coin in montrouge under the name of briggs ill get that car to you right away no dennis protested marie watching jason his eyes telling her to follow his instructions send one in the morning first thing in the morningfour hours from now if you like i cant do that for your own sake you have to you dont understand he was trapped into doing something and hes frightened he wants to run if he knew i called you hed be running now give me time i can convince him to turn himself in just a few more hours hes confused but underneath he knows im right marie said the words looking at bourne what kind of a son of a bitch is he a terrified one she answered one whos being manipulated i need the time give it to me marie corbelier stopped all right first thing in the morning say six oclock and marie they want to help you they can help you i know good night good night marie hung up now well wait bourne said i dont know what youre proving of course hell call the fsfives and of course theyll show up here what do you expect he as much as admitted what he was going to do what he thinks he has to do and these diplomatic fsfives are the ones sending us the message my guess is theyll take us to who is or if those sending it are too far away theyll put us in touch with them ive never been surer of anything in my professional life bourne looked at her i hope youre right because its your whole life that concerns me if the evidence against you in zurich isnt part of any message if it was put there by experts to find meif the zurich police believe itthen im that terrified man you spoke about to corbelier no one wants you to be right more than i do but i dont think you are at three minutes past two the lights in the motel corridor flickered and went out leaving the long hallway in relative darkness the spill from the stairwell the only source of illumination bourne stood by the door of their room pistol in hand the lights turned off watching the corridor through a crack between the doors edge and the frame marie was behind him peering over his shoulder neither spoke the footsteps were muffled but there distinct deliberate two sets of shoes cautiously climbing the staircase in seconds the figures of two men could be seen emerging our of the dim light marie gasped involuntarily jason reached over his shoulder his hand gripping her mouth harshly he understood she had recognized one of the two men a man she had seen only once before in zurichs steppdeckstrasse minutes before another had ordered her execution it was the blond man they had sent up to bournes room the expendable scout brought now to paris to spot the target he had missed in his left hand was a small pencil light in his right a longbarreled gun swollen by a silencer his companion was shorter more compact his walk not unlike an animals tread shoulders and waist moving fluidly with his legs the lapels of his topcoat were pulled up his head covered by a narrowbrimmed hat shading his unseen face bourne stared at this man there was something familiar about him about the figure the walk the way he carried his head what was it what was it he knew him but there was not time to think about it the two men were approaching the door of the room reserved in the name of mr and mrs briggs the blond man held his pencil light on the numbers then swept the beam down toward the knob and the lock what followed was mesmerizing in its efficiency the stocky man held a ring of keys in his right hand placing it under the beam of light his fingers selecting a specific key in his left hand he gripped a weapon its shape in the spill revealing an outsized silencer for a heavycalibered automatic not unlike the powerful sternlicht luger favored by the gestapo in world war two it could cut through webbed steel and concrete its sound no more than a rheumatic cough ideal for taking enemies of the state at night in quiet neighborhoods nearby residents unaware of any disturbance only of disappearance in the morning the shorter man inserted the key turned it silently then lowered the barrel of the gun to the lock three rapid coughs accompanied three flashes of light the wood surrounding any bolts shattered the door fell free the two killers rushed inside there were two beats of silence then an eruption of muffled gunfire spits and white flashes from the darkness the door was slammed shut it would not stay closed falling back as louder sounds of thrashing and collision came from within the room finally a light was found it was snapped on briefly then shot out in fury a lamp sent crashing to the floor glass shattering a cry of frenzy exploded from the throat of an infuriated man the two killers rushed out weapons leveled prepared for a trap bewildered that there was none they reached the staircase and raced down as a door to the right of the invaded room opened a blinking guest peered out then shrugged and went back inside silence returned to the darkened hallway bourne held his place his arm around marie st jacques she was trembling her head pressed into his chest sobbing quietly hysterically in disbelief he let the minutes pass until the trembling subsided and deep breaths replaced the sobs he could not wait any longer she had to see for herself see completely the impression indelible she had to finally understand i am cain i am death come on he whispered he led her out into the hallway guiding her firmly toward the room that was now his ultimate proof he pushed the broken door open and they walked inside she stood motionless both repelled and hypnotized by the sight in an open doorway on the right was the dim silhouette of a figure the light behind it so muted only the outline could be seen and only then when the eyes adjusted to the strange admixture of darkness and glow it was the figure of a woman in a long gown the fabric moving gently in the breeze of an open window window straight ahead was a second figure barely visible but there its shape an obscure blot indistinctly outlined by the wash of light from the distant highway again it seemed to move brief spastic flutterings of clothof arms oh god said marie frozen turn on the lights jason none of them work he replied only two table lamps they found one he walked across the room cautiously and reached the lamp he was looking for it was on the floor against the wall he knelt down and turned it on marie shuddered strung across the bathroom door held in place by threads torn from a curtain was her long dress rippling from an unseen source of wind it was riddled with bullet holes against the far window bournes shirt and trousers had been tacked to the frame the panes by both sleeves smashed the breeze rushing in causing the fabric to move up and down the white cloth of the shirt was punctured in a halfdozen places a diagonal line of bullets across the chest theres your message said jason now you know what it is and now i think youd better listen to what i have to say marie did not answer him instead she walked slowly to the dress studying it as if not believing what she saw without warning she suddenly spun around her eyes guttering the tears arrested no its wrong somethings terribly wrong call the embassy what do as i say now stop it marie youve got to understand no goddamn you youve got to understand it wouldnt happen this way it couldnt it did call the embassy use that phone over there and call it now ask for corbelier quickly for gods sake if i mean anything to you do as i ask bourne could not deny her her intensity was killing both herself and him what do i tell him he asked going to the telephone get him first thats what im afraid of oh god im frightened whats the number she gave it to him he dialed holding on interminably for the switchboard to answer when it finally did the operator was in panic her words rising and falling at moments incomprehensible in the background he could hear shouts sharp commands voiced rapidly in english and in french within seconds he learned why dennis corbelier canadian attaché had walked down the steps of the embassy on the avenue montaigne at in the morning and had been shot in the throat he was dead theres the other part of the message jason whispered marie drained staring at him and now ill listen to anything you have to say because there is someone out there trying to reach you trying to help you a message was sent but not to us not to me only to you and only you were to understand it one by one the four men arrived at the crowded hilton hotel on sixteenth street in washington dc each went to a separate elevator taking it two or three floors above or below his destination walking the remaining flights to the correct level there was no time to meet outside the limits of the district of columbia the crisis was unparalleled these were the men of treadstone seventyone those that remained alive the rest were dead slaughtered in a massacre on a quiet treelined street in new york two of the faces were familiar to the public one more than the other the first belonged to the aging senator from colorado the second was brigadier general i a crawfordirwin arthur freely translated as iron assacknowledged spokesman for army intelligence and defender of the g data ba nks the other two men were virtually unknown except within the corridors of their own operations one was a middleaged naval officer attached to information control th naval district the fourth and last man was a fortysixyearold veteran of the central intelligence agency a slender coiled spring of anger who walked with a cane his foot had been blown off by a grenade in southeast asia he had been a deepcover agent with the medusa operation at the time his name was alexander conklin there was no conference table in the room it was an ordinary double occupancy with the standard twin beds a couch two armchairs and a coffee table it was an unlikely spot to hold a meeting of such consequence there were no spinning computers to light up dark screens with green letters no electronic communications equipment that would reach consoles in london or paris or istanbul it was a plain hotel room devoid of everything but four minds that held the secrets of treadstone seventyone the senator sat on one end of the couch the naval officer at the other conklin lowered himself into an armchair stretching his immobile limb out in front of him the cane between his legs while brigadier general crawford remained standing his face flushed the muscles of his jaw pulsing in anger ive reached the president said the senator rubbing his forehead the lack of sleep apparent in his bearing i had to were meeting tonight tell me everything you can each of you you begin general what in the name of god happened major webb was to meet his car at hours on the corner of lexington and seventysecond street the time was firm but he didnt show up by the driver became alarmed because of the distance to the airfield in new jersey the sergeant remembered the addressmainly because hed been told to forget itdrove around and went to the door the security bolts had been jammed and the door just swung open all the alarms had been shorted out there was blood on the foyer floor the dead woman on the staircase he walked down the hallway into the operations room and found the bodies that man deserves a very quiet promotion said the naval officer why do you say that asked the senator crawford replied he had the presence of mind to call the pentagon and insist on speaking with covert transmissions domestic he specified the scrambler frequency the time and the place of reception and said he had to speak with the sender he didnt say a word to anyone until he got me on the phone put him in the war college irwin said conklin grimly holding his cane hes brighter than most of the clowns youve got over there thats not only unnecessary conklin admonished the senator but patently offensive go on please general crawford exchanged looks with the cia man i reached colonel paul mcclaren in new york ordered him over there and told him to do absolutely nothing until i arrived i then phoned conklin and george here and we flew up together i called a bureau print team in manhattan added conklin one weve used before and can trust i didnt tell them what we were looking for but i told them to sweep the place and give what they found only to me the cia man stopped lifting his cane in the direction of the naval officer then george fed them thirtyseven names all men whose prints we knew were in the fbi files they came up with the one set we didnt expect didnt want didnt believe deltas said the senator yes concurred the naval officer the na mes i submitted were those of anyoneno matter how remotewho might have learned the address of treadstone including incidentally all of us the room had been wiped clean every surface every knob every glassexcept one it was a broken brandy glass only a few fragments in the corner under a curtain but it was enough the prints were there third and index fingers right hand youre absolutely positive asked the senator slowly the prints cant lie sir said the officer they were there moist brandy still on the fragments outside of this room deltas the only one who knows about seventyfirst street can we be sure of that the others may have said something no possibility interrupted the brigadier general abbott would never have revealed it and elliot stevens wasnt given the address until fifteen minutes before he got there when he called from a phone booth beyond that assuming the worst he would hardly ask for his own execution what about major webb pressed the senator the major replied crawford was radioed the address solely by me after he landed at kennedy airport as you know it was a gtwo frequency and scrambled i remind you he also lost his life yes of course the aging senator shook his head its unbelievable why i should like to bring up a painful subject said brigadier general crawford at the outset i was not enthusiastic about the candidate i understood davids reasoning and agreed he was qualified but if you recall he wasnt my choice i wasnt aware we had that many choices said the senator we had a mana qualified man as you agreedwho was willing to go in deep cover for an indeterminate length of time risking his life every day severing all ties with his past how many such men exist we might have found a more balanced one countered the brigadier i pointed that out at the time you pointed out corrected conklin your own definition of a balanced man which i at the time pointed out was a crock we were both in medusa conklin said crawford angrily yet reasonably you dont have exclusive insights deltas conduct in the field was continuously and overtly hostile to command i was in a position to observe that pattern somewhat more clearly than you most of the time he had every right to be if youd spent more time in the field and less in saigon you would have understood that i understood it it may surprise you said the brigadier holding his hand up in a gesture of truce but im not defending the gross stupidities often rampant in saigonno one could im trying to describe a pattern of behavior that could lead to the night before last on seventyfirst street the cia mans eyes remained on crawford his hostility vanished as he nodded his head i know you are sorry thats the crux of it isnt it its not easy for me i worked with delta in half a dozen sectors was stationed with him in phnom penh before medusa was even a gleam in the monks eye he was never the same after phnom penh its why he went into medusa why he was willing to become cain the senator leaned forward on the couch ive heard it but tell me again the president has to know everything his wife and two children were killed on a pier in the mekong river bombed and strafed by a stray aircraftnobody knew which sidesthe identity never uncovered he hated that war hated everybody in it he snapped conklin paused looking at the brigadier and i think youre right general he snapped again it was in him what was asked the senator sharply the explosion i guess said conklin the dam burst hed gone beyond his limits and the hate took over its not hard you have to be very careful he killed those men that woman like a madman on a deliberate rampage none of them expected it except perhaps the woman who was upstairs and she probably heard the shouts hes not delta anymore we created a myth called cain only its not a myth any longer its really him after so many months the senator leaned back his voice trailing off why did he come back from where from zurich answered crawford webb was in zurich and i think hes the only one who could have brought him back the why we may never know unless he expected to catch all of us there he doesnt know who we are protested the senator his only contacts were the yachtsman his wife and david abbott and webb of course added the general of course agreed the senator but not at treadstone not even him it wouldnt matter said conklin tapping the rug once with his cane he knows theres a board webb might have told him wed all be there reasonably expecting that we would weve got a lot of questionssix months worth and now several million dollars delta would consider it the perfect solution he could take us and disappear no traces why are you so certain because one he was there replied the intelligence man raising his voice we have his prints on a glass of brandy that wasnt even finished and two its a classic trap with a couple of hundred variations would you explain that you remain silent broke in the general watching conklin until your enemy cant stand it any longer and exposes himself and weve become the enemy his enemy theres no question about it now said the naval officer for whatever reasons deltas turned its happened beforethank heaven not very often we know what to do the senator once more leaned forward on the couch what will you do his photograph has never been circulated explained crawford well circulate it now to every station and listening post every source and informant we have he has to go somewhere and hell start with a place he knows if only to buy another identity hell spend money hell be found when he is the orders will be clear youll bring him in at once well kill him said conklin simply you dont bring in a man like delta and you dont take the risk that another government will not with what he knows i cant tell the president that there are laws not for delta said the agent hes beyond the laws hes beyond salvage beyond thats right senator interrupted the general beyond salvage i think you know the meaning of the phrase youll have to make the decision whether or not to define it for the president it might be better to youve got to explore everything said the senator cutting off the officer i spoke to abbott last week he told me a strategy was in progress to reach delta zurich the bank the naming of treadstone its all part of it isnt it it is and its over said crawford if the evidence on seventyfirst street isnt enough for you that should be delta was given a clear signal to come in he didnt what more do you want i want to be absolutely certain i want him dead conklins words though spoken softly had the effect of a sudden cold wind he not only broke all the rules we each set down for ourselvesno matter whatbut he sunk into the pits he reeks he is cain weve used the name delta so muchnot even bourne but delta that i think weve forgotten gordon webb was his brother find him kill him book iii it was ten minutes to three in the morning when bourne approached the auberge du coins front desk marie continuing directly to the entrance to jasons relief there were no newspapers on the counter but the late night clerk behind it was in the same mold as his predecessor in the center of paris he was a balding heavyset man with halfclosed eyes leaning back in a chair his arms folded in front of him the weary depression of his interminable night hanging over him but this night thought bourne would be one hed remember for a long time to comebeyond the damage to an upstairs room which would not be discovered until morning a relief night clerk in montrouge had to have transportation ive just called rouen said jason his hands on the counter an angry man furious with uncontrollable events in his personal world i have to leave at once and need to rent a car why not snorted the man getting out of the chair what would you prefer monsieur a golden chariot or a magic carpet i beg your pardon we rent rooms not automobiles i must be in rouen before morning impossible unless you find a taxi crazy enough at this hour to take you i dont think you understand i could sustain considerable losses and embarrassment if im not at my office by eight oclock im willing to pay generously you have a problem monsieur surely theres someone here who would be willing to lend me his car for say a thousand fifteen hundred francs a thousand fifteen hundred monsieur the clerks halfclosed eyes widened until his skin was taut in cash monsieur naturally my companion would return it tomorrow evening theres no rush monsieur i beg your pardon of course theres really no reason why i couldnt hire a taxi confidentiality can be paid for i wouldnt know where to reach one interrupted the clerk in persuasive frenzy on the other hand my renault is not so new perhaps and perhaps not the fastest machine on the road but it is a serviceable car even a worthy car the chameleon had changed his colors again ha d been accepted again for someone he was not but he knew now who he was and he understood daybreak but there was no warm room at a village inn no wallpaper mottled by the early light streaking through a window filtered by the weaving leaves outside rather the first rays of the sun spread up from the east crowning the french countryside defining the fields and hills of saintgermainenlaye they sat in the small car parked off the shoulder of a deserted back road cigarette smoke curling out through the partially open windows he had begun that first narrative in switzerland with the words my life began six months ago on a small island in the mediterranean called ile de port noir he had begun this with a quiet declaration im known as cain he had told it all leaving out nothing he could remember including the terrible images that had exploded in his mind when he had heard the words spoken by jacqueline lavier in the candlelabraed restaurant in argenteuil names incidents cities assassinations everything fit there wasnt anything i didnt know nothing that wasnt somewhere in the back of my head trying to get out it was the truth it was the truth repeated marie he looked closely at her we were wrong dont you see perhaps but also right you were right and i was right about what you i have to say it again calmly and logically you offered your life for mine before you knew me thats not the decision of a man youve described if that man existed he doesnt any longer maries eyes pleaded while her voice remained controlled you said it jason what a man cant remember doesnt exist for him maybe thats what youre faced with can you walk away from it bourne nodded the dreadful moment had come yes he said but alone not with you marie inhaled on her cigarette watching him her hand trembling i see thats your decision then it has to be you will heroically disappear so i wont be tainted i have to thank you very much and who the hell do you think you are what who the hell do you think you are im a man they call cain im wanted by governmentsby the policefrom asia to europe men in washington want to kill me because of what they think i know about this medusa an assassin named carlos wants me shot in the throat because of what ive done to him think about it for a moment how long do you think i can keep running before someone in one of those armies out there finds me traps me kills me is that the way you want your life to end good god no shouted marie something obviously very much on her analytical mind i intend to rot in a swiss prison for fifty years or be hanged for things i never did in zurich theres a way to take care of zurich ive thought about it i can do it how she stabbed out her cigarette in the ashtray for gods sake what difference does it make a confession turning myself in i dont know yet but i can do it i can put your life back together i have to put it back not that way why not marie reached for his face her voice now soft once more the sudden stridency gone because ive just proved my point again even the condemned manso sure of his own guiltshould see it the man called cain would never do what you just offered to do for anyone i am cain even if i were forced to agree that you were youre not now the ultimate rehabilitation a selfinduced lobotomy total loss of recall that happens to be the truth but it wont stop anyone whos looking for me it wont stop himthemfrom pulling a trigger that happens to be the worst and im not ready to concede it then youre not looking at the facts im looking at two facts you seem to have disregarded i cant ill live with them for the rest of my life because im responsible two men were killed in the same brutal way because they stood between you and a message someone was trying to send you through me you saw corbeliers message how many bullet holes were there ten fifteen then he was used you heard him on the phone and so did i he wasnt lying he was trying to help us if not you certainly me its possible anythings possible i have no answers jason only discrepancies things that cant be explainedthat should be explained you havent once ever displayed a need or a drive for what you say you might have been and without those things a man like that couldnt be or you couldnt be him im him listen to me youre very dear to me my darling and that could blind me i know it but i also know something about myself im no wideeyed flower child ive seen a share of this world and i look very hard and very closely at those who attract me perhaps to confirm what i like to think are my valuesand they are values mine nobody elses she stopped for a moment and moved away from him ive watched a man being torturedby himself and by othersand he wont cry out you may have silent screams but you wont let them be anyone elses burden but your own instead you probe and dig and try to understand and that my friend is not the mind of a coldblooded killer any more than what youve done and want to do for me i dont know what you were before or what crimes youre guilty of but theyre not what you believewhat others want you to believe which brings me back to those values i spoke of i know myself i couldnt love the man you say you are i love the man i know you are you just confirmed it again no killer would make the offer you just made and that offer sir is respectfully rejected youre a goddamn fool exploded jason i can help you you cant help me leave me something for christs sake i wont not that way suddenly marie broke off her lips parted i think i just did she said whispering did what asked bourne angrily give us both something she turned back to him i just said it its been there a long time what others want you to believe what the hell are you talking about your crimes what others want you to believe are your crimes theyre there theyre mine wait a minute suppose they were there but they werent yours suppose the evidence was plantedas expertly as it was planted against me in zurichbut it belongs to someone else jasonyou dont know when you lost your memory port noir thats when you began to build one not when you lost it before port noir it could explain so much it could explain you the contradiction between you and the man people think you are youre wrong nothing could explain the memoriesthe imagesthat come back to me maybe you just remember what youve been told said marie over and over and over again until there was nothing else photographs recordings visual and aural stimulae youre describing a walking functioning vegetable whos been brainwashed thats not me she looked at him speaking gently im describing an intelligent very ill man whose background conformed with what other men were looking for do you know how easily such a man might be found theyre in hospitals everywhere in private sanitoriums in military wards she paused then continued quickly that newspaper article told another truth im reasonably proficient with computers anyone doing what i do would be if i were looking for a curveexample that incorporated isolated factors id know how to do it conversely someone looking for a man hospitalized for amnesia whose background incorporated specific skills languages racial characteristics the medical data banks could provide candidates god knows not many in your case perhaps only a few perhaps only one but one man was all they were looking for all they needed bourne glanced at the countryside trying to pry open the steel doors of his mind trying to find a semblance of the hope she felt what youre saying is that im a reproduced illusion he said making the statement flatly thats the end effect but its not what im saying im saying its possible youve been manipulated used it would explain so much she touched his hand you tell me there are times when things want to burst out of youblow your head apart wordsplaces namesthey trigger things jason isnt it possible they trigger the false things the things youve been told over and over again but you cant relive you cant see them clearly because theyre not you i doubt it ive seen what i can do ive done them before you could have done them for other reasons goddamn you im fighting for my life for both our lives all right you can think you can feel think now feel now look at me and tell me youve looked inside yourself inside your thoughts and feelings and you know without a doubt youre an assassin called cain if you can do thatreally do thatthen bring me to zurich take the blame for everything and get out of my life but if you cant stay with me and let me help you and love me for gods sake love me jason bourne took her hand holding it firmly as one might an angry trembling childs its not a question of feeling or thinking i saw the account at the gemeinschaft the entries go back a long time they correspond with all the things ive learned but that account those entries could have been created yesterday or last week or six months ago everything youve heard and read about yourself could be part of a pattern designed by those who want you to take cains place youre not cain but they want you to think you are want others to think you are but theres someone out there who knows youre not cain and hes trying to tell you i have my proof too my lovers alive but two friends are dead because they got between you and the one whos sending you the message whos trying to save your life they were killed by the same people who want to sacrifice you to carlos in place of cain you said before that everything fit it didnt jason but this does it explains you a hollow shell who doesnt even own the memories he thinks he has with demons running around inside kicking hell out of the walls its not a pleasant prospect those arent demons my darling theyre parts of youangry furious screaming to get out because they dont belong in the shell youve given them and if i blow that shell apart whatll i find many things some good some bad a great deal thats been hurt but cain wont be there i promise you that i believe in you my darling please dont give up he kept his distance a glass wall between them and if were wrong finally wrong what then leave me quickly or kill me i dont care i love you i know thats why im not afraid i found two telephone numbers in laviers office the first was for zurich the other here in paris with any luck they can lead me to the one number i need new york treadstone yes the answers there if im not cain someone at that number knows who i am they drove back to paris on the assumption that they would be far less obvious among the crowds of the city than in an isolated country inn a blondhaired man wearing tortoiseshell glasses and a striking but sternfaced woman devoid of makeup and with her hair pulled back like an intense graduate student at the sorbonne were not out of place in montmartre they took a room at the terrasse on the rue de maistre registering as a married couple from brussels in the room they stood for a moment no words necessary for what each was seeing and feeling they came together touching holding closing out the abusive world that refused them peace that kept them balancing on taut wires next to one another high above a dark abyss if either fell it was the end for both bourne could not change his color for the immediate moment it would be false and there was no room for artifice we need some rest he said weve got to get some sleep its going to be a long day they made love gently completely each with the other in the warm rhythmic comfort of the bed and there was a moment a foolish moment when adjustment of an angle was breathlessly necessary and they laughed it was a quiet laugh at first even an embarrassed laugh but the observation was there the appraisal of foolishness intrinsic to something very deep between them they held each other more fiercely when the moment passed more and more intent on sweeping away the awful sounds and the terrible sights of a dark world that kept them spinning in its winds they were suddenly breaking out of that world plunging into a much better one where sunlight and blue water replaced the darkness they raced toward it feverishly furiously and then they burst through and found it spent they fell asleep their fingers entwined bourne woke first aware of the horns and the engines in the paris traffic below in the streets he looked at his watch it was ten past one in the afternoon they had slept nearly five hours probably less than they needed but it was enough it was going to be a long day doing what he was not sure he only knew that there were two telephone numbers that had to lead him to a third in new york he turned to marie breathing deeply beside him her faceher striking lovely faceangled down on the edge of the pillow her lips parted inches from his lips he kissed her and she reached for him her eyes still closed youre a frog and ill make you a prince she said in a sleepfilled voice or is it the other way around as expanding as it may be thats not in my present frame of reference then youll have to stay a frog hop around little frog show off for me no temptations i only hop when im fed flies frogs eat flies i guess they do shudder thats awful come on open your eyes weve both got to start hopping weve got to start hunting she blinked and looked at him hunting for what for me he said from a telephone booth on the rue lafayette a collect call was placed to a number in zurich by a mr briggs bourne reasoned that jacqueline lavier would have wasted no time sending out her alarms one had to have been flashed to zurich when he heard the ring in switzerland jason stepped back and handed the phone to marie she knew what to say she had no chance to say it the international operator in zurich came on the line we regret that the number you have called is no longer in service it was the other day broke in marie this is an emergency operator do you have another number the telephone is no longer in service madame there is no alternate number i may have been given the wrong one its most urgent could you give me the name of the party who had this number im afraid thats not possible i told you its an emergency may i speak with your superior please he would not be able to help you this number is an unpublished listing good afternoon madame the connection was broken its been disconnected she said it took too goddamn long to find that out replied bourne looking up and down the street lets get out of here you think they could have traced it here in paris to a public phone within three minutes an exchange can be determined a district pinpointed in four they can narrow the blocks down to half a dozen how do you know that i wish i could tell you lets go jason why not wait out of sight and watch because i dont know what to watch for and they do theyve got a photograph to go by they could station men all over the area i dont look anything like the picture in the papers not you me lets go they walked rapidly within the erratic ebb and flow of the crowds until they reached the boulevard malesherbes ten blocks away and another telephone booth this with a different exchange from the first this time there were no operators to go through this was paris marie stepped inside coins in her hand and dialed she was prepared but the words that came over the line so astonished her la résidence du général villiers bonjour allô allô for a moment marie was unable to speak she simply stared at the telephone je mexcuse she whispered une erreur she hung up whats the matter asked bourne opening the glass door what happened who was it it doesnt make sense she said i just reached the house of one of the most respected and powerful men in france andré françois villiers repeated marie lighting a cigarette they had returned to their room at the terrasse to sort things out to absorb the astonishing information graduate of saintcyr hero of the second world war a legend in the resistance and until his break over algeria de gaulles heirapparent jason to connect such a man with carlos is simply unbelievable the connections there believe it its almost too difficult villiers is oldline honoroffrance a family traced back to the seventeenth century today hes one of the ranking deputies in the national assemblypolitically to the right of charlemagne to be surebut very much a lawandorder army man its like linking douglas macarthur to a mafia hit man it doesnt make sense then lets look for some what was the break with de gaulle algeria in the early sixties villiers was part of the oasone of the algerian colonels under salan they opposed the evian agreements that gave independence to algeria believing it rightfully belonged to france the mad colonels of algiers said bourne as with so many words and phrases not knowing where they came from or why he said them that means something to you it must but i dont know what it is think said marie why should the mad colonels strike a chord with you whats the first thing that comes to your mind quickly jason looked at her helplessly then the words came bombings infiltrations provocateurs you study them you study the mechanisms why i dont know are decisions based on what you learn i guess so what kind of decisions you decide what disruptions what does that mean to you disruptions i dont know i cant think all right all right well go back to it some other time there isnt time lets get back to villiers after algeria what there was a reconciliation of sorts with de gaulle villiers was never directly implicated in the terrorism and his military record demanded it he returned to francewas welcomed reallya fighter for a lost but respected cause he resumed his command rising to the rank of general before going into politics hes a working politician then more a spokesman an elder statesman hes still an entrenched militarist still fumes over frances reduced military stature howard leland said jason theres your connection to carlos how why leland was assassinated because he interfered with the quai dorsays arms buildups and exports we dont need anything more it seems incredible a man like that maries voice trailed off she was struck by recollection his son was murdered it was a political thing about five or six years ago tell me his car was blown up on the rue du bac it was in all the papers everywhere he was the working politician like his father a conservative opposing the socialists and communists at every turn he was a young member of parliament an obstructionist where government expenditures were concerned but actually quite popular he was a charming aristocrat who killed him the speculation was communist fanatics hed managed to block some legislation or other favorable to the extreme left wing after he was murdered the ranks fell apart and the legislation passed many think thats why villiers left the army and stood for the national assembly thats whats so improbable so contradictory after all his son was assassinated youd think the last person on earth hed want to have anything to do with was a professional assassin theres also something else you said he was welcomed back to paris because he was never directly implicated in the terrorism if he was interrupted marie it was buried theyre more tolerant of passionate causes over here where country and the bed are concerned and he was a legitimate hero dont forget that but once a terrorist always a terrorist dont you forget that i cant agree people change not about some things no terrorist ever forgets how effective hes been he lives on it how would you know that im not sure i want to ask myself right now then dont but i am sure about villiers pm going to reach him bourne crossed to the bedside table and picked up the telephone book lets see if hes listed or if that numbers private ill need his address you wont get near him if hes carlos connection hell be guarded theyll kill you on sight they have your photograph remember it wont help them i wont be what theyre looking for here it is villiers a f parc monceau i still cant believe it just knowing whom she was calling must have put the lavier woman in shock or frightened her to the point where shed do anything doesnt it strike you as odd that shed be given that number not under the circumstances carlos wants his drones to know he isnt kidding he wants cain marie stood up jason whats a drone bourne looked up at her i dont know someone who works blind for somebody else blind not seeing not knowing thinking hes doing one thing when hes really doing something else i dont understand lets say i tell you to watch for a car at a certain street corner the car never shows up but the fact that youre there tells someone else whos watching for you that something else has happened arithmetically an untraceable message yes i guess so thats what happened in zurich walther apfel was a drone he released that story about the theft not knowing what he was really saying which was its a good guess that you were being told to reach someone you know very well treadstone seventyone said jason were back to villiers carlos found me in zurich through the gemeinschaft that means he had to know about treadstone its a good chance that villiers does too if he doesnt there may be a way of getting him to find out for us how his name if hes everything you say he is he thinks pretty highly of it the honoroffrance coupled with a pig like carlos might have an effect ill threaten to go to the police to the papers hed simply deny it hed say its outrageous let him it isnt that was his number in laviers office besides any retraction will be on the same page as his obituary you still have to get to him i will im part chameleon remember the treelined street in parc monceau seemed familiar somehow but not in the sense that he had walked it before instead it was the atmosphere two rows of wellkept stone houses doors and windows glistening hardware shining staircases washed clean the lighted rooms beyond filled with hanging plants it was a monied street in a wealthy section of the city and he knew he had been exposed to one like it before and that exposure had meant something it was in the evening the march night cold the sky clear and the chameleon dressed for the occasion bournes blond hair was covered by a cap his neck concealed beneath the collar of a jacket that spelled out the name of a messenger service across his back slung over his shoulder was a canvas strap attached to a nearly empty satchel it was the end of this particular messengers run he had two or three stops to make perhaps four or five if he thought they were necessary he would know momentarily the envelopes were not really envelopes at all but brochures advertising the pleasures of the bateaux mouche picked up from a hotel lobby he would select at random several houses near general villiers residence and deposit the brochures in mail slots his eyes would record everything they saw one thing sought above everything else what kind of security arrangements did villiers have who guarded the general and how many were there and because he had been convinced he would find either men in cars or other men walking their posts he was startled to realize there was no one andré françois villiers militarist spokesman for his cause and the prime connection to carlos had no external security arrangements whatsoever if he was protected that protection was solely within the house considering the enormity of his crime villiers was either arrogant to the point of carelessness or a damn fool jason climbed the steps of an adjacent residence villiers door no more than twenty feet away he deposited the brochure in the slot glancing up at the windows of villiers house looking for a face a figure there was no one the door twenty feet away suddenly opened bourne crouched thrusting his hand beneath his jacket for his gun thinking he was a damn fool someone more observant than he had spotted him but the words he heard told him it wasnt so a middleaged couplea uniformed maid and a darkjacketed manwere talking in the doorway make sure the ashtrays are clean said the woman you know how he dislikes ashtrays that are stuffed full he drove this afternoon answered the man that means theyre full now clean them in the garage youve got time he wont be down for another ten minutes he doesnt have to be in nanterre until eightthirty the man nodded pulling up the lapels of his jacket as he started down the steps ten minutes he said aimlessly the door closed and silence returned to the quiet street jason stood up his hand on the railing watching the man hurry down the sidewalk he was not sure where nanterre was only that it was a suburb of paris and if villiers was driving there himself and if he was alone there was no point in postponing confrontation bourne shifted the strap on his shoulder and walked rapidly down the steps turning left on the pavement ten minutes jason watched through the windshield as the door opened and general of the army andré françois villiers came into view he was a mediumsized barrelchested man in his late sixties perhaps early seventies he was hatless with closecropped gray hair and a meticulously groomed white chin beard his bearing was unmistakably military imposing his body on the surrounding space entering it by breaking it invisible walls collapsing as he moved bourne stared at him fascinated wondering what insanities could have possibly driven such a man into the obscene world of carlos whatever the reasons they had to be powerful for he was powerful and that made him dangerousfor he was respected and had the ears of his government villiers turned speaking to the maid and glancing at his wristwatch the woman nodded closing the door as the general walked briskly down the steps and around the hood of a large sedan to the drivers side he opened the door and climbed in then started the engine and rolled slowly out into the middle of the street jason waited until the sedan reached the corner and turned right he eased the renault away from the curb and accelerated reaching the intersection in time to see villiers turn right again a block east there was a certain irony in the coincidence an omen if one could believe in such things the route general villiers chose to the outlying suburb of nanterre included a stretch of back road in the countryside nearly identical to the one in saintgermainenlaye where twelve hours ago marie had pleaded with jason not to give uphis life or hers there were stretches of pastureland fields that fused into the gently rising hills but instead of being crowned by early light these were washed in the cold white rays of the moon it occurred to bourne that this stretch of isolated road would be as good a spot as any on which to intercept the returning general it was not difficult for jason to follow at distances up to a quarter of a mile which was why he was surprised to realize he had practically caught up with the old soldier villiers had suddenly slowed down and was turning into a graveled drive cut out of the woods the parking lot beyond illuminated by floodlights a sign hanging from two chains on a highangle post was caught in the spill larbalète the general was meeting someone for dinner at an outoftheway restaurant not in the suburb of nanterre but close by in the country bourne drove past the entrance and pulled off the shoulder of the road the right side of the car covered by foliage he had to think things out he had to control himself there was a fire in his mind it was growing spreading he was suddenly consumed by an extraordinary possibility considering the shattering eventsthe enormity of the embarrassment experienced by carlos last night at the motel in montrouge it was more than likely that andré villiers had been summoned to an outoftheway restaurant for an emergency meeting perhaps even with carlos himself if that was the case the premises would be guarded and a man whose photograph had been distributed to those guards would be shot the instant he was recognized on the other hand the chance to observe a nucleus belonging to carlosor carlos himselfwas an opportunity that might never come again he had to get inside larbalète there was a compulsion within him to take the risk any risk it was crazy but then he was not sane sane as a man with a memory was sane carlos find carlos god in heaven why he felt the gun in his belt it was secure he got out and put on his topcoat covering the jacket with the lettering across the back he picked up a narrowbrimmed hat from the seat the cloth soft angled down all sides it would cover his hair then he tried to remember if he had been wearing the tortoiseshell glasses when the photograph was taken in argenteuil he had not he had removed them at the table when successive bolts of pain had seared through his head brought on by words that told him of a past too familiar too frightening to face he felt his shirt pocket the glasses were there if he needed them he pressed the door closed and started for the woods the glare of the restaurant floodlights filtered through the trees growing brighter with each several yards less foliage to block the light bourne reached the edge of the short patch of forest the graveled parking lot in front of him he was at the side of the rustic restaurant a row of small windows running the length of the building flickering candles beyond the glass illuminating the figures of the diners then his eyes were drawn to the second flooralthough it did not extend the length of the building but only halfway the rear section an open terrace the enclosed part however was similar to the first floor a line of windows a bit larger perhaps but still in a row and again glowing with candles figures were milling about but they were different from the diners below they were all men standing not sitting moving casually glasses in hands cigarette smoke spiraling over their heads it was impossible to tell how manymore than ten less than twenty perhaps there he was crossing from one group to another the white chin beard a beacon switching on and off as it was intermittently blocked by figures nearer the windows general villiers had indeed driven out to nanterre for a meeting and the odds favored a conference that dealt with the failures of the past fortyeight hours failures that permitted a man named cain to remain alive the odds what were the odds where were the guards how many and where were their stations keeping behind the edge of the woods bourne sidestepped his way toward the front of the restaurant bending branches silently his feet over the underbrush he stood motionless watching for men concealed in the foliage or in the shadows of the building he saw none and retraced his path breaking new ground until he reached the rear of the restaurant a door opened the spill of light harsh and a man in a white jacket emerged he stood for a moment cupping his hands lighting a cigarette bourne looked to the left to the right above to the terrace no one appeared a guard stationed in the area would have been alarmed by the sudden light ten feet below the conference there were no guards outside protection foundas it had to be at villiers house in parc monceauwithin the building itself another man appeared in the doorway also wearing a white jacket but with the addition of a chefs hat his voice was angry his french laced with the guttural dialect of gascony while you piss off we sweat the pastry cart is half empty fill it now you bastard the pastry man turned and shrugged he crushed out his cigarette and went back inside closing the door behind him the light vanished only the wash of the moon remained but it was enough to illuminate the terrace there was no one there no guard patrolling the wide double doors that led to the inside room carlos find carlos trap carlos cain is for charlie and delta is for cain bourne judged the distance and the obstacles he was no more than forty feet from the rear of the building ten or twelve below the railing that bordered the terrace there were two vents in the exterior wall vapor escaping from both and next to them a drainpipe that was within reach of the railing if he could scale the pipe and manage to get a toehold in the lower vent he would be able to grab a rung of the railing and pull himself up to the terrace but he could do none of this wearing the topcoat he took it off placing it at his feet the softbrimmed hat on top and covered both with underbrush then he stepped to the edge of the woods and raced as quietly as possible across the gravel to the drainpipe in the shadows he tugged at the fluted metal it was strongly in place he reached as high as he could then sprang up gripping the pipe his feet pressed into the wall peddling one on top of the other until his left foot was parallel to the first vent holding on he slipped his foot into the recess and propelled himself further up the drain he was within eighteen inches of the railings one surge launched from the vent and he could reach the bottom rung the door crashed open beneath him white light shooting across the gravel into the woods a figure plummeted out weaving to maintain its balance followed by the whitehatted chef who was screaming you pissant youre drunk thats what you are youve been drunk the whole shitfilled night pastries all over the dining room floor everything a mess get out youll not get a sou the door was pulled shut the sound of a bolt unmistakably final jason held on to the pipe arms and ankles aching rivulets of sweat breaking out on his forehead the man below staggered backward making obscene gestures repeatedly with his right hand for the benefit of the chef who was no longer there his glazed eyes wandered up the wall settling on bournes face jason held his breath as their eyes met the man stared then blinked and stared again he shook his head closing his lids then opened them wide taking in the sight he was not entirely sure was there he backed away lurching into a sideslip and a forward walk obviously deciding that the apparition halfway up the wall was the result of his pressured labors he weaved around the corner of the building a man more at peace with himself for having rejected the foolishness that had assaulted his eyes bourne breathed again letting his body slump against the wall in relief but it was only for a moment the ache in his ankle had descended to his foot a cramp forming he lunged grabbing the iron bar that was the base of the railing with his right hand whipping his left up from the drainpipe joining it he pressed his knees into the shingles and pulled himself slowly up the wall until his head was over the edge of the terrace it was deserted he kicked his right leg up to the ledge his right hand reaching for the wrought iron top balanced he swung over the railing he was on a terrace used for dining in the spring and summer months a tiled floor that could accommodate ten to fifteen tables in the center of the wall separating the enclosed section from the terrace were the wide double doors he had seen from the woods the figures inside were now motionless standing still and for an instant jason wondered whether an alarm had been set off whether they were waiting for him he stood immobile his hand on his gun nothing happened he approached the wall staying in the shadows once there he pressed his back against the wood and edged his way toward the first door until his fingers touched the frame slowly he inched his head to the pane of glass level with his eyes and looked inside what he saw was both mesmerizing and not a little frightening the men were in linesthree separate lines four men to a linefacing andré villiers who was addressing them thirteen men in all twelve of them not merely standing but standing at attention they were old men but not merely old men they were old soldiers none wore uniforms instead in each lapel they wore ribbons regimental colors above decorations for valor and rank and if there was one allpervasive note about the scene it too was unmistakable these were men used to commandused to power it was in their faces their eyes in the way they listenedrespect rendered but not blindly judgment ever present their bodies were old but there was strength in that room immense strength that was the frightening aspect if these men belonged to carlos the assassins resources were not only farreaching they were extraordinarily dangerous for these were not ordinary men they were seasoned professional soldiers unless he was grossly mistaken thought bourne the depth of experience and range of influence in that room was staggering the mad colonels of algierswhat was left of them men driven by memories of a france that no longer existed a world that was no more replaced by one they found weak and ineffectual such men could make a pact with carlos if only for the covert power it gave them strike attack dispatch decisions of life and death that were once a part of their fabric brought back by a force that could serve causes they refused to admit were no longer viable once a terrorist always a terrorist and assassination was the raw core of terror the general was raising his voice jason tried to hear the words through the glass they became clearer our presence will be felt our purpose understood we are together in our stand and that stand is immovable we shall be heard in memory of all those who have fallenour brothers of the tunic and the cannonwho laid down their lives for the glory of france we shall force our beloved country to remember and in their names to remain strong lackey to no one those who oppose us will know our anger in this too we are united we pray to almighty god that those who have gone before us have found peace for we are still in conflict gentlemen i give you our ladyour france there was a unison of muttered approvals the old soldiers remaining rigidly at attention and then another voice was raised the first five words sung singly joined at the sixth by the rest of the group allons enfants de la patrie le jour de gloire est arrivé bourne turned away sickened by the sight and the sounds inside that room lay waste in the name of glory the death of fallen comrades perforce demands further death it is required and if it means a pact with carlos so be it what disturbed him so why was he suddenly swept by feelings of anger and futility what triggered the revulsion he felt so strongly and then he knew he hated a man like andré villiers despised the men in that room they were all old men who made war stealing life from the young and the very young why were the mists closing in again why was the pain so acute there was no time for questions no strength to tolerate them he had to push them out of his mind and concentrate on andré françois villiers warrior and warlord whose causes belonged to yesterday but whose pact with an assassin called for death today he would trap the general break him learn everything he knew and probably kill him men like villiers robbed life from the young and the very young they did not deserve to live i am in my labyrinth again and the walls are imbedded with spikes oh god they hurt jason climbed over the railing in the darkness and lowered himself to the drainpipe each muscle aching pain too had to be erased he had to reach a deserted stretch of road in the moonlight and trap a broker of death bourne waited in the renault two hundred yards east of the restaurant entrance the motor running prepared to race ahead the instant he saw villiers drive out several others had already left all in separate cars conspirators did not advertise their association and these old men were conspirators in the truest sense they had traded whatever honors they had earned for the lethal convenience of an assassins gun and an assassins organization age and bias had robbed them of reason as they had spent their lives robbing life from the young and the very young what was it why wont it leave me some terrible thing is deep inside me trying to break out trying i think to kill me the fear and the guilt sweep through me but of what and for what i do not know why should these withered old men provoke such feelings of fear and guilt and loathing they were war they were death on the ground and from the skies from the skies from the skies help me marie for gods sake help me there it was the headlights swung out of the drive the long black chassis reflecting the wash of the floodlights jason kept his own lights off as he pulled out of the shadows he accelerated down the road until he reached the first curve where he switched on the headlights and pressed the pedal to the floor the isolated stretch in the countryside was roughly two miles away he had to get there quickly it was ten past eleven and as three hours before the fields swept into the hills both bathed in the light of the march moon now in the center of the sky he reached the area it was feasible the shoulder was wide bordering a pasture which meant that both automobiles could be pulled off the road the immediate objective however was to get villiers to stop the general was old but not feeble if the tactic were suspect he would break over the grass and race away everything was timing and a totally convincing moment of the unexpected bourne swung the renault around in a uturn waited until he saw the headlights in the distance then suddenly accelerated swinging the wheel violently back and forth the automobile careened over the roadan outofcontrol driver incapable of finding a straight line but nevertheless speeding villiers had no choice he slowed down as jason came racing insanely toward him then abruptly when the two cars were no more than twenty feet from colliding bourne spun the wheel to the left braking as he did so sliding into a skid tires screeching he came to a stop the window open and raised his voice in an undefined cry half shout half scream it could have been the vocal explosion of an ill man or a drunk man but the one thing it was not was threatening he slapped his hand on the frame of the window and was silent crouching in the seat his gun on his lap he heard the door of villiers sedan open and peered through the steering wheel the old man was not visibly armed he seemed to suspect nothing relieved only that a collision had been avoided the general walked through the beams of the headlights to the renaults left window his shouts anxious his french the interrogating commands of saintcyr whats the meaning of this what do you think youre doing are you all right his hands gripped the base of the window yes but youre not replied bourne in english raising the gun what the old man gasped standing erect who are you and wha t is this jason got out of the renault his left hand extended above the barrel of the weapon im glad your english is fluent walk back to your car drive it off the road and if i refuse ill kill you right now it wouldnt take much to provoke me do these words come from the red brigades or the paris branch of the baadermeinhof why could you countermand them if they did i spit at them and you no ones ever doubted your courage general walk to your car its not a matter of courage said villiers without moving its a question of logic youll accomplish nothing by killing me less by kidnapping me my orders are firm fully understood by my staff and my family the israelis are absolutely right there can be no negotiations with terrorists use your gun garbage or get out of here jason studied the old soldier suddenly profoundly uncertain but not about to be fooled it would be in the furious eyes that stared at him one name soaked in filth coupled with another name heaped with the honors of his nation would cause another kind of explosion it would be in the eyes back at that restaurant you said france shouldnt be a lackey to anyone but a general of france became someones lackey general andré villiers messenger for carlos carlos contact carlos soldier carlos lackey the furious eyes did grow wide but not in any way jason expected fury was suddenly joined by hatred not shock not hysteria but deep uncompromising abhorrence the back of villiers hand shot up arching from his waist the crack against bournes face sharp accurate painful it was followed by a forward slap brutal insulting the force of the blow reeling jason back on his feet the old man moved in blocked by the barrel of the gun but unafraid undeterred by its presence consumed only with inflicting punishment the blows came one after another delivered by a man possessed pig screamed villiers filthy detestable pig garbage ill shoot ill kill you stop it but bourne could not pull the trigger he was backed into the small car his shoulders pressed against the roof still the old man attacked his hands flying out swinging up crashing down kill meif you canif you dare dirt filth jason threw the gun to the ground raising his arms to fend off villiers assault he lashed his left hand out grabbing the old mans right wrist then his left gripping the left forearm that was slashing down like a broadsword he twisted both violently bending villiers into him forcing the old soldier to stand motionless their faces inches from each other the old mans chest heaving are you telling me youre not carlos man are you denying it villiers lunged forward trying to break bournes grip his barrellike chest smashing into jason i revile you animal goddamn youyes or no the old man spat in bournes face the fire in his eyes now clouded tears welling carlos killed my son he said in a whisper he killed my only son on the rue du bac my sons life was blown up with five sticks of dynamite on the rue du bac jason slowly reduced the pressure of his fingers breathing heavily he spoke as calmly as he could drive your car into the field and stay there we have to talk general somethings happened you dont know about and wed both better learn what it is never impossible it could not happen it happened said bourne sitting with villiers in the front seat of the sedan an incredible mistake has been made you dont know what youre saying no mistakeand i do know what im saying because i found the number myself its not only the right number its a magnificent cover nobody in his right mind would connect you with carlos especially in light of your sons death is it common knowledge he was carlos kill i would prefer different language monsieur sorry i mean that common knowledge among the sûreté a qualified yes within military intelligence and interpol most certainly i read the reports what did they say it was presumed that carlos did a favor for his friends from his radical days even to the point of allowing them to appear silently responsible for the act it was politically motivated you know my son was a sacrifice an example to others who opposed the fanatics fanatics the extremists were forming a false coalition with the socialists making promises they had no intention of keeping my son understood this exposed it and initiated legislation to block the alignment he was killed for it is that why you retired from the army and stood for election with all my heart it is customary for the son to carry on for the father the old man paused the moonlight illuminating his haggard face in this matter it was the fathers legacy to carry on for the son he was no soldier nor i a politician but i am no stranger to weapons and explosives his causes were molded by me his philosophy reflected my own and he was killed for these things my decision was clear to me i would carry on our beliefs into the political arena and let his enemies contend with me the soldier was prepared for them more than one soldier i gather what do you mean those men back there at the restaurant they looked like they ran half the armies in france they did monsieur they were once known as the angry young commanders of saintcyr the republic was corrupt the military incompetent the maginot a joke had they been heeded in their time france would not have fallen they became the leaders of the resistance they fought the boche and vichy all through europe and africa what do they do now most live on pensions many obsessed with the past they pray to the virgin that it will never be repeated in too many areas however they see it happening the military is reduced to a sideshow communists and socialists in the assembly forever eroding the strength of the services the moscow apparatus runs true to form it does not change with the decades a free society is ripe for infiltration and once infiltrated the changes do not stop until that society is remade into another image conspiracy is everywhere it cannot go unchallenged some might say that sounds pretty extreme itself for what survival strength honor are these terms too anachronistic for you i dont think so but i can imagine a lot of damage being done in their names our philosophies differ and i dont care to debate them you asked me about my associates and i answered you now please this incredible misinformation of yours its appalling you dont know what its like to lose a son to have a child killed the pain comes back to me and i dont know why pain and emptiness a vacuum in the sky from the sky death in and from the skies jesus it hurts it what is it i can sympathize said jason his hands gripped to stop the sudden trembling but it fits not for an instant as you said no one in his right mind would connect me to carlos least of all the killer pig himself its a risk he would not take its unthinkable exactly which is why youre being used it is unthinkable youre the perfect relay for final instructions impossible how someone at your phone is in direct contact with carlos codes are used certain words spoken to get that person on the phone probably when youre not there possibly when you are do you answer the telephone yourself villiers frowned actually i dont not that number there are too many people to be avoided and i have a private line who does answer it generally the housekeeper or her husband who serves as part butler part chauffeur he was my driver during my last years in the army if not either of them my wife of course or my aide who often works at my office at the house he was my adjutant for twenty years who else there is no one else maids none permanent if theyre needed theyre hired for an occasion theres more wealth in the villiers name than in the banks cleaning woman two they come twice a week and not always the same two youd better take a closer look at your chauffeur and the adjutant preposterous their loyalty is beyond question so was brutus and caesar outranked you you cant be serious im goddamned serious and youd better believe it everything ive told you is the truth but then you havent really told me very much have you your name for instance its not necessary knowing it could only hurt you in what way in the very remote chance that im wrong about the relayand that possibility barely exists the old man nodded the way old men do when repeating words that have stunned them to the point of disbelief his lined face moved up and down in the moonlight an unnamed man traps me on a road at night holds me under a gun and makes an obscene accusationa charge so filthy i wish to kill himand he expects me to accept his word the word of a man without a name with no face i recognize and no credentials offered other than the statement that carlos is hunting him tell me why should i believe this man because answered bourne hed have no reason to come to you if he didnt believe it was the truth villiers stared at jason no theres a better reason a while ago you gave me my life you threw down your gun you did not fire it you could have easily you chose instead to plead with me to talk i dont think i pleaded it was in your eyes young man its always in the eyes and often in the voice but one must listen carefully supplication can be feigned not anger it is either real or its a posture your anger was real as was mine the old man gestured toward the small renault ten yards away in the field follow me back to parc monceau well talk further in my office id swear on my life that youre wrong about both men but then as you pointed out caesar was blinded by false devotion and indeed he did outrank me if i walk into that house and someone recognizes me im dead so are you my aide left shortly past five oclock this afternoon and the chauffeur as you call him retires no later than ten to watch his interminable television youll wait outside while i go in and check if things are normal ill summon you if theyre not ill come back out and drive away follow me again ill stop somewhere and well continue jason watched closely as villiers spoke why do you want me to go back to parc monceau where else i believe in the shock of unexpected confrontation one of those men is lying in bed watching television in a room on the third floor and theres another reason i want my wife to hear what you have to say shes an old soldiers woman and she has antennae for things that often escape the officer in the field ive come to rely on her perceptions she may recognize a pattern of behavior once she hears you bourne had to say the words i trapped you by pretending one thing you can trap me by pretending another how do i know parc monceau isnt a trap the old man did not waver you have the word of a general officer of france and thats all you have if its not good enough for you take your weapon and get out its good enough said bourne not because its a generals word but because its the word of a man whose son was killed in the rue du bac the drive back into paris seemed far longer to jason than the journey out he was fighting images again images that caused him to break out into sweat and pain starting at his temples sweeping down through his chest forming a knot in his stomachsharp bolts pounding until he wanted to scream death in the skies from the skies not darkness but blinding sunlight no winds that batter my body into further darkness but instead silence and the stench of jungle and riverbanks stillness followed by the screeching of birds and the screaming pitch of machines birds machines racing downward out of the sky in blinding sunlight explosions death of the young and the very young stop it hold the wheel concentrate on the road but do not think thought is too painful and you dont know why they entered the treelined street in parc monceau villiers was a hundred feet ahead facing a problem that had not existed several hours ago there were many more automobiles in the street now parking at a premium there was however one sizable space on the left across from the generals house it could accommodate both their cars villiers thrust his hand out the window gesturing for jason to pull in behind him and then it happened jasons eyes were drawn by a light in doorway his focus suddenly rigid on the figures in the spill the recognition of one so startling and so out of place he found himself reaching for the gun in his belt had he been led into a trap after all had the word of a general officer of france been worthless villiers was maneuvering his sedan into place bourne spun around in the seat looking in all directions there was no one coming toward him no one closing in it was not a trap it was something else part of what was happening about which the old soldier knew nothing for across the street and up the steps of villiers house stood a youngish womana striking womanin the doorway she was talking rapidly with small anxious gestures to a man standing on the top step who kept nodding as if accepting instructions that man was the grayhaired distinguishedlooking switchboard operator from les classiques the man whose face jason knew so well yet did not know the face that had triggered other images images as violent and as painful as those which had ripped him apart during the past half hour in the renault but there was a difference this face brought back the darkness and torrential winds in the night sky explosions coming one after another sounds of a staccato gunfire echoing through the myriad tunnels of a jungle bourne pulled his eyes away from the door and looked at villiers through the windshield the general had switched off his headlights and was about to get out of the car jason released the clutch and rolled forward until he made contact with the sedans bumper villiers whipped around in his seat bourne extinguished his own headlights and turned on the small inside roof light he raised his handpalm downwardthen raised it twice again telling the old soldier to stay where he was villiers nodded and jason switched off the light he looked back over at the doorway the man had taken a step down stopped by a last command from the woman bourne could see her clearly now she was in her middle to late thirties with short dark hair stylishly cut framing a face that was bronzed by the sun she was a tall woman statuesque actually her figure tapered the swell of her breasts accentuated by the sheer closefitting fabric of a long white dress that heightened the tan of her skin if she was part of the house villiers had not mentioned her which meant she was not she was a visitor who knew when to come to the old mans home it would fit the strategy of relayremovedfromrelay and that meant she had a contact in villiers house the old man had to know her but how well the answer obviously was not well enough the grayhaired switchboard operator gave a final nod descended the steps and walked rapidly down the block the door closed the light of the carriage lamps shining on the deserted staircase and the glistening black door with the brass hardware why did those steps and that door mean something to him images reality that was not real bourne got out of the renault watching the windows looking for the movement of a curtain there was nothing he walked quickly to villiers car the front window was rolled down the generals face turned up his thick eyebrows arched in curiosity what in heavens name are you doing he asked over there at your house said jason crouching on the pavement you saw what i just saw i believe so and who was the woman do you know her i would hope to god i did shes my wife your wife bournes shock was on his face i thought you said i thought you said she was an old woman that you wanted her to listen to me because over the years youd learned to respect her judgment in the field you said thats what you said not exactly i said she was an old soldiers woman and i do indeed respect her judgment but shes my second wifemy very much younger second wifebut every bit as devoted as my first who died eight years ago oh my god dont let the disparity of our ages concern you she is proud and happy to be the second madame villiers shes been a great help to me in the assembly im sorry whispered bourne christ im sorry what about you mistook her for someone else people frequently do shes a stunning girl im quite proud of her villiers opened the door as jason stood up on the pavement you wait here said the general ill go inside and check if everythings normal ill open the door and signal you if it isnt ill come back to the car and well drive away bourne remained motionless in front of villiers preventing the old man from stepping forward general ive got to ask you something im not sure how but i have to i told you i found your number at a relay drop used by carlos i didnt tell you where only that it was confirmed by someone who admitted passing messages to and from contacts of carlos bourne took a breath his eyes briefly on the door across the street now ive got to ask you a question and please think carefully before you answer does your wife buy clothes at a shop called les classiques in sainthonoré yes i happen to know she does not are you sure very much so not only have i never seen a bill from there but shes told me how much she dislikes its designs my wife is very knowledgeable in matters of fashion oh jesus what general i cant go inside that house no matter what you find i cant go in there why not what are you saying the man on the steps who was talking to your wife hes from the drop its les classiques hes a contact to carlos the blood drained from andré villiers face he turned and stared across the treelined street at his house at the glistening black door and the brass fittings that reflected the light of the carriage lamps the pockmarked beggar scratched the stubble of his beard took off his threadbare beret and trudged through the bronze doors of the small church in neuillysurseine he walked down the far right aisle under the disapproving glances of two priests both clerics were upset this was a wealthy parish and biblical compassion notwithstanding wealth did have its privileges one of them was to maintain a certain status of worshiperfor the benefit of other worshipersand this elderly disheveled derelict hardly fit the mold the beggar made a feeble attempt to genuflect sat down in a pew in the second row crossed himself and knelt forward his head in prayer his right hand pushing back the left sleeve of his overcoat on his wrist was a watch somewhat in contradistinction to the rest of his apparel it was an expensive digital the numbers large and the readout bright it was a possession he would never be foolish enough to part with for it was a gift from carlos he had once been twentyfive minutes late for confession upsetting his benefactor and had no other excuse but the lack of an accurate timepiece during their next appointment carlos had pushed it beneath the translucent scrim separating sinner from holy man it was the hour and the minute the beggar rose and walked toward the second booth on the right he parted the curtain and went inside angelus domini angelus domini child of god the whisper from behind the black cloth was harsh are your days comfortable they are made comfortable very well interrupted the silhouette what did you bring me my patience draws to an end i pay thousandshundreds of thousandsfor incompetence and failure what happened in montrouge who was responsible for the lies that came from the embassy in the montaigne who accepted them the auberge du coin was a trap yet not one for killing it is difficult to know exactly what it was if the attaché named corbelier repeated lies our people are convinced he was not aware of it he was duped by the woman he was duped by cain bourne traces each source feeding each false information thus exposing each and confirming the exposure but why to whom we know what and who he is now but he relays nothing to washington he refuses to surface to suggest an answer said the beggar i would have to go back many years but its possible he wants no interference from his superiors american intelligence has its share of vacillating autocrats rarely communicating fully with each other in the days of the cold war money was made selling information three and four times over to the same stations perhaps cain waits until he thinks there is only one course of action to be taken no differing strategies to be argued by those above age hasnt dulled your sense of maneuver old friend its why i called upon you or perhaps continued the beggar he really has turned its happened i dont think so but it doesnt matter washington thinks he has the monk is dead theyre all dead at treadstone cain is established as the killer the monk said the beggar a name from the past he was active in berlin in vienna we knew him well healthier for it from a distance theres your answer carlos it was always the monks style to reduce the numbers to as few as possible he operated on the theory that his circles were infiltrated compromised he must have ordered cain to report only to him it would explain washingtons confusion the months of silence would it explain ours for months there was no word no activity a score of possibilities illness exhaustion brought back for new training even to spread confusion to the enemy the monk had a cathedralful of tricks yet before he died he said to an associate that he did not know what had happened that he wasnt even certain the man was cain who was the associate a man named gillette he was our man but abbott couldnt have known it another possible explanation the monk had an instinct about such men it was said in vienna that david abbott would distrust christ on the mountain and look for a bakery its possible your words are comforting you look for things others do not look for ive had far more experience i was once a man of stature unfortunately i pissed away the money you still do a profligatewhat can i tell you obviously something else youre perceptive carlos we should have known each other in the old days now youre presumptuous always you know that i know you can swat my life away at any moment you choose so i must be of value and not merely with words that come from experience what have you got to tell me this may not be of great value but it is something i put on respectable clothes and spent the day at the auberge du coin there was a man an obese manquestioned and dismissed by the sûretéwhose eyes were too unsteady and he perspired too much i had a chat with him showing him an official nato identification i had made in the early fifties it seems he negotiated the rental of an automobile at three oclock yesterday morning to a blond man in the company of a woman the description fits the photograph from argenteuil a rental supposedly the car was to be returned within a day or so by the woman it will never happen of course not but it raises a question doesnt it why would cain go to the trouble of obtaining an automobile in such a fashion to get as far away as possible as rapidly as possible in which case the information has no value said the beggar but then there are so many ways to travel faster less conspicuously and bourne could hardly trust an avaricious night clerk he might easily look for a reward from the sûreté or anyone else whats your point i suggest that bourne could have obtained that car for the sole purpose of following someone here in paris no loitering in public where he might be spotted no rented cars tha t could be traced no frantic searches for elusive taxis instead a simple exchange of license plates and a nondescript black renault in the crowded streets where would one begin to look the silhouette turned the lavier woman said the assassin softly and everyone else he suspects at les classiques its the only place he has to start theyll be watched and within days hours perhapsa nondescript black renault will be seen and hell be found do you have a full description of the car down to three dents in the left rear fender good spread the word to the old men comb the streets the garages the parking lots the one who finds it will never have to look for work again speaking of such matters an envelope was slipped between the taut edge of the curtain and the blue felt of the frame if your theory proves right consider this a token i am right carlos why are you so convinced because cain does what you would do what i would have donein the old days he must be respected he must be killed said the assassin theres symmetry in the timing in a few days it will be the twentyfifth of march on march jason bourne was executed in the jungles of tam quan now years laternearly to the dayanother jason bourne is hunted the americans as anxious as we are to see him killed i wonder which of us will pull the trigger this time does it matter i want him whispered the silhouette he was never real and thats his crime against me tell the old men that if any find him get word to parc monceau but do nothing keep him in sight but do nothing i want him alive on the twentyfifth of march on march ill execute him myself and deliver his body to the americans the word will go out immediately angelus domini child of god angelus domini said the beggar the old soldier walked in silence beside the younger man down the moonlit path in the bois de boulogne neither spoke for too much had already been saidadmitted challenged denied and reaffirmed villiers had to reflect and analyze to accept or violently reject what he had heard his life would be far more bearable if he could strike back in anger attack the lie and find his sanity again but he could not do that with impunity he was a soldier and to turn away was not in him there was too much truth in the younger man it was in his eyes in his voice in his every gesture that asked for understanding the man without a name was not lying the ultimate treason was in villiers house it explained so many things he had not dared to question before an old man wanted to weep for the man without a memory there was little to change or invent the chameleon was not called upon his story was convincing because the most vital part was based in the truth he had to find carlos learn what the assassin knew there would be no life for him if he failed beyond this he would say nothing there was no mention of marie st jacques or the ile de port noir or a message being sent by person or persons unknown or a walking hollow shell that might or might not be someone he was or was notwho could not even be sure that the fragments of memories he possessed were really his own none of this was spoken of instead he recounted everything he knew about the assassin called carlos that knowledge was so vast that during the telling villiers stared at him in astonishment recognizing information he knew to be highly classified shocked at new and startling data that was in concert with a dozen existing theories but to his ears never before put forth with such clarity because of his son the general had been given access to his countrys most secret files on carlos and nothing in those records matched the younger mans array of facts this woman you spoke with in argenteuil the one who calls my house who admitted being a courier to you her name is lavier bourne interrupted the general paused thank you she saw through you she had your photograph taken yes they had no photograph before no so as you hunt carlos he in turn hunts you but you have no photograph you only know two couriers one of which was at my house yes speaking with my wife yes the old man turned away the period of silence had begun they came to the end of the path where there was a miniature lake it was bordered with white gravel benches spaced every ten to fifteen feet circling the water like a guard of honor surrounding a grave of black marble they walked to the second bench villiers broke his silence i should like to sit down he said with age there comes a paucity of stamina it often embarrasses me it shouldnt said bourne sitting down beside him it shouldnt agreed the general but it does he paused for a moment adding quietly frequently in the company of my wife thats not necessary said jason you mistake me the old man turned to the younger im not referring to the bed there are simply times when i find it necessary to curtail activitiesleave a dinner party early absent myself on weekends to the mediterranean or decline a few days on the slopes in gstaad im not sure i understand my wife and i are often apart in many ways we live quite separate lives taking pleasure of course in each others pursuits i still dont understand must i embarrass myself further said villiers when an old man finds a stunning young woman anxious to share his life certain things are understood others not so readily there is of course financial security and in my case a degree of public exposure creature comforts entry into the great houses easy friendship with the celebrated its all very understandable in exchange for these things one brings a beautiful companion into his home shows her off among his peersa form of continuing virility as it were but there are always doubts the old soldier stopped for several moments what he had to say was not easy for him will she take a lover he continued softly does she long for a younger firmer body one more in tune with her own if she does one can accept iteven be relieved i imaginehoping to god she has the sense to be discreet a cuckolded statesman loses his constituency faster than a sporadic drunk it means hes fully lost his grip there are other worries will she abuse his name publicly condemn an adversary whom one is trying to convince these are the inclinations of the young they are manageable part of the risks in the exchange but there is one underlying doubt that if proved justified cannot be tolerated and that is if she is part of a design from the beginning youve felt it then asked jason quietly feelings are not reality shot back the old soldier vehemently they have no place in observing the field then why are you telling me this villiers head arched back then fell forward his eyes on the water there could be a simple explanation for what we both saw tonight i pray there is and i shall give her every opportunity to provide it the old man paused again but in my heart i know there isnt i knew it the moment you told me about les classiques i looked across the street at the door of my house and suddenly a number of things fell painfully into place for the past two hours i have played the devils advocate there is no point in continuing there was my son before there was this woman but you said you trusted her judgment that she was a great help to you true you see i wanted to trust her desperately wanted to trust her the easiest thing in the world is to convince yourself that youre right as one grows old it is easier still what fell into place for you the very help she gave me the very trust i placed in her villiers turned and looked at jason you have extraordinary knowledge about carlos ive studied those files as closely as any man alive for i would give more than any man alive to see him caught and executed i alone the firing squad and as swollen as they are those files do not approach what you know yet your concentration is solely on his kills his methods of assassination youve overlooked the other side of carlos he not only sells his gun he sells a countrys secrets i know that bourne said its not the side for example continued the general as if he had not heard jason i have access to classified documents dealing with frances military and nuclear security perhaps five other menall above suspicionshare that access yet with damning regularity we find that moscow has learned this washington that peking something else you discussed those things with your wife asked bourne surprised of course not whenever i bring such papers home they are placed in a vault in my office no one may enter that room except in my presence there is only one other person who has a key one other person who knows the whereabouts of the alarm switch my wife id think that would be as dangerous as discussing the material both could be forced from her there was a reason im at the age when the unexpected is a daily occurrence i commend you to the obituary pages if anything happened to me she is instructed to telephone the conseiller militaire go down to my office and stay by that vault until the security personnel arrive couldnt she simply stay by the door men of my years have been known to pass away at their desks villiers closed his eyes all along it was she the one house the one place no one believed possible are you sure more than i dare admit to myself she was the one who insisted on the marriage i repeatedly brought up the disparity of our ages but she would have none of it it was the years together she claimed not those that separated our birth dates she offered to sign an agreement renouncing any claims to the villiers estate and of course i would have none of that for it was proof of her commitment to me the adage is quite right the old fool is the complete fool yet there were always the doubts they came with the trips with the unexpected separations unexpected she has many interests forever demanding her attention a francoswiss museum in grenoble a fine arts gallery in amsterdam a monument to the resistance in boulognesurmer an idiotic oceanography conference in marseilles we had a heated argument over that one i needed her in paris there were diplomatic functions i had to attend and wanted her with me she would not stay it was as though she were being ordered to be here and there and somewhere else at a given moment grenoblenear the swiss border an hour from zurich amsterdam boulognesurmeron the channel an hour from london marseilles carlos when was the conference in marseilles asked jason last august i believe toward the latter part of the month on august at five oclock in the afternoon ambassador howard leland was assassinated on the marseilles waterfront yes i know said villiers you spoke of it before i mourn the passing of the man not his judgments the old soldier stopped he looked at bourne my god he whispered she had to be with him carlos summoned her and she came to him she obeyed i never went this far said jason i swear to you i thought of her as a relaya blind relay i never went this far suddenly from the old mans throat came a screamdeep and filled with agony and hatred he brought his hands to his face his head arched back once again in the moonlight and he wept bourne did not move there was nothing he could do im sorry he said the general regained control and so am i he replied finally i apologize no need to i think there is we will discuss it no further i shall do what has to be done which is the soldier sat erect on the bench his jaw firm you can ask that i have to ask it having done what shes done is no different from having killed the child of mine she did not bear she pretended to hold his memory dear yet she was and is an accomplice to his murder and all the while she committed a second treason against the nation i have served throughout my life youre going to kill her im going to kill her she will tell me the truth and she will die shell deny everything you say i doubt it thats crazy young man ive spent over half a century trapping and fighting the enemies of france even when they were frenchmen the truth will be heard what do you think shes going to do sit there and listen to you and calmly agree that shes guilty shell do nothing calmly but shell agree shell proclaim it why would she because when i accuse her shell have the opportunity to kill me when she makes the attempt i will have my explanation wont i youd take that risk i must take it suppose she doesnt make the attempt doesnt try to kill you that would be another explanation villiers said in that unlikely event i should look to my flanks if i were you monsieur he shook his head it will not happen we both know it i far more clearly than you listen to me insisted jason you say there was your son first think of him go after the killer not the accomplice shes an enormous wound for you but hes a greater wound get the man who killed your son in the end youll get both dont confront her not yet use what you know against carlos hunt him with me no ones ever been this close you ask more than i can give said the old man not if you think about your son if you think of yourself it is but not if you think of the rue du bac you are excessively cruel monsieur im right and you know it a high cloud floated by in the night sky briefly blocking the light of the moon darkness was complete jason shivered the old soldier spoke resignation in his voice yes you are right he said excessively cruel and excessively right its the killer not the whore who must be stopped how do we work together hunt together bourne closed his eyes briefly in relief dont do anything carlos has to be looking for me all over paris ive killed his men uncovered a drop found a contact im too close to him unless were both mistaken your telephone will get busier and busier ill make sure of it how ill intercept a half a dozen employees of les classiques several clerks the lavier woman bergeron maybe and certainly the man at the switchboard theyll talk and so will i that phone of yours will be busy as hell but what of me what do i do stay home say youre not feeling well and whenever that phone rings stay near whoever else answers listen to the conversation try to pick up codes question the servants as to what was said to them you could even listen in if you hear something fine but you probably wont whoevers on the line will know youre there still youll frustrate the relay and depending upon where your wife is the whore is broke in the old soldier in carlos hierarchy we might even force him to come out again how his lines of communication will be disrupted the secure unthinkable relay will be interfered with hell demand a meeting with your wife he would hardly announce the whereabouts he has to tell her bourne paused another thought coming into focus if the disruption is severe enough therell be that one phone call or that one person you dont know coming to the house and shortly after your wife will tell you she has to go somewhere when it happens insist she leave a number where she can be reached be firm about it youre not trying to stop her from going but you must be able to reach her tell her anythinguse the relationship she developed say its a highly sensitive military matter you cant talk about until you get a clearance then you want to discuss it with her before you render a judgment she might jump at it what will it serve shell be telling you where she is maybe where carlos is if not carlos certainly others closer to him then reach me ill give you a hotel and a room number the name on the registry is meaningless dont bother about it why dont you give me your real name because if you ever mentioned itconsciously or unconsciouslyyoud be dead im not senile no youre not but youre a man whos been hurt very badly as badly as a person can be hurt i think you may risk your life i wont youre a strange man monsieur yes if im not there when you call a woman will answer shell know where i am well set up timing for messages a woman the general drew back youve said nothing about a woman or anyone else there is no one else without her i wouldnt be alive carlos is hunting both of us hes tried to kill both of us does she know about me yes shes the one who said it couldnt be true that you couldnt be allied with carlos i thought you were perhaps ill meet her not likely until carlos is takenif he can be takenwe cant be seen with you of all people not you afterwardsif there is an afterwardsyou may not want to be seen with us with me im being honest with you i understand that and i respect it in any event thank this woman for me thank her for thinking i could be no part of carlos bourne nodded can you be sure your private line isnt tapped absolutely it is swept on a regular basis all the telephones restricted by the conseiller are whenever you expect a call from me answer the phone and clear your throat twice ill know its you if for any reason you cant talk tell me to call your secretary in the morning ill call back in ten minutes whats the number villiers gave it to him your hotel asked the general the terrasse rue de maistre montmartre room when will you begin as soon as possible noon today be like a wolfpack said the old soldier leaning forward a commander instructing his officer corps strike swiftly she was so charming i simply must do something for her cried marie in ebullient french into the telephone also for the sweet young man he was of such help i tell you the dress was a succès fou im so grateful from your descriptions madame replied the cultured male voice on the switchboard at les classiques im sure you mean janine and claude yes of course janine and claude i remember now ill drop each a note with a token of my thanks would you by any chance know their last names i mean it seems so crass to address envelopes simply to janine and claude rather like sending missives to servants dont you think could you ask jacqueline its not necessary madame i know them and may i say that madame is as sensitive as she is generous janine dolbert and claude oreale janine dolbert and claude oreale repeated marie looking at jason janine is married to that cute pianist isnt she i dont believe mademoiselle dolbert is married to anyone of course im thinking of someone else if i may madame i didnt catch your name how silly of me marie thrust the phone away and raised her voice darling youre back and so soon thats marvelous im talking to those lovely people at les classiques yes right away my dear she pulled the phone to her lips thank you so much youve been very kind she hung up howd i do if you ever decide to get out of economics said jason poring through the paris telephone book go into sales i bought every word you said were the descriptions accurate to a cadaver and a very limp wrist nice touch the pianist it struck me that if she were married the phone would be in her husbands name it isnt interrupted bourne here it is dolbert janine rue losserand jason wrote down the address oreale thats with an o like the bird isnt it not au i think so marie lit a cigarette youre really going to go to their homes bourne nodded if i picked them up in sainthonoré carlos will have it watched what about the others lavier bergeron whoeverheis on the switchboard tomorrow todays for the groundswell the what get them all talking running around saying things that shouldnt be said by closing time word will be spread through the store by dolbert and oreale ill reach two others tonight theyll call lavier and the man at the switchboard well have the first shock wave and then the second the generals phone will start ringing this afternoon by morning the panic should be complete two questions said marie getting up from the edge of the bed and coming toward him how are you going to get two clerks away from les classiques during store hours and what people will you reach tonight nobody lives in a deep freeze replied bourne looking at his watch especially in haute couture its now ill get to dolberts apartment by noon and have the superintendent reach her at work hell tell her to come home right away theres an urgent very personal problem shed better deal with what problem i dont know but who hasnt got one youll do the same with oreale probably even more effective youre outrageous jason im deadly serious said bourne his finger once again sliding down a column of names here he is oreale claude giselle no comment rue racine ill reach him by three when im finished hell head right back to sainthonoré and start screaming what about the other two who are they ill get names from either oreale or dolbert or both they wont know it but theyll be giving me the second shock wave jason stood in the shadows of the recessed doorway in rue losserand he was fifteen feet from the entrance to janine dolberts small apartment house where moments before a bewildered and suddenly richer surintendanthad obliged a wellspoken stranger by calling mademoiselle dolbert at work and telling her that a gentleman in a chauffeured limousine had been around twice asking for her he was back again what should the surintendantdo a small black taxi pulled up to the curb and an agitated cadaverous janine dolbert literally jumped out jason rushed from the doorway intercepting her on the pavement only feet from the entrance that was quick he said touching her elbow so nice to see you again you were very helpful the other day janine dolbert stared at him her lips parted in recollection then astonishment you the american she said in english monsieur briggs isnt it are you the one who i told my chauffeur to take an hour off i wanted to see you privately me what could you possibly wish to see me about dont you know then why did you race back here the wide eyes beneath the short bobbed hair were fixed on his her pale face paler in the sunlight youre from the house of azur then she asked tentatively i could be bourne applied a bit more pressure to her elbow and ive delivered what i promised there will be nothing more we agreed to that are you sure dont be an idiot you dont know paris couture someone will get furious with someone else and make bitchy comments in your own studio what strange deviations and when the fall line comes out with you parading half of bergerons designs before he does how long do you think i can stay at les classiques im laviers number two girl one of the few who has access to her office youd better take care of me as you promised in one of your los angeles shops lets take a walk said jason gently propelling her youve got the wrong man janine ive never heard of the house of azur and havent the slightest interest in stolen designsexcept where the knowledge can be useful oh my god keep walking bourne gripped her arm i said i wanted to talk to you about what what do you want from me how did you get my name the words came rapidly now the phrases overlapping i took an early lunch hour and must return at once were very busy today pleaseyoure hurting my arm sorry what i said it was foolishness a lie on the floor weve heard rumors i was testing you thats what i was doing i was testing you youre very convincing ill accept that im loyal to les classiques ive always been loyal its a fine quality janine i admire loyalty i was saying that the other day to whats his name that nice fellow on the switchboard what is his name i forget philippe said the salesclerk frightened obsequious philippe danjou thats it thank you they reached a narrow cobblestone alleyway between two buildings jason guided her into it lets step in here for a moment just so were off the street dont worry you wont be late ill only take a few minutes of your time they walked ten paces into the narrow enclosure bourne stopped janine dolbert pressed her back against the brick wall cigarette he asked taking a pack from his pocket thank you yes he lighted it for her noting that her hand trembled relaxed now yes no not really what do you want monsieur briggs to begin with the names not briggs but i think you should know that i dont why should i i was sure laviers number one girl would have told you monique use last names please accuracys important brielle then said janine frowning curiously does she know you why not ask her as you wish what is it monsieur jason shook his head you really dont know do you threequarters of the employees at les classiques are working with us and one of the brightest wasnt even contacted of course its possible someone thought you were a risk it happens what happens what risk who are you there isnt time now the others can fill you in im here because weve never received a report from you and yet you speak to prime customers all day long you must be clearer monsieur lets say im the spokesman for a group of peopleamerican french english dutch closing in on a killer whos murdered political and military leaders in each of our countries murdered military political janines mouth gaped the ash of her cigarette breaking off spilling over her rigid hand what is this what are you talking about ive heard none of this i can only apologize said bourne softly sincerely you should have been contacted several weeks ago it was an error on the part of the man before me im sorry it must be a shock to you it is a shock monsieur whispered the salesclerk her concave body tensed a bent lacquered reed against the brick you speak of things beyond my understanding but now i understand interrupted jason not a word from you about anyone now its clear its not to me were closing in on carlos the assassin known as carlos carlos the cigarette fell from dolberts hand the shock complete hes one of your most frequent customers all the evidence points to it weve narrowed the probabilities down to eight men the trap is set for sometime in the next several days and were taking every precaution precaution theres always the danger of hostages we all know that we anticipate gunfire but it will be kept to a minimum the basic problem will be carlos himself hes sworn never to be taken alive he walks the streets wired up to explosives calculated to be in excess of a thousandpound bomb but we can handle that our marksmen will be on the scene one clean shot to the head and itll be all over une seule balle suddenly bourne looked at his watch ive taken up enough of your time youve got to get back to the shop and i have to get back to my post remember if you see me outside you dont know me if i come into les classiques treat me as you would any rich client except if youve spotted a customer you think may be our man then dont waste time telling me again im sorry about all this it was a breakdown in communications thats all it happens une rupture jason nodded turned in place and began walking rapidly out of the alleyway toward the street he stopped and glanced back at janine dolbert she was comatose against the wall for her the elegant world of haute couture was spinning wildly out of orbit philippe danjou the name meant nothing to him but bourne could not help himself he kept repeating it silently trying to raise an image as the face of the grayhaired switchboard operator gave rise to such violent images of darkness and flashes of light philippe danjou nothing nothing at all yet there had been something something that caused jasons stomach to knot the muscles taut and inflexible a flat panel of hard flesh constricted by the darkness he sat by the front window and the door of a coffee shop on the rue racine prepared to get up and leave the moment he saw the figure of claude oreale arrive at the doorway of the ancient building across the street his room was on the fifth floor in a flat he shared with two other men reached only by climbing a worn angular staircase when he did arrive bourne was sure he would not be walking for claude oreale who had been so effusive with jacqueline javier on another staircase in sainthonoré had been told by a toothless landlady over the phone to get his sale gueule back to rue racine and put a stop to the screaming and smashing of furniture that was taking place in his fifthfloor flat either he would stop it or the gendarmes would be called he had twenty minutes to show up he did so in fifteen his slight frame encased in a pierre cardin suitrear flap fluttering in the headwindcould be seen racing up the sidewalk from the nearby métro exit he avoided collisions with the agility of an outofshape brokenfield runner trained by the ballets russe his thin neck was thrust forward several inches in front of his vested chest his long dark hair a flowing mane parallel to the pavement he reached the entrance and gripped the railing leaping up the steps and plunging into the shadows of the foyer jason walked rapidly out of the coffee shop and raced across the street inside he ran to the ancient staircase then started up the cracked steps from the fourth floor landing he could hear the pounding on the door above ouvrez ouvrez vite nom de dieu oreale stopped the silence within perhaps more frightening than anything else bourne climbed the remaining steps until he could see oreale between the bars of the railing and the floor the clerks frail body was pressed into the door his hands on either side fingers spread his ear against the wood his face flushed jason shouted in guttural bureaucratic french as he rushed up into view sûreté stay exactly where you are young man lets not have any unpleasantness weve been watching you and your friends we know about the darkroom no screamed oreale it has nothing to do with me i swear it darkroom bourne raised his hand be quiet dont shout so he immediately followed his commands by leaning over the railing and looking below you cant involve me continued the salesclerk im not involved ive told them over and over again to get rid of it all one day theyll kill themselves drugs are for idiots my god its quiet i think theyre dead jason stood up from the railing and approached oreale his palms raised i told you to shut up he whispered harshly get inside there and be quiet this was all for the benefit of that old bitch downstairs the salesclerk was transfixed his panic suspended in silent hysteria what youve got a key said bourne open up and get inside its bolted replied oreale its a lways bolted during these times you damn fool we had to reach you we had to get you here without anyone knowing why open that door quickly like the terrified rabbit he was claude oreale fumbled in his pocket and found the key he unlocked the door and pushed it open as a man might entering a storage vault filled with mutilated corpses bourne propelled him through the doorframe stepped inside and closed the door what could be seen of the flat belied the rest of the building the fairsized living room was filled with sleek expensive furniture dozens of red and yellow velvet pillows scattered about on couches chairs and the floor it was an erotic room a luxurious sanctuary in the midst of debris ive only got a few minutes said jason no time for anything but business business asked oreale his expression flatout paralyzed this this darkroom what darkroom forget it you had something better going what business we received word from zurich and we want you to get it to your friend lavier madame jacqueline my friend we cant trust the phones what phones the word what word carlos is right carlos carlos who the assassin claude oreale screamed he brought his hand up to his mouth bit the knuckle of his index finger and screamed what are you saying be quiet why are you saying it to me youre number five were counting on you five what for what to help carlos escape the net theyre closing in tomorrow the next day perhaps the day after that hes to stay away hes got to stay away theyll surround the shop marksmen every ten feet the crossfire will be murderous if hes in there it could be a massacre every one of you dead oreale screamed again his knuckle red will you stop this i dont know what youre talking about youre a maniac and i wont hear another wordi havent heard anything carlos crossfire massacres god im suffocating i need air youll get money a lot of it i imagine lavier will thank you also danjou danjou he loathes me he calls me a peacock insults me every chance he gets its his cover of course actually hes very fond of youperhaps more than you know hes number six what are these numbers stop talking numbers how else can we distinguish between you allocate assignments we cant use names who cant all of us who work for carlos the scream was earshattering as the blood trickled from oreales finger i wont listen im a couturier an artist youre number five youll do exactly as we say or youll never see this passion pit of yours again aunghunn stop screaming we appreciate you we know youre all under a strain incidentally we dont trust the bookkeeper trignon first names only obscuritys important pierre then hes hateful he deducts for telephone calls we think hes working for interpol interpol if he is you could all spend ten years in prison youd be eaten alive claude aunghunn shut up just let bergeron know what we think keep your eyes on trignon especially during the next two days if he leaves the store for any reason watch out it could mean the traps closing bourne walked to the door his hand in his pocket ive got to get back and so do you tell numbers one through six everything i told you its vital the word be spread oreale screamed again hysterically again numbers always numbers what number im an artist not a number you wont have a face unless you get back there as fast as you got here reach lavier danjou bergeron as quickly as you can then the others what others ask number two two dolbert janine dolbert janine her too thats right shes two the salesclerk flung his arms wildly above him in helpless protest this is madness nothing makes sense your life does claude said jason simply value it ill be waiting across the street leave here in exactly three minutes and dont use the phone just leave and get back to les classiques if youre not out of here in three minutes ill have to return he took his hand out of his pocket in it was his gun oreale expunged a lungful of air his face ashen as he stared at the weapon bourne let himself out and closed the door the telephone rang on the bedside table marie looked at her watch it was and for a moment she felt a sharp jolt of fear jason had said he would call at he had left la terrasse after dark around to intercept a salesclerk named monique brielle the schedule was precise to be interrupted only in emergency had something happened is this room asked the deep male voice on the line relief swept over marie the man was andré villiers the general had called late in the afternoon to tell jason that panic had spread through les classiques his wife had been summoned to the phone no less than six times over the span of an hour and a half not once however had he been able to listen to anything of substance whenever he had picked up the phone serious conversation had been replaced by innocuous banter yes said marie this is forgive me we did not speak before i know who you are im also aware of you may i take the liberty of saying thank you i understand youre welcome to substance im telephoning from my office and of course theres no extension for this line tell our mutual friend that the crisis has accelerated my wife has taken to her room claiming nausea but apparently shes not too ill to be on the phone on several occasions as before i picked up only to realize that they were alert for any interference each time i apologized rather gruffly saying i expected calls frankly im not at all sure my wife was convinced but of course shes in no position to question me ill be blunt mademoiselle there is unspoken friction building between us and beneath the surface it is violent may god give me strength i can only ask you to remember the objective broke in marie remember your son yes said the old man quietly my son and the whore who claims to revere his memory im sorry its all right ill convey what youve told me to our friend hell be calling within the hour please interrupted villiers theres more its the reason i had to reach you twice while my wife was on the telephone the voices held meaning for me the second i recognized a face came to mind instantly hes on a switchboard in sainthonoré we know his name what about the first it was strange i did not know the voice there was no face to go with it but i understood why it was there it was an odd voice half whisper half command an echo of itself it was the command that struck me you see that voice was not having a conversation with my wife it had issued an order it was altered the instant i got on the line of course a prearranged signal for a swift goodbye but the residue remained that residue even the tone is well known to any soldier it is his means of emphasis am i being clear i think so said marie gently aware that if the old man was implying what she thought he was the strain on him had to be unbearable be assured of it mademoiselle said the general it was the killer pig villiers stopped his breathing audible the next words drawn out a strong man close to weeping he was instructing my wife the old soldiers voice cracked forgive me the unforgivable i have no right to burden you you have every right said marie suddenly alarmed whats happening has to be terribly painful for you made worse because you have no one to talk to i am talking to you mademoiselle i shouldnt but i am i wish we could keep talking i wish one of us could be with you but thats not possible and i know you understand that please try to hold on its terribly important that no connection be made between you and our friend it could cost you your life i think perhaps i have lost it ça cest absurdesaid marie sharply an intended slap in the old soldiers face vous êtes un soldat arrêtez ça immédiatentent cest linstitutrice qui corrige le mauvais élève vous avez bien raison on dit que vous êtes un géant je le croisthere was silence on the line marie held her breath when villiers spoke she breathed again our mutual friend is very fortunate you are a remarkable woman not at all i just want my friend to come back to me theres nothing remarkable about that perhaps not but i should also like to be your friend you reminded a very old man of who and what he is or who and what he once was and must try to be again i thank you for a second time youre welcome my friend marie hung up profoundly moved and equally disturbed she was not convinced villiers could face the next twentyfour hours and if he could not the assassin would know how deeply his apparatus had been penetrated he would order every contact at les classiques to run from paris and disappear or there would be a bloodbath in sainthonoré achieving the same results if either happened there would be no answers no address in new york no message deciphered nor the sender found the man she loved would be returned to his labyrinth and he would leave her bourne saw her at the corner walking under the spill of the streetlight toward the small hotel that was her home monique brielle jacqueline laviers number one girl was a harder more sinewy version of janine dolbert he remembered seeing her at the shop there was an assurance about her her stride the stride of a confident woman secure in the knowledge of her expertise very unflappable jason could understand why she was laviers number one their confrontation would be brief the impact of the message startling the threat inherent it was time for the start of the second shock wave he remained motionless and let her pass on the sidewalk her heels clicking martially on the pavement the street was not crowded but neither was it deserted there were perhaps a half dozen people on the block it would be necessary to isolate her then steer her out of earshot of any who might overhear the words for they were words that no messenger would risk being heard he caught up with her no more than thirty feet from the entrance to the small hotel he slowed his pace to hers staying at her side get in touch with lavier right away he said in french staring straight ahead pardon what did you say who are you monsieur dont stop keep walking past the entrance you know where i live theres very little we dont know and if i go straight inside theres a doorman theres also lavier interrupted bourne youll lose your job and you wont be able to find another in sainthonoré and im afraid that will be the least of your problems who are you not your enemy jason looked at her dont make me one you the american janine claude oreale carlos completed bourne carlos what is this madness all afternoon nothing but carlos and numbers everyone has a number no ones heard of and talk of traps and men with guns its crazy its happening keep walking please for your own sake she did her stride less sure her body stiffened a rigid marionette uncertain of its strings jacqueline spoke to us she said her voice intense she told us it was all insane that ityou were out to ruin les classiques that one of the other houses must have paid you to ruin us what did you expect her to say you are a hired provocateur she told us the truth did she also tell you to keep your mouth shut not to say a word about any of this to anyone of course above all ran on jason as if he had not heard her not to contact the police which under the circumstances would be the most logical thing in the world to do in some ways the only thing to do yes naturally not naturally contradicted bourne look im just a relay probably not much higher than you im not here to convince you im here to deliver a message we ran a test on dolbert we fed her false information janine monique brielles perplexity was compounded by mounting confusion the things she said were incredible as incredible as claudes hysterical screamingthe things he said but what she said was the opposite of what he said we know it was done intentionally shes been talking to azur the house of azur check her out tomorrow confront her confront her just do it it could be tied in with what the trap azur could be working with interpol interpol traps this is the same craziness nobody knows what youre talking about lavier knows get in touch with her right away they approached the end of the block jason touched her arm ill leave you here at the corner go back to your hotel and call jacqueline tell her its far more serious than we thought everythings falling apart worst of all someone has turned not dolbert not one of the clerks but someone more highly placed someone who knows everything turned what does that mean theres a traitor in les classiques tell her to be careful of everyone if she isnt it could be the end for all of us bourne released her arm then stepped off the curb and crossed the street on the other side he spotted a recessed doorway and quickly stepped inside he inched his face to the edge and peered out looking back at the corner monique brielle was halfway down the block rushing toward the entrance of her hotel the fast panic of the second shock wave had begun it was time to call marie im worried jason its tearing him apart he nearly broke down on the phone what happens when he looks at her what must he be feeling thinking hell handle it said bourne watching the traffic on the champselysées from inside the glass telephone booth wishing he felt more confident about andré villiers if he doesnt ive killed him i dont want it on my head but thats what ill have done i should have shut my goddamn mouth and taken her myself you couldnt have done that you saw danjou on the steps you couldnt have gone inside i could have thought of something as weve agreed im resourcefulmore than i like to think about but you are doing something youre creating panic forcing those who carry out carlos orders to show themselves someones got to stop the panic and even you said you didnt think jacqueline lavier was high enough jason youll see someone and youll know youll get him you will i hope so christ i hope so i know exactly what im doing but every now and then bourne stopped he hated saying it but he had tohe had to say it to her i get confused its as if im split down the middle one part of me saying save yourself the other part god help me telling me to get carlos its what youve been doing from the beginning isnt it said marie softly i dont care about carlos shouted jason wiping away the sweat that had broken out on his hairline aware too that he was cold its driving me crazy he added not sure whether he had said the words out loud or to himself darling come back what bourne looked at the telephone again not sure whether he had heard spoken words or whether he had wanted to hear them and so they were there it was happening again things were and they were not the sky was dark outside outside a telephone booth on the champselysées it had once been bright so bright so blinding and hot not cold with screeching birds and screaming streaks of metal jason what come back darling please come back why youre tired you need rest i have to reach trignon pierre trignon hes the bookkeeper do it tomorrow it can wait until tomorrow no tomorrows for the captains what was he saying captains troops figures colliding in panic but it was the only way the only way the chameleon was a provocateur listen to me said marie her voice insistent somethings happening to you its happened before we both know that my darling and when it does you have got to stop we know that too come back to the hotel please bourne closed his eyes the sweat was drying and the sounds of the traffic outside the booth replaced the screeching in his ears he could see the stars in the cold night sky no more blinding sunlight no more unbearable heat it had passed whatever it was im all right really im okay now a couple of bad moments thats all jason marie spoke slowly forcing him to listen what caused them i dont know you just saw the brielle woman did she say something to you something that made you think of something else im not sure i was too busy figuring out what to say myself think darling bourne closed his eyes trying to remember had there been something something spoken casually or so rapidly that it was lost at the moment she called me a provocateur said jason not understanding why the word came back to him but then thats what i am arent i thats what im doing yes agreed marie ive got to get going continued bourne trignons place is only a couple of blocks from here i want to reach him before ten be careful marie spoke as if her thoughts were elsewhere i will i love you i believe in you said marie st jacques the street was quiet the block an odd mixture of shops and flats indigenous to the center of paris bustling with activity during the day deserted at night jason reached the small apartment house listed in the telephone directory as pierre trignons residence he climbed the steps and walked into the neat dimly lit foyer a row of brass mailboxes was on the right each one above a small spoked circle through which a caller raised his voice loudly enough to identify himself jason ran his finger along the printed names below the slots m pierre trignon he pushed the tiny black button twice ten seconds later there was a crackling of static oui monsieur trignon sil vous plaît ici télégramme monsieur je ne peux pas quitter ma bicyclette télégramme pour moi pierre trignon was not a man who often received telegrams it was in his astonished tone the rest of his words were barely distinguishable but a female voice in the background was in shock equating a telegram with all manner of horrendous disasters bourne waited outside the frosted glass door that led to the apartment house interior in seconds he heard the rapid clatter of footsteps growing louder as someoneobviously trignoncame rushing down the staircase the door swung open concealing jason a balding heavyset man unnecessary suspenders creasing the flesh beneath a bulging white shirt walked to the row of mailboxes stopping at number monsieur trignon the heavyset man spun around his cherubic face set in an expression of helplessness a telegram i have a telegram he cried did you bring me a telegram i apologize for the ruse trignon but it was for your own benefit i didnt think you wanted to be questioned in front of your wife and family questioned exclaimed the bookkeeper his thick protruding lips curled his eyes frightened me what about what is this why are you here at my home im a lawabiding citizen you work in sainthonoré for a firm called les classiques i do who are you if you prefer we can go down to my office said bourne who are you im a special investigator for the bureau of taxation and records division of fraud and conspiracy come alongmy official car is outside outside come along i have no jacket no coat my wife shes upstairs expecting me to bring back a telegram a telegram you can send her one if you like come along now ive been at this all day and i want to get it over with please monsieur protested trignon i do not insist on going anywhere you said you had questions ask your questions and let me go back upstairs i have no wish to go to your office it might take a few minutes said jason ill ring through to my wife and tell her its a mistake the telegrams for old gravet he lives here on the first floor and can barely read she will understand madame trignon did not understand but her shrill objections were stilled by a shriller monsieur trignon there you see said the bookkeeper coming away from the mailslot the strings of hair on his bald scalp matted with sweat theres no reason to go anywhere whats a few minutes of a mans life the television shows will be repeated in a month or two now what in gods name is this monsieur my books are immaculate totally immaculate of course i cannot be responsible for the accountants work thats a separate firm hes a separate firm frankly ive never liked him he swears a great deal if you know what i mean but then who am i to say trignons hands were held out palms up his face pinched in an obsequious smile to begin with said bourne dismissing the protestations do not leave the city limits of paris if for any reason personal or professional you are called upon to do so notify us frankly it will not be permitted surely youre joking monsieur surely im not i have no reason to leave parisnor the money to do sobut to say such a thing to me is unbelievable what have i done the bureau will subpoena your books in the morning be prepared subpoena for what cause prepared for what payments to socalled suppliers whose invoices are fraudulent the merchandise was never receivedwas never meant to be receivedthe payments instead routed to a bank in zurich zurich i dont know what youre talking about ive prepared no checks for zurich not directly we know that but how easy it was for you to prepare them for nonexistent firms the monies paid then wired to zurich every invoice is initialed by madame lavier i pay nothing on my own jason paused frowning now its you who are joking he said on my word its the house policy ask anyone les classiques does not pay a sou unless authorized by madame what youre saying then is that you take your orders directly from her but naturally whom does she take orders from trignon grinned it is said from god when not the other way around of course thats a joke monsieur i trust you can be more serious who are the specific owners of les classiques it is a partnership monsieur madame lavier has many wealthy friends they have invested in her abilities and of course the talents of rené bergeron do these investors meet frequently do they suggest policy perhaps advocate certain firms with which to do business i wouldnt know monsieur naturally everyone has friends we may have concentrated on the wrong people interrupted bourne its quite possible that you and madame lavieras the two directly involved with the daytoday financesare being used used for what to funnel money into zurich to the account of one of the most vicious killers in europe trignon convulsed his large stomach quivering as he fell back against the wall in the name of god what are you saying prepare yourselves especially you you prepared the checks no one else only upon approval did you ever check the merchandise against the invoices its not my job so in essence you issued payments for supplies you never saw i never see anything only invoices that have been initialed i pay only on those youd better find every one you and madame lavier had better start digging up every backup in your files because the two of youespecially youwill face the charges charges what charges for a lack of a specific writ lets call it accessory to multiple homicide multiple assassination the account in zurich belongs to the assassin known as carlos you pierre trignon and your current employer madame jacqueline lavier are directly implicated in financing the most soughtafter killer in europe ilich ramirez sanchez alias carlos aughhhh trignon slid down to the foyer floor his eyes in shock his puffed features twisted out of shape all afternoon he whispered people running around hysterical meetings in the aisles looking at me strangely passing my cubicle and turning their heads oh my god if i were you i wouldnt waste a moment morning will be here soon and with it possibly the most difficult day of your life jason walked to the outside door and stopped his hand on the knob its not my place to advise you but if i were you id reach madame lavier at once start preparing your joint defenseit may be all you have a public execution is not out of the question the chameleon opened the door and stepped outside the cold night air whipping across his face get carlos trap carlos cain is for charlie and delta is for cain false find a number in new york find treadstone find the meaning of a message find the sender find jason bourne sunlight burst through the stainedglass windows as the cleanshaven old man in the dated suit of clothes rushed down the aisle of the church in neuillysurseine the tall priest standing by the rack of novena candles watched him struck by a feeling of familiarity for a moment the cleric thought he had seen the man before but could not place him there had been a disheveled beggar yesterday about the same size the same no this old mans shoes were shined his white hair combed neatly and the suit of clothes although from another decade were of good quality angelus domini said the old man as he parted the curtains of the confessional booth enough whispered the silhouetted figure behind the scrim what have you learned in sainthonoré little of substance but respect for his methods is there a pattern random it would appear he selects people who know absolutely nothing and instigates chaos through them i would suggest no further activity at les classiques naturally agreed the silhouette but whats his purpose beyond the chaos asked the old man id say it was to spread distrust among those who do know something the brielle woman used the words she said the american told her to tell lavier there was a traitor inside a patently false statement which of them would dare last night was insane as you know the bookkeeper trignon went crazy waiting until two in the morning outside laviers house literally assaulting her when she returned from brielles hotel screaming and crying in the street lavier herself did not behave much better she was barely in control when she called parc monceau she was told not to call again no one is to call there ever again ever we received the word the few of us who know the number have forgotten it be sure you have the silhouette moved suddenly there was a ripple in the curtain of course to spread distrust it follows chaos theres no question about it now hell pick up the contacts try to force information from them and when one fails throw him to the americans and go on to the next but hell make the approaches alone its part of his ego he is a madman and obsessed he may be both countered the old man but hes also a professional hell make sure the names are delivered to his superiors in the event he does fail so regardless of whether you take him or not they will be taken they will be dead said the assassin but not bergeron hes far too valuable tell him to head for athens hell know where am i to assume im taking the place of parc monceau that would be impossible but for the time being you will relay my final decisions to whomever they concern and the first person i reach is bergeron to athens yes so lavier and the colonial danjou are marked then they are marked bait rarely survives and they will not you may also relay another message to the two teams covering lavier and danjou tell them ill be watching themall the time there can be no mistakes it was the old mans turn to pause to bid silently for attention ive saved the best for last carlos the renault was found an hour and a half ago in a garage in montmartre it was brought in last night in the stillness the old man could hear the slow deliberate breathing of the figure beyond the cloth i assume youve taken measures to have it watchedeven now at the momentand followedeven now at the moment the oncebespoken beggar laughed softly in accord with your last instructions i took the liberty of hiring a friend a friend with a sound automobile he in turn has employed three acquaintances and together they are on four sixhour shifts on the street outside the garage they know nothing of course except that they are to follow the renault at any hour of day or night you do not disappoint me i cant afford to and since parc monceau was eliminated i had no telephone number to give them but my own which as you know is a rundown café in the quarter the owner and i were friends in the old days the better days i could reach him every five minutes for messages and he would never object i know where he got the money to pay for his business and whom he had to kill to get it youve behaved well you have value i also have a problem carlos as none of us are to call parc monceau how can i reach you in the event i must say for instance the renault yes im aware of the problem are you aware of the burden you ask for i would much prefer not to have it my only hope is that when this is over and cain is dead you will remember my contributions and rather than killing me change the number you do anticipate in the old days it was my means of survival the assassin whispered seven figures you are the only man alive who has this number naturally it is untraceable naturally who would expect an old beggar to have it every hour brings you closer to a better standard of living the net is closing every hour brings him nearer to one of several traps cain will be caught and an imposters body will be thrown back to the bewildered strategists who created him they counted on a monstrous ego and he gave it to them at the end he was only a puppet an expendable puppet everyone knew it but him bourne picked up the telephone yes room go ahead general the telephone calls have stopped shes no longer being contactednot at least by telephone our couple was out and the phone rang twice both times she asked me to answer it she really wasnt up to talking who called the chemists with a prescription and a journalist requesting an interview she couldnt have known either did you get the impression she was trying to throw you off by having you take the calls villiers paused his reply laced with anger it was there the effect less than subtle insofar as she mentioned she might be having lunch out she said she had a reservation at the george cinq and i could reach her there if she decides to go if she does i want to get there first ill let you know you said shes not being contacted by phone not at least by telephone i think you said did you mean something by that yes thirty minutes ago a woman came to the house my wife was reluctant to see her but nevertheless did so i only saw her face for a moment in the parlor but it was enough the woman was in panic describe her villiers did jacqueline lavier said jason i thought it might be from the looks of her the wolfpack was eminently successful it was obvious she had not slept before taking her into the library my wife told me she was an old friend in a marriage crisis a fatuous lie at her age there are no crises left in marriage only acceptance and extraction i cant understand her going to your house its too much of a risk it doesnt make sense unless she did it on her own knowing that no further calls were to be made these things occurred to me said the soldier so i felt the need of a little air a stroll around the block my aide accompanied mea doddering old man taking his limited constitutional under the watchful eye of an escort but my eyes too were watchful lavier was followed two men were seated in a car four houses away the automobile equipped with a radio those men did not belong to the street it was in their faces in the way they watched my house how do you know she didnt come with them we live on a quiet street when lavier arrived i was in the sitting room having coffee and heard her running up the steps i went to the window in time to see a taxi drive away she came in a taxi she was followed when did she leave she hasnt and the men are still outside what kind of car are they in citroën gray the first three letters of the license plate are nyr birds in the air following a contact where do the birds come from i beg your pardon what did you say jason shook his head im not sure never mind im going to try to get out there before lavier leaves do what you can to help me interrupt your wife say you have to speak with her for a few minutes insist her old friend stay say anything just make sure she doesnt leave i will do my best bourne hung up and looked at marie standing by the window across the room its working theyre starting to distrust each other lavier went to parc monceau and she was followed theyre beginning to suspect their own birds in the air said marie what did you mean i dont know its not important there isnt time i think it is important jason not now bourne walked to the chair where he had dropped his topcoat and hat he put them on quickly and went to the bureau opened the drawer and took out the gun he looked at it for a moment remembering the images were there the past that was his whole yet not his whole at all zurich the bahnhofstrasse and the carillon du lac the drei alpenhäuser and the löwenstrasse a filthy boardinghouse on the steppdeckstrasse the gun symbolized them all for it had once nearly taken his life in zurich but this was paris and everything started in zurich was in motion find carlos trap carlos cain is for charlie and delta is for cain false goddamn you false find treadstone find a message find a man jason remained in the far corner of the back seat as the taxi entered villiers block in parc monceau he scanned the cars lining the curb there was no gray citroën no license with the letters nyr but there was villiers the old soldier was standing alone on the pavement four doors away from his house two men in a car four houses away from my house villiers was standing now where that car had stood it was a signal arrêtez sil vous plait said bourne to the driver le vieux làbas je veux parler avec lui he rolled down the window and leaned forward monsieur in english replied villiers walking toward the taxi an old man summoned by a stranger what happened asked jason i could not detain them them my wife left with the lavier woman i was adamant however i told her to expect my call at the george cinq it was a matter of the utmost importance and i required her counsel what did she say that she wasnt sure shed be at the george cinq that her friend insisted on seeing a priest in neuillysurseine at the church of the blessed sacrament she said she felt obliged to accompany her did you object strenuously and for the first time in our life together she stated the thoughts in my own mind she said if its your desire to check up on me andré why not call the parish im sure someone might recognize me and bring me to a telephone was she testing me bourne tried to think perhaps someone would see her there shed make sure of it but bringing her to a phone might be something else again when did they leave less than five minutes ago the two men in the citroën followed them were they in your car no my wife called a taxi im going out there said jason i thought you might said villiers i looked up the address of the church bourne dropped a fiftyfranc note over the back of the front seat the driver grabbed it its important to me to reach neuillysurseine as fast as possible the church of the blessed sacrament do you know where it is but of course monsieur it is the most beautiful parish in the district get there quickly and therell be another fifty francs we shall fly on the wings of blessed angels monsieur they flew the flight plan jeopardizing most of the traffic in their path there are the spires of the blessed sacrament monsieur said the victorious driver twelve minutes later pointing at three soaring towers of stone through the windshield another minute perhaps two if the idiots who should be taken off the street will permit slow down interrupted bourne his attention not on the spires of the church but on an automobile several cars ahead they had taken a corner and he had seen it during the turn it was a gray citroën two men in the front seat they came to a traffic light the cars stopped jason dropped the second fiftyfranc note over the seat and opened the door ill be right back if the light changes drive forward slowly and ill jump in bourne got out keeping his body low and rushed between the cars until he saw the letters nyr the numbers following were but for the moment they were inconsequential the taxi driver had earned his money the light changed and the row of automobiles lurched forward like one elongated insect pulling its shelled parts together the taxi drew alongside jason opened the door and climbed in you do good work he said to the driver im not sure i know the work i am doing an affair of the heart one must catch the betrayer in the act in church monsieur the world moves too swiftly for me not in traffic said bourne they approached the final corner before the church of the blessed sacrament the citroën made the turn a single car between it and a taxi the passengers indistinguishable something bothered jason the surveillance on the part of the two men was too open far too obvious it was as if carlos soldiers wanted someone in that taxi to know they were there of course villiers wife was in that cab with jacqueline lavier and the two men in the citroën wanted villiers wife to know they were behind her there is the blessed sacrament said the driver entering the street where the church rose in minor medieval splendor in the center of a manicured lawn crisscrossed by stone paths and dotted with statuary what shall i do monsieur pull into that space ordered jason gesturing at a break in the line of parked cars the taxi with villiers wife and the lavier woman stopped in front of a path guarded by a concrete saint villiers stunning wife got out first extending her hand for jacqueline lavier who emerged ashen on the pavement she wore large orangerimmed sunglasses and carried a white purse but she was no longer elegant her crown of silverstreaked hair fell in straight disassociated lines down the sides of her deathwhite mask of a face and her stockings were torn she was at least three hundred feet away but bourne felt he could almost hear the erratic gasping for breath that accompanied the hesitant movements of the once regal figure stepping forward in the sunlight the citroën had proceeded beyond the taxi and was now pulling to the curb neither man got out but a thin metal rod reflecting the glare of the sun began rising out of the trunk the radio antenna was being activated codes sent over a guarded frequency jason was mesmerized not by the sight and the knowledge of what was being done but by something else words came to him from where he did not know but they were there delta to almanac delta to almanac we will not respond repeat negative brother almanac to delta you will respond as ordered abandon abandon that is final delta to almanac youre final brother go fuck yourself delta out equipment damaged suddenly the darkness was all around him the sunlight gone there were no soaring towers of a church reaching for the sky instead there were black shapes of irregular foliage shivering beneath the light of iridescent clouds everything was moving everything was moving he had to move with the movement to remain immobile was to die move for christs sake move and take them out one by one crawl in closer overcome the fearthe terrible fearand reduce the numbers that was all there was to it reduce the numbers the monk had made that clear knife wire knee thumb you know the points of damage of death death is a statistic for the computers for you it is survival the monk the monk the sunlight came again blinding him for a moment his foot on the pavement his gaze on the gray citroën a hundred yards away but it was difficult to see why was it so difficult haze mist not darkness now but impenetrable mist he was hot no he was cold cold he jerked his head up suddenly aware of where he was and what he was doing his face had been pressed against the window his breath had fogged the glass im getting out for a few minutes said bourne stay here all day if you wish monsieur jason pulled up the lapels of his topcoat pushed his hat forward and put on the tortoiseshell glasses he walked alongside a couple toward a religious sidewalk bazaar breaking away to stand behind a mother and child at the counter he had a clear view of the citroën the taxi which had been summoned to parc monceau was no longer there dismissed by villiers wife it was a curious decision on her part thought bourne cabs were not that available three minutes later the reason was clear and disturbing villiers wife came striding out of the church walking rapidly her tall statuesque figure drawing admiring glances from strollers she went directly to the citroën spoke to the men in front then opened the rear door the purse a white purse villiers wife was carrying the purse that only minutes before had been clutched in the hands of jacqueline lavier she climbed into the citroëns back seat and pulled the door shut the sedans motor was switched on and gunned prelude to a quick and sudden departure as the car rolled away the shiny metal rod that was the vehicles antenna became shorter and shorter retracting into its base where was jacqueline lavier why had she given her purse to villiers wife bourne started to move then stopped instinct warning him a trap if lavier was followed those following her might also be trailedand not by him he looked up and down the street studying the pedestrians on the sidewalk then each car each driver and passenger watching for a face that did not belong as villiers had said of the two men in the citroën had not belonged in parc monceau there were no breaks in the parade no darting eyes or hands concealed in outsized pockets he was being overly cautious neuillysurseine was not a trap for him he moved away from the counter and started for the church he stopped his feet suddenly clamped to the pavement a priest was coming out of the church a priest in a black suit a starched white collar and a black hat that partially covered his face he had seen him before not long ago not in a forgotten past but recently very recently weeks days hours perhaps where was it where he knew him it was in the walk in the tilt of his head in the wide shoulders that seemed to glide in place above the fluid movement of his body he was a man with a gun where was it zurich the carillon du lac two men breaking through the crowds converging brokering death one wore goldrimmed glasses it was not he that man was dead was it that other man in the carillon du lac or in the guisan quai an animal grunting wildeyed in rape was it he or someone else a darkcoated man in the corridor at the auberge du coin where the lights had been shorted out the spill from the staircase illuminating the trap a reverse trap where that man had fired his weapon in darkness at shapes he thought were human was it that man bourne did not know he only knew that he had seen the priest before but not as a priest as a man with a gun the killer in the priestly dark suit reached the end of the stone path and turned right at the base of the concrete saint his face briefly caught in the sunlight jason froze the skin the killers skin was dark not tanned by the sun but by birth a latin skin its hue tempered generations ago by ancestors living in or around the mediterranean forebears who migrated across the globe across the seas bourne stood paralyzed by the shock of his own certainty he was looking at ilich ramirez sanchez get carlos trap carlos cain is for charlie and delta is for cain jason tore at the front of his coat his right hand grasping the handle of the gun in his belt he started running on the pavement colliding with the backs and chests of strollers shouldering a sidewalk vendor out of his way lurching past a beggar digging into a wire trashthe beggar the beggars hand surged into his pocket bourne spun around in time to see the barrel of an automatic emerge from the threadbare coat the suns rays bouncing off the metal the beggar had a gun his gaunt hand raised it weapon and eyes steady jason lunged into the street careening off the side of a small car he heard the spits of the bullets above him and around him piercing the air with sickening finality screams shrill and in pain came from unseen people on the sidewalk bourne ducked between two automobiles and raced through the traffic to the other side of the street the beggar was running away an old man with eyes of steel was racing into the crowds into oblivion get carlos trap carlos cain is jason spun again and lurched again propelling himself forward throwing everything in his path out of his way racing in the direction of the assassin he stopped breathless confusion and anger welling in his chest sharp bolts of pain returning to his temples where was he where was carlos and then he saw him the killer had climbed behind the wheel of a large black sedan bourne ran back into the traffic slamming hoods and trunks as he threaded his way insanely toward the assassin suddenly he was blocked by two cars that had collided he spread his hands on a glistening chrome grille and leaped sideways over the impacted bumpers he stopped again his eyes searing with pain at what he saw knowing it was pointless to go on he was too late the large black sedan had found a break in the traffic and ilich ramirez sanchez sped away jason crossed back to the far pavement as the shrieking of police whistles turned heads everywhere pedestrians had been grazed or wounded or killed a beggar with a gun had shot them lavier bourne broke into a run again back toward the church of the blessed sacrament he reached the stone path under the eye of the concrete saint and spun left racing toward the arched sculptured doors and the marble steps he ran up and entered the gothic church facing racks of flickering candles fused rays of colored light streaming down from the stainedglass windows high in the dark stone walls he walked down the center aisle staring at the worshipers looking for streaked silver hair and a mask of a face laminated in white the lavier woman was nowhere to be seen yet she had not left she was somewhere in the church jason turned glancing up the aisle there was a tall priest walking casually past the rack of candles bourne sidestepped his way through a cushioned row emerged on the far right aisle and intercepted him excuse me father he said im afraid ive lost someone no one is lost in the house of god sir replied the cleric smiling she may not be lost in spirit but if i dont find the rest of her shell be very upset theres an emergency at her place of business have you been here long father i greet those of our flock who seek assistance yes ive been here for the better part of an hour two women came in a few minutes ago one was extremely tall quite striking wearing a lightcolored coat and i think a dark kerchief over her hair the other was an older lady not as tall and obviously not in good health did you by any chance see them the priest nodded yes there was sorrow in the older womans face she was pale and grieving do you know where she went i gather her younger friend left a devoted friend may i say she escorted the poor dear to confession helping her inside the booth the cleansing of the soul gives us all strength during the desperate times to confession yesthe second booth from the right she has a compassionate father confessor i might add a visiting priest from the archdiocese of barcelona a remarkable man too im sorry to say this is his last day he returns to spain the tall priest frowned isnt that odd a few moments ago i thought i saw father manuel leave i imagine he was replaced for a while no matter the dear lady is in good hands im sure of it said bourne thank you father ill wait for her jason walked down the aisle toward the row of confessional booths his eyes on the second where a small strip of white fabric proclaimed occupancy a soul was being cleansed he sat down in the front row then knelt forward angling his head slowly around so he could see the rear of the church the tall priest stood at the entrance his attention on the disturbance in the street outside sirens could be heard wailing in the distance drawing closer bourne got up and walked to the second booth he parted the curtain and looked inside seeing what he expected to see only the method had remained in question jacqueline lavier was dead her body slumped forward rolled to the side supported by the prayer stall her mask of a face upturned her eyes wide staring in death at the ceiling her coat was open the cloth of her dress drenched in blood the weapon was a long thin letter opener plunged in above her left breast her fingers were curled around the handle her lacquered nails the color of her blood at her feet was a pursenot the white purse she had clutched in her hands ten minutes earlier but a fashionable yves st laurent the precocious initials stamped on the fabric an escutcheon of the haute couture the reason for it was clear to jason inside were papers identifying this tragic suicide this overwrought woman so burdened with grief she took her own life while seeking absolution in the eyes of god carlos was thorough brilliantly thorough bourne closed the curtain and stepped away from the booth from somewhere high in a tower the bells of the morning angelus rang splendidly the taxi wandered aimlessly through the streets of neuillysurseine jason in the back seat his mind racing it was pointless to wait perhaps deadly to do so strategies changed as conditions changed and they had taken a deadly turn jacqueline lavier had been followed her death inevitable but out of sequence too soon she was still valuable then bourne understood she had not been killed because she had been disloyal to carlos rather because she had disobeyed him she had gone to parc monceauthat was her indefensible error there was another known relay at les classiques a grayhaired switchboard operator named philippe danjou whose face evoked images of violence and darkness and shattering flashes of light and sound he had been in bournes past of that jason was certain and because of that the hunted had to be cautious he could not know what that man meant to him but he was a relay and he too would be watched as lavier had been watched additional bait for another trap dispatch demanded when the trap closed were these the only two were there others an obscure faceless clerk perhaps who was not a clerk at all but someone else a supplier who spent hours in sainthonoré legitimately pursuing the cause of haute couture but with another cause far more vital to him or her or the muscular designer rené bergeron whose movements were so quick and fluid bourne suddenly stiffened his neck pressed back against the seat a recent memory triggered bergeron the darkly tanned skin the wide shoulders accentuated by tightly rolledup sleeves shoulders that floated in place above a tapered waist beneath which strong legs moved swiftly like an animals a cats was it possible were the other conjectures merely phantoms compounded fragments of familiar images he had convinced himself might be carlos was the assassinunknown to his relaysdeep inside his own apparatus controlling and shaping every move was it bergeron he had to get to a telephone right away every minute he lost was a minute removed from the answer and too many meant there would be no answer at all but he could not make the call himself the sequence of events had been too rapid he had to hold back store his own information the first telephone booth you see pull over he said to the driver who was still shaken by the chaos at the church of the blessed sacrament as you wish monsieur but if monsieur will please try to understand it is past the time when i should report to the fleet garage way past the time i understand theres a telephone good pull over the red telephone booth its quaint panes of glass glistening in the sunlight looked like a large dollhouse from the outside and smelled of urine on the inside bourne dialed the terrasse inserted the coins and asked for room marie answered what happened i havent time to explain i want you to call les classiques and ask for rené bergeron danjou will probably be on the switchboard make up a name and tell him youve been trying to reach bergeron on laviers private line for the past hour or so say its urgent youve got to talk to him when he gets on what do i say i dont think he will but if he does just hang up and if danjou comes on the line again ask him when bergerons expected ill call you back in three minutes darling are you all right ive had a profound religious experience ill tell you about it later jason kept his eyes on his watch the infinitesimal jumps of the thin delicate sweep hand too agonizingly slow he began his own personal countdown at thirty seconds calculating the heartbeat that echoed in his throat as somewhere around two and a half per second he started dialing at ten seconds inserted the coins at four and spoke to the terrasses switchboard at minusfive marie picked up the phone the instant it began to ring what happened he asked i thought you might still be talking it was a very short conversation i think danjou was wary he may have a list of names of those whove been given the private numberi dont know but he sounded withdrawn hesitant what did he say monsieur bergeron is on a fabric search in the mediterranean he left this morning and isnt expected back for several weeks its possible i may have just seen him several hundred miles from the mediterranean where in church if it was bergeron he gave absolution with the point of a very sharp instrument what are you talking about laviers dead oh my god what are you going to do talk to a man i think i knew if hes got a brain in his head hell listen hes marked for extinction danjou delta i wondered when i think id know your voice anywhere he had said it the name had been spoken the name that meant nothing to him and yet somehow everything danjou knew philippe danjou was part of the unremembered past delta cain is for charlie and delta is for cain delta delta delta he had known this man and this man had the answer alpha bravo cain delta echo foxtrot medusa medusa he said softly repeating the name that was a silent scream in his ears paris is not tam quan delta there are no debts between us any longer dont look for payment we work for different employers now jacqueline laviers dead carlos killed her in neuillysurseine less than thirty minutes ago dont even try as of two hours ago jacqueline was on her way out of france she called me herself from orly airport shes joining bergeron on a fabric search in the mediterranean interrupted jason danjou paused the woman on the line asking for rené i thought as much it changes nothing i spoke with her she called from orly she was told to tell you that did she sound in control of herself she was upset and no one knows why better than you youve done a remarkable job down here delta or cain or whatever you call yourself now of course she wasnt herself its why shes going away for a while its why shes dead youre next the last twentyfour hours were worthy of you this isnt she was followed youre being followed watched every moment if i am its for my own protection then why is lavier dead i dont believe she is would she commit suicide never call the rectory at the church of the blessed sacrament in neuillysurseine ask about the woman who killed herself while taking confession what have you got to lose ill call you back bourne hung up and left the booth he stepped off the curb looking for a cab the next call to philippe danjou would be made a minimum of ten blocks away the man from medusa would not be convinced easily and until he was jason would not risk electronic scanners picking up even the general location of the call delta i think id know your voice anywhere paris is not tam quan tam quan tam quan tam quan cain is for charlie and delta is for cain medusa stop it do not think of things that you cannot think about concentrate on what is now you not what others say you arenot even what you may think you are only the now and the now is a man who can give you answers we work for different employers that was the key tell me for christs sake tell me who is it who is my employer danjou a taxi swerved to a stop perilously close to his kneecaps jason opened the door and climbed in place vendôme he said knowing it was near sainthonoré it was imperative to be as close as possible to put in motion the strategy that was rapidly coming into focus he had the advantage it was a matter of using it for a dual purpose danjou had to be convinced that those following him were his executioners but what those men could not know was that another would be following them the vendôme was crowded as usual the traffic wild as usual bourne saw a telephone booth on the corner and got out of the taxi he went inside the booth and dialed les classiques it had been fourteen minutes since he had called from neuillysurseine danjou a woman took her own life while at confession thats all i know come on you wouldnt settle for that medusa wouldnt settle for that give me a moment to put the board on hold the line went dead for roughly four seconds danjou returned a middleaged woman with silver and white hair expensive clothing and a st laurent purse ive just described ten thousand women in paris how do i know you didnt take one kill her make her the basis of this call oh sure i carried her into the church like a pieta blood dripping in the aisle from her open stigmata be reasonable danjou lets start with the obvious the purse wasnt hers she carried a white leather handbag shed hardly be likely to advertise a competing house lending credence to my belief it was not jacqueline lavier lends more to mine the papers in that purse identified her as someone else the body will be claimed quickly no one touches les classiques because you say so no because its the method used by carlos in five kills i can name he could that was the frightening thing a man is taken out the police believing hes one person the death an enigma killers unknown then they find out hes someone else by which time carlos is in another country another contract fulfilled lavier was a variation of that method thats all words delta you never said much but when you did the words were there and if you were in sainthonoré three or four weeks from nowwhich you wont beyoud see how it ends a plane crash or a boat lost in the mediterranean bodies charred beyond recognition or simply gone the identities of the dead however clearly established lavier and bergeron but only one is really deadmadame lavier monsieur bergeron is privilegedmore than you ever knew bergeron is back in business and as for you youre a statistic in the paris morgue and you according to the plan im dead too they expect to take me through you logical were both from medusa they know thatcarlos knows that its to be assumed you recognized me and you me danjou paused yes he said as i told you we work for different employers now thats what i want to talk about no talking delta but for old times sakefor what you did for us all in tam quantake the advice of a medusan get out of paris or youre that dead man you just mentioned i cant do that you should if i have the opportunity ill pull the trigger myself and be well paid for it then ill give you that opportunity forgive me if i find that ludicrous you dont know what i want or how much im willing to risk to get it whatever you want youll take risks for it but the real danger will be your enemys i know you delta and i must get back to the switchboard id wish you good hunting but it was the moment to use the only weapon he had left the sole threat that might keep danjou on the line whom do you reach for instructions now that parc monceau is out the tension was accentuated by danjous silence when he replied his voice was a whisper what did you say its why she was killed you know why youll be killed too she went to parc monceau and she died for it youve been to parc monceau and youll die for it too carlos cant afford you any longer you simply know too much why should he jeopardize such an arrangement hell use you to trap me then kill you and set up another les classiques as one medusan to another can you doubt it the silence was longer now more intense than before it was apparent that the older man from medusa was asking himself several hard questions what do you want from me except me you should know hostages are meaningless yet you provoke me astonish me with what youve learned im no good to you dead or alive so what is it you want information if you have it ill get out of paris tonight and neither carlos nor you will ever hear from me again what information youll lie if i ask for it now i would but when i see you youll tell me the truth with a wire around my throat in the middle of a crowd a crowd daylight an hour from now outside the louvre near the steps at the taxi stand the louvre crowds information you think i have that will send you away you cant reasonably expect me to discuss my employer not yours mine treadstone he knew philippe danjou had the answer remain calm dont let your anxiety show seventyone completed jason just a simple question and ill disappear and when you give me the answerthe truthill give you something in exchange what could i possibly want from you except you information that may let you live its no guarantee but believe me when i tell you you wont live without it parc monceau danjou silence again bourne could picture the grayhaired former medusan staring as his switchboard the name of the wealthy paris district echoing louder and louder in his mind there was death from parc monceau and anjou knew it as surely as he knew the dead woman in neuillysurseine was jacqueline lavier what might that information be asked danjou the identity of your employer a name and sufficient proof to have sealed in an envelope and given to an attorney to be held throughout your natural life but if your life were to end unnaturally even accidentally hed be instructed to open the envelope and reveal the contents its protection danjou i see said the medusan softly but you say men watch me follow me cover yourself said jason tell them the truth youve got a number to call havent you yes theres a number a man the older mans voice rose slightly in astonishment reach him tell him exactly what i said except for the exchange of course say i contacted you want a meeting with you its to be outside the louvre in an hour the truth youre insane i know what im doing you usually did youre creating your own trap mounting your own execution in which event you may be amply rewarded or executed myself if what you say is so lets find out if it is ill make contact with you one way or another take my word for it they have my photograph theyll know it when i do better a controlled situation than one in which theres no control at all now i hear delta said danjou he doesnt create his own trap he doesnt walk in front of a firing squad and ask for a blindfold no he doesnt agreed bourne you dont have a choice danjou one hour outside the louvre the success of any trap lies in its fundamental simplicity the reverse trap by the nature of its single complication must be swift and simpler still the words came to him as he waited in the taxi in sainthonoré down the street from les classiques he had asked the driver to take him around the block twice an american tourist whose wife wag shopping in the strip of haute couture sooner or later she would emerge from one of the stores and he would find her what he found was carlos surveillance the rubbercapped antenna on the black sedan was both the proof and the danger signal he would feel more secure if that radio transmitter were shorted out but there was no way to do it the alternative was misinformation sometime during the next fortyfive minutes jason would do his best to make sure the wrong message was sent over that radio from his concealed position in the back seat he studied the two men in the car across the way if there was anything that set them apart from a hundred other men like them in sainthonoré it was the fact that they did not talk philippe danjou walked out onto the pavement a gray homburg covering his gray hair his glances swept the street telling bourne that the former medusan had covered himself he had called a number he had relayed his startling information he knew there were men in a car prepared to follow him a taxi apparently ordered by phone pulled up to the curb danjou spoke to the driver and climbed inside across the street an antenna rose ominously out of its cradle the hunt was on the sedan pulled out after danjous taxi it was the confirmation jason needed he leaned forward and spoke to the driver i forgot he said irritably she said it was the louvre this morning shopping this afternoon christ im half an hour late take me to the louvre will you please mais oui monsieur le louvre twice during the short ride to the monumental façade that overlooked the seine jasons taxi passed the black sedan only to be subsequently passed by it the proximity gave bourne the opportunity to see exactly what he needed to see the man beside the driver in the sedan spoke repeatedly into the hand held radio microphone carlos was making sure the trap had no loose spikes others were closing in on the execution ground they came to the enormous entrance of the louvre get in line behind those other taxis said jason but they wait for fares monsieur i have a fare you are my fare i will take you to the just do as i say said bourne dropping fifty francs over the seat the driver swerved into the line the black sedan was twenty yards away on the right the man on the radio had turned in the seat and was looking out the left rear window jason followed his gaze and saw what he thought he might see several hundred feet to the west in the huge square was a gray automobile the car that had followed jacqueline lavier and villiers wife to the church of the blessed sacrament and sped the latter away from neuillysurseine after she had escorted lavier to her final confession its antenna could be seen retracting down into its base over on the right carlos soldier no longer held the microphone the black sedans antenna was also receding contact had been made visual sighting confirmed four men these were carlos executioners bourne concentrated on the crowds in front of the louvre entrance spotting the elegantly dressed danjou instantly he was pacing slowly cautiously back and forth by the large block of white granite that flanked the marble steps on the left now it was time to send the misinformation pull out of the line ordered jason what monsieur two hundred francs if you do exactly what i tell you pull out and go to the front of the line then make two left turns heading back up the next aisle i dont understand monsieur you dont have to three hundred francs the driver swung right and proceeded to the head of the line where he spun the wheel sending the taxi to the left toward the row of parked cars bourne pulled the automatic from his belt keeping it between his knees he checked the silencer twisting the cylinder taut where do you wish to go monsieur asked the bewildered driver as they entered the aisle heading back toward the entrance to the louvre slow down said jason that large gray car up ahead the one pointing to the seine exit do you see it but of course go around it slowly to the right bourne slid over to the left side of the seat and rolled down the window keeping his head and the weapon concealed he would show both in a matter of seconds the taxi approached the sedans trunk the driver spinning the wheel again they were parallel jason thrust his head and his gun into view he aimed for the gray sedans right rear window and fired five spits coming one after another shattering the glass stunning the two men who screamed at each other lurching below the window frames to the floor of the front seat but they had seen him that was the misinformation get out of here yelled bourne to the terrified driver as he threw three hundred francs over the seat and wedged his soft felt hat into the well of the rear window the taxi shot ahead toward the stone gates of the louvre now jason slid back across the seat opened the door and rolled out to the cobblestone pavement shouting his last instructions to the driver if you want to stay alive get out of here the taxi exploded forward engine gunning driver screaming bourne dove between two parked cars now hidden from the gray sedan and got up slowly peering between the windows carlos men were quick professional losing no moment in the pursuit they had the taxi in view the cab no match for the powerful sedan and in that taxi was the target the man behind the wheel pulled the car into gear and raced ahead as his companion held the microphone the antenna rising from its recess orders were being shouted to another sedan nearer the great stone steps the speeding taxi swerved out into the street by the seine the large gray car directly behind it as they passed within feet of jason the expressions on the two mens faces said it all they had cain in their sights the trap had closed and they would earn their pay in a matter of minutes the reverse trap by the nature of its single complication must be swift and simpler still a matter of minutes he had only a matter of moments if everything he believed was so danjou the contact had played his rolehis minor roleand was expendableas jacqueline lavier had been expendable bourne ran out from between the two cars toward the black sedan it was no more than fifty yards ahead he could see the two men they were converging on philippe danjou who was still pacing in front of the short flight of marble steps one accurate shot from either man and danjou would be dead treadstone seventyone gone with him jason ran faster his hand inside his coat gripping the heavy automatic carlos soldiers were only yards away now hurrying themselves the execution to be quick the condemned man cut down before he understood what was happening medusa roared bourne not knowing why he shouted the name rather than danjous own medusamedusa danjous head snapped up shock on his face the driver of the black sedan had spun around his weapon leveled at jason while his companion moved toward danjou his gun aimed at the former medusan bourne dove to his right the automatic extended steadied by his left hand he fired in midair his aim accurate the man closing in on danjou arched backward as his stiffened legs were caught in an instant of paralysis he collapsed on the cobblestones two spits exploded over jasons head the bullets impacting into metal behind him he rolled to his left his gun again steady directed at the second man he pulled the trigger twice the driver screamed an eruption of blood spreading across his face as he fell hysteria swept through the crowds men and women screamed parents threw themselves over children others ran up the steps through the great doors of the louvre as guards tried to get outside bourne got to his feat looking for danjou the older man had lunged behind the block of white granite his gaunt figure now crawling awkwardly in terror out of his sanctuary jason raced through the panicked crowd shoving the automatic into his belt separating the hysterical bodies that stood between himself and the man who could give him the answers treadstone treadstone he reached the grayhaired medusan get up be ordered lets get out of here delta it was carlos man i know him ive used him he was going to kill me i know come on quickly othersll be coming back theyll be looking for us come on a patch of black fell across bournes eyes at the corner of his eyes he spun around instinctively shoving danjou down as four rapid shots came from a gun held by a dark figure standing by the line of taxis fragments of granite and marble exploded all around them it was him the wide heavy shoulders that floated in space the tapered waist outlined by a formfitting black suit the darkskinned face encased in a white silk scarf below the narrowbrimmed black hat carlos get carlos trap carlos cain is for charlie and delta is for cain false find treadstone find a message for a man find jason bourne he was going mad blurred images from the past converged with the terrible reality of the present driving him insane the doors of his mind opened and closed crashing open crashing shut light streaming out one moment darkness the next the pain returned to his temples with sharp jarring notes of deafening thunder he started after the man in the black suit with the white silk scarf wrapped around his face then he saw the eyes and the barrel of the gun three dark orbs zeroed in on him like black laser beams bergeron was it bergeron was it or zurich or no time he feigned to his left then dove to the right out of the line of fire bullets splattered into stone the screeches of ricochets following each explosion jason spun under a stationary car between the wheels he could see the figure in black racing away the pain remained but the thunder stopped he crawled out on the cobblestones rose to his feet and ran back toward the steps of the louvre what had he done danjou was gone how had it happened the reverse trap was no trap at all his own strategy had been used against him permitting the only man who could give him the answers to escape he had followed carlos soldiers but carlos had followed him since sainthonoré it was all for nothing a sickening hollowness spread through him and then he heard the words spoken from behind a nearby automobile philippe danjou came cautiously into view tam quans never far away it seems where shall we go delta we cant stay here they sat inside a curtained booth in a crowded café on the rue pilon a back street that was hardly more than an alley in montmartre danjou sipped his double brandy his voice low pensive i shall return to asia he said to singapore or hong kong or even the seychelles perhaps france was never very good for me now its deadly you may not have to said bourne swallowing the whiskey the warm liquid spreading quickly inducing a brief spatial calm i meant what i said you tell me what i want to know ill give you he stopped the doubts sweeping over him no he would say it ill give you carlos identity im not remotely interested replied the former medusan watching jason closely ill tell you whatever i can why should i withhold anything obviously i wont go to the authorities but if i have information that could help you take carlos the world would be a safer place for me wouldnt it personally however i wish no involvement youre not even curious academically perhaps for your expression tells me ill be shocked so ask your questions and then astonish me youll be shocked without warning danjou said the name quietly bergeron jason did not move speechless he stared at the older man danjou continued ive thought about it over and over again whenever we talk i look at him and wonder each time however i reject the idea why bourne interrupted refusing to acknowledge the medusans accuracy mind you im not surei just feel its wrong perhaps because ive learned more about carlos from rené bergeron than anyone else hes obsessed by carlos hes worked for him for years takes enormous pride in the confidence my problem is that he talks too much about him the ego speaking through the assumed second party its possible i suppose but inconsistent with the extraordinary precautions carlos takes the literally impenetrable wall of secrecy hes built around himself im not certain of course but i doubt its bergeron you said the name i didnt danjou smiled you have nothing to be concerned about delta ask your questions i thought it was bergeron im sorry dont be for he may be i told you it doesnt matter to me in a few days ill be back in asia following the franc or the dollar or the yen we medusans were always resourceful werent we jason was not sure why but the haggard face of andré villiers came to his minds eye he had promised himself to learn what he could for the old soldier he would not get the opportunity again where does villiers wife fit in danjous eyebrows arched angélique but of courseyou said parc monceau didnt you how the details arent important now certainly not to me what about her primed bourne have you looked at her closely the skin ive been close enough shes tanned very tall and very tanned she keeps her skin that way the riviera the greek isles costa del sol gstaad she is never without a sundrenched skin its very becoming its also a successful device it covers what she is for her there is no autumn or winter pallor no lack of color in her face or arms or very long legs the attractive hue of her skin is always there because it would be there in any event with or without sainttropez or the costa brava or the alps what are you talking about although the stunning angélique villiers is presumed to be parisian shes not shes hispanic venezuelan to be precise sanchez whispered bourne ilich ramirez sanchez yes among the very few who speak of such things it is said she is carlos first cousin his lover since the age of fourteen it is rumoredamong those very few peoplethat beyond himself she is the only person on earth he cares about and villiers is the unwitting drone words from medusa delta danjou nodded yes villiers is the drone carlos brilliantly conceived wire into many of the most sensitive departments of the french government including the files on carlos himself brilliantly conceived said jason remembering because its unthinkable totally bourne leaned forward the interruption abrupt treadstone he said both hands gripping the glass in front of him tell me about treadstone seventyone what can i tell you everything they know everything carlos knows i dont think im capable of doing that i hear things piece things together but except where medusas concerned im hardly a consultant much less a confidant it was all jason could do to control himself curb himself from asking about medusa about delta and tam quan the winds in the night sky and the darkness and the explosions of light that blinded him whenever he heard the words he could not certain things had to be assumed his own loss passed over no indication given the priorities treadstone treadstone seventyone what have you heard what have you pieced together what i heard and what i pieced together were not always compatible still obvious facts were apparent to me such as when i saw it was you i knew delta had made a lucrative agreement with the americans another lucrative agreement a different kind than before perhaps spell that out please eleven years ago the rumors out of saigon were that the icecold delta was the highestpaid medusan of us all surely you were the most capable i knew so i assumed you drove a hard bargain you must have driven an infinitely harder one to do what youre doing now which is from what youve heard what we know it was confirmed in new york the monk confirmed it before he died that much i was told it was consistent with the pattern since the beginning bourne held the glass avoiding danjous eyes the monk the monk do not ask the monk is dead whoever and whatever he was he is not pertinent now i repeat said jason what is it they think they know im doing come delta im the one whos leaving its pointless to please interrupted bourne very well you agreed to become cain the mythical killer with an unending list of contracts that never existed each created out of whole cloth given substance by all manner of reliable sources purpose to challenge carloseroding his stature at every turn was the way bergeron phrased itto undercut his prices spread the word of his deficiencies your own superiority in essence to draw out carlos and take him this was your agreement with the americans rays of his own personal sunlight burst into the dark comers of jasons mind in the distance doors were opening but they were still too far away and opened only partially but there was light where before there was only darkness then the americans are bourne did not finish the statement hoping in brief torment that danjou would finish it for him yes said the medusan treadstone seventyone the most controlled unit of american intelligence since the state departments consular operations created by the same man who built medusa david abbott the monk said jason softly instinctively another door in the distance partially open of course who else would he approach to play the role of cain but the man from medusa known as delta as i say the instant i saw you i knew it a role bourne stopped the sunlight growing brighter warm not blinding danjou leaned forward its here of course that what i heard and what i pieced together was incompatible it was said that jason bourne accepted the assignment for reasons i knew were not true i was there they were not they could not know what did they say what did you hear that you were an american intelligence officer possibly military can you imagine you delta the man filled with contempt for so much not the least of which was for most things american i told bergeron it was impossible but im not sure he believed me what did you tell him what i believed wha t i still believe it wasnt moneyno amount of money could have made you do itit had to be something else i think you did it for the same reason so many others agreed to medusa eleven years ago to clean a slate somewhere to be able to return to something you had before that was barred to you i dont know of course and i dont expect you to confirm it but thats what i think its possible youre right said jason holding his breath the cool winds of release blowing into the mists it made sense a message was sent this could be it find the message find the sender treadstone which leads us back continued danjou to the stories about delta who was he what was he this educated oddly quiet man who could transform himself into a lethal weapon in the jungles who stretched himself and others beyond endurance for no cause at all we never understood it was never required is there anything else you can tell me do they know the precise location of treadstone certainly i learned it from bergeron a residence in new york city on east seventyfirst street number isnt that correct possibly anything else only what you obviously know the strategy of which i admit eludes me which is that the americans think you turned better phrased they want carlos to believe they think you turned why he was closer it was here the story is a long period of silence coinciding with cains inactivity plus stolen funds but mainly the silence that was it the message the silence the months in port noir the madness in zurich the insanity in paris no one could possibly know what had happened he was being told to come in to surface you were right marie my love my dearest love you w ere right from the beginning nothing else then asked bourne trying to control the impatience in his voice anxious now beyond any anxiety he had known to get back to marie its all i knowbut please understand i was never told that much i was brought in because of my knowledge of medusaand it was established that cain was from medusabut i was never part of carlos inner circle you were close enough thank you jason put several bills on the table and started to slide across the booth theres one thing said danjou im not sure its relevant at this point but they know your name is not jason bourne what march dont you remember delta its only two days from now and the dates very important to carlos word has been spread he wants your corpse on the twentyfifth he wants to deliver it to the americans on that day what are you trying to say on march jason bourne was executed at tam quan you executed him she opened the door and for a moment he stood looking at her seeing the large brown eyes that roamed his face eyes that were afraid yet curious she knew not the answer but that there was an answer and he had come back to tell her what it was he walked into the room she closed the door it happened she said it happened bourne turned and reached for her she came to him and they held each other the silence of the embrace saying more than any spoken words you were right he whispered finally his lips against her soft hair theres a great deal i dont knowmay never knowbut you were right im not cain because there is no cain there never was not the cain they talk about he never existed hes a myth invented to draw out carlos im that creation a man from medusa called delta agreed to become a lie named cain im that man she pulled back still holding him cain is for charlie she said the words quietly and delta is for cain completed jason youve heard me say it marie nodded yes one night in the room in switzerland you shouted it in your sleep you never mentioned carlos just cain delta i said something to you in the morning about it but you didnt answer me you just looked out the window because i didnt understand i still dont but i accept it it explains so many things she nodded again the provocateur the code words you use the strange phrases the perceptions but why why you to clean a slate somewhere thats what he said who said danjou the man on the steps in parc monceau the switchboard operator the man from medusa i knew him in medusa what did he say bourne told her and as he did he could see in her the relief he had felt in himself there was a light in her eyes and a muted throbbing in her neck sheer joy bursting from her throat it was almost as if she could barely wait for him to finish so she could hold him again jason she cried taking his face in her hands darling my darling my friend has come back to me its everything we knew everything we felt not quite everything he said touching her cheek im jason to you bourne to me because thats the name i was given and have to use it because i dont have any other but its not mine an invention no he was real they say i killed him in a place called tam quan she took her hands away from his face sliding them to his shoulders not letting him go there had to have been a reason i hope so i dont know maybe its the slate im trying to clean it doesnt matter she said releasing him its in the past over ten years ago all that matters now is that you reach the man at treadstone because theyre trying to reach you danjou said word was out that the americans think ive turned no word from me in over six months millions taken out of zurich they must think im the most expensive miscalculation on record you can explain what happened you havent knowingly broken your agreement on the other hand you cant go on its impossible all the training you received means nothing to you its there only in fragmentsimages and phrases that you cant relate to anything people youre supposed to know you dont know theyre faces without names without reasons for being where they are or what they are bourne took off his coat and pulled the automatic from his belt he studied the cylinderthe ugly perforated extension of the barrel that guaranteed to reduce the decibel count of a gunshot to a spit it sickened him he walked to the bureau put the weapon inside and pushed the drawer shut he held on to the knobs for a moment his eyes straying to the mirror to the face in the glass that had no name what do i say to them he asked this is jason bourne calling of course i know thats not my name because i killed a man named jason bourne but its the one you gave me im sorry gentlemen but something happened to me on the way to marseilles i lost somethingnothing you can put a price onjust my memory now i gather weve got an agreement but i dont remember what it is except for crazy phrases like get carlos and trap carlos and something about delta being cain and cain is supposed to replace charlie and charlie is really carlos things like that which may lead you to think i do remember you might even say to yourselves weve got one prime bastard here lets put him away for a couple of decades in a very tight stockade he not only took us but worse he could prove to be one hell of an embarrassment bourne turned from the mirror and looked at marie im not kidding what do i say the truth she answered theyll accept it theyve sent you a message theyre trying to reach you as far as the six months is concerned wire washburn in port noir he kept records extensive detailed records he may not answer we had our own agreement for putting me back together he was to receive a fifth of zurich untraceable to him i sent him a million american dollars do you think that would stop him from helping you jason paused he may not be able to help himself hes got a problem hes a drunk not a drinker a drunk the worst kind he knows it and likes it how long can he live with a million dollars more to the point how long do you think those waterfront pirates will let him live once they find out you can still prove you were there you were ill isolated you werent in contact with anyone how can the men at treadstone be sure from their view im a walking encyclopedia of official secrets i had to be to do what ive done how can they be certain i havent talked to the wrong people tell them to send a team to port noir itll be greeted with blank stares and silence i left that island in the middle of the night with half the waterfront after me with hooks if anyone down there made any money out of washburn hell see the connection and walk the other way jason i dont know what youre driving at youve got your answer the answer youve been looking for since you woke up that morning in port noir what more do you want i want to be careful thats all said bourne abrasively i want to look before i leap and make damn sure the stable door is shut and jack be nimble jack be quick jack jump over the candlestickbut for christs sake dont fall into the fire hows that for remembering he was shouting he stopped marie walked across the room and stood in front of him its very good but thats not it is it being careful i mean jason shook his head no it isnt he said with each step ive been afraid afraid of the things ive learned now at the end im more frightened than ever if im not jason bourne who am i really what have i left back there has that occurred to you in all its ramifications my darling in a way im far more afraid than you but i dont think that can stop us i wish to god it could but i know it cant the attaché at the american embassy on the avenue gabriel walked into the office of the first secretary and closed the door the man at the desk looked up youre sure its him im only sure he used the key words said the attaché crossing to the desk a redbordered index card in his hand heres the flag he continued handing the card to the first secretary ive checked off the words he used and if that flags accurate id say hes genuine the man behind the desk studied the card when did he use the name treadstone only after i convinced him that he wasnt going to talk with anyone in u s intelligence unless he gave me a damn good reason i think he thought itd blow my mind when he said he was jason bourne when i simply asked him what i could do for him he seemed stuck almost as if he might hang up on me didnt he say there was a flag out for him i was waiting for it but he never said it according to that eightword sketchexperienced field officer possible defection or enemy detentionhe could have just said the word flag and we would have been in sync he didnt then maybe hes not genuine the rest fits though he did say dcs been looking for him for more than six months that was when he used the name treadstone he was from treadstone thats supposed to be the explosive he also told me to relay the code words delta cain and medusa the first two are on the flag i checked them off i dont know what medusa means i dont know what any of this means said the first secretary except that my orders are to hightail it down to communications clear all scrambler traffic to langley and get a sterile patch to a spook named conklin him ive heard of a mean son of a bitch who got his foot blown off ten or twelve years ago in nam he pushes very strange buttons over at the company also he survived the purges which leads me to think hes one man they dont want roaming the streets looking for a job or a publisher who do you think this bourne is asked the attaché ive never seen such a concentrated but formless hunt for a person in my whole eight years away from the states someone they want very badly the first secretary got up from the desk thanks for this ill tell dc how well you handled it whats the schedule i dont suppose he gave you a telephone number no way he wanted to call back in fifteen minutes but i played the harried bureaucrat i told him to call me in an hour or so thatd make it past five oclock so we could gain another hour or two by my being out to dinner i dont know we cant risk losing him ill let conklin set up the game plan hes the control on this no one makes a move on bourne unless its authorized by him alexander conklin sat behind the desk in his whitewalled office in langley virginia and listened to the embassy man in paris he was convinced it was delta the reference to medusa was the proof for it was a name no one would know but delta the bastard he was playing the stranded agent his controls at the treadstone telephone not responding to the proper code wordswhatever they werebecause the dead could not talk he was using the omission to get himself off the meathook the sheer nerve of the bastard was awesome bastard bastard kill the controls and use the kills to call off the hunt any kind of hunt how many men had done it before thought alexander conklin he had there had been a sourcecontrol in the hills of huong khe a maniac issuing maniacal orders certain death for a dozen teams of medusans on a maniacal hunt a young intelligence officer named conklin had crept back into base camp kilo with a north vietnamese rifle russian caliber and had fired two bullets into the head of a maniac there had been grieving and harsher security measures put in force but the hunt was called off there had been no fragments of glass found in the jungle paths of base camp kilo however fragments with fingerprints that irrefutably identified the sniper as an occidental recruit from medusa itself there were such fragments found on seventyfirst street but the killer did not know itdelta did not know it at one point we seriously questioned whether he was genuine said the embassys first secretary rambling on as if to fill the abrupt silence from washington an experienced field officer would have told the attaché to check for a flag but the subject didnt an oversight replied conklin pulling his mind back to the brutal enigma that was deltacain what are the arrangements initially bourne insisted on calling back in fifteen minutes but i instructed lowerlevel to stall for instance we could use the dinner hour the embassy man was making sure a company executive in washington realized the perspicacity of his contributions it would go on for the better part of a minute conklin had heard too many variations before delta why had he turned the madness must have eaten his head away leaving only the instincts for survival he had been around too long he knew that sooner or later they would find him kill him there was never any alternative he understood that from the moment he turnedor broke or whatever it was there was nowhere to hide any longer he was a target all over the globe he could never know who might step out of the shadows and bring his life to an end it was something they all lived with the single most persuasive argument against turning so another solution had to be found survival the biblical cain was the first to commit fratricide had the mythical name triggered the obscene decision the strategy itself was it as simple as that clod knew it was the perfect solution kill them all kill your brother webb gone the monk gone the yachtsman and his wife who could deny the instructions delta received since these four alone relayed instructions to him he had removed the millions and distributed them as ordered blind recipients he had assumed were intrinsic to the monks strategy who was delta to question the monk the creator of medusa the genius who had recruited and created him cain the perfect solution to be utterly convincing all that was required was the death of a brother the proper grief to follow the official judgment would be rendered carlos had infiltrated and broken treadstone the assassin had won treadstone abandoned the bastard so basically i felt the game plan would come from you the first secretary in paris had finished he was an ass but conklin needed him one tune had to be heard while another was being played you did the right thing said a respectful executive in langley ill let our people over here know how well you handled it you were absolutely right we need time but bourne doesnt realize it we cant tell him either which makes it tough were on sterile so may i speak accordingly of course bournes under pressure hes been detained for a long period of time am i clear the soviets right up to the lubyanka his run was made by means of a doubleentry are you familiar with the term yes i am moscow thinks hes working for them now thats what they think conklin paused and were not sure crazy things happen in the lubyanka the first secretary whistled softly thats a basket how are you going to make a determination with your help but the classification priority is so high its above embassy even ambassadorial level youre on the scene you were reached you can accept the condition or not thats up to you if you do i think a commendation might come right out of the oval office conklin could hear the slow intake of breath from paris ill do whatever i can of course name it you already did we want him stalled when he calls back talk to him yourself naturally interrupted the embassy man tell him you relayed the codes tell him washington is flying over an officerofrecord from treadstone by military transport say dc wants him to keep out of sight and away from the embassy every route is being watched then ask him if he wants protection and if he does find out where he wants to pick it up but dont send anyone when you talk to me again ill have been in touch with someone over there ill give you a name then and an eyespot you can give to him eyespot visual identification something or someone he can recognize one of your men yes we think its best that way beyond you theres no point in involving the embassy as a matter of fact its vital we dont so whatever conversations you have shouldnt be logged i can take care of that said the first secretary but how is the one conversation im going to have with him going to help you determine whether hes a doubleentry because it wont be one itll be closer to ten ten thats right your instructions to bournefrom us through youare that hes to check in on your phone every hour to confirm the fact that hes in safe territory until that last time when you tell him the treadstone officer has arrived in paris and will meet with him what will that accomplish asked the embassy man hell keep moving if hes not ours there are a half a dozen known deepcover soviet agents in paris all with tripped phones if hes working with moscow the chances are hell use at least one of them well be watching and if thats the way it turns out i think youll remember the time you spent all night at the embassy for the rest of your life presidential commendations have a way of raising a career mans grade level of course you dont have too much higher to go theres higher mr conklin interrupted the first secretary the conversation was over the embassy man would call back after hearing from bourne conklin got up from the chair and limped across the room to a gray filing cabinet against the wall he unlocked the top panel inside was a stapled folder containing a sealed envelope bearing the names and locations of men who could be called upon in emergencies they had once been good men loyal men who for one reason or another could no longer be on a washington payroll in all cases it had been necessary to remove them from the official scene relocate them with new identities those fluent in other languages frequently given citizenship by cooperating foreign governments they had simply disappeared they were the outcasts men who had gone beyond the laws in the service of their country who often killed in the interests of their country but their country could not tolerate their official existence their covers had been exposed their actions made known still they could be called upon monies were constantly funneled to accounts beyond official scrutiny certain understandings intrinsic to the payments conklin carried the envelope back to his desk and tore the marked tape from the flap it would be resealed remarked there was a man in paris a dedicated man who had come up through the officer corps of army intelligence a lieutenant colonel by the time he was thirtyfive he could be counted on he understood national priorities he had killed a leftwing cameraman in a village near hu a dozen years ago three minutes later he had the man on the line the call unlogged unrecorded the former officer was given a name and a brief sketch of defection including a covert trip to the united states during which the defector in question on special assignment had eliminated those controlling the strategy a doubleentry asked the man in paris moscow no not the soviets replied conklin aware that if delta requested protection there would be conversations between the two men it was a longrange deep cover to snare carlos the assassin thats right you may say its not moscow but you wont convince me carlos was trained in novgorod and as far as im concerned hes still a dirty gun for the kgb perhaps the details arent for briefing but suffice it to say were convinced our man was bought off hes made a few million and wants an unencumbered passport so he took out the controls and the fingers pointed at carlos which doesnt mean a damn thing but give him another kill thats it we want to play it out let him think hes home free best wed like an admission whatever information we can get which is why im on my way over but its definitely secondary to taking him out too many people in too many places were compromised to put him where he is can you help therell be a bonus my pleasure and keep the bonus i hate fuckers like him they blow whole networks its got to be airtight hes one of the best id suggest support at least one ive got a man from the saintgervais worth five hes for hire hire him here are the particulars the control in paris is an embassy blind he knows nothing but hes in communication with bourne and may request protection for him ill play it said the former intelligence officer go ahead theres not much more for the moment ill take a jet out of andrews my eta in paris will be anywhere between eleven and twelve midnight your time i want to see bourne within an hour or so after that and be back here in washington by tomorrow its tight but thats the way its got to be thats the way itll be then the blind at the embassy is the first secretary his name is conklin gave the remaining specifics and the two men worked out basic ciphers for their initial contact in paris code words that would tell the man from the central intelligence agency whether or not any problems existed when they spoke conklin hung up everything was in motion exactly the way delta would expect it to be in motion the inheritors of treadstone would go by the book and the book was specific where collapsed strategies and strategists were concerned they were to be dissolved cut off no official connection or acknowledgment permitted failed strategies and strategists were an embarrassment to washington and from its manipulative beginnings treadstone seventyone had used abused and maneuvered every major unit in the united states intelligence community and not a few foreign governments very long poles would be held when touching any survivors delta knew all this and because he himself had destroyed treadstone he would appreciate the precautions anticipate them be alarmed if they were not there and when confronted he would react in false fury and artificial anguish over the violence that had taken place in seventyfirst street alexander conklin would listen with all his concentration trying to discern a genuine note or even the outlines of a reasonable explanation but he knew he would hear neither irregular fragments of glass could not beam themselves across the atlantic only to be concealed beneath a heavy drape in a manhattan brownstone and fingerprints were more accurate proof of a man having been at a scene than any photograph there was no way they could be doctored conklin would give delta the benefit of two minutes to say whatever came to his facile mind he would listen and then he would pull the trigger why are they doing it asked jason sitting down next to marie in the packed café he had made the fifth telephone call five hours after having reached the embassy they want me to keep running theyre forcing me to run and i dont know why youre forcing yourself said marie you could have made the calls from the room no i couldnt for some reason they want me to know that each time i call that son of a bitch asks me where i am now am i in safe territory silly goddamn phrase safe territory but hes saying something else hes telling me that every contact must be made from a different location so that no one outside or inside could trace me to a single phone a single address they dont want me in custody but they want me on a string they want me but theyre afraid of me it doesnt make sense isnt it possible youre imagining these things no one said anything remotely like that they didnt have to its in what they didnt say why didnt they just tell me to come right over to the embassy order me no one could touch me there its u s territory they didnt the streets are being watched you were told that you know i accepted thatblindlyuntil about thirty seconds ago when it struck me by whom whos watching the streets carlos obviously his men you know that and i know thatat least we can assume itbut they dont know that i may not know who the hell i am or where i came from but i know whats happened to me during the past twentyfour hours they dont they could assume too couldnt they they might have spotted strange men in cars or standing around too long too obviously carlos is brighter than that and there are lots of ways a specific vehicle could get quickly inside an embassys gate marine contingents everywhere are trained for things like that i believe you but they didnt do that they didnt even suggest it instead theyre stalling me making me play games goddamn it why you said it yourself jason they havent heard from you in six months theyre being very careful why this way they get me inside those gates they can do whatever they want they control me they can throw me a party or throw me into a cell instead they dont want to touch me but they dont want to lose me either theyre waiting for the man flying over from washington what better place to wait for him than in the embassy bourne pushed back his chair somethings wrong lets get out of here it had taken alexander conklin inheritor of treadstone exactly six hours and twelve minutes to cross the atlantic to go back he would take the first concorde flight out of paris in the morning reach dulles by washington time and be at langley by if anyone tried to phone him or asked where he had spent the night an accommodating major from the pentagon would supply a false answer and a first secretary at the embassy in paris would be told that if he ever mentioned having had a single conversation with the man from langley hed be descaled to the lowest attaché on the ladder and shipped to a new post in tierra del fuego it was guaranteed conklin went directly to a row of pay phones against the wall and called the embassy the first secretary was filled with a sense of accomplishment everythings according to schedule conklin said the embassy man the absence of the previously employed mister a sign of equality the company executive was in paris now and turf was turf bournes edgy during our last communication he repeatedly asked why he wasnt being told to come in he did at first conklin was surprised then he understood delta was feigning the reactions of a man who knew nothing of the events on seventyfirst street if he had been told to come to the embassy he would have bolted he knew better there could be no official connection treadstone was anathema a discredited strategy a major embarrassment did you reiterate that the streets were being watched naturally then he asked me who was watching them can you imagine i can what did you say that he knew as well as i did and all things considered i thought it was counterproductive to discuss such matters over the telephone very good i rather thought so what did he say to that did he settle for it in an odd way yes he said i see thats all did he change his mind and ask for protection hes continued to refuse it even when i insisted the first secretary paused briefly he doesnt want to be watched does he he said confidentially no he doesnt when do you expect his next call in about fifteen minutes tell him the treadstone officer has arrived conklin took the map from his pocket it was folded to the area the route marked in blue ink say the rendezvous has been set for onethirty on the road between chevreuse and rambouillet seven miles south of versailles at the cimetière de noblesse onethirty road between chevreuse and rambouillet the cemetery will he know how to get there hes been there before if he says hes going by taxi tell him to take the normal precautions and dismiss it wont that appear strange to the driver i mean its an odd hour for mourning i said youre to tell him that obviously he wont take a taxi obviously said the first secretary quickly recovering by volunteering the unnecessary since i havent called your man here shall i call him now and tell him youve arrived ill take care of that youve still got his number yes of course burn it ordered conklin before it burns you ill call you back in twenty minutes a train thundered by in the lower level of the métro the vibrations felt throughout the platform bourne hung up the pay phone on the concrete wall and stared for a moment at the mouthpiece another door had partially opened somewhere in the distance of his mind the light too far away too dim to see inside still there were images on the road to rambouillet through an archway of iron latticework a gently sloping hill with white marble crosseslarge larger mausoleums and statuary everywhere le cimetière de noblesse a cemetery but far more than a resting place for the dead a drop but even more than that a place where conversations took place amid burials and the lowering of caskets two men dressed somberly as the crowds were dressed somberly moving between the mourners until they met among the mourners and exchanged the words they had to say to each other there was a face but it was blurred out of focus he saw only the eyes and that unfocused face and those eyes had a name david abbott the monk the man he knew but did not know creator of medusa and cain jason blinked several times and shook his head as if to shake the sudden mists away he glanced over at marie who was fifteen feet to his left against the wall supposedly scanning the crowds on the platform watching for someone possibly watching him she was not she was looking at him herself a frown of concern across her face he nodded reassuring her it was not a bad moment for him instead images had come to him he had been to that cemetery somehow he would know it he walked toward marie she turned and fell in step beside him as they headed for the exit hes here said bourne treadstones arrived im to meet him near rambouillet at a cemetery thats a ghoulish touch why a cemetery its supposed to reassure me good god how ive been there before ive met people there a man there by naming it as the rendezvousan unusual rendezvoustreadstones telling me hes genuine she took his arm as they climbed the steps toward the street i want to go with you sorry you cant exclude me i have to because i dont know what im going to find there and if its not what i expect ill want someone on my side darling that doesnt make sense im being hunted by the police if they find me theyll send me back to zurich on the next plane you said so yourself what good would i be to you in zurich not you villiers he trusts us he trusts you you can reach him if im not back by daybreak or havent called explaining why he can make a lot of noise and god knows hes ready to hes the one backup weve got the only one to be more specific his wife isthrough him marie nodded accepting his logic hes ready she agreed how will you get to rambouillet we have a car remember ill take you to the hotel then head over to the garage he stepped inside the elevator of the garage complex in montmartre and pressed the button for the fourth floor his mind was on a cemetery somewhere between chevreuse and rambouillet on a road he had driven over but had no idea when or for what purpose which was why he wanted to drive there now not wait until his arrival corresponded more closely to the time of rendezvous if the images that came to his mind were not completely distorted it was an enormous cemetery where precisely within those acres of graves and statuary was the meeting ground he would get there by one leaving a half hour to walk up and down the paths looking for a pair of headlights or a signal other things would come to him the elevator door scraped open the floor was threequarters filled with cars deserted otherwise jason tried to recall where he had parked the renault it was in a far corner he remembered that but was it on the right or the left he started tentatively to the left the elevator had been on his left when he had driven the car up several days ago he stopped logic abruptly orienting him the elevator had been on his left when he had entered not after he had parked the car it had been diagonally to his right then he turned his movement rapid his thoughts on a road between chevreuse and rambouillet whether it was the sudden unexpected reversal of direction or an inexperienced surveillance bourne neither knew nor cared to dwell upon whichever the moment saved his life of that he was certain a mans head ducked below the hood of a car in the second aisle on his right that man had been watching him an experienced surveillance would have stood up holding a ring of keys he had presumably picked up from the floor or checked a windshield wiper then walked away the one thing he would not do was what this man did risk being seen by ducking out of sight jason maintained his pace his thoughts concerned on this new development who was this man how had he been found and then both answers were so clear so obvious he felt like a fool the clerk at the auberge du coin carlos had been thoroughas he was always thoroughevery detail of failure examined and one of those details was a clerk on duty during a failure such a man bore scrutiny then questioning it would not be difficult the show of a knife or a gun would be more than sufficient information would pour from the night clerks trembling lips and carlos army ordered to spread throughout the city each district divided into sectors hunting for a specific black renault a painstaking search but not impossible made easier by the driver who had not bothered to switch license plates for how many unbroken hours had the garage been watched how many men were there inside outside how soon would others arrive would carlos arrive the questions were secondary he had to get out he could do without the car perhaps but the resulting dependency on unknown arrangements might cripple him he needed transportation and he needed it now no taxi would drive a stranger to a cemetery on the outskirts of rambouillet at one oclock in the morning and it was no time to rely on the possibility of stealing a car in the streets he stopped taking cigarettes and matches from his pockets then striking a match he cupped his hands and angled his head to protect the flame in the corner of his eye he could see a shadow squareshaped stocky the man once more had lowered himself now behind the trunk of a nearer automobile jason dropped to a crouch spun to his left and lunged out of the aisle between two adjacent cars breaking his fall with the palms of his hands the maneuver made in silence he crawled around the rear wheels of the automobile on his right arms and legs working rapidly quietly down the narrow alley of vehicles a spider scurrying across a web he was behind the man now he crept forward toward the aisle and rose to his knees inching his face along smooth metal and peered beyond a headlight the heavyset man was in full view standing erect he was evidently bewildered for he moved hesitantly closer toward the renault his body low again squinting to see beyond the windshield what he saw frightened him further there was nothing no one he gasped the audible intake of breath a prelude to running he had been tricked he knew it and was not about to wait around for the consequenceswhich told bourne something else the man had been briefed on the driver of the renault the danger explained the man began to race toward the exit ramp now jason sprang up and ran straight ahead across the aisle between the cars to the second aisle catching up with the running man hurling himself at his back and throwing him to the concrete floor he hammerlocked the mans thick neck crashing the outsized skull into the pavement the fingers of his left hand pressed into the mans eye sockets you have exactly five seconds to tell me whos outside he said in french remembering the grimacing face of another frenchman in an elevator in zurich there had been men outside then men who wanted to kill him then on the bahnhofstrasse tell me now a man one man thats all bourne relocked the neck digging his fingers deeper into the eyes where in a car spat out the man parked across the street my god youre choking me youre blinding me not yet youll know it when and if i do both what kind of car foreign i dont know italian i think or american i dont know please my eyes color dark green blue very dark oh my god youre carlos man arent you who jason yanked again pressed again you heard meyoure from carlos i dont know any carlos we call a man there is a number thats all we do has he been called the man did not reply bourne dug his fingers deeper tell me yes i had to when a few minutes ago the coin telephone on the second ramp my god i cant see yes you can get up jason released the man pulling him to his feet get over to the car quickly bourne pushed the man back between the stationary automobiles to the renaults aisle the man turned protesting helpless you heard me hurry shouted jason im only earning a few francs now you can drive for them bourne shoved him again toward the renault moments later the small black automobile careened down an exit ramp toward a glass booth with a single attendant and the cash register jason was in the back seat his gun pressed against the mans bruised neck bourne shoved a bill and his dated ticket out the window the attendant took both drive said bourne do exactly what i told you to do the man pressed the accelerator and the renault sped out through the exit the man made a screeching uturn in the street coming to a sudden stop in front of a dark green chevrolet a car door opened behind them running footsteps followed jules que se passetil cest toi qui conduis a figure loomed in the open window bourne raised his automatic pointing the barrel at the mans face take two steps back he said in french no more just two and then stand still he tapped the head of the man named jules get out slowly we were only to follow you protested jules stepping out into the street follow you and report your whereabouts youll do better than that said bourne getting out of the renault taking his map of paris with him youre going to drive me for a while get in your car both of you five miles outside of paris on the road to chevreuse the two men were ordered out of the car it was a dark poorly lighted thirdgrade highway there had been no stores buildings houses or road phones for the past three miles what was the number you were told to call demanded jason dont lie youd be in worse trouble jules gave it to him bourne nodded and climbed into the seat behind the wheel of the chevrolet the old man in the threadbare overcoat sat huddled in the shadows of the empty booth by the telephone the small restaurant was closed his presence there an accommodation made by a friend from the old days the better days he kept looking at the instrument on the wall wondering when it would ring it was only a question of time and when it did he would in turn make a call and the better days would return permanently he would be the one man in paris who was the link to carlos it would be whispered among the other old men and respect would be his again the highpitched sound of the bell burst from the telephone echoing off the walls of the deserted restaurant the beggar climbed out of the booth and rushed to the phone his chest pounding with anticipation it was the signal cain was cornered the days of patient waiting merely a preface to the fine life he lifted the phone out of its curved recess yes its jules cried the breathless voice the old mans face turned ashen the pounding in his chest growing so loud he could barely hear the terrible things being said but he had heard enough he was a dead man whitehot explosions joined the vibrations that took hold of his body there was no air only white light and deafening eruptions surging up from his stomach to his head the beggar sank to the floor the cord stretched taut the phone still in his hand he stared up at the horrible instrument that carried the terrible words what could he do what in the name of god would he do bourne walked down the path between the graves forcing himself to let his mind fall free as washburn had commanded a lifetime ago in port noir if ever he had to be a sponge it was now the man from treadstone had to understand he was trying with all his concentration to make sense out of the unremembered to find meaning in the images that came to him without warning he had not broken whatever agreement they had he had not turned or run he was a cripple it was as simple as that he had to find the man from treadstone where inside those fenced acres of silence would he be where did he expect him to be jason had reached the cemetery well before one the chevrolet a faster car than the brokendown renault he had passed the gates driven several hundred yards down the road pulled off onto the shoulder and parked the car reasonably out of sight on his way back to the gates it had started to rain it was a cold rain a march rain but a quiet rain little intrusions upon the silence he passed a cluster of graves within a plot bordered by a low iron railing the centerpiece an alabaster cross rising eight feet out of the ground he stood for a moment before it had he been here before was another door opening for him in the distance or was he trying too desperately to find one and then it came to him it was not this particular grouping of gravestones not the tall alabaster cross nor the low iron railing it was the rain a sudden rain crowds of mourners gathered in black around a burial site the snapping of umbrellas and two men coming together umbrellas touching brief quiet apologies muttered as a long brown envelope exchanged hands pocket to pocket unnoticed by the mourners there was something else an image triggered by an image feeding upon itself seen only minutes ago rain cascading down white marble not a cold light rain but a downpour pounding against the wall of a glistening white surface and columns rows of columns on all sides a miniature replica of an ancient treasure on the other side of the hill near the gates a white mausoleum someones scaleddown version of the parthenon he had passed it less than five minutes before looking at it but not seeing it that was where the sudden rain had taken place where two umbrellas had touched and an envelope been delivered he squinted at the radium dial of his watch it was fourteen minutes past one he started running back up the path he was still early there was time left to see a cars headlights or the striking of a match or the beam of a flashlight it was there at the bottom of the hill and it was moving up and down intermittently swinging back at the gates as though the holder were concerned that someone might appear bourne had an almost uncontrollable urge to race down between the rows of graves and statuary shouting at the top of his voice im here its me i understand your message ive come back i have so much to tell you and there is so much you must tell me but he did not shout and he did not run above all else he had to show control for what afflicted him was so uncontrollable he had to appear completely lucidsane within the boundaries of his memory he began walking down the hill in the cold light rain wishing his sense of urgency had allowed him to remember a flashlight the flashlight something was odd about the beam of light five hundred feet below it was moving in short vertical strokes as if in emphasis as if the man holding it were speaking emphatically to another he was jason crouched peering through the rain his eyes struck by a sharp darting reflection of light that shot out whenever the beam hit the object in front of it he crept forward his body close to the ground covering practically a hundred feet in seconds his gaze still on the beam and the strange reflection he could see more clearly now he stopped and concentrated there were two men one holding the flashlight the other a shortbarreled rifle the thick steel of the gun known only too well to bourne at distances of up to thirty feet it could blow a man six feet into the air it was a very odd weapon for an officerofrecord sent by washington to have at his command the beam of light shot over to the side of the white mausoleum the figure holding the rifle retreated quickly slipping behind a column no more than twenty feet away from the man holding the flashlight jason did not have to think he knew what he had to do if there was an explanation for the deadly weapon so be it but it would not be used on him kneeling he judged the distance and looked for points of sanctuary both for concealment and protection he started out wiping the rain from his face feeling the gun in his belt that he knew he could not use he scrambled from gravestone to gravestone statue to statue heading to his right then angling gradually to his left until the semicircle was nearly complete he was within fifteen feet of the mausoleum the man with the murderous weapon was standing by the left corner column under the short portico to avoid the rain he was fondling his gun as though it were a sexual object cracking the breach unable to resist peering inside he ran his palm over the inserted shells the gesture obscene now bourne crept out from behind the gravestone hands and knees propelling him over the wet grass until he was within six feet of the man he sprang up a silent lethal panther hurling dirt in front of him one hand surging for the barrel of the rifle the other for the mans head he reached both grabbed both clasping the barrel in the fingers of his left hand the mans hair in his right the head snapped back throat stretched sound muted he smashed the head into the white marble with such force that the expulsion of breath that followed signified a severe concussion the man went limp jason supporting him against the wall permitting the unconscious body to slip silently to the ground between the columns he searched the man removing a magnum automatic from a leather case sewn into his jacket a razorsharp scaling knife from a scabbard on his belt and a small revolver from an ankle holster nothing remotely government issue this was a hired killer an arsenal on foot break his fingers the words came back to bourne they had been spoken by a man in goldrimmed glasses in a large sedan racing out of the steppdeckstrasse there was reason behind the violence jason grabbed the mans right hand and bent the fingers back until he heard the cracks he did the same with the left the mans mouth blocked bournes elbow jammed between the teeth no sound emerged above the sound of the rain and neither hand could be used for a weapon or as a weapon the weapons themselves placed out of reach in the shadows jason stood up and edged his face around the column the treadstone officer now angled the light directly into the earth in front of him it was the stationary signal the beam a lost bird was to home into it might be other things alsothe next few minutes would tell the man turned toward the gate taking a tentative step as though he might have heard something and for the first time bourne saw the cane observed the limp the officerofrecord from treadstone seventyone was a cripple as he was a cripple jason dashed back to the first gravestone spun behind it and peered around the marble edge the man from treadstone still had his attention on the gates bourne glanced at his watch it was time remained he pushed himself away from the grave hugging the ground until he was out of sight then stood up and ran retracing the arch back to the top of the hill he stood for a moment letting his breathing and his heartbeat resume a semblance of normalcy then reached into his pocket for a book of matches protecting it from the rain he tore off a match and struck it treadstone he said loud enough to be heard from below delta cain is for charlie and delta is for cain why did the man from treadstone use the name delta rather than cain delta was no part of treadstone he had disappeared with medusa jason started down the hill the cold rain whipping his face his hand instinctively reaching beneath his jacket pressing the automatic in his belt he walked onto the stretch of lawn in front of the white mausoleum the man from treadstone limped toward him then stopped raising his flashlight the harsh beam causing bourne to squint and turn his head away its been a long time said the crippled officer lowering the light the names conklin in case youve forgotten thank you i had its only one of the things one of what things that ive forgotten you remembered this place though i figured you would i read abbotts logs it was here where you last met last made a delivery during a state burial for some minister or other wasnt it i dont know thats what we have to talk about first you havent heard from me in over six months theres an explanation really lets hear it the simplest way to put it is that i was wounded shot the effects of the wounds causing a severe dislocation disorientation is a better word i guess sounds good what does it mean i suffered a memory loss total i spent months on an island in the mediterraneansouth of marseillesnot knowing who i was or where i came from theres a doctor an englishman named washburn who kept medical records he can verify what im telling you im sure he can said conklin nodding and ill bet those records are massive christ you paid enough what do you mean weve got a record too a bank officer in zurich who thought he was being tested by treadstone transferred a million and a half swiss francs to marseilles for an untraceable collection thanks for giving us the name thats part of what you have to understand i didnt know hed saved my life put me back together i was damn near a corpse when i was brought to him so you decided a millionodd dollars was a pretty fair ballpark figure is that it courtesy of the treadstone budget i told you i didnt know treadstone didnt exist for me in many ways it still doesnt i forgot you lost your memory what was the word disorientation yes but its not strong enough the word is amnesia lets stick to disorientation because it seems you oriented yourself straight into zurich right to the gemeinschaft there was a negative surgically implanted near my hip there certainly was you insisted on it a few of us understood why its the best insurance you can have i dont know what youre talking about cant you understand that sure you found the negative with only a number on it and right away you assumed the name of jason bourne it didnt happen that way each day it seemed i learned something one step at a time one revelation at a time a hotel clerk called me bourne i didnt learn the name jason until i went to the bank where you knew exactly what to do interrupted conklin no hesitation at all in and out four million gone washburn told me what to do then a woman came along who just happened to be a financial whiz kid to tell you how to squirrel away the rest and before that you took out chernak in the löwenstrasse and three men we didnt know but figured they sure as hell knew you and here in paris another shot in a bank transfer truck another associate you covered every track every goddamned track until there was only one thing left to do and youyou son of a bitchyou did it will you listen to me those men tried to kill me theyve been hunting me since marseilles beyond that i honestly dont know what youre talking about things come to me at times faces streets buildings sometimes just images i cant place but i know they mean something only i cant relate to them and namesthere are names but then no faces goddamn youim an amnesiac thats the truth one of those names wouldnt be carlos would it yes and you know it thats the point you know much more about it than i do i can recite a thousand facts about carlos but i dont know why i was told by a man whos halfway back to asia by now i had an agreement with treadstone the man worked for carlos he said carlos knows that carlos was closing in on me that you put out the word that id turned he couldnt understand the strategy and i couldnt tell him you thought id turned because you didnt hear from me and i couldnt reach you because i didnt know who you were i still dont know who you are or the monk i suppose yes yes the monk his name was abbott very good and the yachtsman you remember the yachtsman dont you and his wife names theyre there yes no faces elliot stevens nothing or gordon webb conklin said the name quietly what bourne felt the jolt in his chest then a stinging searing pain that drove through his temples to his eyes his eyes were on fire fire explosions and darkness high winds and pain almanac to delta abandon abandon you will respond as ordered abandongordon jason heard his own voice but it was far away in a faraway wind he closed his eyes the eyes that burned so and tried to push the mists away then he opened his eyes and was not at all surprised to see conklins gun aimed at his head i dont know how you did it but you did the only thing left to do and you did it you got back to new york and blew them all away you butchered them you son of a bitch i wish to christ i could bring you back and see you strapped into an electric chair but i cant so ill do the next best thing ill take you myself i havent been in new york for months before then i dont knowbut not in the last halfyear liar why didnt you do it really right why didnt you time your goddamn stunt so you could get to the funerals the monks was just the other day you would have seen a lot of old friends and your brothers jesus god almighty you could have escorted his wife down the aisle of the church maybe delivered the eulogy thatd be the kicker at least speak well of the brother you killed brother stop it for christs sake stop it why should i cain lives we made him and he came to life im not cain he never was i never was so you do know liar bastard put that gun away im telling you put it down no chance i swore to myself id give you two minutes because i wanted to hear what youd come up with well ive heard it and it smells who gave you the right we all lose things it goes with the job and if you dont like the goddamned job you get out if theres no accommodation you fade thats what i thought you did and i was willing to pass on you to convince the others to let you fade but no you came back and turned your gun on us no its not true tell that to the laboratory techs who have eight fragments of glass that spell out two prints third and index fingers right hand you were there and you butchered five people youone of themtook out your gunspluraland blew them away perfect setup discredited strategy varied shells multiple bullets infiltration treadstones aborted and you walk out free no youre wrong it was carlos not me carlos if what youre saying took place on seventyfirst street it was him he knows they know a residence on seventyfirst street number they know about it conklin nodded his eyes clouded the loathing in them seen in the dim light through the rain so perfect he said slowly the prime mover of the strategy blows it apart by making a deal with the target whats your take besides the four million carlos give you immunity from his own particular brand of persecution you two make a lovely couple thats crazy and accurate completed the man from treadstone only nine people alive knew that address before seventhirty last friday night three of them were killed and were the other four if carlos found it theres only one person who could have told him you how could i i didnt know it i dont know it you just said it conklins left hand gripped the cane it was a prelude to firing steadying a crippled foot dont shouted bourne knowing the plea was useless spinning to his left as he shouted his right foot lashing out at the wrist that held the gun chesah was the unknown word that was the silent scream in his head conklin fell back firing wildly in the air tripping over his cane jason spun around and down now hammering his left foot at the weapon it flew out of the hand that held it conklin rolled on the ground his eyes on the far columns of the mausoleum expecting an explosion from the gun that would blow his attacker into the air no the man from treadstone rolled again now to the right his features in shock his wild eyes focused onthere was someone else bourne crouched diving diagonally backward as four gunshots came in rapid succession three screeching ricochets spinning off beyond sound he rolled over and over and over pulling the automatic from his belt he saw the man in the rain a silhouetted figure rising above a gravestone he fired twice the man collapsed ten feet away conklin was thrashing on the wet grass both hands spreading frantically over the ground feeling for the steel of a gun bourne sprang up and raced over he knelt beside the treadstone man one hand grabbing the wet hair the other holding his automatic its barrel pressed into conklins skull from the far columns of the mausoleum came a prolonged shattering scream it grew steadily eerily in volume then stopped thats your hired shotgun said jason yanking conklins head to the side treadstones taken on some very strange employees who was the other man what death row did you spring him from he was a better man than you ever were replied conklin his voice strained the rain glistening on his face caught in the beam of the fallen flashlight six feet away on the ground they all are theyve all lost as much as you lost but they never turned we can count on them no matter what i say you wont believe me you dont want to believe me because i know what you arewhat you did you just confirmed the whole damn thing you can kill me but theyll get you youre the worst kind you think youre special you always did i saw you after phnom penheverybody lost out there but that didnt count with you it was only you just you then in medusa no rules for delta the animal just wanted to kill and thats the kind that turns well i lost too but i never turned go on kill me then you can go back to carlos but when i dont come back theyll know theyll come after you and they wont stop until they get you go on shoot conklin was shouting but bourne could hardly hear him instead he had heard two words and the jolts of pain hammered at his temples phnom penh phnom penh death in the skies from the skies death of the young and the very young screeching birds and screaming machines and the deathlike stench of the jungle and a river he was blinded again on fire again beneath him the man from treadstone had broken away his crippled figure was crawling in panic lunging his hands surging through the wet grass jason blinked trying to force his mind to come back to him then instantly he knew he had to point the automatic and fire conklin had found his gun and was raising it but bourne could not pull the trigger he dove to his right rolling on the ground scrambling toward the marble columns of the mausoleum conklins gunshots were wild the crippled man unable to steady his leg or his aim then the firing stopped and jason got to his feet his face against the smooth wet stone he looked out his automatic raised he had to kill this man for this man would kill him kill marie link them both to carlos conklin was hobbling pathetically toward the gates turning constantly the gun extended his destination a car outside in the road bourne raised his automatic the crippled figure in his gunsight a split halfsecond and it would be over his enemy from treadstone dead hope found with that death for there were reasonable men in washington he could not do it he could not pull the trigger he lowered the gun standing helpless by the marble column as conklin climbed into his car the car he had to get back to paris there was a way it had been there all along she had been there he rapped on the door his mind racing facts analyzed absorbed and discarded as rapidly as they came to him a strategy evolving marie recognized the knock she opened the door dear god look at you what happened no time he said rushing toward the telephone across the room it was a trap theyre convinced i turned sold out to carlos what they say i flew into new york last week last friday that i killed five people among them a brother jason closed his eyes briefly there was a brotheris a brother i dont know i cant think about it now you never left paris you can prove it how eight ten hours thats all id need and eight or ten hours unaccounted for is all they need now whos going to come forward i will youve been with me they think youre part of it said bourne picking up the telephone and dialing the theft the turning port noir the whole damn thing theyve locked you into me carlos engineered this down to the last fragment of a fingerprint christ did he put it together what are you doing whom are you calling our backup remember the only one weve got villiers villiers wife shes the one were going to take her break her put her on a hundred racks if we have to but we wont have to she wont fight because she cant win goddamn it why doesnt he answer the private phones in his office its three in the morning hes probably hes on general is that you jason had to ask the voice on the line was oddly quiet but not the quiet of interrupted sleep yes it is i my young friend i apologize for the delay ive been upstairs with my wife thats whom im calling about weve got to move now alert french intelligence interpol and the american embassy but tell them not to interfere until ive seen her talked to her we have to talk i dont think so mr bourne yes i know your name my friend as for your talking to my wife however im afraid thats not possible you see ive killed her jason stared at the hotel room wall at the flock paper with the faded designs that spiraled into one another in meaningless contortions of worn fabric why he said quietly into the phone i thought you understood i tried my friend said villiers his voice beyond anger or sorrow the saints know i tried but i could not help myself i kept looking at her seeing the son she did not bear behind her killed by the pig animal that was her mentor my whore was someone elses whore the animals whore it could not be otherwise and as i learned it was not i think she saw the outrage in my eyes heaven knows it was there the general paused the memory painful now she not only saw the outrage but the truth she saw that i knew what she was what she had been during the years wed spent together at the end i gave her the chance i told you i would give her to kill you yes it wasnt difficult between our beds is a nightstand with a weapon in the drawer she lay on her bed goyas maja splendid in her arrogance dismissing me with her private thoughts as i was consumed by my own i opened the drawer for a book of matches and walked back to my chair and my pipe leaving the drawer open the handle of the gun very much in evidence it was my silence i imagine and the fact that i could not take my eyes off her that forced her to acknowledge me then concentrate on me the tension between us had grown to the point where very little had to be said to burst the floodgates andgod help mei said it i heard myself asking why did you do it then the accusation became complete i called her my whore the whore that killed my son she stared at me for several moments her eyes breaking away once to glance at the open drawer and the gun and the telephone i stood up the embers in my pipe glowing loose chauffé au rouge she spun her legs off the bed put both hands into that open drawer and took out the gun i did not stop her instead i had to hear the words from her own lips hear my own indictment of myself as well as hers what i heard will go to my grave with me for there will be honor left by my person and the person of my son we will not be scorned by those whove given less than us never general bourne shook his head unable to think clearly knowing he had to find the seconds in order to find his thoughts general what happened she gave you my name how youve got to tell me that please willingly she said you were an insignificant gunman who wished to step into the shoes of a giant that you were a thief out of zurich a man your own people disowned did she say who those people were if she did i didnt hear i was blind deaf my rage uncontrolled but you have nothing to fear from me the chapter is closed my life over with a telephone call no jason shouted dont do that not now i must please dont settle for carlos whore get carlos trap carlos reaping scorn on my name by lying with that whore manipulated by the animals slut goddamn youwhat about your son five sticks of dynamite on rue du bac leave him in peace leave me in peace its over its not over listen to me give a moment thats all i ask the images in jasons mind raced furiously across his eyes clashing supplanting one another but these images had meaning purpose he could feel maries hand on his arm gripping him firmly somehow anchoring his body to a mooring of reality did anyone hear the gunshot there was no gunshot the coup de grâce is misunderstood in these times i prefer its original intent to still the suffering of a wounded comrade or a respected enemy it is not used for a whore what do you mean you said you killed her i strangled her forcing her eyes to look into mine as the breath went out of her body she had your gun on you ineffective when ones eyes are burning from the loose embers of a pipe its immaterial now she might have won she did win if you let it stop here cant you see that carlos wins she broke you and you didnt have the brains to do anything but choke her to death you talk about scorn youre buying it all theres nothing left but scorn why do you persist monsieur bourne asked villiers wearily i expect no charity from you nor from anyone simply leave me alone i accept what is you accomplish nothing i will if i can get you to listen to me get carlos trap carlos how many times do i have to say it hes the one you want he squares it all for you and hes the one i need without him im dead were dead for gods sake listen to me i would like to help you but theres no way i can or will if you like there is the images came into focus he knew where he was where he was going the meaning and the purpose came together reverse the trap walk away from it untouched with everything youve got in place i dont understand how is that possible you didnt kill your wife i did jason marie screamed clutching his arm i know what im doing said bourne for the first time i really know what im doing its funny but i think ive known it from the beginning parc monceau was quiet the street deserted a few porch lights shimmering in the cold mistlike rain all the windows along the row of neat expensive houses dark except for the residence of andré françois villiers legend of saintcyr and normandy member of frances national assembly wife killer the front windows above and to the left of the porch glowed dimly it was the bedroom wherein the master of the house had killed the mistress of the house where a memoryridden old soldier had choked the life out of an assassins whore villiers had agreed to nothing he had been too stunned to answer but jason had driven home his theme hammered the message with such repeated emphasis that the words had echoed over the telephone get carlos dont settle for the killers whore get the man who killed your son the man who put five sticks of dynamite in a car on rue du bac and took the last of the villiers line hes the one you want get him get carlos trap carlos cain is for charlie and delta is for cain it was so clear to him there was no other way at the end it was the beginningas the beginning had been revealed to him to survive he had to bring in the assassin if he failed he was a dead man and there would be no life for marie st jacques she would be destroyed imprisoned perhaps killed for an act of faith that became an act of love cains mark was on her embarrassment avoided with her removal she was a vial of nitroglycerine balanced on a highwire in the center of an unknown ammunition depot use a net remove her a bullet in the head neutralizes the explosives in her mind she cannot be heard there was so much villiers had to understand and so little time to explain the explanation itself limited both by a memory that did not exist and the current state of the old soldiers mind a delicate balance had to be found in the telling parameters established as to time and the generals immediate contributions jason understood he was asking a man who held his honor above all things to lie to the world for villiers to do that the objective had to be monumentally honorable get carlos there was a second ground floor entrance to the generals home to the right of the steps beyond a gate where deliveries were made to the downstairs kitchen villiers had agreed to leave the gate and the door unlatched bourne had not bothered to tell the old soldier that it did not matter that he would get inside in any event a degree of damage intrinsic to his strategy but first there was the risk that villiers house was being watched there being good reasons for carlos to do so and equally good reasons not to do so all things considered the assassin might decide to stay as far away from angélique villiers as possible taking no chance that one of his men could be picked up thus proving his connection the parc monceau connection on the other hand the dead angélique was his cousin and lover the only person on earth he cares about philippe danjou danjou of course thered be someone watchingor two or ten if danjou had gotten out of france carlos could assume the worst if the man from medusa had not the assassin would know the worst the colonial would be broken every word exchanged with cain revealed where where were carlos men strangely enough thought jason if there was no one posted in parc monceau on this particular night his entire strategy was worthless it was not they were there in a sedanthe same sedan that had raced through the gates of the louvre twelve hours ago the same two menkillers who were the backups of killers the car was fifty feet down the street on the lefthand side with a clear view of villiers house but were those two men slumped down in the seat their eyes awake and alert all that were there bourne could not tell automobiles lined the curbs on both sides of the street he crouched in the shadows of the corner building diagonally across from the two men in the stationary sedan he knew what had to be done but he was not sure how to do it he needed a diversion alarming enough to attract carlos soldiers visible enough to flush out any others who might be concealed in the street or on a rooftop or behind a darkened window fire out of nowhere sudden away from villiers how yet close enough and startling enough to send vibrations throughout the quiet deserted treelined street vibrations sirens explosive explosions it could be done it was merely a question of equipment bourne crept back behind the corner building into the intersecting street and ran silently to the nearest doorway where he stopped and removed his jacket and topcoat then he took off his shirt ripping the cloth from collar to waist he put both coats on again pulling up the lapels buttoning the topcoat the shirt under his arm he peered into the night rain scanning the automobiles in the street he needed gasoline but this was paris and most fuel tanks would be locked most but not all there had to be an unsecured top among the line of cars at the curb and then he saw what he wanted to see directly up ahead on the pavement chained to an iron gate it was a motorbike larger than a street scooter smaller than a cycle its gas tank a metal bubble between handlebars and seat the top would have a chain attached but it was unlikely to have a lock eight liters of fuel was not forty the risk of any theft had to be balanced against the proceeds and two gallons of gas was hardly worth a franc fine jason approached the bike he looked up and down the street there was no one no sounds other than the quiet spattering of the rain he put his hand on the gas tank top and turned it it unscrewed easily better yet the opening was relatively wide the gas level nearly full he replaced the top he was not yet ready to douse his shirt another piece of equipment was needed he found it at the next corner by a sewer drain a partially dislodged cobblestone forced from its recess by a decade of careless drivers jumping the curb he pried it loose by kicking his heel into the slice that separated it from its jagged wall he picked it up along with a smaller fragment and started back toward the motorbike the fragment in his pocket the large brick in his hand he tested its weight tested his arm it would do both would do three minutes later he pulled the drenched shirt slowly out of the gas tank the fumes mingling with the rain the residue of oil covering his hands he wrapped the cloth around the cobblestone twisting and crisscrossing the sleeves tying them firmly together holding his missile in place he was ready he crept back to the edge of the building at the corner of villiers street the two men in the sedan were still low in the front seat their concentration still on villiers house behind the sedan were three other cars a small mercedes a dark brown limousine and a bentley directly across from jason beyond the bentley was a white stone building its windows outlined in black enamel an inside hallway light spilled over to the casement bay windows on either side of the staircase the left was obviously a dining room he could see chairs and a long table in the additional light of a rococo sideboard mirror the windows of that dining room with their splendid view of the quaint rich parisian street would do bourne reached into his pocket and pulled out the rock it was barely onefourth the size of the gasdrenched brick but it would serve the purpose he inched around the corner of the building cocked his arm and threw the stone as far as he could above and beyond the sedan the crash echoed throughout the quiet street it was followed by a series of cracks as the rock clattered across the hood of a car and dropped to the pavement the two men in the sedan bolted up the man next to the driver opened his door his foot plunging down to the pavement a gun in his hand the driver lowered the window then switched on the headlights the beams shot forward bouncing back in blinding reflection off the metal and the chrome of the automobile in front it was a patently stupid act serving only to point up the fear of the men stationed in parc monceau now jason raced across the street his attention on the two men whose hands were covering their eyes trying to see through the glare of the reflected light he reached the trunk of the bentley the cobblestone brick under his arm a matchbook in his left hand a cluster of tornoff matches in his right he crouched struck the matches lowered the brick to the ground then picked it up by an extended sleeve he held the burning matches beneath the gassoaked cloth it burst instantly into flame he rose quickly swinging the brick by the sleeve and dashed over the curb hurling his missile toward the bulging framework of the casement window with all his strength racing beyond the edge of the building as impact was made the crash of shattering glass was a sudden intrusion on the rainsoaked stillness of the street bourne raced to his left across the narrow avenue then back toward villiers block again finding the shadows he needed the fire spread fanned by the wind from the broken window leaping up into the willowy backing of the drapes within thirty seconds the room was a flaming oven the fire magnified by the huge sideboard mirror shouts erupted windows lighted up nearby then farther down the street a minute passed and the chaos grew the door of the flaming house was yanked open and figures appearedan elderly man in a nightshirt a woman in a negligée and one slipper both in panic other doors opened other figures emerged adjusting from sleep to chaos some racing toward the fireswept residencea neighbor was in trouble jason ran diagonally across the intersection one more running figure in the rapidly gathering crowd he stopped where he had started only minutes before by the edge of the corner building and stood motionless trying to spot carlos soldiers he had been right the two men were not the only guards posted in parc monceau there were four men now huddling by the sedan talking rapidly quietly no five another walked swiftly up the pavement joining the four he heard sirens growing louder drawing nearer the five men were alarmed decisions had to be made they could not all remain where they were perhaps there were arrest records to consider agreement one man would staythe fifth man he nodded and walked rapidly across the street to villiers side the others climbed into the sedan and as a fire engine careened up the street the sedan curved out of its parking place and sped past the red behemoth racing in the opposite direction one obstacle remained the fifth man jason rounded the building spotting him halfway between the corner and villiers house it was now a question of timing and shock bourne broke into a loping run similar to that used by the people heading toward the fire his head angled back toward the corner running partially backward a figure melting into the surrounding pattern only the direction in conflict he passed the man he had not been noticedbut he would be noticed if he continued to the downstairs gate of villiers house and opened it the man was glancing back and forth concerned bewildered perhaps frightened by the fact that now he was the only patrol in the street he was standing in front of a low railing another gate another downstairs entrance to another expensive house in parc monceau jason stopped taking two rapid sidesteps toward the man then pivoted his balance on his left foot his right lashing out at the fifth mans midsection pummeling him backward over the iron rail the man shouted as he fell down into the narrow concrete corridor bourne leaped over the railing the knuckles of his right hand rigid the heels of both feet pushed forward he landed on the mans chest the impact breaking the ribs beneath him his knuckles smashing into the mans throat carlos soldier went limp he would regain consciousness long after someone removed him to a hospital jason searched the man there was a single gun strapped to his chest bourne took it out and put it into his topcoat pocket he would give it to villiers villiers the way was clear he climbed the staircase to the third floor halfway up the steps he could see a line of light at the bottom of the bedroom door beyond that door was an old man who was his only hope if ever in his liferemembered and unrememberedhe had to be convincing it was now and his conviction was realthere was no room for the chameleon now everything he believed was based on one fact carlos had to come after him it was the truth it was the trap he reached the landing and turned to his left toward the bedroom door he paused for a moment trying to dismiss the echo in his chest it was growing louder the pounding more rapid part of the truth not all of it no invention simply omission an agreement a contract with a group of menhonorable menwho were after carlos that was all villiers had to know it was what he had to accept he could not be told he was dealing with an amnesiac for in that loss of memory might be found a man of dishonor the legend of saintcyr algeria and normandy would not accept that not now here at the end of his life oh god the balance was tenuous the line between belief and disbelief so thin as thin as it was for the man corpse whose name was not jason bourne he opened the door and stepped inside into an old mans private hell outside beyond draped windows the sirens raged and the crowds shouted spectators in an unseen arena jeering the unknown oblivious to its unfathomable cause jason closed the door and stood motionless the large room was filled with shadows the only light a bedside table lamp his eyes greeted by a sight he wished he did not have to see villiers had dragged a highbacked desk chair across the room and was sitting on it at the foot of the bed staring at the dead woman sprawled over the covers angélique villiers bronzed head was resting on the pillow her eyes wide bulging out of their sockets her throat was swollen the flesh a reddish purple the massive bruise having spread throughout her neck her body was still twisted in contrast to the upright head contorted in furious struggle her long bare legs stretched out her hips turned the negligée torn her breasts bursting out of the silkeven in death sensual there had been no attempt to conceal the whore the old soldier sat like a bewildered child punished for an insignificant act the meaningful crime having escaped his tormentors reasoning and perhaps his own he pulled his eyes away from the dead woman and looked at bourne what happened outside he asked in a monotone men were watching your house carlos men five of them i started a fire up the block no one was hurt all but one man left i took him out youre resourceful monsieur bourne im resourceful agreed jason but theyll be back the firell be out and theyll come back before then if carlos puts it together and i think he will if he does hell send someone in here he wont come himself of course but one of his guns will be here when that man finds you and her hell kill you carlos loses her but he still wins he wins a second time hes used you through her and at the end he kills you he walks away and youre dead people can draw whatever conclusions they like but i dont think theyll be flattering youre very precise assured of your judgment i know what im talking about id prefer not to say what im going to say but theres no time for your feelings i have none left say what you will your wife told you she was french didnt she yes from the south her family was from loures barouse near the spanish border she came to paris years ago lived with an aunt what of it did you ever meet her family no they didnt come up for your marriage all things considered we thought it would be best not to ask them the disparity of our ages would have disturbed them what about the aunt here in paris she died before i met angélique whats the point of all this your wife wasnt french i doubt there was even an aunt in paris and her family didnt come from loures barouse although the spanish border has a certain relevance it could cover a lot explain a lot what do you mean she was venezuelan carlos first cousin his lover since she was fourteen they were a team have been for years i was told she was the only person on earth he cared about a whore an assassins instrument i wonder how many targets she set up how many valuable men are dead because of her i cannot kill her twice you can use her use her death the insanity you spoke of the only insanity is if you throw your life away carlos wins it all he goes on using his gun and sticks of dynamite and youre one more statistic another kill added to a long list of distinguished corpses thats insane and youre the reasonable man you assume the guilt for a crime you did not commit for the death of a whore hunted for a killing that was not yours thats part of it the essential part actually dont talk to me of insanity young man i beg you leave what youve told me gives me the courage to face almighty god if ever a death was justified it was hers by my hand i will look into the eyes of christ and swear it youve written yourself out then said jason noticing for the first time the bulge of a weapon in the old mans jacket pocket i will not stand trial if thats what you mean oh thats perfect general carlos himself couldnt have come up with anything better not a wasted motion on his part he doesnt even have to use his own gun but those who count will know he did it he caused it those who count will know nothing une affaire de coeur une grave maladie i am not concerned with the tongues of killers and thieves and if i told the truth told why you killed her who would listen even should you live to speak im not a fool monsieur bourne you are running from more than carlos you are hunted by many not just one you as much as told me so you would not tell me your name for my own safety you claimed when and if this was over you said it was i who might not care to be seen with you those are not the words of a man in whom much trust is placed you trusted me i told you why said villiers glancing away staring at his dead wife it was in your eyes the truth the truth then look at me now the truth is still there on that road to nanterre you told me youd listen to what i had to say because i gave you your life im trying to give it to you again you can walk away free untouched go on standing for the things you say are important to you were important to your son you can win dont mistake me im not being noble your staying alive and doing what i ask is the only way i can stay alive the only way ill ever be free the old soldier looked up why i told you i wanted carlos because something was taken from mesomething very necessary to my life my sanityand he was the cause of it thats the truthi believe its the truthbut its not the whole truth there are other people involved some decent some not and my agreement with them was to get carlos trap carlos they want what you want but something happened that i cant explaini wont try to explainand those people think i betrayed them they think i made a pact with carlos that i stole millions from them and killed others who were my links to them they have men everywhere and the orders are to execute me on sight you were right im running from more than carlos im hunted by men i dont know and cant see for all the wrong reasons i didnt do the things they say i did but no one wants to listen i have no pact with carlosyou know i dont i believe you theres nothing to prevent me from making a call on your behalf i owe you that how what are you going to say the man known to me as jason bourne has no pact with carlos i know this because he exposed carlos mistress to me and that woman was my wife the wife i choked to death so as not to bring dishonor to my name im about to call the sûreté and confess my crimealthough of course i wont tell them why i killed her or why im going to kill myself is that it general is that what youre going to say the old man stared silently at bourne the fundamental contradiction clear to him i cannot help you then good fine carlos wins it all she wins you lose your son loses go oncall the police then put the barrel of the gun in your goddamn mouth and blow your goddamn head off go on thats what you want take yourself out lie down and die youre not good for anything else anymore youre a selfpitying old old man god knows youre no match for carlos no match for the man who placed five sticks of dynamite in rue du bac and killed your son villiers hands shook the trembling spread to his head do not do this im telling you do not do this telling me you mean youre giving me an order the little old man with the big brass buttons is issuing a command well forget it i dont take orders from men like you youre frauds youre worse than all the people you attack at least they have the stomachs to do what they say theyre going to do you dont all youve got is wind words and wind and selfserving bromides lie down and die old man but dont give me an order villiers unclasped his hands and shot out of the chair his racked body now trembling i told you no more im not interested in what you tell me i was right the first time i saw you you belong to carlos you were his lackey alive and youll be his lackey dead the old soldiers face grimaced in pain he pulled out his gun the gesture pathetic the threat however real ive killed many men in my time in my profession it was unavoidable often disturbing i dont want to kill you now but i will if you disregard my wishes leave me leave this house thats terrific you must be wired into carlos head you kill me he sweeps the board jason took a step forward aware of the fact that it was the first movement he had made since entering the room he saw villiers eyes widen the gun shook its oscillating shadow cast against the wall a single half ounce of pressure and the hammer would plunge forward bullet finding its mark for in spite of madness of the moment the hand that held that weapon had spent a lifetime gripping steel it would be steady when the instant came if it came that was the risk bourne had to take without villiers there was nothing the old man had to understand jason suddenly shouted go on fire kill me take your orders from carlos youre a soldier youve got your orders carry them out the trembling in villiers hand increased the knuckles white as the gun rose higher its barrel now leveled at bournes head and then jason heard the whisper from an old mans throat vous êtes un soldat arrêtez arrêtez what i am a soldier someone said that to me recently someone very dear to you villiers spoke quietly she shamed an old warrior into remembering who he was who he had been on dit que vous êtes un géant je le croisshe had the grace the kindness to say that to me also she had been told i was a giant and she believed it she was wrongalmighty god she was wrongbut i shall try andré villiers lowered the gun there was dignity in the submission a soldiers dignity a giants what would you have me do jason breathed again force carlos into coming after me but not here not in paris not even in france where then jason held his place can you get me out of the country i should tell you im wanted my name and description by now are on every immigration desk and border check in europe for the wrong reasons for the wrong reasons i believe you there are ways the conseiller militaire has ways and will do as i ask with an identity thats false without telling them why my word is enough ive earned it another question that aide of yours you talked about do you trust himreally trust him with my life above all men with anothers life one you correctly said was very dear to me of course why youll travel alone i have to shed never let me go youll have to tell her something i will that im underground here in paris or brussels or amsterdam cities where carlos operates but she has to get away our car was found in montmartre carlos men are searching every street every fiat every hotel youre working with me now your aide will take her into the countryshell be safe there ill tell her that i must ask the question now what happens if you dont come back bourne tried to keep the plea out of his voice ill have time on the plane ill write out everything thats happened everything that i remember ill send it to you and you make the decisions with her she called you a giant make the right decisions protect her vous êtes un soldat arrêtez you have my word shell not be harmed thats all i can ask villiers threw the gun on the bed it landed between the twisted bare legs of the dead woman the old soldier coughed abruptly contemptuously his posture returning to practicalities my young wolfpack he said authority coming back to him awkwardly but with definition whats this strategy of yours to begin with youre in a state of collapse beyond shock youre an automaton walking around in the dark following instructions you cant understand but have to obey not very different from reality wouldnt you say interrupted villiers before a young man with truth in his eyes forced me to listen to him but how is this perceived state brought about and why all you knowall you rememberis that a man broke into your house during the fire and smashed his gun into your head you fell unconscious when you woke up you found your wife dead strangled a note by her body its whats in the note thats driven you out of your mind what would that be asked the old soldier cautiously the truth said jason the truth you cant ever permit anyone to know what she was to carlos what he was to her the killer who wrote the note left a telephone number telling you that you could confirm what hes written once you were satisfied you could destroy the note and report the murder any way you like but for telling you the truthfor killing the whore who was so much a part of your sons deathhe wants you to deliver a written message to carlos no hell send a relay thank god for that im not sure i could go through with it knowing it was him the message will reach him what is it ill write it out for you you can give it to the man he sends its got to be exact both in what it says and what it doesnt say bourne looked over at the dead woman at the swelling in her throat do you have any alcohol a drink no rubbing alcohol perfume will do im sure theres rubbing alcohol in the medicine cabinet would you mind getting it for me also a towel please what are you going to do put my hands where your hands were just in case although i dont think anyone will question you while im doing that call whomever you have to call to get me out the timings important i have to be on my way before you call carlos relay long before you call the police theyd have the airports watched i can delay until daybreak i imagine an old mans state of shock as you put it not much longer than that where will you go new york can you do it i have a passport identifying me as a man named george washburn its a good job making mine far easier youll have diplomatic status preclearance on both sides of the atlantic as an englishman the passports british as a nato accommodation conseiller channels you are part of an angloamerican team engaged in military negotiations we favor your swift return to the united states for further instructions its not unusual and sufficient to get you rapidly past both immigration points good ive checked the schedules theres a seven am flight air france to kennedy youll be on it the old man paused he had not finished he took a step toward jason why new york what makes you so certain carlos will follow you to new york two questions with different answers said bourne i have to deliver him where he marked me for killing four men and a woman i didnt know one of those men very close to me very much a part of me i think i dont understand you im not sure i do either theres no time itll all be in what i write down for you on the plane i have to prove carlos knew a building in new york where it all took place theyve got to understand he knew about it trust me i do the second question then why will he come after you jason looked again at the dead woman on the bed instinct maybe ive killed the one person on earth he cares about if she were someone else and carlos killed her id follow him across the world until i found him he may be more practical i think that was your point to me theres something else replied jason taking his eyes away from angélique villiers he has nothing to lose everything to gain no one knows what he looks like but he knows me by sight still he doesnt know my state of mind hes cut me off isolated me turned me into someone i was never meant to be maybe he was too successful maybe im mad insane god knows killing her was insane my threats are irrational how much more irrational am i an irrational man an insane man is a panicked man he can be taken out is your threat irrational can you be taken out im not sure i only know i dont have a choice he did not at the end it was as the beginning get carlos trap carlos cain is for charlie and delta is for cainthe man and the myth were finally one images and reality fused there was no other way ten minutes had passed since he had called marie lied to marie and heard the quiet acceptance in her voice knowing it meant she needed time to think she had not believed him but she believed in him she too had no choice and he could not ease her pain there had been no time there was no time everything was in motion now villiers was downstairs calling an emergency number at frances conseiller militaire arranging for a man with a false passport to fly out of paris with diplomatic status in less than three hours a man would be over the atlantic approaching the anniversary of his own execution it was the key it was the trap it was the last irrational act insanity the order of that date bourne stood by the desk he put down the pen and studied the words he had written on a dead womans stationery they were the words a broken bewildered old man was to repeat over the telephone to an unknown relay who would demand the paper and give it to ilich ramirez sanchez i killed your bitch whore and ill come back for you there are seventyone streets in the jungle a jungle as dense as tam quan but there was a path you missed a vault in the cellars you did not know aboutjust as you never knew about me on the day of my execution eleven years ago one other man knew and you killed him it doesnt matter in that vault are documents that will set me free did you think id become cain without that final protection washington wont dare touch me it seems right that on the date of bournes death cain picks up the papers that guarantee him a very long life you marked cain now i mark you ill come back and you can join the whore delta jason dropped the note on the desk and walked over to the dead woman the alcohol was dry the swollen throat prepared he bent down and spread his fingers placing his hands where anothers had been placed madness early light broke over the spires of the church in levallois perret in northwest paris the march morning cold the night rain replaced by mist a few old women returning to their flats from allnight cleaning shifts in the city proper trudged in and out of the bronze doors holding railings and prayer books devotions about to begin or finished with precious sleep to follow before the drudgery of surviving the daylight hours along with the old women were shabbily dressed men most also old others pathetically youngholding overcoats together seeking the warmth of the church these clutching bottles in their pockets precious oblivion extended another day to survive one old man however did not float in the trancelike movements of the others he was an old man in a hurry there was reluctanceeven fear perhapsin his lined sallow face but no hesitation in his progress up the steps and through the doors past the flickering candles and down the far left aisle of the church it was an odd hour for a worshiper to seek confession nevertheless this old beggar went directly to the first booth parted the curtain and slipped inside angelus domini did you bring it the whisper demanded the priestly silhouette behind the curtain trembling with rage yes he thrust it in my hand like a man in a stupor weeping telling me to get out hes burned cains note to him and says hell deny everything if a single word is ever mentioned the old man shoved the pages of writing paper under the curtain he used her stationery the assassins whisper broke a silhouetted hand brought to a silhouetted head a muted cry of anguish now heard behind the curtain i urge you to remember carlos pleaded the beggar the messenger is not responsible for the news he bears i could have refused to hear it refused to bring it to you how why lavier he followed her to parc monceau then both of them to the church i saw him in neuillysurseine when i was your point i told you that i know but why he could have used her in a hundred different ways against me why this its in his note hes gone mad he was pushed too far carlos it happens ive seen it happen a man on a doubleentry his sourcecontrols taken out he has no one to confirm his initial assignment both sides want his corpse hes stretched to the point where he may not even know who he is any longer he knows the whisper was drawn out in quiet fury by signing the name delta hes telling me he knows we both know where it comes from where he comes from the beggar paused if thats true then hes still dangerous to you hes right washington wont touch him it may not want to acknowledge him but it will call off its hangmen it may even be forced to grant him a privilege or two in return for his silence the papers he speaks of asked the assassin yes in the old daysin berlin prague viennathey were called final payments bourne uses final protection a minor variance they were papers drawn up between a primary sourcecontrol and the infiltrator to be used in the event the strategy collapsed the primary killed no other avenues open to the agent it was not something you would have studied in novgorod the soviets had no such accommodations soviet defectors however insisted upon them they were incriminating then they had to be to some degree generally in the area of who was manipulated embarrassment is always to be avoided careers are destroyed by embarrassment but then i dont have to tell you that youve used the technique brilliantly seventyone streets in the jungle said carlos reading from the paper in his hand an icelike calm imposed on his whisper a jungle as dense as tam quan this time the execution will take place as scheduled jason bourne will not leave this tam quan alive by any other name cain will be dead and delta will die for what hes done angéliqueyou have my word the incantation stopped the assassins mind racing to the practical did villiers have any idea when bourne left his house he didnt know i told you he was barely lucid in as much a state of shock as with his telephone call it doesnt matter the first flights to the united states began within the past hour hell be on one ill be in new york with him and i wont miss this time my knife will be waiting its blade a razor ill peel his face away the americans will have their cain without a face then they can give this bourne this delta whatever name they care to the bluestriped telephone rang on alexander conklins desk its bell was quiet the understated sound lending an eerie emphasis the bluestriped telephone was conklins direct line to the computer rooms and data banks there was no one in the office to take the call the central intelligence executive suddenly rushed limping through the door unused to the cane provided him by g shape brussels last night when he had commandeered a military transport to andrews field maryland he threw the cane angrily across the room as he lurched for the phone his eyes were bloodshot from lack of sleep his breath short the man responsible for the dissolution of treadstone was exhausted he had been in scramblercommunication with a dozen branches of clandestine operationsin washington and overseastrying to undo the insanity of the past twentyfour hours he had spread every scrap of information he could cull from the files to every post in europe placed agents in the parislondonamsterdam axis on alert bourne was alive and dangerous he had tried to kill his dc control he could be anywhere within ten hours of paris all airports and train stations were to be covered all underground networks activated find him kill him yes conklin braced himself against the desk and picked up the phone this is computer dock said the male voice efficiently we may have something at least state doesnt have any listing on it what for christs sake the name you gave us four hours ago washburn what about it a george p washburn was precleared out of paris and into new york on an air france flight this morning washburns a fairly common name he could be just a businessman with connections but it was flagged on the readout and since the status was natodiplomatic we checked with state they never heard of him theres no one named washburn involved with any ongoing nato negotiations with the french government from any member nation then how the hell was he precleared who gave him the diplomatic we checked back through paris it wasnt easy apparently it was an accommodation of the conseiller militaire theyre a quiet bunch the conseiller where do they get off clearing our people it doesnt have to be our people or their people it can be anybody just a courtesy from the host country and that was a french carrier its one way to get a decent seat on an overbooked plane incidentally washburns passport wasnt even us it was british theres a doctor an englishman named washburn it was him it was delta and frances conseiller had cooperated with him but why new york what was in new york for him and who placed so high in paris would accommodate delta what had he told them oh christ how much had he told them when did the flight get in asked conklin ten thirtyseven this morning a little over an hour ago all right said the man whose foot had been blown off in medusa as he slid painfully around the desk into his seat youve delivered and now i want this scratched from the reels delete it everything you gave me is that clear understood sir deleted sir conklin hung up new york new york not washington but new york there was nothing in new york any longer delta knew that if he was after someone in treadstoneif he was after himhe would have taken a flight directly to dulles what was in new york and why had delta deliberately used the name washburn it was the same as telegraphing a strategy he knew the name would be picked up sooner or later later after he was inside the gates delta was telling whatever was left of treadstone that he was dealing from strength he was in a position to expose not only the treadstone operation but he could go god knows how much further whole networks he had used as cain listening posts and ersatz consulates that were no more than electronic espionage stations even the bloody specter of medusa his connection inside the conseiller was his proof to treadstone how high up he had traveled his signal that if he could reach within so rarefied a group of strategists nothing could stop him goddamn it stop him from what what was the point he had the millions he could have faded conklin shook his head remembering there had been a time when he would have let delta fade he had told him so twelve hours ago in a cemetery outside of paris a man could take only so much and no one knew that better than alexander conklin once among the finest covert field officers in the intelligence community only so much the sanctimonious bromides about still being alive grew stale and bitter with time it depended on what you were before what you became with your deformity only so much but delta did not fade he came back with insane statements insane demands crazy tactics no experienced intelligence officer would even contemplate for no matter how much explosive information he possessed no matter how high he penetrated no sane man walked back into a minefield surrounded by his enemies and all the blackmail in the world could not bring you back no sane man no sane man conklin sat slowly forward in his chair im not cain he never was i never was i wasnt in new york it was carlos not me carlos if what youre saying took place on seventyfirst street it was him he knows but delta had been at the brownstone on seventyfirst street printsthird and index fingers right hand and the method of transport was now explained air france conseiller cover fact carlos could not have known things come to me faces streets buildings images i cant place i know a thousand facts about carlos but i dont know why conklin closed his eyes there was a phrase a simple code phrase that had been used at the beginning of treadstone what was it it came from medusa cain is for charlie and delta is for cain that was it cain for carlos deltabourne became the cain that was the decoy for carlos conklin opened his eyes jason bourne was to replace ilich ramirez sanchez that was the entire strategy of treadstone seventyone it was the keystone to the whole structure of deception the parallax that would draw carlos out of position into their sights bourne jason bourne the totally unknown man a name buried for over a decade a piece of human debris left in a jungle but he had existed that too was part of the strategy conklin separated the folders on his desk until he found the one he was looking for it had no title only an initial and two numbers followed by a black x signifying that it was the only folder containing the origins of treadstone t x the birth of treadstone seventyone he opened it almost afraid to see what he knew was there date of execution tam quan sector march conklins eyes moved to the calendar on his desk march oh my god he whispered reaching for the telephone dr morris panov walked through the double doors of the psychiatric ward on the third floor of bethesdas naval annex and approached the nurses counter he smiled at the uniformed aide shuffling index cards under the stem gaze of the head floor nurse standing beside her apparently the young trainee had misplaced a patients fileif not a patientand her superior was not about to let it happen again dont let annies whip fool you said panov to the flustered girl underneath those cold inhuman eyes is a heart of sheer granite actually she escaped from the fifth floor two weeks ago but were all afraid to tell anybody the aide giggled the nurse shook her head in exasperation the phone rang on the desk behind the counter will you get that please dear said annie to the young girl the aide nodded and retreated to the desk the nurse turned to panov doctor mo how am i ever going to get anything through their heads with you around with love dear annie with love but dont lose your bicycle chains youre incorrigible tell me hows your patient in fivea i know youre worried about him im still worried i hear you stayed up all night there was a three am movie on television i wanted to see dont do it mo said the matronly nurse youre too young to end up in there and maybe too old to avoid it annie but thanks suddenly panov and the nurse were aware that he was being paged the wideeyed trainee at the desk speaking into the microphone dr panov please telephone for im dr panov said the psychiatrist in a sotto voce whisper to the girl we dont want anyone to know annie donovan heres really my mother from poland who is it the trainee stared at panovs id card on his white coat she blinked and replied a mr alexander conklin sir oh panov was startled alex conklin had been a patient on and off for five years until they both had agreed hed adjusted as well as he was ever going to adjustwhich was not a hell of a lot there were so many and so little they can do for them whatever conklin wanted had to be relatively serious for him to call bethesda and not the office where can i take this annie room one said the nurse pointing across the hall its empty ill have the call transferred panov walked toward the door an uneasy feeling spreading through him i need some very fast answers mo said conklin his voice strained im not very good at fast answers alex why not come in and see me this afternoon its not me its someone else possibly no games please i thought wed gone beyond that no games this is a fourzero emergency and i need help fourzero call in one of your staff men ive never requested that kind of clearance i cant thats how tight it is then youd better whisper to god mo please i only have to confirm possibilities the rest i can put together myself and i dont have five seconds to waste a man may be running around ready to blow away ghosts anyone he thinks is a ghost hes already killed very real very important people and im not sure he knows it help me help him if i can go ahead a man is placed in a highly volatile maximum stress situation for a long period of time the entire period in deep cover the cover itself is a decoyvery visible very negative constant pressure applied to maintain that visibility the purpose is to draw out a target similar to the decoy by convincing the target that the decoys a threat forcing the target into the open are you with me so far so far said panov you say theres been constant pressure on the decoy to maintain a negative highly visible profile whats been his environment as brutal as you can imagine for how long a period of time three years good god said the psychiatrist no breaks none at all twentyfour hours a day three hundred and sixtyfive days a year three years someone not himself when will you damn fools learn even prisoners in the worst camps could be themselves talk to others who were themselves panov stopped catching his own words and conklins meaning thats your point isnt it im not sure answered the intelligence officer its hazy confusing even contradictory what i want to ask is this could such a man under these circumstances begin to believe hes the decoy assume the characteristics absorb the mocked dossier to the point where he believes its him the answer to thats so obvious im surprised you ask it of course he could probably would its an unendurably prolonged performance that cant be sustained unless the belief becomes a part of his everyday reality the actor never off the stage in a play that never ends day after day night after night the doctor stopped again then continued carefully but thats not really your question is it no replied conklin i go one step further beyond the decoy i have to its the only thing that makes sense wait a minute interrupted panov sharply youd better stop there because im not confirming any blind diagnosis not for what youre leading up to no way charlie thats giving you a license i wont be responsible forwith or without a consultation fee no way charlie why did you say that mo what do you mean why did i say it its a phrase i hear it all the time kids in dirty blue jeans on the corner hookers in my favorite saloons how do you know what im leading up to said the cia man because i had to read the books and youre not very subtle youre about to describe a classic case of paranoid schizophrenia with multiple personalities its not just your man assuming the role of the decoy but the decoy himself transferring his identity to the one hes after the target thats what youre driving at alex youre telling me your man is three people himself decoy and target and i repeat no way charlie im not confirming anything remotely like that without an extensive examination thats giving you rights you cant have three reasons for dispatch no way im not asking you to confirm anything i just want to know if its possible for christs sake mo theres a lethally experienced man running around with a gun killing people he claims he didnt know but whom he worked with for three years he denies being at a specific place at a specific time when his own fingerprints prove he was there he says images come to himfaces he cant place names hes heard but doesnt know from where he claims he was never the decoy it was never him but it was it is is it possible thats all i want to know could the stress and time and the everyday pressures break him like this into three panov held his breath for a moment its possible he said softly if your facts are accurate its possible thats all ill say because there are too many other possibilities thank you conklin paused a last question say there was a datea month and a daythat was significant to the mocked dossierthe decoys dossier youd have to be more specific i will it was the date when the man whose identity was taken for decoy was killed then obviously not part of the working dossier but known to your man am i following you yes he knew it lets say he was there would he remember it not as the decoy but as one of the other two assuming the target was also aware of it or that hed communicated it through his transference yes theres also a place where the strategy was conceived where the decoy was created if our man was in the vicinity of that place and the date of death was close at hand would he be drawn to it would it surface and become important to him it would if it was associated with the original place of death because the decoy was born there its possible it would depend on who he was at the moment suppose he was the target and knew the location yes because another part of him had to then hed be drawn to it it would be a subconscious compulsion why to kill the decoy hed kill everything in sight but the main objective would be the decoy himself alexander conklin replaced the phone his nonexistent foot throbbing his thoughts so convoluted he had to close his eyes again to find a consistent strain he had been wrong in paris in a cemetery outside of paris he had wanted to kill a man for the wrong reasons the right ones beyond his comprehensions he was dealing with a madman someone whose afflictions were not explained in twenty years of training but were understandable if one thought about the pains and the losses the unending waves of violence all ending in futility no one knew anything really nothing made sense a carlos was trapped killed today and another would take his place why did we do it david david i say your name finally we were friends once david delta i knew your wife and your children we drank together and had a few dinners together in faroff posts in asia you were the best foreign service officer in the orient and everyone knew it you were going to be the key to the new policy the one that was around the corner and then it happened death from the skies in the mekong you turned david we all lost but only one of us became delta in medusa i did not know you that welldrinks and a dinner or two do not a close companion makebut few of us become animals you did delta and now you must die nobody can afford you any longer none of us leave us please said general villiers to his aide as he sat down opposite marie st jacques in the montmartre café the aide nodded and walked to a table ten feet away from the booth he would leave but he was still on guard the exhausted old sober looked at marie why did you insist on my coming here he wanted you out of paris i gave him my word out of paris out of the race said marie touched by the sight of the old mans haggard face im sorry i dont want to be another burden for you i heard the reports on the radio insanity said villiers picking up the brandy his aide had ordered for him three hours with the police living a terrible lie condemning a man for a crime that was mine alone the description was accurate uncannily accurate no one could miss him he gave it to me himself he sat in front of my wifes mirror and told me what to say looking at his own face in the strangest manner he said it was the only way carlos could only be convinced by my going to the police creating a manhunt he was right of course he was right agreed marie but hes not in paris or brussels or amsterdam i beg your pardon i want you to tell me where hes gone he told you himself he lied to me how can you be certain because i know when he tells me the truth you see we both listen for it you both im afraid i dont understand i didnt think you would i was sure he hadnt told you when he lied to me on the phone saying the things he said so hesitantly knowing i knew they were lies i couldnt understand i didnt piece it together until i heard the radio reports yours and another that description so complete so total even to the scar on his left temple then i knew he wasnt going to stay in paris or within five hundred miles of paris he was going far awaywhere that description wouldnt mean very muchwhere carlos could be led delivered to the people jason had his agreement with am i right villiers put down the glass ive given my word youre to be taken to safety in the country i dont understand the things youre saying then ill try to be clearer said marie leaning forward there was another report on the radio one you obviously didnt hear because you were with the police or in seclusion two men were found shot to death in a cemetery near rambouillet this morning one was a known killer from saintgervais the other was identified as a former american intelligence officer living in paris a highly controversial man who killed a journalist in vietnam and was given the choice of retiring from the army or facing a courtmartial are you saying the incidents are related asked the old man jason was instructed by the american embassy to go to that cemetery last night to meet with a man flying over from washington washington yes his agreement was with a small group of men from american intelligence they tried to kill him last night they think they have to kill him good god why because they cant trust him they dont know what hes done or where hes been for a long period of time and he cant tell them marie paused closing her eyes briefly he doesnt know who he is he doesnt know who they are and the man from washington hired other men to kill him last night that man wouldnt listen they think hes betrayed them stolen millions from them killed men hes never heard of he hasnt but he doesnt have any clear answers either hes a man with only fragments of a memory each fragment condemning him hes a near total amnesiac villiers lined face was locked in astonishment his eyes pained in recollection for all the wrong reasons he said that to me they have men everywhere the orders are to execute me on sight im hunted by men i dont know and cant see for all the wrong reasons for all the wrong reasons emphasized marie reaching across the narrow table and touching the old mans arm and they do have men everywhere men ordered to kill him on sight wherever he goes theyll be waiting how will they know where hes gone hell tell them its part of his strategy and when he does theyll kill him hes walking into his own trap for several moments villiers was silent his guilt overwhelming finally he spoke in a whisper almighty god what have i done what you thought was right what he convinced you was right you cant blame yourself or him really he said he was going to write out everything that had happened to him everything that they remembered how painful that statement must have been for him i cant wait for that letter mademoiselle we cant wait i must know everything you can tell me now what can you do go to the american embassy to the ambassador now everything marie st jacques withdrew her hand slowly as she leaned back in the booth her dark red hair against the banquette her eyes were far away clouded with the mist of tears he told me his life began for him on a small island in the mediterranean called ile de port noir the secretary of state walked angrily into the office of the director of consular operations the departments section dealing with clandestine activities he strode across the room to the desk of the astonished director who rose at the sight of this powerful man his expression a mixture of shock and bewilderment mr secretary i didnt receive any message from your office sir i would have come upstairs right away the secretary of state slapped a yellow legal pad down on the directors desk on the top page was a column of six names written with the broad strokes of a felttipped pen bourne delta medusa cain carlos treadstone what is this asked the secretary what the hell is this the director of consop leaned over the desk i dont know sir theyre names of course a code for the alphabetthe letter dand a reference to medusa thats still classified but ive heard of it and i suppose the carlos refers to the assassin i wish we knew more about him but ive never heard of bourne or cain or treadstone then come up to my office and listen to a tape of a telephone conversation that ive just had with paris and youll learn all about them exploded the secretary of state there are extraordinary things on that tape including killings in ottawa and paris and some very strange dealings our first secretary in the montaigne had with a cia man theres also outright lying to the authorities of foreign governments to our own intelligence units and to the european newspaperswith neither the knowledge nor the consent of the department of state theres been a global deception thats spread misinformation throughout more countries than i want to think about were flying over under a deepdiplomatic a canadian womanan economist for the government in ottawa whos wanted for murder in zurich were being forced to grant asylum to a fugitive to subvert the laws because if that womans telling the truth weve got our ass in a sling i want to know whats been going on cancel everything on your calendarand i mean everything youre spending the rest of the day and all night if you have to digging this damn thing out of the ground theres a man walking around who doesnt know who he is but with more classified information in his head than ten intelligence computers it was past midnight when the exhausted director of consular operations made the connection he had nearly missed it the first secretary at the embassy in paris under threat of instant dismissal had given him alexander conklins name but conklin was nowhere to be found he had returned to washington on a military jet out of brussels in the morning but had signed out of langley at in the afternoon leaving no telephone numbernot even an emergency numberwhere he could be reached and from what the director had learned about conklin that omission was extraordinary the cia man was what was commonly referred to as a sharkkiller he directed individual strategies throughout the world where defection and treason were suspected there were too many men in too many stations who might need his approval or disapproval at any given moment it was not logical he would sever that cord for twelve hours what was also unusual was the fact that his telephone logs had been scratched there were none for the past two daysand the central intelligence agency had very specific regulations concerning those logs traceable accountability was the new order of the new regime however the director of consop had learned one fact conklin had been attached to medusa using the threat of state department retaliation the director had requested a closed circuit readout of conklins logs for the past five weeks reluctantly the agency beamed them over and the director had sat in front of a screen for two hours instructing the operators at langley to keep the tape repeating until he told them to stop eightysix logicals had been called the word treadstone mentioned none had responded then the director went back to the possibles there was an army man he had not considered because of his wellknown antipathy to the cia but conklin had telephoned him twice during the space of twelve minutes a week ago the director called his sources at the pentagon and found what he was looking for medusa brigadier general irwin arthur crawford current ranking officer in charge of army intelligence data banks former commander saigon attached to covert operationsstill classified medusa the director picked up the conference room phone it bypassed the switchboard he dialed the brigadiers home in fairfax and on the fourth ring crawford answered the state department man identified himself and asked if the general cared to return a call to state and be put through for verification why would i want to do that it concerns a matter that comes under the heading of treadstone ill call you back he did so in eighteen seconds and within the next two minutes the director had delivered the outlines of states information theres nothing there we dont know about said the brigadier theres been a control committee on this from the beginning the oval office given a preliminary summation within a week of the inauguration our objective warranted the procedures you may be assured of that im willing to be convinced replied the man from state is this related to that business in new york a week ago elliot stevensthat major webb and david abbott where the circumstances were shall we say considerably altered you were aware of the alterations im the head of consop general yes you would be stevens wasnt married the rest understood robbery and homicide were preferable the answer is affirmative i see your man bourne flew into new york yesterday morning i know we knowthat is conklin and myself were the inheritors youve been in touch with conklin i last spoke to him around one oclock in the afternoon unlogged he insisted on it frankly hes checked out of langley theres no number where he can be reached i know that too dont try with all due respect tell the secretary to back away you back away dont get involved we are involved general were flying over the canadian woman by diplomatic for gods sake why we were forced to she forced us to then keep her in isolation youve got to shes our resolve well be responsible i think youd better explain were dealing with an insane man a multiple schizophrenic hes a walking firing squad he could kill a dozen innocent people with one outburst one explosion in his own head and he wouldnt know why how do you know because hes already killed that massacre in new yorkit was him he killed stevens the monk webbabove all webband two others you never heard of we understand now he wasnt responsible but that cant change anything leave him to us to conklin bourne yes we have proof prints they were confirmed by the bureau it was him your man would leave prints he did he couldnt have said the man from state finally what tell me where did you come up with the conclusion of insanity this multiple schizophrenia or whatever the hell you call it conklin spoke to a psychiatristone of the bestan authority on stressbreakdowns alex described the historyand it was brutal the doctor confirmed our suspicions conklins suspicions he confirmed them asked the director stunned yes based on what conklin said on what he thought he knew theres no other explanation leave him to us hes our problem youre a damn fool general you should have stuck to your data banks or maybe more primitive artillery i resent that resent it all you like if youve done what i think youve done you may not have anything left but resentment explain that said crawford harshly youre not dealing with a madman or with insanity or with any goddamned multiple schizophreniawhich i doubt you know any more about than i do youre dealing with an amnesiac a man whos been trying for months to find out who he is and where he comes from and from a telephone tape weve got over here we gather he tried to tell youtried to tell conklin but conklin wouldnt listen none of you would listen you sent a man out in deep cover for three yearsthree yearsto pull in carlos and when the strategy broke you assumed the worst amnesia no youre wrong i spoke to conklin he did listen you dont understand we both knew i dont want to hear his name broke in the director of consular operations the general paused we both knew bourne years ago i think you know from where you read the name off to me he was the strangest man i ever met as close to being paranoid as anyone in that outfit he undertook missionsrisksno sane man would accept yet he never asked for anything he was filled with so much hate and that made him a candidate for a psychiatric ward ten years later seven years corrected crawford i tried to prevent his selection in treadstone but the monk said he was the best i couldnt argue with that not in terms of expertise but i made my objections known he was psychologically a borderline case we knew why i was proven right i stand on that youre not going to stand on anything general youre going to fall right on your iron ass because the monk was right your man is the best with or without a memory hes bringing in carlos delivering him right to your goddamn front door that is hes bringing him in unless you kill bourne first crawfords low sharp intake of breath was precisely what the director was afraid he might hear he continued you cant reach conklin can you he asked no hes gone under hasnt he made his own arrangements payments funneled through third and fourth parties unknown to each other the source untraceable all connections to the agency and treadstone obliterated and by now there are photographs in the hands of men conklin doesnt know wouldnt recognize if they held him up dont talk to me about firing squads yours is in place but you cant see ityou dont know where it is but its prepareda half a dozen rifles ready to fire when the condemned man comes into view am i reading the scenario you dont expect me to answer that said crawford you dont have to this is consular operations ive been there before but you were right about one thing this is your problem its right back in your court were not going to be touched by you thats my recommendation to the secretary the state department cant afford to know who you are consider this call unlogged understood im sorry said the director meaning it hearing the futility in the generals voice it all blows up sometimes yes we learned that in medusa what are you going to do with the girl we dont even know what were going to do with you yet thats easy eisenhower at the summit what utwos well go along no preliminary summation nothing we can get the girl off the zurich books well tell her it may help well be making apologies all over the place with her well try for a very substantial settlement are you sure interrupted crawford about the settlement no the amnesia are you positive ive listened to that tape at least twenty times heard her voice ive never been so sure of anything in my life incidentally she got in several hours ago shes at the pierre hotel under guard well bring her down to washington in the morning after we figure out what were going to do wait a minute the generals voice rose not tomorrow shes here can you get me clearance to see her dont dig that grave of yours any deeper general the fewer names she knows the better she was with bourne when he was calling the embassy shes aware of the first secretary probably conklin by now he may have to take the fall himself stay out of it you just told me to play it out not this way youre a decent man so am i were professionals you dont understand we have photographs yes but they may be useless theyre three years old and bournes changed changed drastically its why conklins on the scenewhere i dont knowbut hes there hes the only one whos seen him but it was night raining she may be our only chance shes been with himliving with him for weeks she knows him its possible that shed recognize him before anyone else i dont understand ill spell it out among bournes many many talents is the ability to change his appearance melt into a crowd or a field or a cluster of treesbe where you cant see him if what you say is so he wouldnt remember but we used to have a word for him in medusa his men used to call him a chameleon thats your cain general it was our delta there was no one like him and thats why the girl can help now clear me let me see her talk to her by clearing you we acknowledge you i dont think we can do that for gods sake you just said we were decent men are we we can save his life maybe if shes with me and we find him we can get him out of there there are you telling me you know exactly where hes going to be yes how because he wouldnt go anywhere else and the time span asked the incredulous director of consular operations you know when hes going to be there yes today its the date of his own execution rock music blared from the transistor radio with tinlike vibrations as the longhaired driver of the yellow cab slapped his hand against the rim of the steering wheel and jolted his jaw with the beat the taxi edged east on seventyfirst street locked into the line of cars that began at the exit on the east river drive tempers flared as engines roared in place and cars lurched forward only to slam to sudden stops inches away from bumpers in front it was in the morning new yorks rush hour traffic as usual a contradiction in terms bourne wedged himself into the corner of the back seat and stared at the treelined street beneath the rim of his hat and through the dark lenses of his sunglasses he had been there it was all indelible he had walked the pavements seen the doorways and the storefronts and the walls covered with ivyso out of place in the city yet so right for this street he had glanced up before and had noticed the roof gardens relating them to a gracious garden several blocks away toward the park beyond a pair of elegant french doors at the far end of a large complicated room that room was inside a tall narrow building of brown jagged stone with a column of wide leadpaned windows rising four stories above the pavement windows made of thick glass that refracted light both inside and out in subtle flashes of purple and blue antique glass perhaps ornamental glass bulletproof glass a brownstone residence with a set of thick outside steps they were odd steps unusual steps each level crisscrossed with black ridges that protruded above the surface protecting the descender from the elements shoes going down would not slip on ice or snow and the weight of anyone climbing up would trigger electronic devices inside jason knew that house knew they were coming closer to it the echo in his chest accelerated and became louder as they entered the block he would see it any moment and as he held his wrist he knew why parc monceau had struck such chords in his minds eye that small part of paris was so much like this short stretch of the upper east side except for an isolated intrusion of an unkempt stoop or an illconceived whitewashed façade they could be identical blocks he thought of andré villiers he had written down everything he could remember since a memory had been given him in the pages of a notebook hastily purchased at charles de gaulle airport from the fast moment when a living bulletridden man had opened his eyes in a humid dingy room on ile de port noir through the frightening revelations of marseilles zurich and parisespecially paris where the specter of an assassins mantle had fallen over his shoulders the expertise of a killer proven to be his by any standards it was a confession as damning in what it could not explain as in what it described but it was the truth as he knew the truth infinitely more exculpatory after his death than before it in the hands of andré villiers it would be used well the right decisions would be made for marie st jacques that knowledge gave him the freedom he needed now he had sealed the pages in an envelope and mailed it to parc monceau from kennedy airport by the time it reached paris he would be alive or he would be dead he would kill carlos or carlos would kill him somewhere on that streetso like a street thousands of miles awaya man whose shoulders floated rigidly above a tapered waist would come after him it was the only thing he was absolutely sure of he would do the same somewhere on that street there it was it was there the morning sun bouncing off the black enameled door and the shiny brass hardware penetrating the thick leadpaned windows that rose like a wide column of glistening purplish blue emphasizing the ornamental splendor of the glass but not its resistance to the impacts of highpowered rifles and heavycalibered automatic weapons he was here and for reasons emotionshe could not define his eyes began to tear and there was a swelling in his throat he had the incredible feeling that he had come hack to a place that was as much a part of him as his body or what was left of his mind not a home there was no comfort no serenity found in looking at that elegant east side residence but there was something elsean overpowering sensation ofreturn he was back at the beginning the beginning at both departure and creation black night and bursting dawn something was happening to him he gripped his wrist harder desperately trying to control the almost uncontrollable impulse to jump out of the taxi and race across the street to that monstrous silent structure of jagged stone and deep blue glass he wanted to leap up the steps and hammer his fist against the heavy black door let me in i am here you must let me in cant you understand i am inside images welled up in front of his eyes jarring sounds assaulted his ears a jolting throbbing pain kept exploding at his temples he was inside a dark roomthat roomstaring at a screen at other inner images that kept flashing on and off in rapid blinding succession who is he quickly youre too late youre a dead man where is this street what does it mean to you whom did you meet there what good keep it simple say as little as possible heres a list eight names which are contacts quickly heres another methods of matching kills which are yours no no no delta might do that not cain you are not delta you are not you you are cain you are a man named bourne jason bourne you slipped back try again concentrate obliterate everything else wipe away the past it does not exist for you you are only what you are here became here oh god marie had said it maybe you just know what youve been told over and over and over again until there was nothing else things youve been told but you cant relive because theyre not you the sweat rolled down his face stinging his eyes as he dug his fingers into his wrist trying to push the pain and the sounds and the flashes of light out of his mind he had written carlos that he was coming back for hidden documents that were his final protection at that time the phrase had struck him as weak he had nearly crossed it out wanting a stronger reason for flying to new york yet instinct had told him to let it stand it was a part of his past somehow now he understood his identity was inside that house his identity and whether carlos came after him or not he had to find it he had to it was suddenly insane he shook his head violently back and forth trying to suppress the compulsion to still the screams that were all around himscreams that were his screams his voice forget carlos forget the trap get inside that house it was there it was the beginning stop it the irony was macabre there was no final protection in that house only a final explanation for himself and it was meaningless without carlos those who hunted him knew it and disregarded it they wanted him dead because of it but he was so close he had to find it it was there bourne glanced up the longhaired driver was watching him in the rearview mirror migraine said jason curtly drive around the block to this block again im early for my appointment ill tell you where to let me off its your wallet mister the brownstone was behind them now passed quickly in a sudden brief break in the traffic bourne swung around in the seat and looked at it through the rear window the seizure was receding the sights and sound of personal panic fading only the pain remained but it too would diminish he knew that it had been an extraordinary few minutes priorities had become twisted compulsion had replaced reason the pull of the unknown had been so strong that for a moment or two he had nearly lost control he could not let it happen again the trap itself was everything he had to see that house again he had to study it again he had all day to work to refine his strategy his tactics for the night but a second calmer appraisal was in order now others would come during the day closer appraisals the chameleon in him would be put to work sixteen minutes later it was obvious that whatever he intended to study no longer mattered suddenly everything was different everything had changed the line of traffic in the block was slower another hazard added to the street a moving van had parked in front of the brownstone men in coveralls stood smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee putting off that moment when work was to commence the heavy black door was open and a man in a green jacket the moving companys emblem above the left pocket stood in the foyer a clipboard in his hand treadstone was being dismantled in a few hours it could be gutted a shell it couldnt be they had to stop jason leaned forward money in his hand the pain gone from his head all was movement now he had to reach conklin in washington not laternot when the chess pieces were in placebut right now conklin had to tell them to stop his entire strategy was based on darkness always darkness the beam of a flashlight shooting out of first one alleyway then another then against dark walls and up to darkened windows orchestrated properly swiftly darting from one position to another an assassin would be drawn to a stone building at night at night it would happen at night not now he got out hey mister yelled the driver through the open window jason bent down what is it i just wanted to say thanks this makes my a spit over his shoulder followed by a cough that was the start of a scream bourne stared at the driver at the stream of blood that had erupted over the mans left ear the man was dead killed by a bullet meant for his fare fired from a window somewhere in that street jason dropped to the ground then sprang to his left spinning toward the curb two more spits came in rapid succession the first imbedded in the side of the taxi the second exploding the asphalt it was unbelievable he was marked before the hunt had begun carlos was there in position he or one of his men had taken the high ground a window or a rooftop from which the entire street could be observed yet the possibility of indiscriminate death caused by a killer in a window or on a rooftop was crazy the police would come the street blocked off even a reverse trap aborted and carlos was not crazy it did not make sense nor did bourne have the time to speculate he had to get out of the trap the reverse trap he had to get to that phone carlos was here at the doors of treadstone he had brought him back he had actually brought him back it was his proof he got to his feet and began running weaving in and out of the groups of pedestrians he reached the corner and turned rightthe booth was twenty feet away but it was also a target he could not use it across the street was a delicatessen a small rectangular sign above the door telephone he stepped off the curb and started running again dodging the lurching automobiles one of them might do the job carlos had reserved for himself that irony too was macabre the central intelligence agency sir is fundamentally a factfinding organization said the man on the line condescendingly the sort of activities you describe are the rarest part of our work and frankly blown out of proportion by films and misinformed writers goddamn it listen to me said jason cupping the mouthpiece in the crowded delicatessen just tell me where conklin is its an emergency his office already told you sir mr conklin left yesterday afternoon and is expected back at the end of the week since you say you know mr conklin youre aware of his servicerelated injury he often goes for physical therapy will you stop it i saw him in parisoutside of paristwo nights ago he flew over from washington to meet me as to that interrupted the man in langley when you were transferred to this office wed already checked theres no record of mr conklin having left the country in over a year then its buried he was there youre looking for codes said bourne desperately i dont have them but someone working with conklin will recognize the words medusa delta cain treadstone someone has to no one does you were told that by someone who doesnt there are those who do believe me im sorry i really dont hang up there was another way one he did not care to use but there was nothing else five or six minutes ago i got out of a taxi on seventyfirst street i was spotted and someone tried to take me out take you out yes the driver spoke to me and i bent down to listen that movement saved my life but the drivers dead a bullet in his skull thats the truth and i know you have ways of checking there are probably half a dozen police cars on the scene by now check it out thats the strongest advice i can give you there was a brief silence from washington since you asked for mr conklinat least used his nameill follow this up where can i reach you ill stay on this calls on an international credit card french issue name of chamford chamford you said please ill be back the waiting was intolerable made worse by a stern hassid glaring at him fingering coins in one hand a roll in another and crumbs in his stringy unkempt beard a minute later the man in langley was on the line anger replacing compromise i think this conversation has come to an end mr bourne or chamford or whatever you call yourself the new york police were reached theres no such incident as you described on seventy first street and you were right we do have ways of checking i advise you that there are laws about such calls as this strict penalties involved good day sir there was a click the line went dead bourne stared at the dial in disbelief for months the men in washington had searched for him wanted to kill him for the silence they could not understand now when he presented himselfpresented them with the sole objective of his threeyear agreementhe was dismissed they still would not listen but that man had listened and he had come back on the line denying a death that had taken place only minutes ago it could not be it was insane it had happened jason put the phone back on the hook tempted to bolt from the crowded delicatessen instead he walked calmly toward the door excusing himself through the rows of people lined up at the counter his eyes on the glass front scanning the crowds on the sidewalk outside he removed his topcoat carrying it over his arm and replaced the sunglasses with his tortoiseshells minor alterations but he would not be where he was going long enough for them to be a major mistake he hurried across the intersection toward seventyfirst street at the far corner he fell in with a group of pedestrians waiting for the light he turned his head to the left his chin pressed down into his collarbone the traffic was moving but the taxi was gone it had been removed from the scene with surgical precision a diseased ugly organ cut from the body the vital functions in normal process it showed the precision of a master assassin who knew precisely when to go in swiftly with a knife bourne turned quickly reversing his direction and began walking south he had to find a store he had to change his outer skin the chameleon could not wait marie st jacques was angry as she held her place across the room from brigadier general irwin arthur crawford in the suite at the pierre hotel you wouldnt listen she accused none of you would listen have you any idea what youve done to him all too well replied the officer the apology in his acknowledgment not his voice i can only repeat what ive told you we didnt know what to listen for the differences between the appearance and the reality were beyond our understanding obviously beyond his own and if beyond his why not ours hes been trying to reconcile the appearance and reality as you call it for seven months and all you could do was send out men to kill him he tried to tell you what kind of people are you flawed miss st jacques flawed but decent i think its why im here the time spans begun and i want to save him if i can if we can god you make me sick marie stopped she shook her head and continued softly ill do whatever you ask you know that can you reach this conklin im sure i can ill stand on the steps of that house until he has no choice but to reach me he may not be our concern however carlos perhaps others what do you mean ill explain on the way our main concern nowour only concern nowis to reach delta jason yes the man you call jason bourne and hes been one of you from the beginning said marie there were no slates to clean no payments or pardons bargained for none youll be told everything in time but this is not the time ive made arrangements for you to be in an unmarked government car diagonally across from the house we have binoculars for you you know him better than anyone now perhaps youll spot him i pray to god you do marie went quickly to the closet and got her coat he said to me one night that he was a chameleon he remembered interrupted crawford remembered what nothing he had a talent for moving in and out of difficult situations without being seen thats all i meant wait a minute marie approached the army man her eyes suddenly riveted on his again you say we have to reach jason but theres a better way let him come to us to me put me on the steps of that house hell see me get word to me giving whoevers out there two targets you dont know your own man general i said get word to me hell send someone pay a man or a woman on the street to give me a message i know him hell do it its the surest way i cant permit it why not youve done everything else stupidly blindly do one thing intelligently i cant it might even solve problems youre not aware of but i cant do it give me a reason if deltas right if carlos has come after him and is in the street the risk is too great carlos knows you from photographs hell kill you im willing to take that risk im not id like to think im speaking for my government when i say that i dont think you are frankly leave it to others may we go please general service administration intoned a disinterested switchboard operator mr j petrocelli please said alexander conklin his voice tense his fingers wiping the sweat from his forehead as he stood by the window the telephone in his hand quickly please everybodys in a hurry the words were shorted out replaced by the hum of a ring petrocelli reclamation invoice division what are you people doing exploded the cia man the shock calculated a weapon the pause was brief right now listening to some nut ask a stupid question well listen further my names conklin central intelligence agency fourzero clearance you do know what that means i havent understood anything you peopleve said in the past ten years youd better understand this it took me damn near an hour but i just reached the dispatcher for a moving company up here in new york he said he had an invoice signed by you to remove all the furniture from a brownstone on seventyfirst street to be exact yeah i remember that one what about it who gave you the order thats our territory we removed our equipment last week but we did notrepeat did notrequest any further

can still blow smoke look conklin we both know you can get what you want if i get what i need do it right make it legitimate i cant involve the agency youre not going to involve me either those people have got to get out im telling you conklin stopped his eyes on the brownstone below and across the street his thoughts suddenly paralyzed a tall man in a black overcoat had walked up the concrete steps he turned and stood motionless in front of the open door it was crawford what was he doing what was he doing here he had lost his senses he was out of his mind he was a stationary target he could break the trap conklin conklin the voice floated up out of the phone as the cia man hung up conklin turned to a stocky man six feet away at an adjacent window in the mans large hand was a rifle a telescopic sight secured to the barrel alex did not know the mans name and he did not want to know it he had paid enough not to be burdened do you see that man down there in the black overcoat standing by the door he asked i see him hes not the one were looking for hes too old get over there and tell him theres a cripple across the street who wants to see him bourne walked out of the used clothing store on third avenue pausing in front of the filthy glass window to appraise what he saw it would do everything was coordinated the black wool knit hat covered his head to the middle of his forehead the wrinkled patched army field jacket was several sizes too large the redchecked flannel shirt the widebulging khaki trousers and the heavy work shoes with the thick rubber soles and huge rounded toes were all of a piece he only had to find a walk to match the clothing the walk of a strong slowwitted man whose body had begun to show the effects of a lifetime of physical strain whose mind accepted the daily inevitability of hard labor reward found with a sixpack at the end of the drudgery he would find that walk he had used it before somewhere but before he searched his imagination there was a phone call to make he saw a telephone booth up the block a mangled directory hanging from a chain beneath the metal shelf he started walking his legs automatically more rigid his feet pressing weight on the pavement his arms heavy in their sockets the fingers of his hands slightly spaced curved from years of abuse a set dull expression on his face would come later not now belkins moving and storage announced an operator somewhere in the bronx my name is johnson said jason impatiently but kindly im afraid i have a problem and i hope you might be able to help me ill try sir what is it i was on my way over to a friends house on seventyfirst streeta friend who died recently im sorry to sayto pick up something id lent him when i got there your van was in front of the house its most embarrassing but i think your men may remove my property is there someone i might speak to that would be a dispatcher sir might i have his name please what his name sure murray murray schumach ill connect you two clicks preceded a long hum over the line schumach mr schumach thats right bourne repeated his embarrassing tale of course i can easily obtain a letter from my attorney but the item in question has little or no value what is it a fishing rod not an expensive one but with an oldfashioned casting reel the kind that doesnt get tangled every five minutes yeah i know what you mean i fish out of sheepshead bay they dont make them reels like they used to i think its the alloys i think youre right mr schumach i know exactly in which closet he kept it oh what the hella fishing rod go up and see a guy named dugan hes the supervisor on the job tell him i said you could have it but youll have to sign for it if he gives you static tell him to go outside and call me the phones disconnected down there a mr dugan thank you very much mr schumach christ that place is a ballbreaker today i beg your pardon nothing some whacko called telling us to get out of there and the jobs firm cash guaranteed can you believe it carlos jason could believe it its difficult mr schumach good fishing said the belkins man bourne walked west on seventieth street to lexington avenue three blocks south he found what he was looking for an army navy surplus store he went inside eight minutes later he came out carrying four brown padded blankets and six wide canvas straps with metal buckles in the pockets of his field jacket were two ordinary road flares they had been there on the counter looking like something they were not triggering images beyond memory back to a moment of time when there had been meaning and purpose and anger he slung the equipment over his left shoulder and trudged up toward seventyfirst street the chameleon was heading into the jungle a jungle as dense as the unremembered tam quan it was when he reached the corner of the treelined block that held the secrets of treadstone seventyone he was going back to the beginninghis beginningand the fear that he felt was not the fear of physical harm he was prepared for that every sinew taut every muscle ready his knees and feet hands and elbows weapons his eyes tripwire alarms that would send signals to those weapons his fear was far more profound he was about to enter the place of his birth and he was terrified at what he might find thereremember there stop it the trap is everything cain is for charlie and delta is for cain the traffic had diminished considerably the rush hour over the street in the doldrums of midmorning quiescence pedestrians strolled now they did not hasten automobiles swung leisurely around the moving van angry horns replaced by brief grimaces of irritation jason crossed with the light to the treadstone side the tall narrow structure of brown jagged stone and thick blue glass was fifty yards down the block blankets and straps in place an already weary slowwitted laborer walked behind a welldressed couple toward it he reached the concrete steps as two muscular men one black one white were carrying a covered harp out the door bourne stopped and called out his words halting his dialect coarse hey wheres doogan where the hell dyou tink replied the white angling his head around sittin in a fuckin chair he aint gonna lift nothin heavier than that clipboard man added the black hes an executive aint that right joey hes a crumbball is what he is watcha got there schumach sent me said jason he wanted another man down here and figured you needed this stuff told me to bring it murray the menace laughed the black you new man i aint seen you before you come from shapeup yeah take that shit up to the executive grunted joey starting down the steps he can allocate it how about that pete allocateyou like it i love it joey you a regular dictionary bourne walked up the reddish brown steps past the descending movers to the door he stepped inside and saw the winding staircase on the right and the long narrow corridor in front of him that led to another door thirty feet away he had climbed those steps a thousand times walked up and down that corridor thousands more he had come back and an overpowering sense of dread swept through him he started down the dark narrow corridor he could see shafts of sunlight bursting through a pair of french doors in the distance he was approaching the room where cain was born that room he gripped the straps on his shoulder and tried to stop the trembling marie leaned forward in the back seat of the armorplated government sedan the binoculars in place something had happened she was not sure what it was but she could guess a short stocky man had passed by the steps of the brownstone a few minutes ago slowing his pace as he approached the general obviously saying something to him the man had then continued down the block and seconds later crawford had followed him conklin had been found it was a small step if what the general said was true hired gunmen unknown to their employer he unknown to them hired to kill a man for all the wrong reasons oh god she loathed them all mindless stupid men playing with the lives of other men knowing so little thinking they knew so much they had not listened they never listened until it was too late and then only with stern forbearance and strong reminders of what might have beenhad things been as they were perceived to be which they were not the corruption came from blindness the lies from obstinacy and embarrassment do not embarrass the powerful the napalm said it all marie focused the binoculars a belkins man was approaching the steps blankets and straps over his shoulder walking behind an elderly couple obviously residents of the block out for a stroll the man in the field jacket and the black knit hat stopped he began talking to two other movers carrying a triangularshaped object out the door what was it there was something something odd she could not see the mans face it was hidden from view but there was something about the neck the angle of the head what was it the man started up the steps a blunt man weary of his day before it had begun a slovenly man marie removed the binoculars she was too anxious too ready to see things that were not there oh god my love my jason where are you come to me let me find you do not leave me for these blind mindless men do not let them take you from me where was crawford he had promised to keep her informed of every move everything she had been blunt she did not trust him any of them she did not trust their intelligence that word spelled with a lowercase i he had promised where was he she spoke to the driver will you put down the window please its stifling in here sorry miss replied the civilianclothed army man ill turn on the air conditioning for you though the windows and doors were controlled by buttons only the driver could reach she was in a glass and metal tomb in a sundrenched treelined street i dont believe a word of it said conklin limping angrily across the room back to the window he leaned against the sill looking out his left hand pulled up to his face his teeth against the knuckle of his index finger not a goddamned word you dont want to believe it alex countered crawford the solution is so much easier its in place and so much simpler you didnt hear that tape you didnt hear villiers ive heard the woman shes all i have to hear she said we didnt listen you didnt listen then shes lying awkwardly conklin spun around christ of course shes lying why wouldnt she shes his woman shell do anything to get him off the meathook youre wrong and you know it the fact that hes here proves youre wrong proves i was wrong to accept what you said conklin was breathing heavily his right hand trembling as he gripped his cane maybe maybe we maybe he did not finish instead he looked at crawford helplessly we ought to let the solution stand asked the officer quietly youre tired alex you havent slept for several days youre exhausted i dont think i heard that no the cia man shook his head his eyes closed his face reflecting his disgust no you didnt hear it and i didnt say it i just wish i knew where the hell to begin i do said crawford going to the door and opening it come in please the stocky man walked in his eyes darting to the rifle leaning against the wall he looked at the two men appraisal in his expression what is it the exercise has been called off crawford said i think you must have gathered that what exercise i was hired to protect him the gunman looked at alex you mean you dont need protection anymore sir you know exactly what we mean broke in conklin all signals are off all stipulations what stipulations i dont know about any stipulations the terms of my employment are very clear im protecting you sir good fine said crawford now what we have to know is who else out there is protecting him who else where outside this room this apartment in other rooms on the street in cars perhaps we have to know the stocky man walked over to the rifle and picked it up im afraid you gentlemen have misunderstood i was hired on an individual basis if others were employed im not aware of them you do know them shouted conklin who are they where are they i havent any idea sir the courteous gunman held the rifle in his right arm the barrel angled down toward the floor he raised it perhaps two inches no more than that the movement barely perceptible if my services are no longer required ill be leaving can you reach them interrupted the brigadier well pay generously ive already been paid generously sir it would be wrong to accept money for a service i cant perform and pointless for this to continue a mans life is at stake out there shouted conklin sos mine said the gunman walking to the door the weapon raised higher goodbye gentlemen he let himself

its only a complication now i cant i tried i didnt have anything to do with it agency controls picked up our sheets when we had the equipment taken out they saw that a store was being closed up and told gsa to get us the hell out of there with all deliberate speed said crawford nodding the monk covered that equipment by signature his statement absolves the agency its in his files thatd be fine if we had twentyfour hours we dont even know if weve got twentyfour minutes well still need it therell be a senate inquiry closed i hope rope off the street what you heard merope off the street call

also aware that shell do it for us if this goes down she may do it anyway no matter what happens but id rather try to save a man i didnt like didnt approve of but i respected him once and i think i respect him more now what about another man if carlos is really out there youre opening the gates for him youre handing him his escape we didnt create carlos we created cain and we abused him we took his mind and his memory we owe him go down and get the woman ill use the phone bourne walked into the large library with the sunlight streaming through the wide elegant french doors at the far end of the room beyond the panes of glass were the high walls of the garden all around him objects too painful to look at he knew them and did not know them they were fragments of dreamsbut solid to be touched to be felt to be usednot ephemeral at all a long hatch table where whiskey was poured leather armchairs where men sat and talked bookshelves that housed books and other thingsconcealed thingsthat appeared with the touch of buttons it was a room where a myth was born a myth that had raced through southeast asia and exploded in europe he saw the long tubular bulge in the ceiling and the darkness came followed by flashes of light and images on a screen and voices shouting in his ears who is he quick youre too late youre a dead man where is this street what does it mean to you whom did you meet there methods of kills which are yours no you are not delta you are not you you are only what you are here became here hey who the hell are you the question was shouted by a large redfaced man seated in an armchair by the door a clipboard on his knees jason had walked right past him you doogan bourne asked yeah schumach sent me said you needed another man what for i got five

the straps leave that junk hereyou dont need it get upstairs top floor and start with the single wood units as heavy as you can carry and dont give me no union bullshit bourne circled the landing on the second floor and climbed the narrow staircase to the third as if drawn by a magnetic force beyond his understanding he was being pulled to another room high up in the brownstone a room that held both the comfort of solitude and the frustration of loneliness the landing above was dark no lights on no sunlight bursting through windows anywhere he reached the top and stood for a moment in silence which room was it there were three doors two on the left side of the hallway one on the right he started walking slowly toward the second door on the left barely seen in the shadows that was it it was where thoughts came in the darkness memories that haunted him pained him sunlight and the stench of the river and the jungle screaming machines in the sky screaming down from the sky oh god it hurt he put his hand on the knob twisted it and opened the door darkness but not complete there was a small window at the far end of the room a black shade pulled down covering it but not completely he could see a thin line of sunlight so narrow it barely broke through where the shade met the sill he walked toward it toward that thin tiny shaft of sunlight a scratch a scratch in the darkness he spun terrified at the tricks being played on his mind but it was not a trick there was a diamondlike flash in the air light bouncing off steel a knife was slashing up at his face i would willingly see you die for what youve done said marie staring at conklin and that realization revolts me then theres nothing i can say to you replied the cia man limping across the room toward the general other decisions could have been madeby him and by you could they where was he to start when that man tried to kill him in marseilles in the rue sarrasin when they hunted him in zurich when they shot at him in paris and all the while he didnt know why what was he to do come out goddamn it come out he did and when he did you tried to kill him you were there you were with him you had a memory assuming i knew whom to go to would you have listened to me conklin returned her gaze i dont know he answered breaking the contact between them and turning to crawford whats happening washingtons calling me back within ten minutes but whats happening im not sure you want to hear it federal encroachment on state and municipal lawenforcement statutes clearances have to be obtained jesus look the army man suddenly bent down to the window the trucks leaving someone got through said conklin who ill find out the cia man limped to the phone there were scraps of paper on the table telephone numbers written hastily he selected one and dialed give me schumach please schumach this is conklin central intelligence who gave you the word the dispatchers voice on the line could be heard halfway across the room what word get off my back were on that job and were going to finish it frankly i think youre a whacko conklin slammed down the phone christ oh christ his hand trembled as he gripped the instrument he picked it up and dialed again his eyes on another scrap of paper petrocelli reclamations he commanded petrocelli conklin again you faded out what happened no time level with me that priority invoice from agency controls who signed it what do you mean who signed it the top cat who always signs them mcgivern conklins face turned white thats what i was afraid of he whispered as he lowered the phone he turned to crawford his head quivering as he spoke the order to gsa was signed by a man who retired two weeks ago carlos oh god screamed marie the man carrying the blankets the straps the way he held his head his neck angled to the right it was him when his head hurts he favors the right it was jason he went inside alexander conklin turned back to the window his eyes focused on the black enameled door across the way it was closed the hand the skin the dark eyes in the thin shaft of light carlos bourne whipped his head back as the razorlike edge of the blade sliced the flesh under his chin the eruption of blood streaming across the hand that held the knife he lashed his right foot out catching his unseen attacker in the kneecap then pivoted and plunged his left heel into the mans groin carlos spun and again the blade came out of the darkness now surging toward him the line of assault directly at his stomach jason sprang back off the ground crossing his wrists slashing downward blocking the dark arm that was an extension of the handle he twisted his fingers inward yanking his hands together vicing the forearm beneath his bloodsoaked neck and wrenched the arm diagonally up the knife creased the cloth of his field jacket and once above his chest bourne spiraled the arm downward twisting the wrist now in his grip crashing his shoulder into the assassins body yanking again as carlos plunged sideways off balance his arm pulled half out of its socket jason heard the clatter of the knife on the floor he lurched toward the sound at the same time reaching into his belt for his gun it caught on the cloth he rolled on the floor but not quickly enough the steel toe of a shoe crashed into the side of his headhis templeand shock waves bolted through him he rolled again faster faster until he smashed into the wall coiling upward on his knee trying to focus through the weaving obscure shadows in the near total darkness the flesh of a hand was caught in the thin line of light from the window he lunged at it his own hands now claws his arms battering rams he gripped the hand snapping it back breaking the wrist a scream filled the room a scream and the hollow lethal cough of a gunshot an icelike incision had been made in bournes upper left chest the bullet lodged somewhere near his shoulder blade in agony he crouched and sprang again pummeling the killer with a gun into the wall above a sharpedged piece of furniture carlos lunged away as two more muted shots were fired wildly jason dove to his left freeing his gun leveling it at the sounds in the darkness he fired the explosion deafening useless he heard the door crash shut the killer had raced out into the hallway trying to fill his lungs with air bourne crawled toward the door as he reached it instinct commanded him to stay at the side and smash his fist into the wood at the bottom what followed was the core of a terrifying nightmare there was a short burst of automatic gunfire as the paneled wood splintered fragments flying across the room the instant it stopped jason raised his own weapon and fired diagonally through the door the burst was repeated bourne spun away pressing his back against the wall the eruption stopped and he fired again there were now two men inches from each other wanting above all to kill each other cain is for charlie and delta is for cain get carlos trap carlos kill carlos and then they were not inches from each other jason heard racing footsteps then the sounds of a railing being broken as a figure lurched down the staircase carlos was racing below the piganimal wanted support he was hurt bourne wiped the blood from his face from his throat and moved in front of what was left of the door he pulled it open and stepped out into the narrow corridor his gun leveled in front of him painfully he made his way toward the top of the dark staircase suddenly he heard shouts below what the hell you doin man pete pete two metallic coughs filled the air joey joey a single spit was heard bodies crashed to a floor somewhere below jesus jesus mother of two metallic coughs again followed by a guttural cry of death a third man was killed what had that third man said two wiseass stiffs and now four crumbballs the moving van was a carlos operation the assassin had brought two soldiers with himthe first three crumbballs from the shapeup three men with weapons and he was one with a single gun cornered on the top floor of the brownstone still carlos was inside inside if he could get out it would be carlos who was cornered if he could get out out there was a window at the front end of the hallway obscured by a black shade jason veered toward it stumbling holding his neck creasing his shoulder so to blunt the pain in his chest he ripped the shade from its spindle the window was small the glass here too thick prismatic blocks of purple and blue light shooting through it it was unbreakable the frame riveted in place there was no way he could smash a single pane and then his eyes were drawn below to seventyfirst street the moving van was gone someone had to have driven it away one of carlos soldiers that left two two men not three and he was on the high ground there were always advantages on the high ground grimacing bent partially over bourne made his way to the first door on the left it was parallel to the top of the staircase he opened it and stepped inside from what he could see it was an ordinary bedroom lamps heavy furniture pictures on the walls he grabbed the nearest lamp ripped the cord from the wall and carried it out to the railing he raised it above his head and hurled it down stepping back as metal and glass crashed below there was another burst of gunfire the bullets shredding the ceiling cutting a path in the plaster jason screamed letting the scream fade into a cry the cry into a prolonged desperate wail and then silence he edged his way to the rear of the railing he waited silence it happened he could hear the slow cautious footsteps the killer had been on the second floor landing the footsteps came closer became louder a faint shadow appeared on the dark wall now bourne sprang out of his recess and fired four shots in rapid succession at the figure on the staircase a line of bullet holes and eruptions of blood appeared diagonally across the mans collar the killer spun roaring in anger and pain as his neck arched back and his body plummeted down the steps until it was still sprawled faceup across the bottom three steps in his hands was a deadly automatic field machine gun with a rod and brace for a stock now jason ran over to the top of the staircase and raced down holding the railing trying to keep whatever was left of his balance he could not waste a moment he might not find another if he was going to reach the second floor it was now in the immediate aftermath of the soldiers death and as he leaped over the dead body bourne knew it was a soldier it was not carlos the man was tall and his skin was white very white his features nordic or northern european in no way latin jason ran into the hallway of the second floor seeking the shadows hugging the wall he stopped listening there was a sharp scrape in the distance brief scratch from below he knew what he had to do now the assassin was on the first floor and the sound had not been deliberate it had not been loud enough or prolonged enough to signify a trap carlos was injureda smashed kneecap or a broken wrist could disorient him to the point where he might collide with a piece of furniture or brush against a wall with a weapon in his hand briefly losing his balance as bourne was losing his it was what he needed to know jason dropped to a crouch and crept back to the staircase to the dead body sprawled across the steps he had to pause for a moment he was losing strength too much blood he tried to squeeze the flesh at the top of his throat and press the wound in his chestanything to stem the bleeding it was futile to stay alive he had to get out of the brownstone away from the place where cain was born jason bourne there was no humor in the word association he found his breath again reached out and pried the automatic weapon from the dead mans hands he was ready he was dying and he was ready get carlos trap carlos kill carlos he could not get out he knew that time was not on his side the blood would drain out of him before it happened the end was the beginning cain was for carlos and delta was for cain only one agonizing question remained who was delta it did not matter it was behind him now soon there would be darkness not violent but peaceful freedom from that question and with his death marie would be free his love would be free decent men would see to it led by a decent man in paris whose son had been killed on rue du bac whose life had been destroyed by an assassins whore within the next few minutes thought jason silently checking the clip in the automatic weapon he would fulfill his promise to that man carry out the agreement he had with men he did not know by doing both the proof was his jason bourne had died once on this day he would die again but would take carlos out with him he was ready he lowered himself to a prone position and crept hands over elbows toward the top of the staircase he could smell the blood beneath him the sweet bland odor penetrating his nostrils informing him of a practicality time was running out he reached the top step pulling his legs under him digging into his pocket for one of the road flares he had purchased at the armynavy store on lexington avenue he knew now why he had felt the compulsion to buy them he was back in the unremembered tam quan forgotten except for brilliant blinding flashes of light the flares had reminded him of that fragment of memory they would light up a jungle now he uncoiled the waxed fuse from the small round recess in the flare head brought it to his teeth and bit through the cord shortening the fuse to less than an inch he reached into his other pocket and took out a plastic lighter he pressed it against the flare gripping both in his left hand then he angled the rod and the brace of the weapon into his right shoulder shoving the curved strip of metal into the cloth of his bloodsoaked field jacket it was secure he stretched out his legs and snakelike started down the final flight of steps head below feet above his back scraping the wall he reached the midpoint of the staircase silence darkness all the lights had been extinguished lights light where were the rays of sunlight he had seen in that hallway only minutes ago they had streamed through a pair of french doors at the far end of the roomthat roombeyond the corridor but he could see only darkness now the door had been shut the door beneath him the only other door in that hallway was also closed marked by a thin shaft of light at the bottom carlos was making him choose behind which door or was the assassin using a better strategy was he in the darkness of the narrow hallway itself bourne felt a stabbing jolt of pain in his shoulder blade then an eruption of blood that drenched the flannel shirt beneath his field jacket another warning there was very little time he braced himself against the wall the weapon leveled at the thin posts of the railing aimed down into the darkness of the corridor now he pulled the trigger the staccato explosions tore the posts apart as the railing fell the bullets shattering the walls and the door beneath him he released the trigger slipping his hand under the scalding barrel grabbing the plastic lighter with his right hand the flare in his left he spun the flint the wick took fire and he put it to the short fuse he pulled his hand back to the weapon and squeezed the trigger again blowing away everything below a glass chandelier crashed to a floor somewhere singing whines of ricochets filled the darkness and thenlight blinding light as the flare ignited firing the jungle lighting up the trees and the walls the hidden paths and the mahogany corridors the stench of death and the jungle was everywhere and he was there almanac to delta almanac to delta abandon abandon never not now not at the end cain is for carlos and delta is for cain trap carlos kill carlos bourne rose to his feet his back pressed against the wall the flare in his left hand the exploding weapon in his right he plunged down into the carpeted underbrush kicking the door in front of him open shattering silver frames and trophies that flew off tables and shelves into the air into the trees he stopped there was no one in that quiet soundproof elegant room no one in the jungle path he spun around and lurched back into the hallway puncturing the walls with a prolonged burst of gunfire no one the door at the end of the narrow dark corridor beyond was the room where cain was born where cain would die but not alone he held his fire shifting the flare to his right hand beneath the weapon reaching into his pocket for the second flare he pulled it out and again uncoiled the fuse and brought it to his teeth severing the cord now millimeters from its point of contact with the gelatinous incendiary he shoved the first flare to it the explosion of light was so bright it pained his eyes awkwardly he held both flares in his left hand and squinting his legs and arms losing the battle for balance approached the door it was open the narrow crack extending from top to bottom on the lock side the assassin was accommodating but as he looked at that door jason instinctively knew one thing about it that carlos did not know it was a part of his past a part of the room where cain was born he reached down with his right hand bracing the weapon between his forearm and his hip and gripped the knob now he shoved the door open six inches and hurled the flares inside a long staccato burst from a sten gun echoed throughout the room throughout the entire house a thousand dead sounds forming a running chord beneath as sprays of bullets imbedded in a lead shield backed by a steel plate in the door the firing stopped a final clip expended now bourne whipped his hand back to the trigger crashed his shoulder into the door and lunged inside firing in circles as he rolled on the floor swinging his legs counterclockwise gunshots were returned wildly as jason honed his weapon toward the source a roar of fury burst from blindness across the room it accompanied bournes realization that the drapes had been drawn blocking out the sunlight from the french doors then why was there so much light magnified light beyond the sizzling blindness of the flares it was overpowering causing explosions in his head sharp bolts of agony at his temples the screen the huge screen was pulled down from its bulging recess in the ceiling drawn taut to the floor the wide expanse of glistening silver a whitehot shield of icecold fire he plunged behind the large hatch table to the protection of a copper dry bar he rose and jammed the trigger back in another bursta final burst the last clip had run out he hurled the weapon by its rodstock across the room at the figure in white overalls and a white silk scarf that had fallen below his face the face he knew it he had seen it before where where was it marseilles yes not zurich paris yes and no then it struck him at that instant in the blinding vibrating light that the face across the room was known to many not just him but from where where as so much else he knew it and did not know it but he did know it it was only the name he could not find he spiraled back off his feet behind the heavy copper dry bar gunshots came two three the second bullet tearing the flesh of his left forearm he pulled his automatic from his belt he had three shots left one of them had to find its markcarlos there was a debt to pay in pa ris and a contract to fulfill his love far safer with the assassins death he took the plastic lighter from his pocket ignited it and held it beneath a bar rag suspended from a hook the cloth caught fire he grabbed it and threw it to his right as he dove to his left carlos fined at the flaming rag as bourne spun to his knees leveling his gun pulling the trigger twice the figure buckled but did not fall instead he crouched then sprang like a white panther diagonally forward his hands outstretched what was he doing then jason knew the assassin gripped the edge of the huge silver screen ripping it from its metal bracket in the ceiling pulling it downward with all his weight and strength it floated down above bourne filling his vision blocking everything else from his mind he screamed as the shimmering silver descended over him suddenly more frightened of it than of carlos or of any other human being on the earth it terrified him infuriated him splitting his mind in fragments images flashed across his eyes and angry voices shouted in his ears he aimed his gun and fired at the terrible shroud as he slashed his hand against it wildly pushing the rough silver cloth away he understood he had fired his last shot his last as a legend named cain carlos knew by sight and by sound every weapon on earth he had counted the gunshots the assassin loomed above him the automatic in his hand aimed at jasons head your execution delta on the day scheduled for everything youve done bourne arched his back rolling furiously to his right at least he would die in motion gunshots filled the shimmering room hot needles slicing across his neck piercing his legs cutting up to his waist roll roll suddenly the gunshots stopped and in the distance he could hear repeated sounds of hammering the smashing of wood and steel growing louder more insistent there was a final deafening crash from the dark corridor outside the library followed by men shouting running and beyond them somewhere in the unseen outside world the insistent whine of sirens in here hes in here screamed carlos it was insane the assassin was directing the invaders directly toward him to him reason was madness nothing on earth made sense the door was crashed open by a tall man in a black overcoat someone was with him but jason could not see the mists were filling his eyes shapes and sounds becoming obscured blurred he was rolling in space away away but then he saw the one thing he did not want to see rigid shoulders that floated above a tapered waist raced out of the room and down the dimly lit corridor carlos his screams had sprung the trap open he had reversed it in the chaos he had trapped the stalkers he was escaping carlos bourne knew he could not be heard what emerged from his bleeding throat was a whisper he tried again forcing the sound from his stomach its him its carlos there was confusion commands shouted futilely orders swallowed in consternation and then a figure came into focus a man was limping toward him a cripple who had tried to kill him in a cemetery outside of paris there was nothing left jason lurched crawling toward the sizzling blinding flare he grabbed it and held it as though it were a weapon aiming it at the killer with a cane come on come on closer you bastard ill burn your eyes out you think youll kill me you wont ill kill you ill burn your eyes you dont understand said the trembling voice of the limping killer its me delta its conklin i was wrong the flare singed his hands his eyes madness the explosions were all around him now blinding deafening punctuated by earsplitting screeches from the jungle that erupted with each detonation the jungle tam quan the wet hot stench was everywhere but they had reached it the base camp was theirs an explosion to his left he could see it high above the ground suspended between two trees the spikes of a bamboo cage the figure inside was moving he was alive get to him reach him a cry came from his right breathing coughing in the smoke a man was limping toward the dense underbrush a rifle in his hand it was him the blond hair caught in the light a foot broken from a parachute jump the bastard a piece of filth who had trained with them studied the maps with them flown north with them all the time springing a trap on them a traitor with a radio who told the enemy exactly where to look in that impenetrable jungle that was tam quan it was bourne jason bourne traitor garbage get him dont let him reach others kill him kill jason bourne he is your enemy fire he did not fall the head that had been blown apart was still there coming toward him what was happening madness tam quan come with us said the limping figure walking out of the jungle into what remained of an elegant room that room were not your enemies come with us get away from me bourne lunged again now back to the fallen screen it was his sanctuary his shroud of death the blanket thrown over a man at birth a lining for his coffin you are my enemy ill take you all i dont care it doesnt matter cant you understand im delta cain is for charlie and delta is for cain what more do you want from me i was and i was not i am and i am not bastards bastards come on closer another voice was heard a deeper voice calmer less insistent get her bring her in somewhere in the distance the sirens reached a crescendo and then they stopped darkness came and the waves carried jason up to the night sky only to hurl him down again crashing him into an abyss of watery violence he was entering an eternity of weightless memory an explosion filled the night sky now a fiery diadem rose above black waters and then he heard the words spoken from the clouds filling the earth jason my love my only love take my hand hold it tightly jason tightly my darling peace came with the darkness epilogue brigadier general crawford put the file folder down on the couch beside him i dont need this he said to marie st jacques who sat across from him in a straightback chair ive gone over it and over it trying to find out where we missed you presumed where no one should said the only other person in the hotel suite he was dr morris panov psychiatrist he stood by the window the morning sun streaming in putting his expressionless face in shadow i allowed you to presume and ill live with it for the rest of my life its nearly two weeks now said marie impatiently id like specifics i think im entitled to them you are it was an insanity called clearance insanity agreed panov protection also added crawford i subscribe to that part it has to continue for a very long time protection marie frowned well get to it said the general glancing at panov from everyones point of view its vital i trust we all accept that please jasonwho is he his name is david webb he was a career foreign service officer a specialist in far eastern affairs until his separation from the government five years ago separation resignation by mutual agreement his work in medusa precluded any sustained career in the state department delta was infamous and too many knew he was webb such men are rarely welcome at the diplomatic conference tables im not sure they should be visceral wounds are reopened too easily with their presence he was everything they say in medusa yes i was there he was everything they say its hard to believe said marie hed lost something very special to him and couldnt come to grips with it he could only strike out what was that his family his wife was a thai they had two children a boy and a girl he was stationed in phnom penh his house on the outskirts near the mekong river one sunday afternoon while his wife and children were down at their dock a stray aircraft circled and dove dropping two bombs and strafing the area by the time he reached the river the dock was blown away his wife and children floating in the water their bodies riddled oh god whispered marie whom did the plane belong to it was never identified hanoi disclaimed it saigon said it wasnt ours remember cambodia was neutral no one wanted to be responsible webb had to strike out he headed for saigon and trained for medusa he brought a specialists intellect to a very brutal operation he became delta was that when he met danjou later on yes delta was notorious by then north vietnamese intelligence had put an extraordinary price on his head and its no secret that among our own people a number hoped theyd succeed then hanoi found out that webbs younger brother was an army officer in saigon and having studied deltaknowing the brothers were closedecided to mount a trap they had nothing to lose they kidnapped lieutenant gordon webb and took him north sending back a cong informant with word that he was being held in the tam quan sector delta bit along with the informera double agenthe formed a team of medusans who knew the area and picked a night when no aircraft should have left the ground to fly north danjou was in the unit so was another man webb didnt know about a white man whod been bought by hanoi an expert in communications who could assemble the electronic components of a highfrequency radio in the dark which is exactly what he did betraying the units position webb broke through the trap and found his brother he also found the double agent and the white man the vietnamese escaped in the jungle the white man didnt delta executed him on the spot and that man maries eyes were riveted on crawford jason bourne a medusan from sydney australia a runner of guns narcotics and slaves throughout all southeast asia a violent man with a criminal record who was nevertheless highly effectiveif the price were high enough it was in medusas interests to bury the circumstances of his death he became an mia from a specialized unit years later when treadstone was being formed and webb called back it was webb himself who took the name of bourne it fit the requirements of authenticity traceability he took the name of the man whod betrayed him the man he had killed in tam quan where was he when he was called back for treadstone asked marie what was he doing teaching in a small college in new hampshire living an isolated life some said destructive for him crawford picked up the file folder those are the essential facts miss st jacques other areas will be covered by dr panov whos made it clear that my presence is not required there is however one remaining detail which must be thoroughly understood its a direct order from the white house the protection said marie her words a statement yes wherever he goes regardless of the identity he assumes or the success of his cover hell be guarded around the clock for as long as it takeseven if it never happens please explain that hes the only man alive whos ever seen carlos as carlos he knows his identity but its locked away in his mind part of an unremembered past we understand from what he says that carlos is someone known to many peoplea visible figure in a government somewhere or in the media or international banking or society it fits with a prevalent theory the point is one day that identity may come into focus for webb we realize youve had several discussions with dr panov i believe hell confirm what ive said marie turned to the psychiatrist is it true mo its possible said panov crawford left and marie poured coffee for the two of them panov went to the couch where the brigadier had been sitting its still warm he said smiling crawford was sweating right down to his famous backsides he has every right to they all do whats going to happen nothing absolutely nothing until i tell them they can go ahead and that may not be for months a couple of years for all i know not until hes ready for what the questions and photographsvolumes of them theyre compiling a photographic encyclopedia based on the loose description he gave them dont get me wrong one day hell have to begin hell want to well all want him to carlos has to be caught and its not my intention to blackmail them into doing nothing too many people have given too much hes given too much but right now he comes first his head comes first thats what i mean whats going to happen to him panov put down his coffee im not sure yet ive too much respect for the human mind to deal you chicken soup psychology theres too damn much of it floating around in the wrong hands ive been in on all the conferencesi insisted upon thatand ive talked to the other shrinks and the neurosurgeons its true we can go in with a knife and reach the storm centers reduce the anxieties bring a kind of peace to him even bring him back to what he was perhaps but its not the kind of peace he wants and theres a far more dangerous risk we might wipe away too much take away the things he has foundwill continue to find with care with time time i believe it yes because the patterns been established theres growth the pain of recognition and the excitement of discovery does that tell you something marie looked into panovs dark weary eyes there was a light in them all of us she said thats right in a way hes a functioning microcosm of us all i mean were all trying to find out who the hell we are arent we marie went to the front window in the cottage on the waterfront with the rising dunes behind it the fencedoff grounds surrounding it and guards every fifty feet a man with a gun she could see him several hundred yards down the beach he was scaling shells over the water watching them bounce across the waves that gently lapped into the shore the weeks had been good to him for him his body
